"" the words ""and on and after 23rd January, 1902, free,"" be added. we are now being called upon to discuss affords a glaring instance of the fact that the Ministry, in framing the Tariff, were concerned more with the Victorian industries than with other Commonwealth industries. In the division of the spoils, the interests of New South Wales have been altogether neglected, but wherever there has been a Victorian industry to consider, or a Victorian interest to protect, the Minister for Trade and Customs has always been ready to lend himself to the work. To such an extent has this studious regard for Victorian industries, and disregard of New South Wales industries been carried, that we are forced to believe that the Tariff has been framed under the guidance of the Treasurer and the Attorney-General. The honourable member for Bourke told us last night that in the making of barbed wire in The answers Victoria something like 38 men are empleyed in five factories. The plant used in the industry is composed of imported machinery, imported wire being fed into one machine and traversed by wire of another gauge from another machine. That is the important industry which the consumers of Australia are to be taxed to support. But no regard is paid to a kindred industry in New South Wales for the manufacture of wire netting. As a free trader I cannot advocate that the public of Australia should be penalized to benefit that industry, but it is only right that the committee should know that Messrs Lysaght Bros., Limited, at their works at Chiswick, on the Parramatta River, pay over Â£20,000 per annum in wages, and employ upwards of 300 men. ber support a duty upon wire netting 1 represent are produced nearly all the Committee of Ways and Means : articles which are dealt with in the division which we are now considering and in division VI . A ; but I have not done what some free-traders have done-vote d for protection where industries in my own electorate wore done-vote d for free-trade where an article was largely consumed by my constituents. I have remained true to my principles, and have voted consistently for free-trade throughout. AlthoughI knew that the duties even as reduced would give a' fortune to some of the manufacturers in my district, and be a distinct gain to thousands of employees there, no appeal has been made to the Chamber by me for the taxation of the consumers of the Commonwealth on their account. Surely the New South Wales wire-netting industry, which employs more than 300 men, is at least as important as the Victorian barbed wire industry, which employs only 38 men, and deserves as much consideration. tory is in New South Wales. point I wish to emphasize. Every consideration is paid to Victorian industries, but when New South Wales industries are mentioned, a lamentable ignorance in regard to them is displayed by Ministers, who tell us that the)' were not aware of their existence.

19,Mr Wilks,"Exactly. That is theto meet the expenditure of the Commonwealth, New South Wales occupies a place in the front rank; but it is a remarkable thing that although there are three representativesfrom New South Wales in the Ministry, and all are avowed protectionists, no provision has been made in the Tariff for New South Wales industries. The protectionists express a great dislike for German importations, and the greatest competitor of Messrs. Lysaght Brothers in the wire-netting industry is the bounty-fed wire which is imported from Germany. I am prepared to see wire netting placed upon the free list in the general interests of the consumers and of the Commonwealth generally, and the manufacturers of barbed wire, who use imported machinery and wire, should not be selected for special encouragement. of barbed wire is a good log-roller. minds me of the remark of the Prime Minister, at Maitland, that whilst the Federal Parliament was sitting in Melbourne, honourable members were surrounded by a provincial atmosphere. The right honourable gentleman was probably referring to the facilities which were afforded to Victorian manufacturers for approaching Members of Parliament, and it certainly appears that whilst the Federal Parliament is sitting here the industries which receive the first consideration, as well 'as the second and the last, are those carried on in Victoria, whilst industries in the other States are neglected. Messrs. LysaghtBrothers have established their industry on a solid basis, and have carried it on successfully for about sixteen years without any assistance whatever, and their experience affords the best proof that there is no necessity for protection to enable an .industry to be built up. The honourable member for Bourke stated last evening that if a ton of colonial barbed wire would not go further than a ton of imported wire, he had been authorized to vote against the imposition of a duty. I should like to know who authorized the honourable member, and whom he regarded himself as representing. It seems to me that a very undesirable element is being introduced into federal politics when honourable members think fit to speak in that way, and state that they are authorized to vote in one way or another if certain conditions are not carried out. It might be perfectly right for the State Government of Victoria to do anything it thought desirable to coddle up an industry within its own borders ; but a different complexion is placed upon the matter when the rest of Australia is asked to continue the coddling process at the expense of the Commonwealth. If the barbed wire industry is to be protected, the wire-netting industry of New South Wales should also receive assistance; in fact, the wire-netting industry has far greater claims than the other, because of its extent and its value to the community as a whole. I do not hold a brief for Messrs. Lysaght Brothers, but I think it is reasonable to ask that they should receive the same liberal treatment as has been meted out to those engaged in other industries, especially when it is considered that their operations are of such a character that they cannot be very great gainers from the imposition ""of the duty. I see no reason why barbed wire should be placed in any position of advantage over wire netting. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) -It is unfortunate that we should accuse each other of showing undue preference for industries in our respective States. point. MrA . M c LEAN I do not think that any such imputation should be made against the Government or any section of the committee. I am perfectly sure no honourable members here would do anything of the kind. Last night a number of country members, including myself, were prepared to place iron rails on the free list, until a representative of New South Wales showed that the article was being manufactured in New South Wales. AVe then voted for a 15 per cent, duty, whilst the honourable member from New South Wales, to whom I have referred, voted for only 10 per cent. I am perfectly sure that the claims of any other industry in New South Wales, or any other State would receive the same consideration from the protectionists in the Chamber-a t any rate from the Victorian protectionists. it was left to a member of the House to unearth the matter?

The imposition of a duty cheapens the article when there is healthy competition between the importer and the manufacturer. I am prepared on every occasion to give protection to any industry that can be successfully established within the Commonwealth, but not to grant a monopoly.

A certain amount of latitudeI am afraid rather undue latitude-ba s been given to honourable members, whom I now ask to confine themselves to the item.. ing in a general discussion, but dealing with the subject of barbed wire. I am merely replying to what seemed to me a proper statement by the honourable member for Gippsland, but a statement which in my opinion is in direct conflict with others made from time to time as to the bearing of duties on local manufactures. These contradictory doctrines lead to endless trouble and debate, because the conflict between the statements must be pointed out. It is said that the Ministers have not had time to get information regarding the industries within the Commonwealth.. But what strikes members of the Opposition is the completeness of the Ministerial. information regarding all, industries that.are Victorian, and the absolute dearth of information respecting the industries of, say, New South Wales. mation given regarding the Lithgow industries. do what the honourable member never does -stan d up for his own State. If the honourable member would tell the committee what industries are carried on in New South Wales, he would do better service to his constituents than by interfering with members who are performing that duty. Last night I tried to furnish the Ministers with some information regarding tlie manufacture of steel rails, and I am now urging that there are other industries in New South Wales. There are three Ministers from New South Wales in the Cabinet, and the Prime Minister at Maitland the other night said that all the members of the Government were ill from overwork. with barbed wire-? that the anomalies in the Tariff, such as the one under discussion, are the result of the ignorance of Ministers regarding industries. Last night the Minister for Trade and Customs proposed to put steel rails on the free list, in sheer ignorance that the manufacture of these rails is carried on in the Commonwealth ; and it is A general discusstartling to find his colleagues expressing the same ignorance: What were the New South Wales representatives doing when the Tariff was being considered in Cabinet, particularly those whose life-long boast has been that they want to help the industries of the State, and who at the last election told the people how urgent it was to return Ministers who would look after their interests ? member is certainly not now discussing the item, before the committee. t be in order if I were allcwed to finish my j sentence.

It is a pity the Ministers from New South Wales did not display a little more sympathy with and knowledge of the industries of that State. Barbed wire is on the same footing, I take it , as wire netting: if one is entitled to a duty so is the other. In Victoria, 40 men are empioj'ed in five factories in making barbed careful and earnest student-h e will rewire; and if a duty of 20 per cent, is required in that case, and the people of the whole Commonwealth are to be compelled to put their hands into their pockets and subscribe specially to keep those .men going, surely, by a parity of reasoning, a similar contribution, at least, ought to be made to keep going the 300 men engaged in a similar occupation in New South Wales. Yet, strange to say, Federal Ministers, who are not supposed to have regard to particular States, but to sit on a coign of vantage, and look over the whole of the industrial activities of the Commonwealth, have only seen the State of Victoria, and, in connection with this item, are only aware of the little factories in which 40 men are emtrader in it , so at the present time. I do not ployed. It is our duty to point out these anomalies; and it ill becomes honourable members from New South Wales to gird at their co-delegates when the latter are engaged in supplying information which ought to have been abundantly at our disposal through the channel of the responsible Minister specially charged with the framing of the Tariff. orable member for Parramatta has referred mercy of the manufacturer. There is no to an interjection which I made last night. The honourable member attributed to me a statement which I have never madea statement which, although it may be true, was not made by me, either in this House or outside of it-and ( I trust that when I have concluded my remarks, he will see f it to withdraw such an unwarrantable accusatio . member can show me where I have misrepresented him I shall be glad to do so. put it that I stated last night that the higher the duty upon an article until absolute prohibition is reached, the greater is the competition which results. I said nothing of the sort. The position was that a New South Wales manufacturer had declared that he would be satisfied with a maximum of 10 per cent, from which statement honourable members upon the other side of the chamber proceeded to argue that no need existed for the imposition of a higher duty. Thereupon I pointed out that the manufacturer in question might desire to stifle competition, and if the honourable member for Parramatta is a student of economics-and I believe he is a very cognise that a duty which is low enough to limi t importation may not be sufficient to encourage manufacturers to embark in any particular industry. Thus, it sometimes happens that au advantage is given to those who are already engaged in that industry. That is all I said, and I am prepared to stand by it . The attitude adopted by the honourable member for Gippsland is, to my mind, in perfect accord with that adopted by a very large number of honourable members professing protectionist principles. Just as a low duty may stifle local competition, so a high duty may prevent outside competition. Just as when this House met there was not a single freethink it contains one prohibitionist. There is not one honourable member who wishes to see such a high duty imposed as will absolutely stifle outside competition. The honourable member for Gippsland is perfectly consistent in desiring that the consumer in the Commonwealth shall not be placed at a disadvantage by the imposition of such a tax as will altogether prevent im-",19,Tariff

It is. certainly not my own desire that we should have a complete cessation of importations. The Ministry propose that Â£8,500,000 shall be collected by means of customs and excise duties, and surely this fact evidences their belief that the duties which they pVopose will not be prohibitive in their incidence. Under these circumstances thejibes which have from time to time been hurled against honourable members professing moderate views upon this question are utterly undeserved. I very much regret-and I trust that the honourable member for Parramatta will not think that I am lecturing him-to see imported into this Chamber any individual State feeling. I believe that every honourable member represents not merely his own particular State, but the whole of the Commonwealth. I am not going to ascribe, even to the honourable member who calls himself a delegate from New South ""Wales-and I was sorry to hear him use that worda State feeling, which it would be discreditable' for any honourable member of a great national Parliament such as this to entertain. I . trust that when we are discussing questions which have a national bearing, we shall lose sight altogether of any State differences that may exist. AlthoughI admit that the position of 'Victoria as a great manufacturing State may excite more envy than admiration in tlie other States, it is not a fair thing that its manufacturers should be penalized on that account by the action of honourable members from other States. I ask the honourable member for Parramatta to note the different attitude evinced in this Parliament by the representatives of Victoria. There are representatives of this State upon both sides of the House, and I challenge him to give an instance in which a A ictorian supporter T of the Government has attempted to belittle the efforts of his fellow representatives who happen to differ from him upon this particular question. I sincerely hope that honourable members will not consider that I am endeavouring to adopt a superior attitude. I speak from a deep conviction that the well-being of the Commonwealth depends very materially upon the attitude adopted by this Parliament, and my only desire is to see all State differences which may exist swept away and utterly obliterated. 26 D ; Tariff. 9061 marks of the honourable member for Gippsland with a considerable amount of interest. There is no doubt that there is a very great deal of truth in the statement that"" we have not been able to give to the committee all the information we should like to give upon a variety of subjects. We had not the time at our disposal, and I am sure that honourable members will entirely sympathize with ^us in the difficult position in which we found ourselves. We had either to postpone the introduction of the Tariff and the establishment of Inter-State free-trade or bike upon ourselves the Herculean task of framing the Tariff as best we could in time for the first session of Parliament in order that InterState free-trade should be brought into operation at the earliest possible moment. We were faced with the difficulty that we could not do all that we should have liked in the way of obtaining information..

77,Mr Kingston,"I cannot tell thein New South Wales and not in Victoria, the facts show that there is not a tittle of evidence in support of the suggestion. In reply to the assertion that in framing the Tariff we have forgotten the New South Wales industries, I would call attention to the fact that the provisions of Division VIA are devoted to giving the most liberal treatment aud encouragement to the greatest of all manufacturing industries-the iron industry-whic h must be essentially a New South Wales industry, because of the iron and coal supplies there. ber can read the conditions for himself. Special encouragement is there given for the establishment of an industry in New South Wales which is worthy of all encouragement, and which, when established, will be of the greatest advantage to the whole Commonwealth. Before the introduction of the Federal Tariff, Victoria charged a duty of Â£ 3 a ton upon imported barbed wire, while New South AAales admitted barbed r wirefree, but the price of No. 12 gauge barbed wire was then Â£ 1 5 10s. per ton in Sydney, and only Â£ 1 5 13s. 6d. a ton in Melbourne. 10s. a ton in Melbourne at-that time. the price of imported wire was in Melbourne then, but the price quoted by the honourable member shows a difference of only Â£ 2 a ton between the locally-made Victorian barbed wire and the barbed wire imported into Victoria, which proves that the local manufacturers did not increase their prices by the amount of the duty. barbed wire does not go so far as the imported article. No. 12 gauge barbed wire costs Â£ 1 6 10s. in New South Wales, while the locally manufactured barbed wire costs only Â£ 1 5 13s. 6d. in Melbourne. I venture to think that the barbed wire industry has 'been fairly and properly stimulated in A ictoria, with good results to those engaged in its manufacture, and without disadvantage to the consumers, and that that fact affords a justification for the course which we now propose. There is no doubt a difficulty in making a distinction between wire netting and barbed wire, but the Government thought that wire netting was in 2G D 2 the nature of a necessary in the poverty stricken districts of the interior. be considered more than any others 1 that people who are poor are entitled to more consideration than those who are able to pay. I understood that that was a view which the honourable member for Maranoa was always ready to uphold. fence their properties with wire netting cannot be described as very poor. room for a difference of opinion as to the wisdom of our proposal. We are willing, in view of the reduction in the duties upon other articles in the item, to accept a duty of 15 per cent, upon barbed wire; and the imposition of such a duty will strengthen the case for the imposition of a similar duty upon wire-netting. I have explained the reasons which have induced us to propose this duty, and whether they be acceptable to the committee or not, I am sure that no honourable member will give credence to the suggestion that in any proposal we have made in the Tariff we have been influenced by the fact that one State is affected more than another. AVe believe that we have treated each and all the States with equal I do not know what fairness, and, as we have acted in the past, we shall continue to act in the future. for Trade and Customs did well to recognise the importance of the issues which are now before us, but I do not think we can let him off upon the copy-book phrase that ""just as in the past we have done our best, so in the future we hope to do the same."" I am afraid that we shall have to go a little deeper into the matter than that. Our blame must fall upon tlie right honorA t the present time able gentleman, because of tlie theory of Ministerial responsibility. The right honourable gentleman knew all about the industries of South Australia, and forgot none of them.

But in the absence of some such statement, we must judge the Ministry by what we know of their acts. Ministers pleaded in the Cabinet for these industries, and their appeal was not regarded, a very serious charge lies at the door of the Cabinet. either a neglect of duty on the part of the New South Wales Ministers, or conduct on the part of a well-informed Cabinet which justifies very serious charges being made against it. If the Cabinet knew that the wire-netting industry employed a great number of men in New South Wales, how in the name of common political decency could they, when putting a protective duty upon barbed wire to support a Victorian industiy employing only a few hands, refuse to put a protective duty upon wire netting ? Wales wire-netting industry employs 300 hands, and is equal to half-a-dozen or even 30 of some of the Victorian industries which have been fought for by the day. Ministers and members supporting the Government tell us that the imposition of provote for a 15 per cent, duty for the entective duties makes articles cheaper to the consumer; and then the Minister for Trade and Customs informs us that he has not put a duty upon wire netting because it is used in poverty-stricken districts, where people cannot afford to pay very highly for what they require. New South Wales is asked to bear the burden of taxation, but no attempt is made to give her any of the so called benefits of this policy of protection. If the wire-netting industry werescar cely known, I should have had nothing to say; but Messrs. Lysaght's factory has been in existence within 7 miles of Sydney for a number of years. factory. that factory, and would not give it encouragement and protection, howcan they justify themselves before the people of Australia in proposing a duty of 20 per cent, upon barbed wire.

Three OP four months have elapsed since this Tariff was made known, and during that period the Ministry must have been overwhelmed There has been with information on all subjects. By this time Ministers might be supposed to know something of the large industries with which they were dealing. What is the problem that the Ministry and this committee are trying to solve? The adoption of a policy which will deal fairly with all the industries of Australia. Surely there is an indication of some sort of censurable act when large industries employing hundreds of men are altogether forgotten. How can the sincere protectionists, who have so honestly battled The New South for very small industries, and who are battling now for an industry in which a few men are engaged in placing a little piece of twisted wire in the shape of a tag on miles of imported wire with imported machines-ho w can these protectionists couragement of such an industry, and stand by while an enterprise employing 300 hands in New South Wales is left totally destitute of encouragement?

Trade and Customs has told us that the Cabinet knew about the wire-netting industry, so that the plea of ignorance is withdrawn and a plea of guilty has been substituted, and the Minister for Trade and Customs can only say a few halting words to the effect that the Ministry had some vague idea that wire netting was used by poverty stricken people in poverty-stricken districts.

Our position in this matter is perfectly clear. We say that in the interests of our great rural industries no duties should be placed upon these articles. The Ministry say that in the name of protection we should put a duty of 20 per cent, on barbed wire, but in the name of what do they put wire netting on the free list ?

We are in favour of a moderate Tariff based on revenue principles, but our friends opposite favour a protective Tariff-pro tective for Victoria, but free-trade so far as the industries of New South Wales are Not that that is a reason concerned. A private member, whose consistency as a protectionist we all respect, has actually had to come to the rescue of 300 wire-netting workers in New South Wales when the Ministers representing New South Wales, although they brought the matter before the Cabinet, were not strong enough to prevail. We have now to put our trust in the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. The men who preached protection in New South Wales for so many years ought-no w that protection has got a chance in Australia-to have remembered New South Wales industries better than they seem to have done, and if So far as the poverty of the they found the Cabinet determined to neglect the big New South AAales industries, r they had influence that would have been sufficient to compel the Cabinet to do what was right. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Home Affairs, and the A icer President of the Executive Council had only to insist upon having wire netting treated at least as well as barbed wire, and their colleagues would have given way We, as free-traders, who do not believe in these duties, are placed in an awkward position when we have to complain that they are not put on for the benefit of our own facThe honourable tories, but the distinction we make is a perfectly fair one. AAe say"" If you will adr minister this policy of protection, in the name of all that is fair, act fairly by the absent men who have to bear one-third of the taxation of the Commonwealth.

If there were 5, 6, or 50 importers of an article in Melbourne who formed a ring, there is not a single' merchant in Melbourne who could not, unless prevented by the Tariff, bring that ring down. What is the use of talking about any importers' monopoly in New South Wales? If all the soft-goodsmen in that State attempted to establish a monopolj , with free ports,any man of 7 brains and capital here or in Germanj', the United States, or Great Britain, could come and smash that monopoly.

But the position of the protectionists is one we must criticise, and the action of In this case I give a the New South Wales Ministers in allowing their colleagues to put this wire netting on the free list, whilst leaving barbed wire taxable, demands explanation.

Just as I believe in placing agricultural machinery on the free list, I believe in dealing with these other articles in precisely the same waj', i u the interests of our struggling pioneer industries in the interior.

Sir AVILLIAMLYNE those who cried out so much about itare very sorry. The right honourable member for East Sydney has said that division VIA of the Tariff, to which it was proposed to transfer the item under consideration, was in the clouds. But he knows that the proposal in the New South Wales Tariff was that a duty should be placed upon pig-iron twelve months after the introduction of that Tariff, the object being to defer the imposition of the tax until the industry had become established. The industry was not established, and at the end of the period specified the duty became operative upon the raw material. The recollection of this fact has prompted the Ministry to introduce the division to which I have referred, which will make it impossible for the tax to fall upon the raw material at a time when we are not likely to produce it in our midst. The proposal of the Government is a very good one, and I know that the public regard it as such. Before concluding I wish it to be clearly understood by my constituents and the public generally, that the reason I do not speak oftener upon the Tariff is that it would not be right for me to unduly occupy the time of the House, and thus interfere with the duties of the two Ministers who are directly in charge of this business. I make this explanation beN o thanks to the Minister-. cause an attempt is insidiously being made in The right New South Wales, and especially in Sydney, to discredit me as the head of the protectionists in that State on the ground that I do not evince that interest in the Tariff which I ought to exhibit. The fact is that I am not called upon, save under very exB u t Nature did ceptional circumstances, to debate any item when it comes before the committee. I hope that the attempt to discredit my two colleagues and myself in New South Wales No, it dewill not be repeated. It is a contemptible thing when it is well known that we had The Minister has no hand Sir AVILLIAMLYNE I repeat that it I was a memis a contemptible thing, whenit is well known that we had no desire to admit wire netting free. I had not, and if I had the opportunity, I should be delighted to place a duty upon it . to conduct the Cabinet, which is something that the right honourable member never knew. The reason the wire-netting industry I know that has existed in New South Wales as long as it has is because several of the largest commercial men along the Great AVestern railway line prefer the local to the imported article. It is distributed throughout the whole of the western and southern districts of New South Wales. I know that a large firm in Orange purchase as much of it as they can obtain, and distribute it amongst their customers in the western division. That, however, is no reason why a duty of 15 per cent, should not be imposed upon it. I venture to think that if the history of New South Wales and Victoria is examined, it will be found that where the importers have been able, by means of rings, to raise the prices of articles, those prices have been reduced when a local industry has become thoroughly established, and in this connection I will undertake to say that the price of barbed wire will be reduced as soon as there is a larger output. If there is a small output only, it stands to reason that tbe price of any article must be higher than if there were a large output.

I throw the responsibility for this waste of time upon the members of the Opposition. I am not so new a chum in politics as not to understand that this matter was arranged outside the Chamber, because the debate was opened by the honourable member for Dalley, who was followed by tbe honourable member for Parramatta, and then supported by their honored chief. There was evidently a conspiracy to disparage the Government by raising the cry of State against State, in order that certain honourable members might get their opinions reported in the Sydney papers, and make the people of New South Wales imagine ask the Chairman to rule whether the honourable member's references to public opinion in Sydney have any relevance to the item under discussion ? able member has gone I have not noticed that he is out of order. biggest sinner who attempts to reprove sin.

The making of wire netting is in no sense an industry peculiar to New South Wales.

Would honourable members opposite support the imposition of a duty on wire netting ? honourable member do so ? proposed duty. not vote for a duty on rock salt, sheep dip, wire netting, or anything of that kind. right honourable member's insulting remark later on.

If you will allow me to make one reference to the question, I should like to point out that it will be necessary within a few years to erect something like 50,000 or 100,000 miles of wire netting fences in Australia. Is this, then, the time to talk of putting a duty upon it ? opportunity for protectionists to foster the local wire-netting industry, and thus make wire netting cheaper to the consumers. proposed duty upon barbed wire, it is with reluctance that I vote against the Ministerial proposal. I am always willing to give the Ministry the benefit of any doubt, and I am not fond of finding myself in the bad company of honourable members opposite, because our fiscal beliefs are as wide asunder as the poles. But I am bound to remember any electoral pledges, and to adhere to my principles. ThoughI announced myself as a protectionist, I believe that the application of protectionist doctrines should be regulated by wisdom and moderation. A\ ho is it that 7 uses barbed wire? The farmers and the settlers of the country. monwealth. be taxed by a duty which will raise the price oÂ£ barbed wired by 30s. or 32s. per ton ? I have hundreds of farmers in my district who will suffer if this duty is imposed, and there are thousands of others throughout the Commonwealth. Should we do this injustice to them to benefit an industry that employs only 38 hands ? coming round ! protectionist, and if an industry is worth protecting, and can be protected without unduly hurting the great mass of those who use its productions, I am ready to protect it : but when I have to take my choice between increasing the price of barbed wire to the farmers by 30s. or 32s. a ton, and fostering an industry which does not seem to have prospered in A ictoria even under a r protective duty of 40 per cent., I must vote in favour of the producers of the.country. This does not appear to me to be worth calling a national industry. We produce If in neither the wire nor the barbs here. wire is 7s. 6d. a ton less in A'ictoria than in any other State. and many will suffer by the imposition of this duty, and where the many will suffer the few must go to the wall. I prefer to benefit the many rather than to benefit the few. But although I think that barbed wire should be put upon the free list, I am ready to strain a point to assist to maintain an existing industry, and therefore I shall support a duty of 10 per cent., though I am. somewhat inconsistent in doing so. It is very difficult to always give a consistent vote, but one must do his best according to his beliefs at the time. In reference to the sneer of the leader of the Opposition, that, although I am a protectionist, I want free salt, free sheep clip, and free wire netting, I wish to say that the imposition of a duty upon sheep dip would not affect me to the extent of Â£ 1 a year, while, as for a duty upon salt, I never use imported salt.

I do not suppose they were seriously meant. While, in my opinion, protection is a sound principle when wisely -and prudently applied, I have always agreed with the free-traders that a duty of 100 to 150 per cent, establishes a monopoly, and I am of opinion that to impose high duties which unduly tax hundreds and thousands of our best settlers, in order to build up such small industries as the barbed wire industry, is calculated to bring discredit upon the protectionist cause. I will not go one step further thaii to support a duty of 10 per cent., and then only with the object of maintaining an existing industry. should refuse to support any duty whatever. Being a free-trader, I should object to this duty being imposed under any circumstances, but I desire to point out that the reason given by the Government for admitting wire netting free of duty applies equally to barbed wire. Barbed wire is very often used in conjunction with wire netting, and if wire netting is to be admitted free out of consideration for the poverty-stricken settlers of the poorer districts, barbed wire should also be admitted without the payment of duty. If barbed wire is not placed along the top of the wire-netting fences, the cattle rub and knock against it, and damage it so as to very soon render it useless, and it is for this reason, amongst others, that I would ask the committee to vote in favour of placing barbed wire on the free list. I cannot admit for one moment that the user of barbed wire is able to obtain it any more cheaply because of the duty. Figures may be quoted in this Chamber with the view to proving such a proposition, but they will never convince me. We do not find the galleries thronged by the users of any material who ask that a duty may be placed upon it in order to make it cheaper, but the manufacturers are in daily attendance with the object of bringing pressure to bear in favour of the imposition of duties. In regard to this particular article I have good reason to know that the manufacturers have been present here with a view to inducing honourable members to retain the duty.' The honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, has told us that barbed wire is very largely used in South Australia, but I am sure that the South Australian Government have not come to Victoria for barbed wire in auy large quantities. If the South Australian Government knew that barbed wire was cheaper in Victoria than in their own State, they would doubtless have purchased it from the local manufacturers. tities of barbed, wire have been sent from Victoria to Western. Australia and Queensland. of South Australia, where the Government encourage the use of barbed wire. I know, from my own experience, that in the purI f I were perfectly logical I chase of protected articles I have had to pay more on account of the duties imposed, and I hope that the members of the committee will consider the interests of the users of barbed wire and place it on the free list. member for Bourke made a statement last night that the Victorian barbed wire was equal in length to the imported article, but if the honourable member had handled as much wire as I have, he would know that there is no comparison between the two kinds. Every one knows that in each coil of barbed wire there is a certain weight, and that the smaller the gauge of the wire the greater the distance it will cover. Of the two samples that were submitted to us, one was double the gauge of the other, and, therefore, a coil of the smaller gauge wire must have been capable of extending over almost double the distance that would have been covered by the larger gauge wire. for gauge. gauge the imported wire shows a margin of over a mile per ton to the good as compared with the Victorian wire. I have here a circular issued by Messrs. McLean Brothers and .Rigg showing the weights of the various gauges and the distances covered by them, and this affords conclusive evidence of the superiority of the imported wire. The Minister for Trade and Customs said that wire netting was to be admitted free so as to help the poverty-stricken settlers scattered over the poorer districts of the Commonwealth, but if the Minister went to Queensland he would see some of the richest land in the world enclosed with",32,Tariff

We have very nearly the whole of Queensland enclosed with a double fence of wire netting in order to keep out the rabbits which originally migrated from Victoria. to Victoria, and we wish it to remain so. The Prime Minister, in his Maitland speech, said he wished to preserve the national industries of the Commonwealth, and I would ask what greater national industry there is than the pastoral industry. It is the backbone of the Commonwealth, and yet it is proposed to heavily tax all the goods used in connection with it . Hitherto barbed /wire has been admitted into New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and New Zealand free of duty, whereas in Victoriai t has been subject to a duty of Â£-3 per ton, and in Tasmania to a duty of 20 per cent. I do not understand the principle by which the Ministry have been guided in imposing this duty, Unless they were anxious to protect a Victorian industry at the expense of the whole of the Commonwealth. Isi t fair or reasonable that the whole of the people engaged in the pastoral industry of the Commonwealth should be taxed for the sake of 40 men in Victoria? I say it is monstrous. If the manufacture of barbed wire is a national industry, why has it not been carried on in the other States instead of being confined to Victoria? the only State that imposed the duty. had a prohibitive duty. The revenue derived from barbed wire in Victoriai n 1900 was Â£588-a n amount which would be realized in Queensland in one week if a Â£ 3 per ton duty were imposed there. A constituent of mine told me, when I was last in Queensland, that he had just paid Â£ 1 4 0 in the way of duty for barbed wire, and the article is used throughout hundreds of miles of open country in the cattle districts of Queensland. has told us that he believes in helping the oppressed, but is the imposition of a duty on barbed wire calculated to help the oppressed people of Queensland ? We have just passed through a four years drought, and there are many men who were worth thousands four years ago who are now working for 15s a week and rations. proposes to further tax them by imposing a duty on barbed wire. only earning 15s. a week and their rations ? mediate use for barbed wire, it is true, but the duty will make it all the more difficult The rabbit industiy is one peculiar for them to start again. Thank goodness Queensland is a place in which a man has a chance to make a fresh start. When a man meets with a reverse he does not fly to the factories in the big cities as they do in Victoria. Such a man goes out into the wilds, and, in pioneering work, perhaps gets another start in life, and yet the incentive now offered to him is the imposition of a duty of Â£ 3 per ton on the barbed wire he may require. If j>rotection, as claimed, makes the article cheaper, how does it come that at Townsville in September last the price was Â£ 1 5 10s. per ton, while to-day it is Â£ 1 7 15s.? barbed wire is not manufactured in Queensland. to cai-ry the barbed wire to Townsville?

If the right honourable gentleman was the owner of a barbed wire factory, he could not "" barrack "" more strongly for the duty ; but I am, certain that the Minister is not of his own free will advocating a duty which will bear most heavily on the pioneers throughout the Commonwealth, and particularly in Queensland, where more barbed wire is used than in any of the other States. Every honourable member for Queensland,' whether protectionist or free-trade, should vote against this impost, which affects most prejudicially what is truly a national industry in that State. Even a most consistent supporter of the Government, like the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, must on this occasion give some support to those who are opposing this duty. The pastoral industry is just as national in Queensland as the salt industry in South Australia, and I wish I -were in a position to make an appeal on behalf of the former such as was made for the latter by the Minister for Trade and Customs. Those engaged in the pastoral industry in Queensland have i u the last four years been going through one of the most trying times ever experienced in the State, and this duty means saddling them with still greater disadvantages and disabilities. always amusing to hear the honourable member for Maranoa make his free-trade speeches, when we recollect how strenuously he appealed for a duty on bananas. The honourable member tells us that the price of barbed wire at Townsville is Â£ 1 7 13s. 6d., and I shall not dispute his figures, because Townsville is one of the most northern ports but if we take the prices in the more central cities, which is perhaps the fairest way, the price in Brisbane to-day is Â£17, as against Â£ 1 6 10s. some time ago, for 12-gauge imported American wire. It has been said that American wire goes further than Australian wire, and in support of that statement there was produced a circular issued by Messrs. McLean Brothers and Rigg. It is perfectly true that one class of American wire in this market does go further than the ordinary wire. This wire, which was that referred to in the circular, is known in the trade as having an oval barb, and it is a lighter wire than that ordinarily used, and is not in great favour, because it does not exactly carry out the purpose for which it is intended. But, when this wire was referred to, the fact was not stated that an extra price is charged for it simply because it goes a little further than that in .more general use. position to say. able member know that the American wire is dearer ? who know best about prices that this particular wire is somewhat dearer. more. able member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, assert that this American wire is not dearer ? about it.

I offered last night, and repeat the offer now, to vote with those who are asking that this item should be placed on the free list, if my statements in regard to this particular kind of wire can be disproved. We had some samples of barbed wire, said to be colonial and American, placed before the committee, and I ventured to assert my belief that one of the samples was not American, but German. Since then, I have taken from coils of wire two samples, one American and the other Australian. The American sample is made of one straight wire, with the other wire curled round, while the barbs are placed on one wire, and the result of this form of construction is, that the quality is not equal to that of wire both strands of which are twisted. ber not think that sheep-owners know which is best? and I shall give the testimony of a man who",34,Tariff

As a matter of fact the machines are not imported, but made in the Commonwealth, and the probabilities are that, with the duty which has been placed on iron, New South Wales manufacturers of crude iron will, before long, be making wire, and thus do away with the necessity for the importation of that article. Hitherto no wire has been made in the Commonwealth. They cannot buy colonial wire if they wish to, but we hope they will soon be in a position to purchase it at as low a price as the imported article. Coming to the position in South Australia we are asked why, if barbed wire is cheaper in Melbourne than it is in the other States, the South Australian Government do not buy their wire here ! The reason is that up to the present time the freightage from Melbourne to South Australia has exceeded the margin of difference between the prices in those States. But there is such a large market for barbed wire in South Australia that one Melbourne manufacturer is about to establish the industry there, and the South Australian consumer will then be able member's statement as to the facts. able to purchase his wire at the same low price as does the Victorian consumer. the honourable member to doubt them, when What are the facts in this connection ? he cannot disprove them.

How is it possible to pay higher wages, incur more expense in production, and yet sell the wire cheaper ? toria the competition between the manufacturer and the importer compelled them to take a less profit than was received in New South Wales. If the argument of tlie right honourable member for East Sydney be a sound one, the price in New South Wales should have been Â£ 1 2 10s. per ton, because there was no duty operative there, whereas in Victoria there was a duty of Â£ 3 per ton. The honourable member for North Sydneyi n replying to my statements last evening, declared that if a duty was wanted, it was wanted to enable the manufacturers to increase their profits. He also affirmed that the price of wire in Victoria had been raised by nearly the amount of the duty. Such an argument ought surely to apply both ways? If there is a duty of Â£ 3 per ton operative in A'ictoria., whereas no duty exists in New South Wales, then by a parity of reasoning the price in the latter State should be Â£ 3 per ton less than it is in the former.

236,Mr Hume Cook,"Can any honorsafraid that if I returned to South Australia, and repeated the arguments of the honourable member for Bourke as an excuse for voting for the imposition of a duty of 20 per cent., the people would think that I had lost my reason since I last stood upon the hustings. The honourable member says that if this duty be imposed a factory will be established in South Australia, and the consumer will be able to purchase wire there cheaper than he can at present. What was the object of starting there'! To get rid of the freight. The honourable member for Bourke has told us-thoug h I am not prepared to accept his statement-that barbed wire is cheaper in Victoria than in the other States. He said that it was cheaper in Victoria than in South Australia, and that the difference in price was caused by the freight to South Australia ; and he tells us that since the imposition of this duby Â£16 10s. a ton in Melbourne. If the a branch of the local industry is to be established in South Australia. Is that branch to be established there 'for the benefit of the consumer? W ill the honourable member contend that those who establish that factory are philanthropists who go there, not in their own interests, but to benefit the consumers of South Australia by ridding them of the freight -charges ? The argument is too thin. It is as thin as another argument which we have heard from him ad nauseam during the Tariff discussion-that the way to promote competition is to prevent, or, at all 'events, to reduce importation. He tells us that . owing to the competition between manufacturers and importers in Victoria, things have been cheaper here than elsewhere, but I have never been able to see how the imposition of a duty and the diminution of . imports could increase Competition between the local manufacturers and the importers, .and statistics do not bear out the contention. We find that in Victoria only 77 persons are employed in the wireworking industry, while in New South Wales 212 persons are so employed, and in New South Wales from 1894 until the imposition of the present Tariff barbed wire was admitted free. The Minister for Home Affairs prided -himself in his speech upon having done so much for the metal workers of New South Wales, . but I cannot see from my reading of statistics what his policy did for them. In the year 1893 there were 6,430 persons employed in the metal and machinery works of New South Wales, while in 1S94 the number of persons so employed was 6,969. But when the leader of the Opposition applied to the industry that freedom upon which he has so often and so effectively spoken, the result, instead of being decadence and increased prices to the consumer, which would have been in accordance with protectionist ideas, was that the number of persons employed had increased by 1900 to 12,306, or 2,000 more than were similarly employed in Victoria. The honourable member for Bourke has made certain assertions in regard to prices which it would be difficult to refute, but I know that in July .of last year, before the imposition of the present Tariff, American barbed wire cost Â£ 1 5 10s. a ton in Sydney and Â£17 10s. a ton in Melbourne, while the locally-made wire cost locally-made wire Was as good as the American wire, I wonder that squatters were foolish enough to pay Â£ 1 per ton more for the American wire. I would point out, too, that although the local manufacturer was protected to the extent of a duty of Â£ 3 per ton, he conceded only Â£ 1 per ton to the consumer, and took the benefit of the remaining Â£ 2 a ton himself. Those facts refute the assertion of the honourable member for Bourke that the quality of the Victorianmade wire is on a par with that of the imported wire. I should like to know to what extent the proposed duty will affect the consumers of barbed wire 1 In South Australia we are to a great extent a pastoral people, and since 1879, when we passed our first Vermin and Rabbit Destruction Act -havin g in, I think, one year prior to that time spent over Â£90,000 in payment for scalps-w e have passed many measures in the attempt to prevent the continual surrender of pastoral leases through the presence of vermin upon them. Within the last three or four years, however, hope has begun to dawn with us, because of the application of the system of fencing upon which my honourable colleague, Mr Poynton, is an expert, and which he has advocated so often in the South Australian Parliament. But this Government now propose to impose a duty of 20 per cent., or something like Â£ 3 ' 1 0 s . per ton, upon the wire which our squatters have to use for fencing purposes. I cannot",37,Tariff
237,Mr Glynn (Soubh Australia),"I amunderstand such a monstrous proposition coining from the Minister of Trade and Customs. The Ministry do not seem to have given us any estimate of the probable returns from this duty, but, according to the Victorian figures for last year, the importation into this State was 196 tons and thecoiisumption of locally-manufactured wire 1,400 tons. The revenue, therefore, collected by the Government under a duty of Â£ 3 per ton was, therefore, Â£ 5 8 8 ; but, in addition to that, the consumerspaid an equal rate upon the locally manufactured wire, so that the total charge to the consumers really amounted to Â£4,78S. One has only to apply similar figures to the total Australasian consumption to see what a huge burden the passing of the proposed duty would impose upon the pastoral industiy. pear from the remarks of some honourable members that the proposal now before the committee is to impose a serious burden upon a class of the community who have already innumerable difficulties to contend w it h ; but it is evident, when honourable members talk about ruin being inflicted upon the squatters through having to pay duty on the barbed wire they require to fence in sheep, and to keep out rabbits, that tbey do not know much about their subject.

Six months after a duty was first imposed upon barbed wire in Victoria, in September, 1889, the price of the article went down Â£ 4 a ton, and although the Victorian duty remained in force until the imposition of the Commonwealth Tariff last October, at no time during that period was barbed wire of any class cheaper in New South Wales than in Victoria. The honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, stated last night that a ton of imported wire covered a distance of 6 miles 47 chains, whereas a ton of colonial wire covered a length only of 5 miles 18 chains, but what tlie honourable member really compared -were two entirely different classes of wire, and I defy him to prove his statement. in both cases.

Since the imposition of the duty in Victoriai n 1889, we have been able to buy all classes of barbed wire at rates not one cent higher than have been charged in New South Wales. As a matter of fact, during the whole of these eleven years, we have been able to buy for a shade less per ton than have the consumers in New South Wales. have paid Â£ 1 7 10s. per ton, as against Â£ 1 5 10s. in New South Wales. The prices I intend to quote are furnished by Messrs. McLean Brothers and Rigg upon my own personal inquiry. Messrs. McLean Brothers and Rigg deal directly with farmers, and the quotations they have given me are for different classes of wire during the second week after the federal duties were imposed. I have also quotations from Lassetter and Co., Sydney, who occupy a position somewhat similar to that held by McLean Brothers and Rigg in the Melbourne trade. Between the 20th and 24th October, AVaukegan wire of No. 12 gauge was quoted by Messrs. McLean Brothers and Rigg in Melbourne at Â£ 1 9 per ton, aud Messrs. Lassetter and Co's. quotation of the same wire in Sydney was Â£ 2 2 iOs. per ton. For No. 14 gauge, McLean Brothers and Rigg quoted Â£ 2 1 per ton, and Lassetter and Co., Â£ 2 4 per ton. For the ordinary wire, of No. 12 gauge, Messrs. McLean Brothers quoted Â£ 1 7 per ton. I referred to it as have mislaid Messrs. Lassetter's quotation, but I know that there was a difference of Â£ 2 in favour of the Melbourne price. TheI may explain that the creased the cost of the wire to the Victorian consumer, owing to the fact that competition amongst the local manufacturers has kept the price down. As for the contention that imported wire extends for a greater length than locally manufactured wire of the same gauge, it is absurd, and I do not think the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton. was justified in withholding some of the facts when he was making his statement. It is an advantage, wire go further ? Locally manufactured wire is made of exactly the same gauge as is the imported article, and the same number of barbs are put in. As a matter of fact the same wire is used-in both cases, and the wire is twisted and barbed with the same machines, which work so correctly that it is impossible to put any additional length of wire in the barbs beyond that inserted by the same machines in Germany and America. The duty in Victoria has not operated as a tax upon the consumers of wire, because they have been able to buy it at a slightly lower rate than that obtaining in New South Wales. I will admit that since the federal duty was imposed the merchants in Sydney have increased the price of wire That is not true. by an amount equivalent to the rate of duty, but no evidence has been brought before the committee to show that the duty has in any way increased the cost of the wire to the consumer, from six months after the date the duty was imposed in VictoriaSeptember, 1889-u p to the imposition of the federal duty.

I have had considerable experience in fencing contracts in New South Wales and Victoria, and I know that for many years past, at no time has the same class of barbed wire been cheaper in Sydney than in Melbourne; on the contrary, prices have always been in favour of Melbourne. There is no evidence that this duty, which is protective in its incidence, will be a tax on the consumer. It is true that immediately the Federal Tariff was imposed the merchants put up prices in Sydney. ber mean to say that the particular wire, which goes so far, will be cheaper because of the duty 1 time.

Melbourne and Sydney show any difference between protection and free-trade 1 plained that consideration is not given to the wire-netting industry in New South Wales, but those who make that complaint seem to forget that the Federal Tariff affects people equally all over Australia. This particular industry was established by a firm who have an agency here, and wish to meet their own requirements. There has H o w is it that at the been no duty on wire netting in Victoria up to the present time, and in this State there has been a small factory established. I am confident that the duty will not add I d . to the cost of barbed wire. Although there may not be a great many people employed in the industry, still there are some, and where there is a chance of giving employment without enhancing the cost to the consumer, I shall support such a duty as will preserve the industry from extinction. It seems to me that the Ministry have made a decided tactical blunder in introducing this proposed duty of 20 per cent, We have proof that, on barbed wire. If they had first placed a duty of 20 per cent, on wire netting, wire cloth and wire gauze, we should have had no difficulty in carrying a similar duty on barbed wire. I need not traverse the many and varied arguments which have been advanced, but I would urge that this industry, as carried on in Victoria, deserves all the benefits it may have received from the State. Those who carry on the industry have not used the duty in order to raise prices, and have certainly not used it to make fortunes for themselves, seeing that they pay liberal wages. The boys and young men employed receive Â£ 2 15s. per week, and the older and more expert men Â£ 4 10s. per week; and an industry which pays good wages, and does not increase the cost to the consumer, always has a good claim on the consideration of this committee, so far as",40,Tariff

The offer of the Ministry to accept 15 per cent, is a drop of 10 percent., and if we are going to reduce duties we should reduce them slowly.

The honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, however, has quoted figures which show that over m a considerable period during which barbed wire was admitted free into New South Wales, it was cheaper there than it was in Victoria, where there was a duty of something like Â£3 a ton. It has been stated that barbed wire has been imported into New South Wales from Victoria because it could be obtained more cheaply here than in New South Wales, and Peak Hill was named as the district to which it had been sent .from Victoria. representing Peak Hill in the New South Wales Parliament for something like seven years, and I have lived in its vicinity for nearly the whole of my lifetime, so that I think that, if there had been any large importation of barbed wire into that district from Victoria, I should have heard of it. I do not say that no such importation was made, but whatever importation took place was very small. Possibly the wire was imported by one or two settlers who came to New South Wales from Victoria, and who had opportunities of obtaining it to advantage which were not open to consumers generally. sible to purchase barbed wire in Melbourne more cheaply than elsewhere, the New South Wales farmers would have bought large quantities of it here. But Mr Coghlan, in Mr Brown. his statistics for 1900, which are the latest available, shows that in that year NewI know that protecSouth Wales imported only 226 cwt. of barbed wire from any other State, and that upon any article does not that came from South Australia, and was make that article clearer. no doubt used in that part of New South Wales which adjoins the South Australian border. These figures disclose the fact that almost all the barbed wire imported into New South Wales came from the United States of America, the total amount so imported being 36,181 cwt., and the quantity imported from South Australia, the United Kingdom, and all other places except the United States of America, amounted to only 256 cwt. Not one cwt. of wire was imported from Victoria during that year. It has New South Wales, however, exported to Victoria 1,667 cwt. of barbed wire, and sent 12,808 cwt. to Queensland, 200 cwt. to tralia, 1,012 cwt. to Tasmania, and 1,2S3 cwt. to New Zealand, besides exporting to New Guinea, Norfolk Island, the Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, and other places in the South Seas. In all, New South Wales in that year exported to the neighbouring States 16,367 cwt. of barbed wire, valued at Â£11,608, her total export of barbed wire to all places being 18,963 cwt., valued at Â£13,409. Therefore, in spite of Tariff disadvantages, the barbed wire came from New South Wales to Victoria, and not from Victoria to New South Wales. Not only is this wire largely required in the central and western parts of New South Wales, as well as in the other States, to prevent the spread of I had the honour of vermin, but large quantities of it are used in the more settled districts to control the movements of animals. Barbed wire is being used for this purpose more and more each year by the farmers and graziers. A great deal has been said about the need to encourage the barbed-wire making industry in Victoria, but, in view of the contention that the imposition of this duty will cheapen the price of the article, I fail to see how the manufacturers can benefit by its imposition. As a matter of fact, neither the wire used for the barbs nor that used for the main strands is manufactured here; it is all imported. The manufacturing conI know that if it had been possists in attaching the barbs to the wire and in twisting the wire, which is almost wholly the work of machines. I visited .. two or three of these factories, and I found that the machines were invariably under the control of youths, and that the men employed were engaged in lookingafter the steam power which drove the machinery. If the duty adds to the cost of the article ic will inflict a serious injury upon the pastoral and farming industries of New South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland, and possibly of other States, and it would be to the interest of those engaged in these industries to combine and pension oil' all those who are engaged in barbed-wire making. I hope that at least a substantial reduction will be made on the duty proposed by the Government. The Government have not adopted, in connection with this item, the practice followed in many other cases of fixing the duty at something like an average of the rates hitherto prevailing throughout the States. Excepti n ""Victoria and Tasmania, wire netting was admitted free of duty prior to the introduction of the Tariff, but the Government in the first instance adopted the maximum rate of 20 per cenj;., and have now modified it to 15 per cent. Notwithstanding the fact that Victoria had the markets of the other States to operate upon, and her home market protected to the extent of 20 percent., the barbed-wire industry has not assumed any large proportions, and we cannot look for any great results from a protective duty operating throughout the whole of the States against the outside world. Only 40 persons are employed in the industry now, and it is not likely that that number would be increased more than fourfold. We should not, therefore, be. justified in imposing a duty of 15 per cent, upon this article-whic h is absolutely necessary for those who have to live under the very hardest conditions-for the purpose of protecting a small and unimportant industry. lieve our farmers and pastoralists as far as we possibly can, and when we know that barbed wire has to be used for enclosing almost every acre of cultivated land we should not subject it to a duty. The ultimate injury resulting from the imposition of a duty would not, perhaps, be very great, but it must be admitted that barbed wire would be dearer for some considerable time. ' If I were satisfied that a large and profitable industry would be established as the result of imposing a duty I would support it, even though the consumers of the wire might have to pay a little more for a time; but I do not feel justified in taking that course when I consider that the manufacturing process consists of twisting the wire and attaching the barbs. ProbablyI may be regarded as inconsistent in this matter, b u t ' I stated in the first place that I would vote for the protection of all industries which appeared to me to be worth preserving. I do not regard the industry as an important one. There was nothing to prevent Victorian barbed wire from being sent into the markets of the other States if there was such a wide difference in price as has been stated here. I am very doubtful regarding the correctness of some of the figures which have been shown to me bearing upon the difference in price in Victoria and South Australia, because the divergences are greater than would be accounted for by the cost of freight between the States. It has been stated that barbed wire is not so much an absolute necessity for farmers and pastoralists as is wire netting, but its use is very largely resorted to for the protection of flocks against the ravages of wild dogs, and also in connection with vermin-proof fencing generally. Further than that, barbed wire is very largely taking the place of ordinary fencing wire. It has been suggested that a 10 per cent, duty should be imposed upon this article, but on the other hand we are told that that rate of duty would be of no value as a means of protection. In that case 10 per cent, would be simply a revenue duty, and would add to that extent to the cost of every ton of barbed wire used in the Commonwealth. I do not favour the imposition of a merely revenue duty in this case, and as I do not consider a highlyprotective duty would be justified, I shall vote for placing barbed wire on the free list. think the leader of the Opposition has been allowed to make too much use of the complaint that a protective duty has not been placed on wire netting. We did not come into this House as free-traders and protectionists bound down by hard-and-fast principles. It was distinctly stated by the Prime Minister at Maitland that, it would be impracticable to follow out either a purely protectionist or a purely free-trade line of policy in framing the Tariff, and those who support the Government came into the House with a view to framing a Federal Tariff in the best",43,Tariff
294,Mr Batchelo R (South Australia),,45,Tariff
295,We Should Re,"Mr CRUICKSHA NK ( G w y d i r ) Iinterests of Australia as a whole, and we must be guided by our own instincts to that end. So far as the operation of this duty is concerned, we can obtain wire-fencing material in ""New South ""Wales as cheaply to-day as before the imposition of the Tariff. Por some reason or other wirefencing material of every kind increased in price considerably about nine months ago, but I was told by my manager when I was last at home that I could procure it just as cheaply as before the Tariff was imposed. Competition may have brought prices down or stocks may have got in before the duties were imposed. I have my own opinion, quite independent of the party I support, in regard to barbed wire, which I know is largely used by farmers for their cows, and by settlement lessees, where dogs are troublesome. In many instances barbed wire has to be placed on top of wire netting to prevent dogs jumping over. I shall vote for, and, if it be not moved, shall myself move for a reduction of the proposed m duty to 10 per cent. This is an article a duty on which I do not like voting for, but I realize that we must have some revenue. The making of barbed wire does not in my opinion employ sufficient hands to justify a protective duty, and while I intend to vote for a revenue duty, I feel that as the article is so largely used, it would be much better to pension off the people now employed, and let them go elsewhere. The arguments used by the mover of the amendment would have been more effective if they had been directed to the question whether this is really a native industry. If it is a native industry, I take it the product will become cheaper, but if it is not, it will naturally become dearer to the extent of the duty we impose. I do not want to discuss the question of wire netting, but incidentally I express the hope that it will be placed on. the same footing as barbed wire. A t present no one knows to what extent articles, the property of State Governments, are to be admitted free, or how far these duties will affect those who have to use wire netting for fencing on old settlement lease runs. In my opinion, -within two years after the passing of the Rabbit Bill in New South Wales, a million miles will not cover the quantity of wire fencing required. If every one in . that State became manufacturers, they could not make wire netting enough, and such would be no time to impose a duty. Mr Qruicfahanl:. ' Mr O'M ALLEY (Tasmania) -The question arises, is it right to impose any duty 1 The question is not whether only a few men are employed in the industry, but whether we are imposing these duties for the purpose of revenue, or to save the few who are employed, or for the purpose of employing more. I hold that the honourable member for Gwydir is guilty of fiscal schism when he contends that because there are only 30 or 40 men employed there should be no duty. If there was only one man empioj'ed, a duty ought to be imposed. We have capital punishment, not because the whole of the population are murderers, but because there should be a wholesome preventive. I shall vote for a duty of 15 per cent, on barbed wire, and also for a duty on wire netting, and thus encourage the latter in""dustry in New South Wales, from which State we get the largest portion of the revenue. I am sorry to think that Victorian members are a bit selfish on these questions. There is too much' of Victoria, ,.and it is bad for honourable members representing that State to refuse to help others, because such a course of conduct may eventually create combinations against themselves. I do not care if all the newspapers on earth attack me. Mr O'MALLEY -Not even fifty Ages. Every newspaper in Tasmania, with one or two exceptions, fought me, and I beat them. All I desire is to justify my action to my conscience, and not to be dictated to by newspaper individuals or combinations. If it be right to vote in any particular direction, K i ng O'Malley will vote according to his conscience. If 50,000,000 jumped on my chest, it would make no difference. AVe want a duty on barbed wire, not because the industry will give a great deal of employment, but because the duty will help to build up an Australian industry, and help Australians to be self-sustaining and independent against the whole world. a word in explanation on a point on which the leader of the Opposition evidently misunderstood me.

What are we to protect ] Are we to protect industries which are not wanted in tlie Commonwealth? What are we likely to gain from such a course as that ? Surely the statements made by a number of honourable members as to the necessity of having wire netting and barbed wire for use in the Commonwealth points in the direction of encouragement being given to the establishment of these indu stries, rather than to the reverse. It would be simply idle to provide for the encouragement of industries for which there is no use whatever. Something has been said about the addition to the cost of fencing.

I have previously intimated that the arguments in favour of treating barbed wire and wire netting alike were recognised by' the Government, and were to be taken into consideration as soon as we had decided in regard to the first item. There is no doubt that much of the argument in favour of barbed wire applies with equal force to wire netting, and honourable members know the reason that induced the Government to treat them differently. I deny that there will be any increased price, but taking the free-trade argument that there will be an increase to the extent of 15 per cent., what' does that amount to? What is the life of a wire fence ? Australia. stress to which the fence is subjected. ber evidently believes that he' knows more on this subject than those who are accustomed to use such fences.

That difference distributed over the 15 years amounts to 1 per cent., even allowing for interest on the 15 per cent. Yet we have all this crying and howling as to the imposition of a duty which is almost simply a revenue duty, on goods which are required to be renewed only once in 15 j'ears. How does that contrast with the application of free-trade principles to other matters-to the duty on tea, for instance ? man in order ? order.

An Honorable MEMBER -That is the Minister's own proposal. does it lie in the mouths of those who favour the proposal, as revenue tariffists do, to find faultwith a proposal which amounts to only 1 per cent, on the cosb of a wire fence 1 I venture to consider that as regards this particular item the charge is moderate. The industry is of a character which ought to be encouraged. We are told that the manufactured article is wanted. We want the industry and we want the article. What can we do to get them 1 Why, give the industry encouragement! The proposed duty represents only about 1 percent, on the life of a fence, and under all the circumstances it ought to be conceded without demur. the Minister for Trade and Customs should have been satisfied with the pretty long address which he made at an earlier part of the evening. I can assure him that if he will indulge in a protectionist speech at the end of a long discussion on a particular article, I shall simply follow his example. If the Ministeri n charge of a Tariff of this sort thinks that it is a proper consumption of time to air these protectionist generalities, I am surely not expected to have a keener sense of the value of time. I feel that I shall have to answer the right honourable gentleman at some length. In the first place he says that in the long run protective duties will reduce any locally made article to a price as low as-if not lower than-that of the imported article. The right honourable gentleman quite believed that statement the moment he made it ; but he has not believed it half the time that he has been engaged in framing this Tariff, because there are thousands of items contained therein which give the lie direct to his statement. If the right honourable gentleman really believed it, I should never have received a schedule like the one which was handed to me this afternoon. It is full of exemptions. Those exemptions include tools of trade of a thousand different kinds, which are used in protected industries. Surelyi t would be a grand native industry to make our own tools of trade for the industries of Australia. tectionist speech upon the committee at Of course I recognise that the Minister believed the statement which he made at the moment he spoke. He is nothing if not sincere, and he can be sincere in a hundred different ways in the course of a hundred minutes. What do we find in this very division ? The side columns are crowded with free items. Why should rabbit traps be admitted free 1 Is not the great manufacturing industry of Australia equal to the task of making rabbit traps ? What a boon it would be for the rabbit infested districts to have better and cheaper rabbit traps than they can get under a free-trade Tariff. Surelyi t is quite time that these generalities-whic h are all right upon the public platform, but which will not do when addressed to this committee which has such an enormous schedule before it -were abandoned. There is not a page here which is not full of exemptions. Several schedules were handed to honourable members to-day, containing further exemptions. There is no sense in these exemptions if by charging duty we should secure a better and cheaper article than is the imported. Why should we offer premiums to importers to introduce rubbish at a dearer rate than we can manufacture the articles for ourselves 1 The righb honourable gentleman is not consistent in the generalities which he utters. Then there is his calculation that the duty represents about 1 per cent, per year upon the cost of a vermin-proof fence. Unfortunately the Customs department does not collect its duties in that way. It collects the whole lot at once. A man has to be out of pocket the f u l l amount for which he is liable, before he can put one inch of fencing around his holding. When we considerthedistressed state of thepeoplein the interiorof the country, who are battling with vermin and droughts, and contrast it with the comparatively comfortable situation of those resident in the big cities, it seems an outrage that whilst the tools of trade used in snuglyprotected industries are placed upon the free list, the barbed wire which is vital to the self-preservation of the pioneer and his industries does not receive the same treatment. If , as the result of the imposition of duties, we get better and cheaper articles, why not include all these things in the schedule of exemptions ? Cannot we make them ?

The wire netting industry has been in existence in I am not in the conNew South Wales for fifteen years, and was started there long before the Dibbs Tariff came into operation. Messrs. Lysaght Bros, have not asked one New Soutli Wales representative to fight for their interests in this chamber, because they are satisfied with the result of their enterprise. I hold in my hand a document from one of the leading employees of the firm, which draws attention to the fact that their great competitor is the bounty-fed German manufacturer. I could understand the Treasurer proposing a revenue duty of 10 per cent, upon wire netting'; it is only upon these We do not believe lines that the imposition of a duty would be justified.

335,Mr Joseph Cook,"He"" said thatWe have heard all these tales before ad Qiauseam while this Tariff has been under discussion. A t a recent meeting in Melbourne one manufacturer said that the manufacturers were getting ready to die, and yet I am afraid these firms are going along merrily in spite of all statements to the contrary. Naturally they want to get as much as they can out of this Parliament and out of the pockets of the people, and they pull a long face in order to secure a higher rate of duiy. More power to them if they can do so, but the firm to which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has referred will not thank him for stating that they will have to close their doors unless Parliament comes to their assistance. In spite of the honourable member's statement regarding bounty-fed German competition, the industry in New South Wales bas gone on increasing in volume, until to-day it employs 300 hands, and this is the first time we have heard anything as to the necessity of a duty for the protection of the industry. I am curious to know what attitude the Government propose to take with regard to wire netting. It has been stated time and time again by those who profess to have some sympathy with the primary producers of Australia that wire netting, above all things, should be placed on the free list in the interests of those who live in the back blocks. It is essentially one of their raw materials, and its use is necessaiy for their existence, and if we impose a duty upon it we shall add considerably to tlie very heavy burdens which this section of the community already have to bear. These people are already struggling hard for existence against the various pests which have to be fought down by them, and as we cannot protect their products we should certainly not add to their burdens. We cannot insure them any higher prices for their sheep or farm produce, which are opeii to the free breezes of conrpetition all over the world, and it is desirable that we should afford them every facility in carrying on the straggle against the adverse conditions with which they have to contend. article which must be used extensively for the preservation from vermin of the Crown lands of the Commoiiwealth, -and as it is no function of this Parliament to hamper those who are engaged in developing ottv resources under the most arduous conditions, I hope that the committee will vote against the duty. pected that the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports would find acceptance with honourable members opposite, notwithstanding tlie fact that Germany is the principal competitor of those engaged in the wire-netting industry. Every ton of wire netting exported from that country is subsidized to the extent of 15s. or Â£ 1 per ton, and the steamers which convey tlie netting to this countiy also receive high bonuses. The wire-netting industiy has been in existence in New South Wales for some time, but I am informed by those who are managing it that it has not been paying; that there has been an actual loss on the working"" of it , and that but for the slight assistance it received during the operation of the Dibbs Tariffi t would have been closed down long ago. The number of hands employed is 300, including 50 boys, whilst the number of employees in the branch establishment recently opened in ""Victoria is 40. Tlie amount of wages paid in New South Wales is about Â£ 4 0 0 per week. MrA . McLEAN -Thos e are very low wages. may be taken to indicate that the industry is in need of some assistance. Protectionists argue that where a duty is imposed and an industry is established in consequence, the price of the article produced will eventually be cheapened, and therefore I cannot understand. professing protectionists being opposed to the imposition of this duty. I have some figures here which show that Our importations df wire netting from foreign countries for 1901 were as follow:-Prom Great Britain, 7,000 rolls, valued .at Â£ 5 , 0 0 0 ; from Belgium, 4,000 rolls, valued at Â£2,620 : and from Germany, 13,000 rolls, valued at Â£9,640. It will thus be seen that the largest importations come from Germany. As illustrating how the German manufacturers or importers compete with the looal manufacturers, I may mention that a short time ago tenders were called for the : supply of 1,000 miles of wire netting, and Wire netting is an that the German importers or agents tendered at Â£ 3 per ton below the actual cost of manufacturing the wire 'netting here. That is to say, they quoted a price which was Â£ 3 below the actual cost of manufacture here, without allowing anything for profit. We have just imposed a 10 per cent, duty on",50,Pairs

The Government have placed wire netting on the free list, for some reason of which I am not aware, and I think they would have been better' advised if they had made it dutiable. I will not Bros, will close down if a duty is not imposed on wire netting, but as they have been losing money they cannot go on in the the same.way for ever, and I hope the committee will favourably consider the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. not see that there is anything inconsistent in standing by the original proposal of the Government to leave wire netting on the free list, notwithstanding the fact that a duty of 10 per cent, has been placed on barbed wire used. in Australia is comparatively limited. No farmer or pastoralist ever puts up a six-wire fence entirely of barbed wire. for placing at the foot of dog-proof fences, or along the top of wire netting fences, whereas wire netting is used entirely for the whole length of a fence. Thousands of tons of wire netting is used for every few tons of barbed wire. I wish to impress upon the committee that we have a great national enemy to cope with. Although tlie rabbit is a very insignificant animal so far as size is concerned, he threatens to almost destroy the pastoral and farming industries. It is estimated that one pair of rabbits will in three years produce 13,000,000, and it would be interesting to calculate what that 13,000,000 would produce within the following three years. Rabbits are threatening to destroy the country, and I estimate that we shall require at least 50,000 to 100,000 miles of rabbit netting within the next few years. I do not suppose I should be much beyond the mark if I said 100,000 miles. Every pastoralist will find it necessary to rabbit-proof his run, and every farmer wfll have to similarly enclose his farm, so that it can easily be seen that my estimate is not an extravagant one. Putting the cost of this fencing at the modest amount of Â£ 2 0 per mile, 50,000 miles would involve an expenditure of Â£1,000,000, and 100,000 miles would necesI am not, of course, sitate double that outlay. I hold country which I am seriously considering the advisability of abandoning within the next few years, owing to the depredations of the rabbits. The wire Retting industry is carried on chiefly in Sydney, where the ordinary galvanized wire is imported and woven into netting. This industry, which employs about 300 say that the firm of Lysaght men, has not asked for any special consideration, and has been carried on apparently at paying rates, during the free-trade period in. New South Wales. But even if special consideration were asked for, should that stand in the way of the great primary industry which is now having a life and death struggle with the rabbits 1 Wouldi t be possible for any manufacturer in the country to produce the 50,000 to 100,000 miles of wire-netting which will be needed in the immediate future 1 The New South Wales Parliament recently passed a Rabbit Act, by which fencing is almost compulsory, provision barbed wire. The quantity of being made to advance money for the purchase of the netting, and boards being appointed to see that the law is carried out. But the rabbit trouble is all over Australia, It is used and it is our first duty to consider the primary industries. I cannot imagine that this National Parliament will for a mere whim or for the sake of carrying out a certain policy, enhance the price of wire netting, and I hope that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will withdraw his proposal. that from the point of view of the principle of protection it seems hard to subject the makers of wire netting to open competition while giving to makers of barbed wire and similar commodities some degree of protection. But we must consider that in New South Wales-and I dare say in almost as great a degree in other States-there is now going on, and is likely to continue for some time, an almost life-and-death struggle between, not only the pastoralists, but also the smallest of the farmers in the central division, and the rabbits.",51,Pairs

The honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, believes in himself always, and under that benign influence, he, too, often goes straight. But what shall we say of the Ministers of New South Wales, who allowed barbed wire to have the benefit of protection, and will not extend a helping hand when a Victorian member in a chivalrous spirit proposes to help a distressed New South Wales industiy ?

Lysaght Bros, can have is that the three New South Wales Ministers have not stood up for the "" great national policy,"" as the Minister for Customs has stood up for it in connection' with South Australia. There must have been a Cabinet fight over this matter. Surely, the New South Wales Ministers would make a fight for a New South Wales industry? Here we have a Tariff which proposes to tax the people right and left, on every article they eat and wear, and these articles are almost as important as wire netting to people with small wages and large families. A policy placing duties of 100 per cent, on hats, boots, and shoes, was agreed to by the Cabinet, but they cannot afford to put 1 per cent, on wire netting in order to keep afloat a ""great industry "" in New South Wales. So far as the protectionists of New South Wales are concerned, they have been badly served; but our protectionist friends have, I admit, served the free-trader of New South Wales and the national interests of that State. I know it is a sham to talk about mailing things cheaper by imposing a tax. The Ministry know it is a sham in regard to wire netting, and hence we find wire netting on the' free list. remarks from the leader of the Opposithe attention of the committee should be tion, I may say I refrained from debating directed to the position in which we find the general subject of free-trade and protection, because if that course be taken on every item, we shall never get through the Tariff with a reasonable degree of celerity. So far as I am concerned, I have never attempted to persuade the people that the imposition of protective duties will make things cheaper, at any rate not for a very considerable time. I believe the result, especially in regard to those industries not established in a large way, is to make articles, dearer until the industry is sufficiently established to serve the whole of the needs of the consumers in the Commonwealth. There has been no equivocation so far as I am concerned in this connection. If there is sufficient internal production, we can frequently in specific cases, get the article cheaper than the article that is imported. But I do not wish to discuss the question of free-trade and protection. stage to do it . convenient stage so far as I am personally concerned, because I have all along made my position perfectly clear. Buti t is exceedingly inconvenient to open up the whole question from an argumentative stand-point upon almost every item of the Tariff. _ Of course the leader of the Opposition is not aware of the extent to which the general debating power of the Chamber has been carried in this connection. I think that we ought to confine ourselves for the most part to the question immediately at issue. this matter, I have previously explained why the Government originally intended to place _ wire netting upon the free list. We have already disposed of the idea that there was any foundation in fact for the suggestion that we desired to accord to the industries of one State different treatment from that meted out to the industries of another.

Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I desire to state the reasons why I shall not support the Government upon the item under discussion. I consider that if we place wire netting upon the free list, we shall be doing a very great injustice to those who require it, and we know that a very large quantity of it will be required in the near future. We have also the statement that the Lysaghts themselves do not require the aid of this duty. I do not believe that they need it . The firm started here at a time when large orders for wire netting were being placed upon the market by Queensland. They must have made large profits then, and I have strong doubt as to whether they are losing now. The industry is one which can stand by itself, and I will not support the imposition of a duty in cases where it is not required. Mr G. B. .EDWARD S (South Sydney). I think that the Government occupy a very peculiar position in regard to this item. Wheni t is plainly stated that there is no other purpose in view than that of protecting an industry, irrespective of the revenue to be derived from the tax imposed, it is quite clear that there is nothing else to do but to vote against the proposal of the Government. To my mind the result which has been arrived at is a clear victory for the free-trade party. pears to me very plain, from the statements made by the Minister for Trade and Customs, and from the speech of the Minister for Home Affairs, that this matter was not pressed upon the Cabinet by those gentleorder in referring to what may have taken men. 26 F 2 ber is not in order in discussing that matter. member got his remark in. ception to that observation.

I admit, however, that tlie existence of the industry here alters the position to a certain extent.

381,Mr Poynton (South Australia),"Iwhere not an acre could be used for wheat growing until the land had been fenced with vermin-proof netting. That state of things exists nearly all over the northern portion of South Austialia, and the cost of this fencing is equal to an increase of rental of from 2d. to 3d. per acre. A great deal of the netting used in South Australia has been imported from New South Wales,* but we have frequently been unable to obtain all we require from that State, and on two occasions the Government had to import wire netting from England, so that the selectors might be able to obtain profitable crops. point out the very serious effect of doing anything to increase the price of wire netting. Honourable members who have not followed closely the politics of New South Wales may, perhaps, not be aware that the rabbit pest has spread through the western pastoral division of that State into the more settled districts of the central division, which two or three years ago were considered to be too thickly populated to admit of the rabbits ever becoming a pest there. During last year, however, the farmers in many parts of the country have lost very heavily through the depredation of rabbits. Experience shows that the only solution of the dilficulty is to fence in the individual holdings, and to enforce the general and compulsory destruction of rabbits. In its efforts to deal with this question, the part of it . New South Wales Government has leased scrub lands infested with rabbits for long terms, on condition that the holdings shall be enclosed with vermin-proof fences within a specified time, and that the rabbits shall be exterminated. It has been found, however, that some special assistance must be given to residents in the older settled districts, because many of them are not in a position to protect themselves. During the last session of the State Parliament an Act was passed empowering the Government to establish boards, and to place funds at their disposal for the purpose of advancing money to settlers on easy terms, to enable them to enclose their holdings. It is a primary necessity that wire netting should be supplied as cheaply as possible, and if the cost of fencing is increased, a great injury, which will assume national proportions, will be done to the settlers of New South Wales. I trust that the committee will reject this proposal. duty which will impose a heavy tax upon Queensland. It would almost seem as if the honourable member for Melbourne Ports had Singled Queensland out for special attention, but I can assure him that we do not need his favours. Our people are not protectionists run mad, as the residents of Victoria seem to be. Rabbit boards have been formed in Queensland, and have been granted large sums of money by the Government in order to secure the erection of rabbitproof fences along the borders of the State, and if a duty is imposed on wire-netting, the cost of carrying out this work will be greatly increased, and the burdens of the people will be added to. Furthermore, there are many selections which have been taken up in Western and Central Western Queensland, on the condition that they shall be enclosed with rabbit-proof fencing, and the holders of these leases will feel the proposed tax very severely. Some honourable members have claimed that the imposition of a duty will lead to an increased production of wire netting within the Commonwealth. We could not get all the wire netting that we required from New South Wales, and had to go to England and Germany for additional supplies. In New South Wales, I understand that tlie local supply is by no means equal to the daily increasing demand in that Sta!:e alone. and if the wire netting cannot be produced within the Commonwealth, the duty must increase the cost of the netting. I hope every representative of Queensland will join with me in resisting this attempt to impose a cruel and unjust tax upon the people of that State. I desire to direct the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs to the fact that, according to the laws of South Australia, ajid, I believe, those of other States, Crown lessees are compelled to destroy vermin on their holdings, and that the only way in which they can effectually do that is by using wire netting and barbed wire. Further than that, the Minister himself succeeded in passing an Act under which, in certain vermin-infested districts, the landowners are not only compelled to destroy the vermin, but to erect vermin-proof fences.",57,Pairs

Western Australia, as in other States, the necessity for the use of wire netting is growing.' There was a report recently that rabbits had made their appearance on our borders, and that it was necessary to at once take measures to prevent their encroaching upon our territory. The Government now have to face a large expenditure in that direction, and the imposition of a duty on wire netting will prove to be a serious matter to settlers generally. I know from my short experience in Victoria, that the necessity for the use of wire netting is becoming greater every day, and we should be inflicting a great injustice on the community generally, and particularly on settlers, if we imposed this duty. arguments used in support of the claims of the consumers of wire netting have been sufficiently strong to show that the article should be retained on the free list, and I shall, certainly oppose the amendment. Amendment negatived. honourable member desires to propose a new duty, we shall ask the committee to proceed to the consideration of the exemptions. direct the attention of the Government to the machines which are intended to take the place of hand type-setting. It is rather a misnomer to call them type-setting machines, because they do not set type, neither do they cast it in the ordinary sense. The linotype, the monoline, and the monotype, are three of the machines at present in use, and they are of a similar character, sis far as their effect is concerned ; but the linotope and the monotype are on the free list. Type for ordinary hand composition is subject to a duty of 20 per cent., as it is included under "" N . E . I . , "" which come in ostensibly as literature, but whilst machines, which come into competition with the ordinary type for hand composition are to be admitted free. That does not seem to give a fair chance to hand type-setting against machines. I do not wish to see any particular favour shown to the compositors who work by hand, but there certainly should be no handicap placed upon them. passed ? amongst the exemptions it will be subject to a duty. to put type amongst the exemptions. tion to the necessity of having something like an equitable arrangement as between type and machines which take the place of type. Further, I should like to direct attention to a difficulty which presents itself if a tax, or, at any rate, a high tax, is placed on the various things which printers are compelled to use. It is apparent that for many years, or, at any rate, for some years, very few of these things can be locally manufactured in sufficient quantities to bring the price down to a parity with that obtaining outside the Commonwealth.' Local printers, when tendering or quoting for the publication of books within the Commonwealth, will be at a disadvantage as compared with German or American printers, who are willing to quote for works which come into the Commonwealth free, and which none of us desire to see taxed in any shape. These are, it may be, medical works, scientific works, or ordinary works of fiction. A t present a considerable and increasing number of these are published locally, and it would not be fair to offer a premium to any person requiring the publication of such works to go to America or Germany. I know that in Sydney travellers and representatives of firms in those countries are quoting for all classes of printing, and in quite a number of instances large jobs of ordinary book work and advertisements have gone abroad. I admit the Government have made some attempt to assist local manufacturers so far as advertising matter is concerned, but that attempt, I take it , will be comparatively ineffective. There are magazines, such as the Strand and Pearson's, and quite a number of others, which are sometimes loaded with advertisements to the extent of two-thirds of their total contents. The Treasurer shakes his head, but as a purchaser of such books every month, I am certain that a good deal more than half is made up of advertisements.

If they impose a revenue duty of, say, 5 per cent., I shall not object. But I could not agree to a duty of 10 per cent, or more on the things which printers use, and the using of which will place them at a disadvantage with foreign competitors. In addition to that, it would be improper to make any distinction in the rate of taxation between machines and the type which is necessary to hand composition. The two ought to be at least on a parity.

Further inquiries, however, have satisfied us that these articles are being made to a considerable extent within the Commonwealth, and hence we are quite prepared to rectify our mistake. admitting mistakes. pared to admit a mistake whenever I niake one. The charges levied against Ministers by the honourable member are very unfair. If we had done the right thing in our own interests, we should not have attempted whilst the House was in session, and whilst we were administering new departments, the task of framing a Tariff. I repeat that -whenever, as the result of further information, Ministers ascertain that they have made a mistake, they intend to frankly acknowledge it aud ask the committee to rectify it . I care not who criticises our action, because it is the proper course to adopt in the interests of the Commonwealth > Mr G. B.

It seems recognise this fact if they intended toI do not see what justiimpose a duty upon any of these articles. I should like the Government to put a revenue duty of 10 per cent, upon bolts, nuts, washers, and rivets. I am aware that a duty of 15 per cent, has been placed upon bolts and nuts, but I think that that is too heavy a duty to place upon washers and If the black iron washer rivets. In placing a duty upon thesearticles, we must take care that thej are r adequately described, because they enter into the manufacture of all sorts of other articles, and it may happen that in assisting the very small factories which are engaged in making them, we may hamper very much larger industries. Rivets are used in the making of waterproof clothing, in the making of boots, and in the making of a great number of other things. It seems to me that we should give more consideration to the question of obtaining revenue, and so A t the time long as a duty is light and will not hamperthe industry upon which it is imposed, I shall be ready to vote for it. If the honorable member for Melbourne will alter his amendment so as to make the proposed duty upon rivets and washers 10 per cent., I shall be ready to support it . we have had no information as to the amount of revenue likely to be returned by a duty of 10, 15, or 20 per cent, upon these articles, we must regard the amendment as a proposal to impose a protective duty. I think, however, that I am right in stating that in the Victorian Tariff there I am prewas no duty upon washers or rivets, whether made of iron or copper, and that, notwithstanding that fact, they have been made hei-e successfully.
