Particular initiatives have been directed towards the tourist industry and the public sector and new initiatives have been planned in the mining industry, remote communities and in the transport, banking, insurance and retail industries. The DAA has in past years provided funds to local government authorities for Special Works Projects which give employment opportunities to Aboriginals. The requirement that preference will be given to authorities that are willing to provide opportunities for permanent employment has led to the creation of a substantial number of new jobs for Aboriginals. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs currently provides $3.32Im for Special Works Projects to local governments, private employers and Aboriginal organisations for employment of Aboriginals. Overall this financial year, the DAA has made available $11.2m to State Governments and Aboriginal organisations for employment projects such as Community Development Employment Projects and Special Works Projects.
