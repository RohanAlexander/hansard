They are as follows:1.

It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to bo used to protect the covenants of the League. 3. The members of the League agree, further, that they w i ll mutually support one another iu the financial and economic measures which are taken under this article, in order to minimize the loss and inconvenience resulting from the above measures, and that tbey w i ll mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the members of the League which are cooperating to protect the covenants of the League. At this stage some confusion occurs in the record, a confusion which has led to a good deal of public controversy, and It will be seen from the language of obligation at all, but confers upon the An examination of the language of tion, the imposition of military sanctions It would seem that the boycott provisions are intended to be automatic; whereas tbe military provisions, since there the Council has only a power to recommend, are not. The automatic character of economic sanctions under article 16 has, however, produced much discussion ever since the early days of the League. It was felt by many members of the League that the cause of peace might in certain cases be better served by less drastic sanctions than those indicated by the language of the articles, and that in any event any policy of sanctions must possess a collective character if it were to succeed. Attempts were therefore early made to devise some workable machinery for the implementation of the article. These attempts were in 1921 crystallized into a series of resolutions adopted by the Assembly on the 4th October of that year. The 1921 meeting was the second assembly of the League, and it adopted certain amendments of the Covenant, one of which wasI t is for the Council to give an opinion, whether or not a breach of the Covenant has taken place'.

These proposed amendments were ratified by Great Britain and Australia audi ma'ny other countries but not by a sufficient number of countries to enable them to be as yet effective as amendments of the Covenant. At the time, however, of the' adoption of these proposed amendments, it was resolved unanimously that, pending their formal ratification, they should constitute rules for' guidance,and that in addition certain resolutions as to the procedure to be followed trader article 16 should be put into force I will, with the permission of the House, have-recorded in Hansard the ful l text of article 16 with the proposed amendments thereof and the resolutions concerning the economic weapon adopted by the Assembly on the 4th October, 1921. Leave granted. purpose it is sufficient to refer t'o the more important of the resolutions. Resolution 3 saysa. The unilateral action of the defaulting State cannot create a state of war: it merely entitles the other members of the League to icsort to acts of Avar or to declare themselves in a state of war with the Covenantbreaking State: but it is in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant that the League of Nations should attempt, at least, at the outset,to avoid war, and to restore peace by economic pressure. Resolution 4 says4. It is the duty of each member of the League to decide for itself whether a breach of the Covenant has been committed. The fulfilment of their duties under article 1C is required from members of the League by the express terms of the Covenant, and they cannot neglect them without breach of tbeir Treaty obligations. Resolution 5 provides for the reference of all cases of breach of Covenant under article 16 to the Coivhcil, and resolution 6 provides for the circulation of the minutes of the Council meeting if that btidy is of opinion that a State has been guilty of a breach of Covenant. Resolution 7 provides for the setting up of a technical committee for the purpose of assisting the Council to enforce article 16. Resolution 8 indicates that the : Member Sta'te uponwhom somehardship rnigh't be inflicted by providing that'(fi) If it is thought desii-aible to postpone, wholly or partially in the case of certain States, the effective application of the economic sanctions laid down in article 10, such postponement shall not. be permitted except hi so far as it is desirable for the success of the common plan of action, or reduces to a minimum the losses and embarrassments which may be entailed in the case of certain members of the League by the application of the sanctions. Resolution 18 provides thatIn special circumstances and in support of economic measures to betaken, it may become advisable: (a) to establish an effective blockade of the seaboard of the covenantbreaking State; (6) to entrust to some members of the League the execution of the blockade operations. The procedure of the League of Nations during the last three weeks has been based upon these resolutions which, as I have said, represent an attempt to give a fully workable character to the provisions of the Covenant. I may, perhaps, be pardoned if I pause to emphasize two points. The first is that the member's of the League have, without destroying the absolute nature of the obligation to impose sanctions, provided for a means of co-ordination which can, as in the present case, lead to the imposition of special or modified sanctions. The second is that a blockade, stated somewhat baldly in article 16, is accurately treated as the kind of sanction which can be invoked only by special circumstances. At this stage I return to my brief chronicle of events. On the 11th October a committee of all members other than the combatants and the dissenting members was set up to co-ordinate the measures to be taken in discharge of the obligations under article 16. This committee has been known as the Sanctions Co-ordination Committee. This committee, I am advised, is not an instrument of the Council or of the Assembly, but is in substance a conference of League members to assist them in carrying out their obligations tinder article 16. Its decisions are in a sense recommendations to governments and therefore the rules as to",23,Paibs
13,Mr Menzies,"Eo r the presentmianimity do not apply. It would be a mistake, however, to assume that because this committee is merely making recommendations its decisions may at will be ignored by Australia. Whati t is doing is to make recommendations to us as to when and how and in relation to what specific matters our obligations should he discharged. If we do not care to accept its recommendations, we are not thereby released from our obligations; if we refuse to come into line with other countries on the special non-military measures and means suggested, the only result is that we are remitted to our oblithe Covenant of the League of Nations. gations under the article in their absolute and unqualified sense. Honourable members will therefore at once see that while we have an effective voice through our representative on the committee, our freedom to accept or reject the ultimate recommendation of the committee, so far as it relates to economic sanctions, is nominal rather than real. Each of the sanctions provided for in the bill which I now have the honour to submit has been, in fact, recommended by the Coordination Committee and accepted by the Government of Australia and by the governments of many other members of the League. According to the latest advices received to-day the countries which have replied to the League regarding their willingness to apply sanctions arc more numerous than have been indicated in newspaper reports, and the position now is as follows:-No. 1, "" Arms Embargo "", 4.1 countries; No. 2, "" Financial sanctions"", 29 countries; No. 3, ""Imports of Italian goods"", 27 countries; and No. 4, ""Exports of Raw Materials to Italy "", 26 countries. May I now turn aside to glance at one or two criticisms which have recently been made of the efficacy of the League of Nations and of the policy of sanctions. It has been said, and by no one more forcefully than by my honourable friend, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr only of the attitude of this Government Curtin), that the absence of the United States of America, Germany and Japan horn the League has fundamentally altered the whole basis of the Covenant and rendered it no longer a binding obligation. As to this, I desire to point out to the House that the Covenant has never laeen denounced by any member of the League, that the resolutions of 1921 have never been repudiated by any of the governments concerned, and that at the meeting at Locarno on 16th October, 1925, the continued existence of article 16 and its obligations was clearly admitted by the most important members of the League. On that occasion the representatives of Great Britain, Belgium, France, Italy, Czechoslovakia and Poland delivered to Germany a collective note regarding article 16 in these termsThe German delegation has requested certain explanations in regard to article 16 of We are not in a position to speak in the name of the League, but in view of the. discussions which have already taken place in the Assembly and in the commissions of the League of Nations, and after the explanations which have been exchanged between ourselves, we do not hesitate to inform you of the interpretation which, in so far as we are concerned, we place upon article 1G. In accordance with that interpretation the obligations resulting from the said article on the members of the League must be understood to mean that each State member of the League is bound to co-operate loyally and effectively in support of the Covenant and in resistance to any act of aggression to an extent which is compatible with its military situation and takes its; geographical position into account. It is interesting to remember that, at the time of the declaration, Germany was, as it is to-day, outside the League; Japan was in the League, but Russia was not; America was, of course, outside the League but is, if I may say so, clearly more sympathetic with the ideals of the League to-day than it was then. In short, the League as a League is to-day not less strong than it was in 1925 when the declaration to Germany was made at Locarno. I may add, as a fact not without significance, that the signatory for Italy in 1925 was Benito Mussolini, and that Abyssinia was then, largely as a result of Italian advocacy, a member of the League and is still a member. It has also been said, in criticism not but also of the attitude of my honourable and learned friend, the member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) that "" sanctions mean war"", and that to fail to recognize this is a symptom of intellectual obliquity. The advocates of this view have cast around them for some authority, and have relied upon a statement made by no less eminent a lawyer than Sir John Latham. May I read to the House the full text of Sir John Latham'3 view on this point as it appears at pages 21 and 22 of the recently published Proceedings of the Australian and New Zealand Society of International Law. He saysArticle' 10 of the Covenant of the League contains the well-known provision for economic sanctions. For a num'her of years this article was regarded as a substitute for war. It is now being realized, however, that the application of economic sanctions is not a substitute for war. It is really an act of war. Any one who remembers the nature and the effect of the Allied blockade of the Central Powers in the Great War will hardly deny that a blockade is definitely an act of war. The prohibition of economic and other intercourse must involve, in many cases, if it is to be effective, the establishment of a blockade. Accordingly it must be realized that when it is proposed that the provisions of article 1(1 should be put into operation the decision which a government has to take is just the same decision as it has to take when the question is one of a declaration of war. The responsibility upon Ministers is the same in one case as in the other. If the prohibition of intercourse is to be real and it it is resisted, then tion of economic sanctions where they are the governments applying the sanctions must be prepared to see the matter through by the application of physical force. article 16 docs not abolish the risk of war. It only regularizes a particular method of warfare which in some cases may turn out to be very effective without the institution of actual fighting operations. It cannot, however, be regarded as a guarantee against the possibility of warlike operations,. It will be seen that the point that the learned author is making is that the decision to impose sanctions is one of great gravity, and that a resistance to economic sanctions may very well involve the application of physical force. This is undeniably true, but it is also true that in such a case the imposition-of sanctions will have produced war not because of the inherent character of sanctions but because there has been a subsequent act of warlike aggression by the country against whom the sanctions are enforced. Let me remind honourable members opposite of an illustration furnished by Mr A. B. Piddington, who pointed out that it was just as foolish to blame a court of law for violence because somebody chose to shoot a bailiff when he was executing a warrant as to charge Australia with committing an act of war because it co-operated in the imposition of sanctions in terms of the Mr Menzies. League Covenant. A method of coercion which is in its nature non-violent does not assume the character of violence simply because it may, in the case of a foolish or desperate opponent, lead to acts of physical aggression on his part. I adopt the language of Dr. R. L . Buell, Research Director of the Foreign Policy Association of America, who, writing in 1932, saidA fundamental distinction has always been made between non-violent and violent methods of coercion. Every government in the world prohibits the use of violence in disputes between labour and capital, but dearly every government in the world authorizes labour to strike and to organize boycotts against capital. Mahatma Gandhi is the leading pacifist in the world; but Gandhi has organized a boycott against the British Government for the purpose of securing independence. Now there is no difference iu principle between a labour strike or a boycott, and international sanctions. Both arc non-violent methods of coercion, directed toward a social purpose. I also point out to the House that if we are to reject any proposal for the imposidesigned to serve the broad and humane purpose of keeping the -world's peace by Accordingly, making it unprofitable and inconvenient to go to war, we shall be in a poor position to affirm our right to impose customs prohibitions of an exactly similar character where they are designed to serve our own domestic ends. If the remote possibility of armed resistance is to deter us from taking economic measures against an aggressor, we may as well at once admit that the Covenant of the League is futile, that the League itself is no more than an academic debating society, and that we have abandoned the principle of collective security in order to return to that un' happy state in which each nation fears its neighbour and the rivalry of arms goes on unchecked and uncontrolled. I shall now deal very briefly with the principal provisions of the bill. Honourable members will note that in clause 2 we have defined Italy as including all of the colonies and possessions of Italy as well as the kingdom itself, In the same clause we have inserted a definition of the expression ""during the present war "" for the purpose of clause 6 which gives power to prohibit imports and exports "" during the present war."" The principal clauses imposing, or giving the Governor General in Council power to impose, sanctions are clauses 4 and 6. Paragraphs a to / inclusive of sub-clause 1 prohibit the making of payments to the Government of Italy or to public authorities or persons or corporations in Italy, and also prohibit other financial transactions to, or for the benefit of, or in the interests of, Italy. These provisions are designed to give effect to Proposal II . of the sanctions proposal by the Co-ordination Committee. It will be noticed from sub-clau3e 6 of this clause that the sanctions contained in paragraphs a to / of sub-clause 1 do not come into force until a date to be fixed by proclamation. Upon the subject of the date from which these sanctions will, as regards Australia, come into force, it may be mentioned that the ^Commonwealth Government has informed the League of Nations that it will be prepared to put these sanctions into force upon such date as is suggested by the Co-ordination Committee, not being earlier than fourteen days from the 31st October. period of time is necessary to enable the Commonwealth Government to make the necessary arrangements throughout Australia to give effect to the sanctions. It will be noticed that by paragraph g of sub-clause 1 of clause 4 power is taken to prescribe certain other acts, the doing of which in the interests or on behalf of Italy is prohibited. It is not practicable at the moment to say what other financial and economic sanctions may be found necessary in the near future, and this paragraph has been inserted to provide, if need be, for such further sanctions. Any such sanctions would be prescribed by regulation, which must be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament within fifteen sitting days, and may be disallowed by either House. It may be interesting, to honorabie members to know that in Great Britain these sanctions are being imposed by Order in Council made under the Treaty of Peace Act 1919, and that in New Zealand a short act has been passed authorizing in general terms the application of sanctions by Order in Council. It will be noted that while the effect of clause 4 is to prohibit the making of payments or the establishing of credits, the clause does not aim at the extinction of the liability. That liability will continue to exist, but its discharge will 'be suspended during the operation of the imposition of sanctions. The attention of honourable members is also drawn to the provisions of clause 6 of the bill under which the Government seeks power to prohibit by regulation during the present war between Italy and Abyssinia, the exportation or importation of any goods. This power is sought for the purpose of enabling the Commonwealth to give effect to the sanctions contained in Proposals III . and IV . of the Co-ordination Committee. It is possible that the powers which the Governor General in Council has under the existing customs law are sufficient to empower the Government to do what is proposed under this clause; but the Government has thought it wise to proceed by way of a special bill in order to give the Parliament a full opportunity to discuss the measures proposed. Although it has not been necessary to include any express provision dealing This with the matter, honourable members will recall that the recommendation of the Sanctions Co-ordination Committee in relation to the prohibition of importation expressly excepted goods en route at the time of the imposition of the prohibition, but it also provided that goods the subject of existing contracts should not otherwise be excepted from the prohibition. When regulations are made under clause 6 effect will be given to these principles. It will be noted from clause 3 that the provisions of this bill, with the exception of those relating to the importation and exportation of goods, are applied to our external territories, Papua, New Guinea and Norfolk Island. Generally the laws of those territories provide that Commonwealth laws shall not apply to those territories unless expressed so to apply. The object of clause 3 is to make it clear that the provisions of the bill when enacted will apply to those territories. The provisions relating to the importation and exportation of good? have been excepted from application to the territories for the reason that the measures proposed in relation to the importation or exportation of goods to or from those territories may generally be taken under the existing laws of the territories without the passage of any other legislation. By clause 9 of the bill power is taken to suspend by proclamation the operation of clause 4 should circumstances render that course desirable. By clause 10 of the bill power is taken to terminate by proclamation the operation of the measure at any time when the Governor General is of opinion that the necessity for its continuance no longer exists. The remaining previsions of the bill are merely the usual supplementary provisions. mention. cance of sub-clause 2 of Clause 4? member will see, the prohibitions under Clause4 are prohibitions except under licence. It might turn out that a number of individual Italian citizens in Australia may be in the habit of remitting small sums of money to Italy periodically, for example for the upkeep of their parents. come under tbe heading of "" humanitarian payments"" which are exempted from the application of sanctions adopted by the League of Nations. It would be a very cumbersome way of dealing with this matter if the persons concerned had to approach the Minister on each occasion for the issue of a licence. For this reason it is proposed to provide for the delegation of this power to certain authorized officers. Before leaving this matter, I should like to add a few words on a point which will have presented itself, not only to honourable members, but also to very many thousands of the general public. Many members of the League of Nations have not yet indicated their adherence to some of the proposed sanctions, though our information is that the numbers are being added to from day to day. Suppose, however, it turns out that important or essential members of the League are abstaining from the imposition of sanctions in such numbers or to such an extent as to convert the sanctions weapon from being one which is effective against Italy, into being one which is merely injurious to the sanctioning countries. these circumstances"" it is asked, ""where would Australia stand?"" My answer to this is to direct the attention of honourable should cease to be nobody's business and members to one large matter of principle and to two express provisions in this bill. The large matter of principle is that the whole policy of article 16 of the Covenant, as interpreted and openated under the Resolutions of 1921, is that action shall be collective and not individual. It follows from this that if other countries break their obligations under the Covenant, and those other countries are either of such economic importance or so numerous that the collective nature of the They do not call for special proposed sanctions is substantially destroyed, then the countries willing to impose sanctions would 'be at perfect liberty to reconsider their own position. Indeed, the League itself will obviously take cognizance of this point, for its meeting to-day is called to consider the answers given by Member States and to fix a date as from which sanctions shall apply. In this present bill, as I have already pointed out, there is one set of provisions, the effect of which is to Such sums would delay the coming into operation of the bill until the Governor General has decided on the appropriate date. There is a provision in clause 9 which enables the Governor General, even after the coming into operation of the bill, to suspend clause 4, w hile there would, of T course, be an unfettered right to repeal or alter regulations made under any other clause.

It has been said repeatedly on behalf of both Great Britain, and Australia that action taken to support the Covenant must be combined action and not sporadic or individual action.

In deliberations on this question in the Council the votes of Members of the League alleged to have resorted to war and of Members against whom such action wax directed shall not be counted. 3. The Council will notify to all Members of the League the date which it recommends for the application of the economic pressure under this article. 4. Nevertheless, the Council may, in the case of particular Members, postpone the coming into force of any of these measures for a specified period where it is satisfied that such a postponement will facilitate the attainment of the object of the measures referred to in the preceding paragraph, or that it is necessary in order to minimize the loss and inconvenience which will be caused to such Members. 5. It shall be the duty of the Oouncil to recommend to the several governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the Covenants of the League. 6. The Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this article, in order to minimize the loss and inconvenience resulting from the above measures, and that they w ill mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the Covenant-breaking State, and that they w ill take the necessary steps to afford passage through .their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating to protect the Covenants of the League. 7.

The unilateral action of the defaulting State cannot create a state of war: it merely untitles the other members of the League to resort to acts of war or to declare themselves in a state of war with the Covenant-breaking State; but it is in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant that the League of Nations should attempt, at least at the outset, to avoid war, aud to restore peace by economic pressure. 4. It is the duty of each member of the League to decide for itself whether a breach of the Covenant has been committed. The fulfilment of their duties under article 1(3 is' required from members of the League by the express terms of the Covenant, and they cannot neglect them without breach of their treaty obligations. 5. All cases of breach of Covenant under article 10 shall be referred to the Council as a matter of urgency at the request of any member of the League. Further, if a breach of Covenant be committed, or if there arise a danger of such breach being committed, the Secretary-General shall at once give notice thereof to all the members of the Council. Upon receipt of such a request by a member of the League, or of such a notice by the Secretary-General, the Council w ill meet as soon as possible. The Council shall summon representatives of the parties to the conflict and of all States which arc neighbours of the defaulting State, or which normally maintain close economic relations with it , or whose co-operation would be especially valuable for the application of article 10. 0. If the Council is of opinion that a State has been guilty of a breach of Covenant, the minutes of the meeting at which that opinion is arrived at shall be iniinediately sent to a l l members of the League, accompanied by a statement of reasons and by an invitation to take action accordingly.

This committee, which will remain in permanent session as soon as the action decided on is taken, may include, if desirable, representatives of the States specially affected. 8. The Council shall recommend the date on which the enforcement of economic pressure, under article IB, is to be begun and shall give notice of that date to all the members of the League. 9. All States must be treated alike as regards the application of the measures of economic pressure, with the following reservations:(a) It may be necessary to recommend the execution of special measures by certain States.

Bill brought up, and read a first time. Trade and Customs) [5.2] -by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. This is a bill. to approve the sugar agreement made on the 19th July last between the Governments of the Commonwealth and Queensland whereunder, for five years as from the 1st September, 1936, (a) the prohibition of imports of foreign sugar is to continue; (b) the present selling prices for sugar, golden syrup and treacle required for Australian consumption are to remain; (c) the contribution by the sugar industry to the fruit industry is to be increased from £200,000 to £216,000 per annum; (d) the conditions applicable to the wholesale discount are to be amended with the object of creating fair competition' between wholesale merchants and also amongst all classes of retailers; and (e) other usual conditions of previous sugar agreements will be continued. The unprecedented volume of antisugar agreement propaganda, especially during the last few months, largely based on misrepresentation of the facts, renders it necessary that more than usual attention should be given to acomprehensive review of the Government's sugar policy and the merits of the Australian sugar industry. I may say, however, that the principal critics are well-known free trade organizers, who no doubt would as readily deny protection to other Australian industries. Of course, differences of opinion can prevail as to the advisability and the best means of protecting this industry. There are those who believe that sugar production should be left to black labour in foreign countries, thus enabling Australia to buy at world parity prices. In fact, it is the difference between the price of foreign raw sugar grown by coloured labour and the retail price of refined sugar in the capital cities of Australia, on which the most rabid critics base their case. Others may desire that Kanaka labour should be re-introduccd into Australia to bring down the price, while among those who sincerely 'to the extent of protection required. The history of the sugar industry shows that nothing except an embargo, which has been the policy for the last twenty years, will suffice adequately to protect aud stabilize it, in view of the violent fluctuation of overseas raw sugar prices, while the sugar agreement which accompanies the embargo, enables consumers to be safeguarded when world prices are high. From a .modest beginning on a commercial basis in 1866, the production of sugar-cane and raw sugar in Australia developed for many years under Kanaka labour in practically open competition with foreign producers. A vital condition of federation, however, was ths enforcement of the White Australia policy, and the new Commonwealth undertook to protect the industry on a white-labour basis. The transition to white labour took some years. After that, the industry gradually progressed until the climax was reached in 1933, when 4,600,000 tons of sugar cane weTe produced from approximately 325,000 acres of cultivated land, of which some 240,000 acres were harvested. Tho resultant output of raw sugar that year was 667,000 tons, valued at over £11,000,000. The approximate personnel in both the sugar-growing States isfarmers 9,000, field workers 6,000, cane cutters 8,000, mill employees 6,500 and miscellaneous workers 1,100. There are also 1,700 refinery employees in five States, making a total of 32,300 persons directly engaged, and representing a population of probably 100,000 persons. In addition, there arc estimated to be 60,000 people in the sugar belt whose living solely depends upon the continuance of the sugar industry; for example, tradespeople, carters, railway men, waterside workers and many others, together with their families. The present method of protecting the sugar industry commenced in July, 1915, when the Commonwealth Government made the first agreement with the Queensland, Government. This agreement expressly said that its objects were "" to deal with the most serious position that had arisen -with regard both to the",31,Sugar Agreement Bill 1935
20,Mr White (Balaclava,"Minister forsugar industry in Queensland and to the sugar supplies for the whole of the Commonwealth, by those governments cooperating for the benefit of. consumers and the protection of those engaged in the sugar industry"". At tliat time, the world war was causing great havoc with European beet sugar production, which ultimately fell to 25 per cent, of its normal output. Rationing of supplies was commencing in some of the belligerent nations. In Australia, however, production was then much less than local requirements. In order to avoid shortage of supplies and high prices to consumers, the new government-control fixed maximum prices for Australian sugar and prohibited all exports. It also concentrated on purchasing whatever foreign sugar was necessary, and was much helped in securing delivery of that sugar by its war-time control of shipping. From 1915 to early in 1921, and again in 1923 and 1924, the Government's sugar agreement policy saved consumers some millions of pounds, and was so effective that Australia was one of the very few nations that did not have to endure sugar shortages and severe rationing. For part of the time, Australia enjoyed much the lowest-priced sugar in the world, and this led to phenomenal exports of high sugarcontent goods such as jam and condensed in ilk. Since 1924, however, the world's freemarket price of sugar has steadily fallen. During the last five years it has been, according to recognized authorities, far below the cost of e(ven the most efficientlyby means of import duties, consumption produced sugar in native-labour countries such as Java, where wages are as low as lOd. for men and 4d. for women and children for a day of twelve hours, or in Cuba, where even the former low wages have been virtually replaced by bare sustenance allowances, and where the country has passed through several periods of violence and revolution. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that recent sugar agreements hafte operated for the very substantial benefit of the producers; that is, if one is fair as well as theoretically correct in calculating the cost to the community as being the excess of the Australian price over the world's free-market price. On this particular basis, the latest authoritative estiSouth Africa have sugar agreements, or mate of the excess cost of Australian Mr White. sugar is that of Professor Giblin, who determined it last January at £5,100,000 per annum. Of course, should the coming international sugar conference in London succeed in restoring the free-market price to a remunerative level for the principal black-labour countries, this excess cost will be considerably reduced. Eight previous sugar agreements have been concluded by four different governments, representing every political party in the federal arena. The agreement has been renewed by the Lyons Government for the ninth time, because the agreement plan has been proved by Australian experience during the last twenty years to be the most effective arrangement for all interests concerned. World free-market sugar prices have fluctuated enormously during those years, having gone as high as £137 a ton for raw sugar and as low recently as £4 a ton. Obviously, the customs tariff method of protection, under such circumstances, would result in alternating periods of excessive prices to consumers and insufficient returns to producers, thus destroying any stability in the sugar industry and in .the many other industries in which sugar is an important raw material. Contrary to a current opinion in Australia, government control of sugar is not confined to this country. Almost every sugar-producing nation in the world protects the industry with fixed domestic prices much above the free-market price, taxes, and/or bounties. The purely protective duties range from £10 10s. a ton to as high at £51 a ton, converted to Australian currency. In some countries excise duties or consumption taxes are imposed, some for ordinary revenue purposes and others to raise money for payment of a direct bounty to the local producers. Straight-out embargoes and government price-fixation exist in Denmark, Sweden and Latvia; and many prohibitive customs duties are, of course, virtual embargoes in themselves and, therefore, raise no revenue for the government. Several European nations-for example, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Ireland-and similar machinery whereby the Government fixes local selling prices and also the prices to be paid to growers and sugar mills, as is done in Australia. The United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Holland pay bounties to local producers. The extent of the total effective State assistance rendered to the sugar producers of certain countries by the cumulative effect of tariffs, bounties, remissions of excise, and price-fixation is indicated in the following table extracted from the annual report of the British Sugar Beet Society for 1934-35:£ per annum. United States of America .. 43,500,000 Germany Prance 12,000,000 United Kingdom Czechoslovakia. Italy Australia . . Holland 2,500,000 In the United States of America a bounty is paid on both cane and beet sugar, the funds for which are raised through a processing tax on all sugar consumed. In Germany, France, and Czechoslovakia the prices are fixed by the governments as in Australia. In the United Kingdom there has been a bounty and some remission of excise duty on all beet sugar produced since the inception of the industry about eleven years ago. For the first five years the bounty on British beet sugar was no less than £19 10s. a ton, or a fraction over 2d. per lb. The Britisli bounty, however, is now being reduced to a much smaller amount. In Italy there is a very high customs duty and also a consumption tax. The beet sugar industry in Holland is assisted by a bounty, the money for which is raised by special taxes. Apart from sugar, the principle of a home-consumption price is being increasingly observed both here and abroad in regard to other commodities. In Australia this principle is applied to sugar, butter, cheese, dried fruits, jam, canning and other factory fruits, and cotton, and is about to be applied to wheat. I suggest to honourable members who have been influenced by reckless propaganda that, if they wish to be consistent, or if they have any principles, they cannot support other schemes that benefit their particular States and oppose the protection of this industry. Incidentally, it should be remembered that the sugar agreement does no more than provide a home-consumption price for the quantity of sugar required for local use. I now come to the reasons actuating the Government in continuing the present prices for another five years. The first consideration was the financial position of the producers of sugar-cane and raw sugar. The last inquiry into the sugar industry was made by the Commonwealth Sugar Inquiry Committee of 1931. It issued two reports. The majority report indicated that the cost of production up to 1930 justified no reduction in the then retail price of 4^d. per lb., and the 34,000,000 minority report was that a reduction 7,000,000 equivalent to i d . per lb. could be made. 7,000,000 These opinions were based upon a cost of 6,000,000 efficient production of raw sugar fluctuat5,000,000 ing between £19 and £22 a ton. Since then, of course, the economic conditions have brought about lower wages in the sugar industry, and also lower costs of commodities required by sugar producers for their productive and living purposes. The Lyons Government secured, by voluntary agreement with the producers themselves, a reduction of the Australian price as from January, 1933, equivalent to i i . per lb. retail, which represented a loss of £1,250,000 per annum in the revenue of the sugar producers: Furthermore, the net return on the raw sugar exported has fallen appreciably. The result of these two factors is that the average return for all raw sugar last year was only £15 10s. 9d. a ton, which was found, on examination by the Government last February, to be definitely less than the present cost of efficient production, plus a reasonable return to farmers on their capital investment. The trend of the economic position of sugar producers is revealed by increasing liens on farmers' crops. Up to a few seasons ago, liens were held over relatively few crops, but the position has developed since 1932 in the following manner in respect of the 5,168 farms situated in the districts from Mackay to Mossraan:Year. Crop Liens. Percentage of all Farms. 1932 .. 3,102 60 1933 3,186 01 1934 .. 3,559 .. 69 The large and growing percentage of liens to all crops corresponds with the steady reduction of prices for raw sugar, which have been of the following order:Per Ton of Sugar. ment at current prices is fair and rea£ s. d. 1929 1930 .. . . 19 10 1 1931 1932 1933 1934 Proof of the soundness of the Government's calculations last February, when it announced the renewal of the agreement, was obtained in the annual report of the Queensland Commissioner of Taxes issued in August, 1935, where it was shown that, in regard to personal exertion income earned during the year ended the 30th June, 1934, that is, the year when tbe average price of all raw sugar wa3 £16 3s. 6d. a ton, only 1,891 cane-farmers out of about 8,000 in Queensland, or 23-J per cent., earned sufficient money to be liable to pay income tax. Nearly 1,100 of these farmers were classified in taxable income groups up to £250 per annum. Whilst these results are probably better than for some other primary industries, they definitely prove that the industry is not in a position to stand the only reduction that could be of any practic.il benefit to consumers, namely, another id. per lb., which is equivalent to £1,250,000 per annum less revenue for the producers. The growers' share of such a reduction would be £875,000, which is more than the total net income of £780,251 of the 1,891 grower taxpayers, and much more than their taxable income of £569,194 for the year ended the 30th June, 1934. A reduction of id. per lb. would therefore eliminate practically all cane-growers from the income tax field. Seeing that the average price for the following season was 13s. a ton less than in respect of the year reviewed by the Queensland Commissioner of Taxes, and that costs have not fallen in the interim, but rather have slightly increased, it is obvious that there will be a smaller percentage than 23£ per cent, of all cane-farmers paying tax in Queensland on incomes derived during the income tax year ended the 30th June. 1935. In the light of these facts, the Government felt that there was no justification whatever for further reducing tbe income of the sugar producers. Mr White. I turn now to the position of Australian sugar .consumers. The question is whether the renewal of the sugar agreesonable from their point of view. There .. .. . . 20 5 10 are several means whereby this matter .. . . 17 19 10 may be properly considered. Possibly .. . . 18 10 2 the best and fairest comparison rests upon . . 10 3 6 the relative pre-war and present prices of . . 10 10 9 sugar and other Australian commodities, and also wages. With many people, the cry is ""back to pre-war,"" but those who advocate this policy, whether for sugar alone or for other things also, seem to forget that a great war and a consequent mountain of debt and much heavier current obligations have beset the country since 1914, and constitute an overhead charge on all production and national activity which necessarily increases all costs and prices. The pre-war retail price of sugar to the consumer was usually 3d. per lb. It is now 4d. per lb., and will remain .so under the new agreement, that is, an advance of 33 per cent. However, the average retail price for all foods and groceries has increased since 1911 by 42 per cent., or 9 per cent, more than in the case of sugar. Indeed, only two important foodstuffs have increased in price since 1911 to a less degree than sugar, and they are butter and cheese, in which industries relatively low wages are paid owing to the substantial absence of wages awards, whereas all sugar employees have to be paid Arbitration Court rates of wages. Whilst the retail price of sugar has advanced by 33 per cent., the basic wage has increased by 45 per cent, since 1911, and this obviously means that all citizens of Australia working under wages awards are better able to pay. 4d. per lb. for sugar now than they were able in 1911 to pay 3d. per lb. The same contention applies to all sheltered primary and secondary industries-and that means most Australian industries-and to wholesalers, retailers and the community generally. This is substantially proved by the rise in. the average retail price of all commodities, wages and house rents. Honourable members will doubtless be interested in the sugar retail prices in other countries. The Australian capital city price of 4d. per lb. is less than the average retail price now being charged in the nineteen principal countries of the world, namely, 5.44d. per lb. expressed in terms of Australian currency. Even at par rates of exchange, this average price abroad would be approximately 4£d. per lb., or slightly more than the basic retail price in Australia. The details expressed in Australian currency are as follow:Pence per lb. Country. currency.) Austria Belgium 3.28 Czechoslovakia Denmark France Germany Hungary Italy Netherlands Norway Poland Rumania 8.10 Sweden Switzerland United Kingdom Canada New Zealand 3.00 South Africa United States of America. . Average for all countries named .. 5.44 These particulars were obtained by the Government a few weeks ago from official sources overseas. I invite special attention to South Africa, where the par exchange price for black-labour sugar, as fixed by the Government, is 3£d. per lb. uear the sugar areas, but is higher in all parts of the country. South Africa has no price equalization plan as exists in Australia, where the price is 4d. per lb. for white-labour sugar in every capital city. The reason for the average of 5.44d. per lb., Australian currency, being more than the 4.03d. per lb. previously quoted by me in Parliament is that the present list includes additional countries, for example, Italy, Roumania, Poland and Hungary, where higher prices obtain. It is realized, of course, that some of the prices mentioned are inflated by net revenue taxation, but that does not apply in all cases. That the present sugar retail price of 4d. per lb. is not out of step with purchasing power and the prices of other goods is confirmed by the fact that the per capita direct consumption of refined sugar in Australia has increased from 74.3 lb. for 1928-29 to 74.5 lb. for 1934-35, and remains the highest in the world. Such a result could not occur, if sugar were too expensive, relatively to other prices and to our purchasing power. In this connection, it is of interest to note that Australia's total per capita consumption of sugar, direct and indirect, has been for many years either first or (Australian second of all countries in the world, only d. Denmark occasionally being ahead of 0.00 Australia. Expressed in terms of raw O.flO sugar, per capita consumptions in 2.61 1933-34 were as follow:0.00 lb. 8.4o Australia .. ..113 0.28 Average for Europe .. 37 14.34 Average for Asia .. .. 14 8.40 Average for Africa .. .. 10 4.44 Average for America .. .. 70 6.51 Average for world .. 28 2.01 As a side-light on the recent agitation 2.31 for cheaper sugar irrespective of the 2.81 economic circumstances of the sugar pro3.12 ducers, it is well to recall that, in 1925, 4.37 the Bruce-Page Government, at the 3.12 special request of certain so-called consuming interests, inserted a new clause in the sugar agreement providing for the supply of mill-white and first quality mill sugars at -Jd. per lb. less than the price of refined sugar, subject to definite orders and reasonable notice thereof being given. It was represented then, as now, that a widespread demand existed for cheaper sugar. The real attitude of consumers generally may, to some extent, be gauged from the fact that the consumption of mill-white sugar since 1925 has been at the average of 113 tons per annum, as against a refined sugar consumption averaging 310,000 tons per annum. The new sugar agreement, and all its conditions as to prices, rebates, etc., will operate for five years. Five years is a normal period for bounty legislation. Eor example, the current wine and raw cotton bounty acts will operate for five years, and several bounty acts previously in force had five-year terms of operation. The Papua and New Guinea Bounty Act has a term of ten years. The Sulphur Bounty Act and the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act operate indefinitely. A more important reason for the provision that the new sugar agreement will operate for five years is that five years represent the normal crop and seasonal cycles for Australian sugar production. Correct farm practice for most of the production is one plant crop, followed by three ratoon crops, and one year for fallowing, making a total of five years. The same period is nocessary to experience typical or average seasonal conditions. A five-year sugar agreement was recommended by both sections of the Commonwealth Sugar Committee of 1931, and it appears to be obviously warranted from the producers' view-point regarding the productive circumstances mentioned, and in the interests of a reasonable measure of stability. The Government carefully considered the probable position of consumers under a domestic price fixed for five years. would remind honourable members of my earlier figures showing that the price of sugar has advanced less since 1911 than the average price of all other foods and groceries, and the basic wage. At present, therefore, the retail price of 4d. per lb. slightly favours the consumers. to the future, it is necessary to consider the probable trend of food price indices and wages. Most authorities hold that prosperity and full employment will not be attained unless improved prices, especially for primary products, are secured. very direction is now in evidence. In December, 1932, when the Commonwealth Parliament enacted the sugar agreement fixing the price of sugar at 4d. per lb., the All-Items Index figure for food, groceries and housing, which the Commonwealth Arbitration Court uses for fixing wages, was 1,363. months later it fell to 1,330, its lowest point for many years. steadily risen until in September, 1935, it was 1,433 points, which is 70 points aboA'e the index when the 4d. per lb. for sugar was approved. Price indices have at least been stabilized, and there are numerous indications that they will rise during the next five years. less, sugar at 4d. per lb. retail will remain at only 33 per cent, above the usual pre-war price. cause the new sugar agreement to be a distinctly favorable proposition to consumers, as without restriction sugar Mr White. prices might rise to a high level. The present trend towards higher price levels means that sugar wages will probably rise. Also the cost to the sugar producers of the commodities they require for productive purposes and for personal consumption will be increased. Hence, the cost of producing sugar may be expected to increase. Under the new sugar agreement, however, the producers will not be able to claim or secure a higher price for domestic sugar sales, but Inquiry will be compelled to meet the situation by improved efficiency and by re-adjusting their total output. A further aspect that has been considered by the Government is the possibility of export values improving during the term of the next agreement. I must I give credit to the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) for having placed it before the Government. Some improvement on current export prices may, of course, be expected, as a result of international efforts and/or the natural adjustment of the world producAs tion to demand, but progress in that direction-is bound to be slow. However, the maximum likely improvement-average d over the five years-woul d not he sufficient, in itself, to enable the Australian price to be reduced to consumers generally; and, if it should develop to a suffiA marked tendency in that cient extent at any stage, it is not unlikely that it will be offset in the interests of budgets and consumers in the United Kingdom and Canada, by a partial reduction of the present tariff preferences granted on Empire-produced sugar. Apart from these considerations, the average price now received by the AusThree tralian producers is lower than efficient production costs plus a reasonable return It has since on capital invested, and I have already shown that less than 23 per cent, of all cane-growers are earning sufficient money to be liable to income tax, and that relative to all other prices, the sugar retail price of 4d. per lb."" is favorable to consumers. NevertheFinally, it appears to be only equitable that, if the variable factor of better export prices is to be applied in favor Such a result will of a section of consumers, then other variable factors, such as higher sugar wages, a shorter working week, increased costs of machinery, implements, &c, should be applied in favour of the sugar producers. For these various reasons, the Government has decided to allow any improved returns from raw sugar exports to remain with the sugar industry. sugar industry are higher than those paid iu any other primary industry in this country. dustries, certainly, the operatives are undor-paid. The wisdom of the Government's announcement regarding the new sugar agreement eighteen months before the expiration of the current agreement has been questioned in certain quarters. Most of the previous agreements were signed from nine to twelve months before they were due to commence, and the agreement now under discussion was signed in July last, or thirteen months before it will become operative. An early announcement or decision as to the future is suitable, if not essential, cane-cutters, and mill employees, was to the general circumstances of the sugar industry, especially at a time when the producers are, as has already been shown, in furthermore, much land has had to be prepared and cane planted during the last few months for the crop that will be harvested under the new agreement. The current agreement now covers only the crop at present being harvested and crushed, which operations will end in December or January next. For new planting and attention to existing crops during the next eight or ten months, much expenditure by the growers will be necessary, and a fairly large part of the requisite funds will have to be borrowed, and secured by crop liens and other means. For the purpose of such loans, it is essential to have a reasonFollowing is a list of organizations which ably firm value for the next crop. The conclusion of the new agreement gives a definite value to about 55 per cent, of the crop, which will be consumed in the Commonwealth, and the average value of each ton of sugar cane produced may be computed with sufficient accuracy for loan transactions by adopting a conservative value for the export surplus. It is significant that the British Government decided some months ago that, in view of the particular circumstances of the cane-sugar industry throughout the Empire regarding the heavy expenses necessary for preparation of land, planting, and attention to growing crops, in future no alteration in the United Kingdom tariff preferences on Empire sugars would be made without first giving notice eighteen months prior to the alterations becoming effective. to accusations that the sugar industry is controlled by foreigners? was that a recent census in the Cairns district showed that 90 per cent, of the people employed by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company were foreigners. The fact is that the company has only one mill near Cairns, and employs no foreigners in any of its mills. The Commonwealth Inquiry of 1931 specially investigated the extent of aliens engaged in the sugar industry. It found unanimously that the whole of the personnel, namely, farmers, field-workers, distributed as follows:Per centBritish born 79.8 British (naturalized) 10.1 a somewhat difficult position, Foreign .. 10.1 Total .. 100.0. No later figures are available, but action since taken in Queensland to reduce the employment of foreign cane-cutters in certain districts, whilst not allowing other districts to increase such employment, has probably caused a reduction of the above percentage of 10.1 per cent, for foreigners, and increased the 79.8 per cent, for British-born persons.

The annual contribution by the sugar producers to the fruit industry is to be increased from £200,000 to £216,000. This fund is administered by the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee, which distributes the money in the following manner:(1) A domestic sugar rebate to manufacturers of fruit products of £2 4s. per ton of refined sugar used. This rebate reduces the cost of sugar to fruit processors from the ordinary price of £32 10s. 9d. to £30 6s. 9d. a ton, and costs approximately £60,000 per annum. (2) An export sugar rebate on the sugar contents of all manufactured fruit products exported from Australia, for the purpose of reducing the cost of those contents to the Australian equivalent of the world's free-market price. The rates of this rebate vary from month to month in accordance with fluctuating world prices, and the annual cost is about £60,000. (3) Special export assistance on manufactured fruit products, in addition to the domestic and export sugar rebates mentioned. This assistance takes the form of either ordinary export bounties Mr White. or guarantees of manufacturers' production costs. Approximately £96,000 per annum will he available for this work and the next item. ""Without these concessions the canneries in Australia, which are mainly located in Victoria, could not continue in operation. The persons controlling them have definitely said so. The largest cannery in the British Empire is situated at Shepparton, in the north of Victoria. The Goulburn Valley produces more preserved fruits than any other part of Australia. Councillor A. W.

To-day the industry was on the up-grade, and could not supply the demand."" The persons who grossly criticize the sugar industry without knowledge of the facts are doing tremendous harm. They should investigate the Australian canning industry, whose existence and continued profitable export trade is dependent on the sugar industry. The fourth purpose to which the fund is devoted is the subsidizing of scientific and industrial research for the purpose of increasing the acreage yield of fresh marketable fruits required for manufactured fruit products. This is a new responsibility for the committee, of obvious value and importance to the f r u it industry, and, ultimately, to consumers because of its potential influence on lower production costs. Payment of the domestic sugar rebate and special export assistance will, as heretofore, be conditional upon manufacturers paying growers for their fresh fruit not less than the prices declared by the committee each season to be reasonable prices.

29,Mr Lane,"It would be very disdisappointing to canners and others in Victoriai f it did so. The subject of wholesale discounts has been a cause of much controversy. The new agreement contains a clause designed to promote fairer competition between wholesale merchants, and also all classes of retail grocers. I shall deal, first, with the position of the wholesale merchants. Some years ago, as the result of several merchants sharing the wholesale sugar discount with retailers or giving cartage rebates or other concessions on retail sugar orders, most of the other merchants were forced to indulge in the same practice or .else suffer the loss of their sugar business. The practice of discount-cutting and giving other unauthorized rebates was initiated chiefly by merchants whose sugar business was largely confined .to cash transactions in metropolitan areas. The sugar discount is intended only for merchants who trade in legitimate wholesale lines, and who carry the important credit responsibilities essential to most country district and numerous suburban grocers. The wholesale cash sugar discount was reduced many years ago from 3-J per cent, to 2 per cent., which is much the lowest rate for any grocery commodity. Other grocery goods carry discounts ranging from 5 per cent, to 15 per cent., the average being between 8 per cent, and 10 per cent. It is important to remember that the low sugar discount is in the interests of ultimate consumers. A discount of 8 per cent, or 10 per cent., for example, would cause the retail price of sugar to rise i d . per lb. Discount cutting or other concessions given on sugar by certain wholesalers who refuse to take their fair share, and frequently take no share of the credit trade, is no great achievement, for they are virtually acting as brokers and not wholesalers. Such practices merely deprive legitimate wholesalers of the only sound part of their sugar business, reduce their total turn-over and weaken their ability to continue their essential credit facilities by the credit trade only, as it would be if to retailers at the current charge of 2 per cent, on the list wholesale price. The credit charge of 2 per cent, is not all For these reasons, and also because the profit. It covers not only selling costs cash discount of 2 per cent., that is, and administration, but also bad debts 13s. 3d. per ton or one-fourteenth of a I think it would he which average about 1^ per cent, at present. The cash discount and the credit charge cannot be dissociated, for they are interdependent and are based on metropolitan and country trade as a whole. If the cash discount were more than 2 per cent., the credit charge could probably be less than 2 per cent. Conversely, if discount-cutting became general so that only 1 per cent, or less could be retained by legitimate wholesalers, the added charge against retailers for credit facilities would doubtless need to be increased, unless wholesalers traded in sugar at a loss. likely to meet the competition of the chain stores? that point presently. The normal circumstances of the agricultural community are such that most primary producers require to obtain their supplies on credit for part of the year. The need for this has been accentuated by the low prices of primary products in recent years. The credit requirements of primary producers in turn compel country storekeepers to purchase a considerable portion of their goods on credit terms, and -this credit is often not available from banks or other financial institutions. It has to be obtained from wholesale traders. Wholesale merchants are thus an important factor in the credit structure of the grocery trade of Australia. At present, their outstanding accounts for all groceries are reported to be about £9,000,000, of which £1,500,000 is for sugar. Most of this money is owed by storekeepers in country districts. About 40 per cent, of the business throughout Australia is done on credit terms. Any plan, therefore, to maintain the cash discount intact is a reasonable protection for legitimate wholesalers and in the interests of sound trade. It is also beneficial to the people in country districts, who might be expected to bear higher credit charges if the whole burden of bad debts were carried wholesale merchants w«re deprived of their cash trade in sugar.",40,Australia Managing Director Of The Shepparton

32,Mr White,"-Yes. I shall deal withpenny per lb., can never benefit consumers, the Government decided three years ago ito give the Queensland Sugar Board authority to impose conditions that would safeguard the discount for legitimate wholesalers. The same reasons apply with equal force at present. The relevant clause of the present sugar agreement has been found by experience to require strengthening, but it is believed that the clause in the new agreement w ill meet th© position satisfactorily. In future, therefore, the cash discount on sugar w ill only be available to wholesale merchants who, in the opinion of the Queensland Sugar Board, engage to a reasonable extent in the credit trade, ancl who comply with the prescribed conditions forbidding the sharing of the discount with, or the giving of cartage or other concessions to their customers. The wholesale discount has not been, and is not intended to be, reserved to a limited number of merchants. merchant who complies with the prescribed terms aDd conditions is entitled to hare his name added to the approved list. An addition was made recently. I come now to the retail grocers' position. The other purpose of the new wholesale discount clause is to promote f a i r competition amongst all classes of retail grocers. A t present, several chain organizations of retail stores are virtually receiving the discount through the agency of wholesale companies operating under a different name. This means, in effect, that the owners of certain chain stores receive 13s. 3d. per ton more profit for retailing sugar than thousands of individual grocers, which obviously causes unfair competition. The chain store movement, which is of comparatively recent origin, is Creating new problems. Two methods may he adopted to restore fair competition in the retailing of sugar. One method is to make the sugar discount available to syndicates of retailers. This has been formally requested by the retailers' federation. Seeing that the discount is equivalent to only one-four.teenth of a penny per lb., and therefore cannot be passed on to domesticconsumers, and that the consequent los3 of most of the cash trade to wholesalers, if retail syndi[43] cates were allowed to have the discount, would inevitably re-act unfavorably on many country storekeepers and so on the farming community, the Government considers that it is not advisable that retail syndicates should be permitted to obtain the discount. The only other way to restore f a i r competition amongst retailers is to remove from ithe wholesale discount list those concerns that are directly or in directly associated with retail stores, and, in future, to prevent any chain store or other retailers receiving or sharing in the discount either directly or indirectly. The Government has accordingly decided to adopt this method, and the new clause relating to wholesale merchants means that the sugar discount w ill not be available to wholesale merchants in respect of any sugar, or sugar products whicli they directly, or indirectly through any associated person, firm, or corporation, retail to the public. This clause w ill It has been so. be interpreted by the Queensland Sugar Boardi n its widest sense, to promote f a i r I do not think so. Any and equal competition amongst all classes of retail grocers. Further, as chain store competition in rhe retail trade is becoming increasingly acute, the following arrangement has been made by the Queensland Sugar Board:That »the approval by Parliament of the recently-signed new sugar agreement will be regarded by the Sugar Board as indicating the present will of Parliament iu respect to the wholesale sugar discount and fair competition for retail grocers. Consequently, although the new sugar agreement will not commence to operate until the 1st September, 1936, the Sugar Board, at the earliest convenient o*pp< vtunity after it .becomes law, will give effect to Parliament's decision by suitably revising the prescribed conditions for the wholesale sugar discount so that no retailer, or group of retailers (chain stores), shall directly or indirectly receive the discount. In other words the Sugar Board w ill take steps to apply this provision as soon as this bill is passed. The Betail Grocers Fedcra,tion has requested that the free delivery areas in the various capital cities be extended to the outermost suburbs. Such a provision could not benefit retail consumers, as even the maximum cartage charges involved are only 10s. a ton. Moreover, free delivery would involvie .the sugar producers in a very largo expenditure, which",41,Australia Managing Director Of The Shepparton

34,Mr White,"they should not at present be called upon price of 4d. per lb. for refined sugar to bear. Further, whilst grocers in the amongst all participants:outer suburbs have to pay cartage on their sugar deliveries, they, in nearly all cases, STATEMENT BHOWINO DISTRIBUTION AMONGST ALL pay lower rents than city grocers and employ less outside labour. In many instances, no labour is employed. In these circumstances the request for free delivery could not be granted. However, the Government's investigation of this position Retail grocers receive -disclosed that a somewhat anomalous Discount position existed in Melbourne compared with other capital cities, for the Yarraville Refinery was regarded as Transport of raw Bugax from mills to the centre of the free delivery zone. This will be rectified shortly after the new sugar agreement is approved by ParliaInsurance ment, by the adoption of the city as the approximate centre of the free delivery area, and the extension of that Refining area to a number"" of thickly-populated suburbs. At the same time, the cartage rates to grocers in all suburbs outside the extended free delivery area will be slightly Remuneration of Colonial Sugar Rereduced. I have no doubt that reference will be made, during the debate on this bill, to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and that attempts will be made to hold the Government responsible in some way for the profits that the company is making. Some honourable members will probably ask why, in the light of those profits, it should not be possible to reduce the price of sugar by i d . or I d . per lb.

Nevertheless,-1 always supported the sugar embargo as the only effective way of protecting the industry in Australia. At the outset, it should be stated that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is not a party to the sugar agreement, and is not consulted regarding its terms and conditions. The company's receipts, fees and profits-to which I shall refer in a moment-for its services in refining and distributing sugar throughout Australia are fixed by separate agreements each year between the Queensland Government and the company. Honourable members will, I hope, be board ship.

Two of the payments-refinin g costs, £2 13s. l i d . , and selling costs, 7s. 3d. a ton-ar e merely reimbursements of actual expenses in' curred in labour, materials, &c, in doing the-essential work of refining and distributing sugar throughout the Commonwealth. The first of the other two payments is the item of 6s. 4d. a ton for interest on money borrowed by the sugar pool, so that the sugar mills may be paid cash for raw sugar when it is placed on tirjios impossible, to pay canc-cuttcrs' wages. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company with its diverse interests in large liquid cash resources available during the Australian sugar season, which enable it to advance the necessary money -the peak amount each season running up to £6,000,000. these advances on raw sugar a convenient means of investing its cash resources, and it does so always at less than bank rates of interest. The final payment to the company is the 15s. 4d. a ton for administration, taxation and profit. In terms of raw sugar, this payment gives a net profit of 14s. 9d. a ton, which is, in practice, included in the long-established fee of £1 a ton on raw sugar melted for home consumption. The remaining 5s. 3d. represents depreciation on refineries, and is more appropriately included in the foregoing statement in the item of £2 13s. l i d . for refining costs. These findings were unanimously reported by the Commonwealth Sugar Inquiry' Committee of 1931. The amount of 15s. 4d. a ton of refined sugar, which is, of course, subject. to Federal and State income taxes, is the only profit received by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for its services in refining and distributing Australian sugar. If it rendered these services without any profit, the saving to consumers would be only one-twelfth of a penny per lb. of sugar. ment of taxation, this profit becomes onefourteenth of a penny per lb.

The 1933 The company finds retail price reduction of ^d. per lb. would reduce the company's profits by about £75,000 per annum, and there have been little, if any, compensating reductions iu its costs since then. Consequently, the percentage of the company's total profits to capital, in regard to its Australian sugar operations should now be slightly less than 7.1 per cent. That the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has made, and is still making, higher rates of profit from its sugar interests outside Australia,, and possibly in non-sugar activities, also, has nothing whatever to do with the sugar agreements or the Government's policy. Consumers and the Government can only be concerned with the question as to whether the company's essential services in respect of Australian sugar are given at no more than a reasonable profit. In this connection, it is of interest to note that the recent report of the United Kingdom Sugar Industry Inquiry Committee, of 1935, in urging an amalgamation of British refining institutions for the purpose of reducing costs in tbe United Kingdom, recommended a fee to After payrefineries of £1 10s. a ton to cover depreciation and a reasonable return on capital.

This is a bill to provide for the payment of a bounty on the export of oranges from the Commonwealth to the United Kingdom. Since a committee appointed by the Development Branch to inquire into the citrus industry issued its report in 1930 the Commonwealth has given serious consideration to the difficulties confronting the Australian citrusgrowers. In the years 1933 and 1934 the exporters of oranges were guaranteed 13s. a bushel case, and in respect of those whose shipments were covered by comprehensive all-risks insurance policies, the guarantee was increased to 13s. 5d. a bushel case, to cover the added cost of the insurance. After that scheme had been carried on for some time, however, the Government realized that it had certain disadvantages, inasmuch as exporters of high-quality fruit whose return was equal to 13s. or 13s. 5d. a case, Government, whereas exporters of inferior fruit, bringing a very low price, were guaranteed a return of 13s. or 13s. 5d. a case. Thus the Commonwealth made available to the exporters of inferior fruit a considerable amount of money by way of guarantee. This bill proposes to alter the principle upon which future assistance is to be given in respect of the export of citrus fruits. Bounty will be paid at the rate of 2s. a case on oranges exported to the United Kingdom, which absorbs the great bulk of the exports of citrus fruits from this country. The grower of fruit of inferior quality will receive no encouragement to export it to the United Kingdom, because the bounty will only be sufficient to compensate a grower whose fruit brings a reasonable price on the overseas market. That is the real principle embodied in this bill. The Government is fully alive to the difficulties that have been confronting the growers of citrus fruits during the past few years. A severe blow was dealt to them when the Government of the Dominion of New Zealand imposed an embargo against the importation of citrus fruit from Australia, with the exception (Calare Assistant of oranges from South Australia. The Australian citrus-growers thus lost one of their most valuable markets, and while the dominion embargo continues they must seek markets overseas to dispose of their surplus production. The total export of citrus fruits to the United Kingdom and countries other than New Zealand increased from 97,000 cases in 1933 to 213,000 cases in 1934. The bulk of the fruit was exported to the United Kingdom, the 1934 shipments to that market being 179,000 cases as against 77,000 cases in 1933. Honourable members will therefore appreciate why the Government has given so much attention to the export of citrus fruits to the United Kingdom. The amount expended under the guarantee in respect of the 1933 season was £3,000, whilst it is anticipated that something over £10,000 will be required to meet the guarantee for the 1934 season.

In imposing those conditions it is the desire of the Government to ensure that only fruit of first-class quality is consigned to the British market. It must be remembered that Australian citrus fruit has to be marketed in the United Kingdom in competition with first-class fruit from Brazil and other countries' nearer the British market which experience no difficulties in connection with cold storage. With these facts in mind, the Government has endeavoured, in collaboration with the industry, to formulate a plan for the more efficient marketing of Australian citrus fruits overseas, and to secure the best advice possible as the result of scientific research to overcome the many difficulties associated with the export industry. By tightening up the regulations the Government hopes to be able to eliminate the export of a considerable amount of inferior citrus fruit from Australia. It for citrus-growers to produce all firstquality fruit, but at the same time the Government has to bear in mind that on the British market Australian citrus fruit has to meet the competition of some of the best fruit produced in the world. While in LondonI was very much impressed with what I saw at Covent Garden. There, first-quality oranges from Brazil, a country which has greatly expanded its citrus industry during the last few years, were on sale. To-day, several of the South American countries are exporting large quantities of apples and other fruits to the Britisli-market. This fruit is landed in Great Britain just when fruit from Australia, which must be sold in competition with it, is landed. The Government feels the necessity for helping Australian citrus-growers to overcome this competition, and this bill, I believe, will give them financial assistance on the soundest possible business basis. In the past the provision of a guarantee did not encourage people it was intended to encourage}-the producers of high-quality fruit-to send their product overseas, because, if their fruit brought 13s. a case they received no financial aid, whereas the producer of inferior fruit absorbed practically the whole of the guarantee made shipping and packing. The available. asked for this bounty? with both hands. Although the honourable member is not directly interested in the production of citrus fruits, I may inform him that the Government proposes to make available through the agency of the State governments about £80,000 for the purpose of assisting fruit-growers generally. This bill deals only with the citrus industry; other branches of the fruit growing industry will be dealt with in other legislation or by the provision of funds in the Estimates. I hope that when honourable members are discussingthis bill they will bear that point in mind. adjourned.

43,Mr Collins (Hume) [8.15],"I joinhonorable office, in which I wish him every success. that late him also upon the budget which he has presented, because it is not altogether to the liking of many persons who have at heart the. interests of the taxpayers of this country. Seeing that the emergency taxation still imposed on the people generally is in the vicinity of £14,000,000 and that the relief afforded amounts to only about £500,000, the prospects are not very encouraging. It must, however, be admitted that the Government has many large commitments for different services, such as war and repatriation, approximately £18,000,000; defence, £4,600,000; invalid and old-age pensions, £12,750,000; other statutory payments about £4,300,000; miscellaneous services, nearly £2,000,000; and ordinary votes of departments, £2,800,000; together with assistance to primary production in various forms, including approximately £4,300,000 to wheat-growers. there are grants to the States totalling over £14,000,000, and the amount made available for the inauguration of public works for the relief of unemployment. In this latter connection T regret the continuance of the £1 for £1 condition which attaches to the grant, because it has militated, against the States be done those offering for it are drawn doing their part in the provision of the work that is necessary for the absorption of the unemployed to-day. Much yet remains to be done, and a great deal of additional expenditure will have to be incurred in the relief of unemployment. A good deal of the defence vote could be allocated to the employment of youths in a dual capacity: They could be placed in depots under competent instructors and, while being trained in different trades, undergo physical culture and military training that would fit them to defend Australia in time of need. Youths with intermediate and leaving certificates would be far better engaged in that way than in sweeping the streets and doing other work for which they are quite unsuited, because they would become skilled artisans, of which there is a scarthis anomaly. city in every branch of secondary industry. A great deal of criticism is levelled at the Government by members of the Opposition in this and probably in every Mr Collins. other parliament, in an attempt to preI am sorry vail upon it to take adequate steps in the I am unable to congratudirection of providing a solution of this pressing problem. Members of the Opposition in this chamber have criticized the Government most severely for having failed to remove a condition that they as a government could not even check. It is all very well to criticize; constructive ideas and common-sense suggestions are needed. Rather than criticize, honourable members opposite should propound a scheme and co-operate with the Government in its application. If men who are so ful l of ideas would submit them they would be welcomed by the Government, and would receive the approbation of every right-thinking citizen of Australia; but those who are loudest and most vigorous in their denunciation of the Government are as barren of constructive ideas as the proverbial frog is free from feathers. In common with many other persons, ThenI look to some form of relief being given to the over-burdened taxpayers, so that money may flow into industry and absorb many of the unemployed youths and skilled workers. When I suggested the encouragement of the employment of youths in depots I had' in mind the fact that v/hen work requiring skill has to from the ranks of the middle aged and elderly. I commend the suggestion made by the honourable member for .Riverina( Mr Nock) in connection with border telegrams. In border towns such as Albury and Wodonga, which are separated by a distance .of only three miles, the interstate rate is charged. This is a distinct injustice. The honourable member for Riverina mentioned the town of Mungindi, on the Queensland border, the residents of which have to cross into New South Wales territory to transact postal business. If they desire to send a telegram for even the short distance that separates them from their homes they are charged the interstate rate. The Government should give particular attention to Another matter that demands consideration is the closing of small country post offices for. the reason that the revenue is insufficient to defray expenses and provide remuneration for those who manage them. I recently brought under the notice of the Minister in charge of War Service Homes( Mr Thorby) a case in his own electorate at a small isolated place where the man in charge of the post office was receiving £1 a week to keep the office open for business from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. was not regarded as sufficient the department reduced that already inadequate allowance to 17s. 6d. a week, with the result that the post office was closed, and rightly so. point that I wish to make. that particular post office was providing postal services for only a few people, those people have large grazing or farming interests, and their contributions to the revenue derived from taxation entitle them to every possible service. The post office is a public utility and should be conducted as such, instead of being run as a business concern, producing revenue without providing necessary services. This applies particularly in isolated areas to which the owners of big pastoral properties throughout the Riverina and the western districts send thousands of valuable sheep for grazing purposes in times of drought or during a shortage of feed, to await the coming of the autumn rains. always ready to argue that the revenue is not sufficient to provide the service that is needed. This is not the point. In these mountainous regions, where snow is likely to fall at an earlier date in some years than in others, the greatest facilities the Government was backing a loser. It should be provided to enable the men in charge of stock to make contact with their employers in Melbourne or Sydney or in the western or southern districts. The Postal Department should see that everything possible is done for the preservation of the revenue-producing stock of this country. I now turn my attention to a matter much attention throughout the Commonthat is arousing the curiosity of many wealth. We found that all that we had people not only in Australia but also in read about the hardships that were being other parts of the world. I refer to the endured by the mining population there, development of Central and North Ausas regards housing, transport, and tralia. leged to accompany the Minister for the covers an area of about 70 miles by 40 Interior( Mr Paterson) on a visit that miles, and the nearest water suitable for he paid to the ""vast empty spaces"" of drkiking purposes is about 7 miles the Northern Territory ahout which we distant from the township. hear so much. For upwards of 60 years attempts at development have been made by different governments, but only in a half-hearted fashion. Such attempts are always doomed to failure. The party visited the much-discussed gold-fields at Tennants Creek and The Granites. Leaving Adelaide by train on Thursday Because the revenue morning, we arrived on the Saturday night at Alice Springs after a long, dreary journey through country as bare and desolate as it would be possible to gaze upon in any part of the Arabian That, however, is not the Desert. In parts where not a drop of Although rain had fallen within the last three years we saw great heaps of creeping sand, the movement being caused by the absence of herbage, the effect of which is usually to keep the soil stationary. Owing to the prevalence of drought conditions over a period of many years it was not possible to find a tree in which any life remained. The people who are living in those vast and desolate areas are all hoping that conditions will soon improve and that their returns will again be remunerative. I understand that since we visited Central Australia splendid rains have fallen in the vicinity of. Alice Springs, and that as the result the outlook has changed for the better. From Alice Springs we visited the HermannsThe department is burg Mission, which I am bound to say did not greatly impress me. I could not help feeling that if what I saw was all that had been done over a period of 55 years for the preservation of the aborigines, who are fast becoming extinct, is true that the area of 900 square miles held by the mission is carrying 1,000 head of cattle as well as some hundreds of donkeys and mules, hut, on the whole, the results were disappointing to me. From Hermannsburg Mission we travelled to the Tennants Creek gold-field, which in recent years has attracted so Some months ago I was privishortage of water, were true The field Some of the miners cart water for distances of from 5 to 28 miles, and the manner in which they are facing their hardships must arouse the admiration of all who visit that mining field. The Minister for the Interior lost no time in making himself acquainted with the conditions, and took prompt action to ensure a better water supply, as well as to effect other much-desired improvements. He sought the assistance of a water diviner with a view to locating water, and as the result a supply of doubtful water, but suitable for mining operations, was located. Another matter that engaged his attention was the erection of suitable public buildings and the provision of improved roads. We spent three or four days at Tennants Creek inspecting the various mines and prospecting shows and interviewing persons prominently connected with the mining industry in that locality. We found them all imbued with that optimism which is characteristic of Australians who pioneer the development of this country. I also pay a high tribute to the thirteen or fourteen women who are living at Tennants Creek. They are bravely facing all the hardships which life in a new mining settlement entails. Only those who visit a mining field in its earlier stages of development know what this means. Leaving Tennants Creek we travelled to The Granites, which is situated about 408 miles from Alice Springs, and inspected the mining properties under the control of Mr Chapman, who, a few months ago, sought a subsidy from the Government for the training of about 50 lads in the business of mining, and we were not much impressed with the conditions obtaining there. It is to the credit cattle which he saw on the various of the Minister that as soon as he discovered how operations were being carried on, he suspended all work until such time as a mining warden could visit the field with a view to ensuring the safety of the men working there. At a later date we travelled across the Mount Isa. Barkly Tablelands are beyond all doubt, but the area is so vast, and the problems of development are so complex, that earlier ministerial imagine, glad to return to Canberra in the Mr ColUns. hope that the people who are facing the hardships there will eventually work out their own salvation. That great area of fertile grazing country is capable of carrying a large population of white people. Transport facilities are at present an effective barrier to the successful development of that country; but I hope that, before long, practical steps will be taken to open up the natural ports, and that the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties will be able to make satisfactory agreements with other countries, thus ensuring a profitable market for all that can be grown in the Northern Territory. I say without hesitation that there is no better tract of cattle country in Australia than the area between Camooweal and the Kimberley Ranges. It may interest honourable members to know that so fertile is the land that, when water is available as at the station homesteads, the vegetable gardens produce all that one could desire. We saw cabbages and cauliflowers so large that one would almost fill a chaff bag, giant tomatoes which it would be a pity to cut, and other kinds of vegetables, the excellence of which was a testimony to the industry of the growers and the fertility of the soil. One cannot travel through that portion of the Northern Territory without realizing the need for its early development by Australians in order to prevent its occupation by people from other countries, who are looking with eager eyes at Australia's empty spaces. The honourable member for Wentworth ("" Mr E. J. Harrison) yesterday expressed the opinion that the class of stations was anything but a credit to the companies controlling them.. I cannot help feeling that the honourable member wa3 very wide of the mark. As a practical man, I admit that a certain amount of cleaning up is required on many station properties; but I am sure famous Barkly Tablelands to that,with a little judicious culling, the The possibilities of the improvements of the herds would he so marked that, if the honourable member for Wentworth again visited the properties, he would easily be persuaded that they visitors were,' I were not stocked with the same class of cattle. It is true that in some parts there is evidence of deterioration, due to the lack of suitable sires, and this may be explained by the absence of incentive to expend money on improving their herds. An improvement in the market overseas would, I have no doubt, induce them to give this matter their serious attention. Under existing conditionsI refer to the difficulties of transport and the lack of suitable ports-it is impossible for cattle-owners in the Northern Territory to compete with producers in the Argentine Republic, who, besides being more favoured by nature, are so much nearer to the British market. It is the duty of the Government to provide road and rail facilities, and . to develop the ports which would provide an outlet for stock from the vast areas through which we travelled, thus enabling growers to take advantage of the facilities provided by the meat works at ""Wyndham, and also at Darwin, when the works there are reopened. The honourable member for Wentworth emphasized that the companies controlling vast areas in the Northern Territory were not doing their share in the development of the territory. But, when one bears in mind the excessive costs for all commodities and materials, one wonders how even companies, with immense financial resources, continue in possession of their holdings. The transport on stores to the main cattle-raising areas works out nt over £19 a ton, and the cost of ordinary rations and improvement material is greatly in excess of Sydney prices, as the following figures show:Station Price. £ Floor (60-lb. bag) . . Sugar (70-lb. bag) Salt (per ton) 2 30 1 0 0 0 1 3 1 3 18 6 Petrol (per gallon) . . Cement (per ton) Plain Fencing Wire (per ton) In regard to the remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth that the large land-holders are doing nothing to improve their properties, I shall read a few figures to show how much has been spent in this direction by Vestey's Limited. I hold no brief for any vested interests, but I contend that consideration should be shown to individuals or companies prepared to sink their money in developing the Northern Territory. Mr E. J. HARRISON -Ho w does the honourable member account for the low pecentage of accepted cattle from Vestey's stations, and the high percentage from the small leases? transport facilities is the main cause of the trouble. The stock have long walks to cover, and the bruising which occurs through stampedes is responsible for a great deal of damage.

47,Proposition And One With Which The Go,""" Mr FAIRBAIRN' (Flinders) [9.4]with those in their old age, we must agree that there is no greater tragedy in this country to-day than the men who were burnt out in the prime of life while serving their country on the battlefield. The Government's action in this respect is worthy of the greatest praise. However carefully we may watch the ever-increasing cost of our social services and our pensions bill, we must be prepared in the years which lie immediately ahead to incur even greater expenditure upon these burnt-out service men whose disabilities are not directly traceable to war services. I agree with the honourable member for Hume( Mr Collins) that the budget has been framed on conservative lines, and that the Government could be criticized for not having shown more optimism owing to the probability of receiving a larger amount of revenue during the current financial year. provide assistance to those needing it, the prosperity of the country must be increased hy a more courageous policy of tax reduction. If we are to shoulder the burdens confronting us, trade must be stimulated and employment provided by reduced taxation. I do not wish, however, to develop that criticism, because I feel the definite conservatism displayed in the budget is to a considerable extent justified by the somewhat uncertain state of the international situation. In these circumstances, the Government is perhaps wise in delaying a greater remission of taxes until it is certain of the outcome of the present international disturbance. If further taxes were remitted and then as a result of a crisis they had to ho restored, Territory ( Mr Blain) led this debate the psychological effect would be veryserious. I should like to refer briefly to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) who, during a recent debate, criticized the Government for the degree of reduction made in the land tax. a desirable tax because land is capital. subject at length to-night, but I feel that attention should be directed to the fact that the view of the Leader of the Opposition is that land is capital and ought to be taxed. in capital taxation. is the proper view of an honourable member believing in socialistic theories. He Mr Fairbairn. really believes in taxing the people's savings. I consider that the taxing of land is most undesirable, because it brings about a curtailment of development and of industrial activity.. Many persons say that no arguments can be adduced in support of a reduction of the land tax, because a great proportion of it is paid by wealthy persons and the owners of city properties. Developmental works conducted by private enterprise are the best means of providing employment, and the persons best able to carry out developmental works, are those possessing capital. On numerous occasions when I have studied the figures in the estates of wealthy men, I have been amazed to find that only a small proportion of their capital has been invested in progressive developmental works. In every instance, on closer examination, If we are to it was obvious that they had invested their money in active .developmental undertakings up to the point which the land tax permitted and that upon reaching that point they invested their money in less progressive undertakings. Again and again one hears of persons coming from Great Britain to invest in land with the object of developing it, and of returning without having done so, having realized that our land taxes are so heavy as to make that development uneconomic. Last year the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) when dealing with the subject of afforestation, led us down sylvan glades, and a few days ago the honourable member for the Northern across the fertile Barkly Tablelands to the front door of Australia.. I agree with the honourable member that a careful and scientific investigation should be made into the potentialities of that area. The people of the north have a worthy representative in this House though he He considers that the land tax is does not have a vote. ""With some of the contentions of the honourable member for I do not wish to go into this ""Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison) I , like the honourable member for Hume( Mr Collins), do not agree, but with one of his utterances I am in complete agreement. I believe that if chartered comIn other words, he believes panies are to be given certain conI realize that that cessions in the form of remissions of taxes it is only right that those who are struggling in the territory to-day should receive similar concessions to enable them to overcome some of their difficulties. I agree with the honourable member for Hume that the first step towards the effective development of the Northern Territory must be in the direction of providing suitable markets for the producers. Until such time as the tariff mania of the world gives place to sanity and the people are able to purchase our beef, efforts to develop grazing in the Northern Territory on a big scale must be more or less futile. We must concentrate on getting markets for the beef which we are capable of producing. It is also necessary to make a careful scientific analysis of the soil of the Northern Territory, and also of the. type of pasture grasses that might be introduced there. A great difficulty encountered by graziers in the territory to-day is the short growing season for the existing grasses. Because of the great rainfall over a short season, the growth of grasses is tremendous for a while, but when the summer arrives the grass becomes rank. The fattening season for cattle, therefore, is short. Much might be done by introducing grasses which would continue to grow throughout the long dry season. I feel that another duty facing the Government is that of acquainting the people of the world, and the people of the British Empirei n particular, of the nature of the Northern Territory. honourable member for Hume regarding the grazing possibilities of the territory, but I do not agree that it possesses possibilities for close settlement, t. feel that many of the speeches voicing enthusiasm about the potentialities of the north are likely to give the inhabitants of crowded countries the impression that we are keeping from them tremendous areas which are suitable for close settlement. Tliat definitely is not the case. I also undertook a pilgrimage across the Barkly Tableland, and, as a sheep man, I was impressed with its wool-growing possibilities. I have since discussed with practical men who have (visited the district that aspect of its possible development, and m y enthusiasm has abated to ii. certain extent. Although the area is suitable for wool-growing, it is not suitable for sheep-breeding, but expert examination of the possibility of utilizing the Barkly Tableland for the sheep industry is necessary. If a railway were laid down across the tableland, it might be feasible to use the area for dry sheepgrazing. It seems, however, that the cost of conducting the industry there would be too great. It is incontrovertible that the potentialities of the north are limited, and I feel that ignorance about the Northern Territory is dangerous.. We may be led into tremendous losses, and into ""the breaking of hundreds of thousands of hearts, by the institution of immature closer settlement schemes in the north, and wild and enthusiastic statements, born in ignorance, about the territory might invite unwarranted invasion from overcrowded countries. The honourable member for Hume referred to deterrents to the development of leases in the Northern Territory. A further deterrent is the incredibly low prices that the cattle-raisers receive when they get their cattle to port. The manager of the Victoria River Downs Station, who sends 10,000 head of cattle annually to Wyndham, informed me that the average price received at Wyndham, after driving the cattle 300 miles, is 7s. per cwt. A remuneration of £2 10s. for a beast offers a poor incentive to. develop leases and improve the breed of cattle. Eveni f the Northern Territory graziers produced the I agree f u l l y with the best type of cattle in the world, the prices would not at present be remunerative, and would not j u s t if y any big expenditure on development. MrE . J . HARRTSON -Only about 60 per cent, of the land covered in the leases is developed. tbe honourable member has peculiar qualifications for being an authority on grazing matters, but I should like h i m to allow other members who possibly have less experience also to give their ideas. One other point in connection with the Northern Territory is the need for the proper development of what is definitely the fron t door of Australia-Darwin. I suggest that the Government should look into the possibility of establishing a flying boat bas.e at Darwin. The Department of the Interior intends to provide a 45-ft. launch which is to patrol our northern",52,Budget 1935 36

That motor boat will have to stand (by at Darwin every day the air mail is crossing the Timor Sea. The crossing is now made twice weekly and shortly it will 'be made four times weekly. I estimate that possibly for at least six or eight months, until a daily service has been inaugurated, the boat will not be able to get 100 miles away from Darwin, when it should be patrolling a thousand miles of coast-line. A year hence, when a daily air service is inaugurated the boat will always be standing by, and thus be useless for patrol purposes. The Royal Australian Air Force already possesses flying boats, and I maintain that a base in the south is an indifferent training school in comparison with the possibilities presented at Darwin, where flying boats would make for far greater safety of passengers on the air-mail service than would a motor launch. more use for patrol work. expense of maintaining a base at Darwin that of maintaining one in the south, but the difference should be little. I feel that if my suggestion were accepted, I should have to avoid the officers and airmen who would be stationed at Darwin. Nevertheless, the proposal warrants consideration. I should like to join with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) in urging that the Government act on the suggestion of the Attorney-General Menzies) for the closest investigation of the root causes of unemployment and the » extraordinary anomalies that exist. One important anomaly is the definite labour shortage in certain industries, despite the seriousness of unemployment. is amazing that while great numbers of good men are unable to get employment, in two directions at any rate, there is pronounced labour shortage. districts of Australia there is a scarcity of farm labour. affairs which needs careful examination. It is a commentary on the existing economic system that we should have the appalling spectacle of unemployed youths, amd at the same time find a Presbyterian boys' training farm closing down, not because employment cannot be found Mr Fairbairn. for graduates, but because boys cannot be induced to enter into training. One hears continually that the Fairbridge school in Western Australia has two or three applications for boys from farms for every one who leaves it. Those in charge of the Big Brother movement are continually receiving letters from farmers asking for boys to take employment on the land. I am told by those in charge of the movement that the wages and conditions offering are better now than they were even in the boom days that preceded the depression. mostly for boys aged under eighteen? cations from farmers. It is easy to say that the farmers do not give fair conditions to their employees, but only a small percentage is guilty. Quite apart, however, from the question of wages and conditions, the fact remains They would also be of that the reward for the farmer's labour The is so small that he cannot pay comparable wages and give equal conditions to would be greater than those obtaining in other industries. For that reason, parents will not allow their sons to take employment on the land. The difficulties of the farming industry must be rectified if the labour conditions are to be improved, and if there is to be development in this avenue of employment. Another instance of the shortage of labour in the midst of unemployment is the scarcity of domestic ( Mr labour, and in that respect one cannot say that wages and working conditions are inferior. It is, I think, attributable to a wrong mental outlook on the part of the young women of Australia, where work in a factory or in an office as a It stenographer, very' often for indifferent, wages, is considered desirable and a matter for pride, while it is deemed to be beneath the dignity of a girl to seek In many employment in what is woman's natural sphere of occupation. That is something That is a state of which should be investigated. I do not suggest that we should do what Hitler is attempting to achieve, namely, send women back to the home, but we must try to overcome this wrong mental outlook which exists throughout Australia.

53,Mr Brennan,"I visited the Norat an appropriate season. In the south, ample territories which are adjacent to the railways serving our markets-accessibl e lands better than any in the Northern Territory, and suitable for sheep-farming and wheat-growingare still awaiting development and population. The development of the Northern Territory-the most outlying and the least accessible part of Australia-is a problem which must long await the settlement of other parts which are calling more imperatively, and which are more easily exploited. Some honourable members seem to have forgotten that tbe amendment before the House is that tlie item be reduced by f 1, and I would fain bring them back for a moment to a consideration of that fact. The object of the motion, as has been disclosed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), is to ensure legislative colpose, that must be admitted to contain laboration in the establishment of a national employment council to deal with unemployment, particularly among the youth of both sexes, and to provide adequate relief and training for those for whom employment is not provided. This opens up problems for consideration much nearer home than the Northern Territory. There are some of them awaiting solution in the electorate of Hume, for example, which was for so many years well represented by my friend, Mr find employment, the conclusion is forced Parker Moloney. I support the amend-' ment by the Leader of the Opposition, and the object which he has in moving it. Not that I think for one moment that the amendment, even if carried, which it certainly will not be, would have the effect of ending unemployment, but I do think that the calling of public attention to this gross mal-adjustment of our social fabric to which the honourable member for Elinders also referred continues to be one of the most imperative duties that can engage our attention. We make frequent references to unemployment. It becomes, I acknowledge, a little wearisome to insist so much and so frequently upon this important subject, but, to my view, it is the real question and the only question of vital importance, because wrapped up in it, if the problem is to be solved, is a matter of fundamental change. The budget which honourable members are now considering is a good Mr Brennan. one on paper. Every honourable member seems to have considered it his duty to congratulate the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) upon it. I have no objection to congratulating the honourable gentleman, who is an efficient United Australia party Treasurer, and a very industrious one, and with enthusiasm gives effect to that policy upon which he was elected. If our experience, however, could only be squared successfully with the theories of the Treasurer and others, things would be a great deal better for us. No country presents better opportunities for applying a new and courageous policy than does Australia. To my mind, none illustrates better the futility of the present patchwork on which we are now engaged. Of course it may be said that conditions are a little better. It has been said, and will be said again, that we have turned the corner and in an absolute sense, I supsome truth. But, relative to our resources and opportunities, it is absolutely false. Having regard to the extent of our undeveloped territories, including the Northern Territory, to the standard of cur intelligence, if we are to judge it by our labour-saving machinery, and also to tlie tragic fact that, even according to the admission of the Treasurer himself, almost 20 per cent, of our working class people last year were unable to upon us that we afford a shocking example of the utter futility of our whole social system. The budget statement shows no intelligent appreciation of fundamentals. It fails to estimate the probable effect of unassailable facts, or to trace facts back to their natural causes. It argues from false premises. By the way, it is a most distressing fact that, of all the subjects that we discuss in this deliberative chamber of representative men, the one most neglected is economics. The problem which confronts us may be stated in a few sentences. Why is it that indigence and malnutrition on a large scale exist in this land of superabundant resources? Why is it that the use of labour-saving machinery always makes the lot of the worker harder? Why is it that the production of superfluous quantities of wheat makes bread harder to get by those who need it? Why, may I ask the wool growers, it is that the production of more wool means shabbier clothes? Why is it that workmen stand idle in an undeveloped country while so many of their fellows live in hovels which pass for dwellings? The answers to these questions given by honourable members opposite are masterpieces of evasion and selfcomplacency. The real answer can be given in a few words: Intelligent and sympathetic social service is subordinate to ignorance and avarice. I was tempted by the remarks, made last evening by the honourable member for Lilley( Sir Donald Cameron), and also by those made earlier by the honourable -member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) to formulate a few thoughts on defence. marshals of Napoleon has come to light! Let us hear him! -the honourable member for Barker and the honourable member for Lilley-ar e a doughty breed! The defence policy of the Labour party is well known. It is adequate-defenc e against aggression. I admit that that is a wide statement, that may cover even the policy of pacificism, in which I so heartily believe. I disclaim any expert knowledge of tacties or strategy. I have never had any experience in directing naval manoeuvres. YetI have some ideas on defence. It is important to remember that, if we could do away with all the strategists and all the experts in naval manoeuvres we should solve the whole problem of defence, for there would then be no more need to consider defence measures. It has been suggested that we should be forced to consider the necessity to defend Australia. So, in intelligent anticipation of being forced to face the subject, I now do so voluntarily. To justify defence, as I understand it, one of three factors is necessary: Attack, threatened attack, or probable attack. I assume that very remote possibilities are to be ruled out of consideration. If that is not so, we should be constructing dykes around our big cities to prevent tidal waves from submerging them; we should be providing steel nets over the heads of [44] our people to protect them from attacking aeroplanes; and I say this in answer to the remarks of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. E. Harrison)-w e should be wearing coats of mail and carrying guns. Moreover, every house would have two policemen attached to it, one at the front and one at the rear. Perhapsi t would be a good idea to provide still another one to look after the interests of the cook. Defence, such as honourable members opposite recommend, must be defence -against attack, threatened attack, or probable attack. I therefore ask again a question which I have asked frequently, but hitherto have not had answered. Who is threatening us with attack? If there is any threat at all, it must be from an organized nation. We could not in these days be overrun by Goths, Huns, of the or even aborigines. The attack must be threatened by some organized nation. I take it, also, that the threat must be from some naval power. member for Barker acquiesces in that statement. I hope that he will later acquiesce in other statements that I make. The threat of attack must be from a naval power because no combination of science and devilry has so far invented a projectile capable of being propelled 5,000 miles across the ocean to Australia. I understand-n o doubt I shall be speedily corrected if I am wrong-that the only naval powers of any considerable importance in the world to-day are Great Britain, France, Germany, the United States of America, Italy, and Japan. Does any one, including even the nitwits, who must necessarily support the United Australia party, seriously believe thar Australia is in the remotest danger of attack by Great Britain. France. Germany, the United States of America or Italy? able member does not believe that there is need for any defence measures to be taken. honourable member not to interrupt my",56,Budget 1935 36

59,Mr Brennan,"I appeal to thecarefully reasoned argument by irrelevant interjections. I shall welcome, of course, constructive interjections. No honourable member of this Parliament, and, I .believe, no sensible person in AusI distrust the judgment of militarytralia imagines that we are in the slightest danger of attack from any of the nations I have mentioned with the possible exception-and I say this deliberately-of Japan. When I mention Japan, please do not misunderstand me, or imagine that I suggest that in my opinion Australia is in the slightest danger of attack by Japan. But every other nation that I have mentioned must at once be ruled out of court as a possible aggressor. I make an exception in the case of Japan, first, because of its proximity, Yokohama being only 4,420 miles from Sydney; and, secondly, because of the unjust and provocative suspicion entertained by some people against this friendly country; and thirdly, because of the insults habitually offered to Japan by offensive critics who create a war atmosphere when they speak, and apparently, when they even think of Japan. Japan is the only possible aggressor against which we have to defend Australia. The honourable member for Lilley( Sir Donald Cameron) says that it is the duty of every nation, according to its state and power, to take proper measures for its own defence. I agree, and I take this opportunity to apologize to the honourable member for interrupting his interesting speech last night. I hardly know why I should have attempted to provoke one of the least provocative members in the chamber; but I confess that on this subject. I am easily provoked. I really think that I was excited last night, because although I was listening to the honourable member for LilleyI was looking at the Minister for Defence who was sitting opoosite me. We have reduced our possible aggressors to Japan. But we have no quarrel with Japan. On the contrary, we have a perfect understanding with that country, which was one of our allies during the Great War, and is still our friend, and one of our best customers. orable member that he is making war on Italy, and not I . That is the difference between us. I am not greatly concerned with the attitude of the military mind, which sees a danger of attack by Japan. v minded persons because warriors, in accordance with their trade, are expert in making wars. But even from the point of view of experts and the militarists, it can easily by demonstrated that it would be impracticable for Japan to land a hostile force in Australia, even if , on other grounds, such a thing were not almost unthinkable. In this connection I commend to honourable members a book entitled The Defence of Australia, by MrM . H . Ellis, a brother of a gentleman well known to members of ^ the Country party. He draws attention to the time taken, and the expense incurred, in landing 100,000 Australians in a foreign friendly port during the Great War. He points out that our troops were amply protected by convoys on their way to Europe; they were moved from one friendly port to another; they took with them no artillery or munitions, and no food except for the voyage; no huts or housing, and none of the campaigning necessities' which must go with the most ill-equipped force nosing into hostile territory and dependent on a long line of sea communications. Therefore, if we assume the absurd, namely, that Japan has the desire to attack Australia, we see how difficult, if not impossible, a successful invasion would be. Mr Ellis concludes by quoting a number of authorities. One of them, Mr Hector Byiwater, the English writer on naval affairs, considers that a force of 500,000 men would be necessary to subdue Australia, whilst a Japanese statesman, Count Soeshima, estimated the number of men at 1,000,000. I recommend the book to honourable members. Mr Ellis has set out in concise form a number of useful facts which go to show that, even from the point of view of a militarist, the invasion of Australia by Japan is a practical impossibility, a venture not likely to be undertaken by those shrewd naval and military gentlemen who control the affairs of the Japanese nation. He goes on to show that, even if such a force were landed, the position would be entirely different from the land-",58,Budget 1935 36

61,Mr Brennan,"I remind the honing of Australian forces in friendly territory. An invading army would land in unfriendly territory, and could be starved out of existence before it could make its presence seriously felt. I am not greatly concerned witb the militarist point of view, for I am convinced that those military experts whose opinions are of value know that the proposition is so preposterous as to be almost impossible. is armed. military experts who hold that view. honourable member to a publication in which a number of experts are mentioned. That is all that I can pause to do to-night, for only incidentally have I said that the successful landing of an armed force in Australia would be impracticable. I now say that such a thing is incredible. Assuming that we mind our own business, is there any instance in history of a highly-organized civilized nation making an unprovoked attack on another nation equally organized and civilized? many such instances. examples. There is most certainly not an instance of an unprovoked attack being made on a country 5,000 miles away from the base of the attacking nation. were the Conquestadores doing in America? ignorance, calumny, and insult can achieve disaster to almost any limit. But I do not advocate a policy of defence on that ground. Defence must be considered from the view-point that our people will conduct themselves decorously, and not interfere with or insult their neighbours. The honourable member for Lilley states that lack of defence is an invitation to attack, and cites the instance of Abyssinia to support his contention. I challenge that statement, because I believe it to be entirely wrong. In the times in which we live-and they are the only times in which we are interesteda nation invites attack by arming, sending out ships of war, and interfering with, challenging, threatening, and insulting other peoples. Those things constitute invitations to war; but minding one's own business, extending courtesy to others, and expressing goodwill are not invitations to war. Abyssinia is not a highlyorganized civilized nation, but a congeries of warring tribes. Its government is primitive ; its territory is within striking distance of Europe, and for many years it has been the hunting ground of competing imperialists and exploiters. Italy, France, and Britain have all been in the hunt. Disorganized, not in a military sense, which does not matter, but socially, Abyssinia has been a daw to peck at. The European countries which I have mentioned have all invested large sums of money in Abyssinia, and' avaricious speculators are exploiting the country. Abyssinia's defences have not counted, and do not count now. Italy's invasion of Abyssinia is not a war of conquest, but a massacre. When France and England blame Italy, the reply of Italy is, "" Well, you two ought not to talk "". None of the conditions which apply to Abyssinia a civilized people, with a highly organized form of government. The honpause for. orable member for Hume( Mr Collins) says that Australia is undeveloped, and he advocates the filling of our vast empty spaces. The truth is that we have, in a single century, made marvellous development politically and socially. As between our own people, we have much misused this continent, it is true, but as against the outside world we have a great record of achievement which extends from the time when our forefathers crossed the seas in the crazy vessels which brought them here. We have brought to bear the highest order of enterprise and intelligence, which has been expressed in terms of science and machinery, and we have applied to all a form of systematic and democratic government. And so, I ask-wh o has a better claim to Australia than the Australians themselves? It may be readily admitted that the distribution of the world's population is a problem. The natural increase of the population of Australia is admittedly too low. We have to justify before the bar of public",59,Budget 1935 36

I myself have some ideas on that subject also, but I have not time to develop them this evening. however, cannot be magnified into what may be called a. provocation to attack Australia. .Whether we view the matter from the point of view of the militarists who, I regret to say, are constantly making mischief, or from the point of view of the pacifists, the truth is that the only possible danger-that attack from our friendly ally, Japandoes not constitute a real menace to Australia at all, either actual, threatened or able, because the navies of the world probable. Therefore, the defence vote for Australia should be substantially and progressively reduced, instead of being, as suggested by the present Government, calamitously increased. I am justified in making that assertion, not only by reference to the actual requirements of the case, but also by reference to the fact scale here for an unlimited number of that such a reduction would be a friendly gesture of goodwill, and an inspiration to the whole world. As to the navy, if it should not be cut out altogether, expenditure upon it should be reduced to the very minimum for the reasons I have mentioned, and because our navy tends to bring us, as it has indeed brought us in the past, into conflict with other powers. I have heard honourable members speaking of HMAS. Australia which, I understand, is at present operating in the Mediterranean. I have had, on several occasions in this House, to protest against the use and misuse of Australian vessels associated with the British Navy in foreign waters. They have been used in a manner likely to provoke other nations, and to embroil Australia with countries with which we have no quarrel land defences might well consist of shore armaments only, and the harbours to our main cities are comparatively easily defended. We have disposed of the amusing theory of the "" quiet river "" invasion. It is, of course, true, and it is a fact that can neither be avoided nor denied, that a marauding naval vessel may conceivably fire shots into the coast of Australia, but that such a vessel could by those means do anything more than Mr Brennan. effect a certain amount of passing damage is absurd. Moreover, the possibility of such tactics being indulged in is no excuse whatever for hysterically increasing the burden of taxation for These problems, purposes of defence. It has been said that we must keep the trade routes open, and a good deal of nonsense has been spoken on that subject. The truth is that even the biggest fleet in the. world could not keep 12,000 miles of trade routes free from danger against the smallest navy in the world. Again, of an if we adopt for a moment the militarist point of view, an attack on a nonbelligerent on the open sea is unthinkwould be against the marauder It ought to be borne in mind that we are the most self-sufficient-in the sense of self-supporting-continen t in the world, and even with communications, cut off, we are in the unique position that we could sustain life on a high, years, assuming that a considerable section of the rest of the world had forfeited its sanity. It is worth mentioning in this connection that our friends the Japanese are not a migratory people. On page 24 of the book from which I have already quoted, appears the following passage:For one thing, the Japanese have not shown themselves an emigrating race. Outside their national surroundings they seem to be unhappy. It is rare for them to settle down permanently and colonize a strange land as do the Chinese. Where there aro 9,364,000 Chinese living and* multiplying overseas, 634,913 Japanese were abroad at the end of 1930.

71,Bill Brought Up By Mr Thobby And,"In Committee of Supply: (Consideration resumed). Although similar compliments have been voiced practically ad nauseum, I take this opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer ( Mr Oasey) upon his appointment. Werei t not for the fact that differing schools of political thought are so distinctly demarcated in this Parliament, one might have hoped that the new Treasurer would have taken advantage of the remarkable opportunity presented to him by such an appointment to introduce new budgetary methods. Unfortunately, the Treasurer has neglected to take advantage of this opportunity and has come before this Parliament merely as another exponent of the orthodox methods of finance. In so doing he is fundamentally opposed to the Labour party's ideas and ideals. The degree of divergence of opinion on financial matters in this and every Australian Parliament, and in parliaments in other parts of the world in which the Labour party is represented, is the main reason why Labour representatives cannot be members of a non-party government. Of recent years arguments have been advanced to prove that a government ""representative of all sections of the community"" is the most advantageous government for any community, and in certain countries endeavours have been made to establish governments of that nature. Whilst such governments may seem possible in theory, they have been proved altogether impossible in practice, for the reason that the political remedies put forward by the Labour party are totally incompatible with those advanced by anti-Labour parties. It would be as impossible for the Labour party to work in conjunction with an established political party of another colour as it would be for a modern surgeon to work in conjunction with a leech doctor who believes only in bleeding, which was the most advanced treatment known to medical science several centuries ago. Yet it is frequently suggested that co-operation of such <a character between our political doctors would provide the best remedy for the economic, political, financial, and social maladies from which the nation is suffering at the present time. No one would suggest that a doctor having at his command all the knowledge and appliances of modern medical science should collaborate with a doctor who adhered to methods belonging to ages that are dead. That analogy applies here. The Government party will not face the position as it exists to-day. It refuses to recognize the modern requirements of society and declines to plan its programmes to cope with new ideas in order that it might march forward step by step; it refuses to recognize that conditions to-day are no longer static, but dynamic, and that in order to meet such conditions it is necessary to prepare and propound new programmes. Fir3t of all, for instance, we should realize that the use of money in commerce is comparatively a new practice in the history of nations; to-day money is regarded as the whole source of wealth; and its real use for the purposes of exchange of goods and services is disregarded. Recognizing the real purpose of money, and that this nation, as the previous speaker pointed out, is one of the wealthiest in the world, that it produces practically all the necessaries of life, as well as many commodities required for the higher well-being of a community, I suggest-and it is the policy of the party I represent-that more effective use should be made of the credit sources of this nation for the purpose of enabling the goods that are produced in such abundance to be distributed amongst the people who are in dire need of them. The Labour party suggests that the credit sources of the nation, which at the present time are largely unemployed, should.be employed to the fullest extent. To-day, State governments are endeavouring, to the best of their ability, to increase spending power within their particular boundaries, but they find it necessary to increase that spending power by means of loan money borrowed from private banking institutions. Leading economists, excepting some who are in the employ of certain banks and mainly for that reason propagate different views, suggest that such a policy is the only one which can be truly effective. We suggest that economic policies should not be effectuated by means of loan moneys borrowed from private banks, but by means of credits",61,Wheat And Wheat Products

The objection will be offered, no doubt, that such a suggestion is tantamount to inflation, but I point out that every time a private banking institution allows an overdraft or issues an advance of credit, it is, to that extent inflating the amount of credit then existing in the community, just as every treasury-bill issued inflates-o r to use the latest term-reflate s the amount of credit in the community. A reflationary financial policy has been suggested in many countries as the only policy which will assist nations out of the morass of debt in which they are floundering. In order to effectuate such a policy, so that it will not place a country deeper in debt, the credit required should be obtained from a bank which is representative of and controlled by the nation. ""We in Australia are in a fortunate position in this respect. An opportunity is presented to-day to paytribute to the foresight of those members of the Labour party who, a quarter of a century ago, established the Commonwealth Bank in the teeth of bitter opposition from the political prototypes and predecessors of those honourable members who support this Government. While believing that eventually in order to operate this policy, it will be necessary to improved bring about control of the banking system by the nation, and while recognizing what a tremendous advance such a step would be and that those responsible for it would be entitled to full credit, nevertheless I believe that the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank by the Labour party a quarter of a century ago, in view of the state of political opinion at the time, was in many respects a greater and more difficult achievement. I give full credit to Mr of poverty-lac k of food, clothing King O'Malley who was the guiding spirit behind the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, an institution which assisted in raising almost £300,000,000 of loan money to finance Australia's participation in the war, and also financed this nation to the amount of £1,000,000,000 for products produced and exported to Great Britain and other countries during the war. The Treasurer, speaking last week at a there is no promise that it will gathering in Melbourne, stated that the escape altogether from its effects. Aussole reason for the institution of the pretralia is in the position of a ship sent banking commission was that though which has been on its beam ends 3fr. Baker. 85 per cent, of the community were in more or less comfortable circumstances the other 15 per cent, were not so happily situated. The honourable gentleman must have ignored all the figures which have been quoted in this Parliament time and again, not only by honourable members on this side, but also by honourable members opposite. It is a well recognized fact that 25 per cent, of the people have not the means to lead a normal life and that a great many other persons are not by any means in the happy state enjoyed, as the honourable gentleman would have us believe, by 85 per cent, of the population. In addition, every year over 100^000 youths throughout Australia are added to the ranks of the unemployed. These are the problems which have to be faced by this Government, but although two governments led by the present Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) have been in office for four years no definite constructive effort has been made to deal with them. I am convinced that no method of dealing with our problems oan be successful unless the amount of credit in circulation in the community is increased. I realize, of course, as has been argued by honourable members opposite, that conditions have to some slight extent within recent years. That is merely because this country in common with other countries is rising out of the trough of the -depression. Within the last 150 years, since the beginning of tbe machine age, there have been eighteen definite depressions, each worse than its immediate predecessor. But whereas in the past depression and its attendant miseries were the result and other requirements for a decent livelihood-the world is to-day experiencing a depression of plenty; we are suffocating beneath a blanket of abundance. The difficulty is that that plenty is not being distributed to the people in need of it. And though, to some extent, despite rather than because of the actions of this Government, Australia has recovered slightly from the depression, but at the last minute, has righted itself. But even if the ship of state has been able to get back to an even keel the fact is obvious to any one willing to give interested attention to the subject that there will be future depressions, each worse than its immediate predecessor, and a time must come when the economic system will be crushed by its own weight, unless a government with sufficient foresight has taken preventive measures in advance. I suggest that the most rapid method of dealing with the problem is to increase the internal purchasing power of the community. .'Domestic government can have no effect upon our external income, but our internal income is totally dependent upon the policy adopted by the reigning government of the day. This suggestion has been put forward by numbers of economists and in particular by a previous Treasurer at the Premiers conference in February, 1931. It was suggested at that time that sufficient credit should be pumped into the community to bring price levels, which, of course, rise with an increase of the currency, up to the 1928-29 figure. In those years price levels were more stable than they had been for many years past. During 1928, for example, the commodity price level was 1800: during 1929 it rose to 1803, while in December, 1930, it fell very rapidly to 1399. It was also estimated at that time, and no facts have emerged to disprove the estimate, that if the purchasing power of the community were increased to the extent proposed employment would be provided for 100,000 to 200,000 persons who were then out of work. If that had been done the income of the nation would have been increased by from £9,000,000 to £10,000,000 The expenditure of large amounts that at present' have to be paid for interest, sinking fund, and the relief of unemployment would be avoided. I believe that it is the only method under which we can hope to effect any substantial lightening of the taxation burden at present resting on our people. The Government argues in favour of the reduction of taxes. There can be no reduction while large sums are needed to pay for necessary services. It is noticeable that tarily enlisted men, more or less without banking, insurance, mortgage and investment companies, which through their general managers and other spokesmen, are the most insistent advocates of the reduction of taxes, are the very concerns for which the bulk of the taxation is levied, because they aro the principal recipients of the amounts disbursed by way of interest on internal and external loans. They -are thus placed in an inconsistent and untenable position. Yet they are the first to raise a cry against repudiation whenever it is suggested that there should be a lowering of their receipts. Obviously, the taxe3 which they are called upon, to pay cannot be reduced unless the burden is taken from one class and placed upon another, or unless some means are found whereby the aggregate income of the community can be increased. I have suggested the only possible course; but it is objected to by these institutions because, although they would save a certain sum in the taxes that they pay, they would lose considerably more in the profits made from the millions"" of pounds which they now lend to 'the nation, but which would, under another system, be issued through the Commonwealth Bank. It is also astonishing to find that so many of the persons who stand to benefit most from such a policy of increased spending power throughout the community-pastoralists , graziers, and others who would be able to sell a much larger volume of their goods on the best possible market, the home market-ar e opposed to it. At the present time references are frequently being made in this Parliament to the possibility of Australia being involved in war at an early date. According to the nature of the political views that we hold, we are endeavouring either to impose or to prevent the imposition of sanctions. It is recognized on every hand that in the ultimate event if this nation is compelled to proceed from economic and financial to military sanctions it will have to find a considerable amount of money for the enforcement of those military sanctions. An estimatp cannot be made of what a great war in the near future would cost this country. The leaders of Australia went into the last war almost lightheartedly, and made to Great Britain the offer of 20,000 volunany consideration of the probable cost. Eventually Australia sent 350,000 men. We have now had experience of the cost of a great war. Up to the present the cost to Australia of the last war has been £850,000,000, and we are still expending in respect of obligations arising out of the war approximately per annum. Eor many years to come, almost certainly untiPtne end of the present century, the Australian Government will have to meet commitments in that regard. That that is not an exaggeration of the prospect is shown by the fact that the. Government of the United States of America is still paying a large number of pensions arising out of the civil war that took place in the 'sixties of the last usntury, ancl, in addition, pensions to Seven descendants of persons who saw service in a war in which that nation was involved in 1812. Yet, quite lightheartedly, almost casually, and careless of the expense involved, the Government is preparing to engage in another holocaust. At the moment, I am dealing with, not the greatest cost of all,' that of future war loans, undertook, by merely human life, but merely the hundreds of millions of pounds that would have to be raised to finance such an undertaking. No honourable member opposite has expressed the slightest fear that any difficulty would be experienced in providing finance to whatever amount was required and for whatever period the war might continue. sufficient to convince all sections of the community that no honourable member, at least on the Government side, has any doubt as to the ability of this nation, when required, to meet whatever commitments may be laid upon it. We, on this side, contend that the sufferings of the people during the last five years have in many cases been worse than those endured during the war, for the reason that wartime sacrifices fell with the greatest severity on the most fit section of the community-the during the poverty competition, in which Australia has been engaged within the last five years, the misery has been felt most severely by the women and children dependants of breadwinners who have been unemployed. It is necessary for this Government to tackle the serious problem of unemployment. Yet it suggests that it can Mr Baker. find an unlimited amount of money to finance any stray war that looms on the horizon, but would have us believe that it is impossible to provide the money necessary to ensure continuous employment for the 400,000 people in this coun£20,000,000 try who are so much in need of it. I regret the method which, was adopted, not only in Australia, but in Great Britain and other countries, to finance the Great War. Instead of drawing upon the financial reserves of the nation, loans were raised through private banks with the result that the public debt of Australia was increased by hundreds of millions of pounds, and that of Great Britain rose to the almost unbelievable amount of £8,000,000,000 upon which hundreds of millions of pounds have been and are still being paid as interest. This terrible burden of capital and interest debt need not have been laid upon the people of this country. After the first or second loan had been raised, the banks, in order to encourage investments by the public in book entries, -to provide 90 per cent, of all subscriptions by their customers, who, by that act, becamo indebted to the banks to the full amount. This action in that crisis was clear evidence of the power of private banks to extend credit. I am not suggesting that individual banks could extend credit That, of itself, should be to an unlimited amount. It is obvious that they must work in collaboration with the Commonwealth Bank which controls the note issue; but under a coordinated system it is possible for private banks to grant credits equal to about ten times the amount of their cash reserves. If one bank departed from this arrangement and extended credit beyond the agreed limit, the mechanism of the system would be thrown out of gear, and the bank concerned would be exposed to the risk of a run on its reserves bymale section-but depositors. But whilst the banks keep in step and do not extend credit beyond the agreed ratio, there is not this danger. I am not forgetting, of course, the effect of an expansion of credit upon price levels of commodities. Since the prices of raw materials govern the prices of manufactured goods, careful regard must be had for the index figure of price levels in the management of a reformed banking policy which immense value to the nation in time of need. I believe that reform along the lines which I have indicated is the only method for the stabilization of currency. ""Whilsti t is obvious to those who have studied the problem of monetary reform -exceptin g Douglas Credit and suchlike theorists-that monetary reform of itself is not the remedy for all -the evils from which the nation is suffering, I am convinced that it would be the most important first step, and that it would be of immense advantage to the community because it would pave the way to a reduction of the hours of labour in industry and the eventual absorption of private enterprise by State enterprise. The only argument that can be advanced against a nation having full control of its banking system is that there might jiot be the same 'Confidence in .the ma-Mgement.; that private banking institutions are more likely to safeguard the interests of depositors. My reply to that .argument is that thousands of hanks ia the United States of America have gone into liquidation during the last few years, and many private banks in England were also in grave difficulties during the last century. An outstanding example of the inability of private banks to emerge successfully from -a financial crisis was the series of bank failures in Australia in 1893. The ''Story of the Commonwealth Bank and the Note Issue, a booklet published by D. J . Amos, an Adelaide writer, -quotes Amstey's denunciation of private banks in these wordsTlie"" Commercial "" waa the most notorious ment)-put . The committee divided. -of the defaulting -banks. per cent, dividend, and then closed its doors upon 30,000 depositors and millions of deposits. .the deposits as '"" preference "" capital, and gave receipts 'on the indefinite future for the two-thirds balance. "" Commercial's "" example, and thousands of depositors were left penniless, compelled, to sell their deposit receipts and their compulsory shares for a fraction of their face value. The directors of these fiduciary institutions had cross-loaned to each other enormous sums of other people's money, yet while they were pushing other people to the wall, tbey conspired w i th each 'O'hhcr, met in .secret, and wiped off their mutual obligations for a few pence or <Mie farthing in the pound. assets, gave each other -clean receipts, and got through the legislature of the State an act of Parliament making it an offence for any [45] would be of person or newspaper to give publicity to their scandalous, secret "" compositions"". They not only wiped off each other's debts to the institutions tbey controlled, wbose depositors' money they had borrowed, upon whose remaining assets they had foreclosed, but from these foreclosed funds they again "" borrowed"" to purchase the scrip and deposit receipts of the thousands they had ruined. Thus these financiers, trusted custodians of other men's money, emerged from the struggle more wealthy than ever. After the bank smash in 1893, years before Labour attained power, an anti-Labour government in Queensland caused several inquiries to be held, and it was found .that the Premier of the -day, Sir Thomas McHwraith, had borrowed from the Queensland National Bank about £300,000 for which there were practically no securities. The Premier disappeared overseas in order to avoid the inquiry. I also refer honourable members opposite to a speech made in the New South ""Wales Parliament a few months ago by Mr Ryan, now a member of the Stevens Government. On that occasion he bitterly 'attacked the English, Scottish and Australian Bank. The three banks to which I have referred were the worse offenders in the smash. There was unimpeachable evidence that their shareholders made vast profits out of the catastrophe. There could be no more damning indictment of the activities of the private ( banking institutions than their actions in Australia in the .great bank smash of 1893. -member's time has expired.

Tliere are at present 80 tenancies (50 .1-rooms and 38 5-rooms) and the rentals charged are 5s, Od. and 9s. per week respectively, including Bcwerage and water rates. Electricity is connected and individual tenants ft re expected to pay fur current consumed. Education fncilities aro also provided. All services are inaiutaincd at the expense of the iJovcrnment and considerable expenditure has been inenrrud in other necessary items of maintenance, including repairs to doors, windows, roofs, &c. The approximate cost to tlie Commonwealth of the dwellings occupied at Molonglo was about £40,000. About SO per vent, of the tenants at Molonglo are in arrears of rent, varying in amounts up to about £155. the total arrears approximating £2,800. The total rental payable in respect of the dwellings is about £1.628 per annum, but no separate record is kept of the total rentals collected from tenants at Molonglo as distinct from those in other localities. In 1931, when an opportunity arose for the demolition of soiue <II the buildings, demolition was commenced, but the then Minister for Home Affairs directed that tbe work be not proceeded with in order to allow of temporary shelter being made available for non-permanent residents in necessitous circumstances. Adverse comment has been made in the press concerning ""slum conditions "" but these references have been, in fact still are, resented by a number of the residents. A letter in this regard, signed by reputable tenants, appeared in the Canberra Times on the 23rd March, 1935. From time to time applications have been received from tenants at Molonglo, who were desirous of transferring to the Causeway and elsewhere, but a number of these have subsequently intimated that they do not desire to njove. This is no doubt actuated by reason of the fact that their present rents are reasonable, tind they have made themselves couifortuble in their homes, due mainly to the assistance afforded by the department by way of maintenance. Karly in 1935, several tenants at Molonglo, who had been offered superior accommodation at the Causeway refused to leave their Molonglo homes. With regard to the erection of houses to meet the situation the present building programme provides for some of these to be b u i l t at Ainslie, and some nt Kingston-the latter for occupation by tenants the nature of whose employment warrants their allocation of houses in that locality. It is proposed to give some of the Molonglo tenants who are regularly employed, and whose rental position is satisfactory, tbe opportunity of transferring to the new houses, whilst tboso who are iu arrears w ill be housed elsewhere as opportunity offers.
