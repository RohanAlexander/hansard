95,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper,"Treafor Works and Railways) [11.9] I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-21, the following work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report, viz.:-Sydney General Post Office-Extension of the installation of Mail Handling Appliances. The proposal for installing mail handling appliances in the Sydney General Post Office was referred to the Public Works Committee in 1926, and following a second reference to that body Parliament agreed in December, 1927, to proposed extensions of the scheme. Certain alterations have become necessary consequent upon tbe decision to adopt the alphabetical system of sorting. These alterations will involve certain increased costs, of wbich the following are the principal:-Lifts and elevators, £6,000; conveyors, £14,031; sorting machines, posting slips, clearing machine, £3,410; overhead runaways, £1,310; mail chutes, £260; tracks for trucks, £660. The increased cost of the revised scheme is estimated at £32,500. This work is urgent, because the quantity of mail matter handled in the Sydney Post Office is increasing rapidly, and it is desirable that the new installation should be completed at an early date. tbe Public Works Committee on two previous occasions, what is the reason for a further reference? ---The handling of mails at the General Post Office, Sydney, has been brought under my notice, and I have been informed that the alphabetical system of sorting has involved considerable delays in the delivery of letters. Not only is this system less efficient, but it bas the effect of depriving a large number of postal workers of tbeir employment. I am opposed to any system which is less efficient and at the same time has the effect of dismissing employees. Will tbe Postmaster-General state whether this criticism of the alphabetical sorting is correct, and whether, if some men are to be displaced, employment will be found for tbem elsewhere? master-General and Minister for Works and Railways) '[11.111] -On two previous occasions this work was considered by the Public Works Committee, which was informed that after tbe trial of certain machinery in Melbourne some alterations in the scheme proposed for Sydney might be necessary. Mr Brown bas since investigated these matters in England, America and Germany, and it is now thought necessary that certain alterations should be effected, and particularly that tbe width of the conveyor belts should be increased. That is the main alteration that is proposed. I assure tbe bonorable member for. West Sydney( Mr Beasley) that the introduction of the alphabetical system of sorting will not cause tbe services of mail sorters to be dispensed witb, but will considerably expedite tbeir work. Question resolved in the affirmative. That the House at its rising adjourn until Monday next at 3 p.m. In committee-(Consideratio n resumed from the 7th March, vide page 902). Clause2 (Validation of agreement.) progress was reported last night I was contending that this agreement had been accepted by ^he States under duress, and in support of that statement. I quoted from a speech by Mr L. L. Hill, Leader of the Opposition in tbe South Australian Parliament. MrH ill said alsoI t is no use members opposite trying to slielter themselves behind the fact that Western Australia, Tasmania and other States accepted the agreement. were after the repeal of the act. Mr Hill's speech contains many similar statements, and tbe belief is general in South Australia that tbe States were compelled to accept tbe agreement because this Parliament had already discontinued tbe per capita payments.

102,Mr Reidy,"You must take things as theyof the moral or the legal rights of the Sir Jobn Cockburn, also of South AusStates to the per capita payments has tralia, at tbe third session of the Federal been raised. I have always contended Convention held in Melbourne in 1898, that the States have a moral right to somo saidform of payment from tbe Commonwealth. When they entered the federation the States to place the Federal Parliament as they were led to believe that they would a sort of Lord Bountiful over the States to receive, if not a definite proportion of whom the customs revenue, then a per capita Federal Parliament might render financial payment or some other form of assistance aid to any State in such manner as it thought from the Commonwealth. ber's view is more favorable than that of the right bonorable member for Balaclava, wbo says that this agreement is a poor business deal. The States, wheu tbe Commonwealth was formed, surrendered certain powers, and therefore they have a moral rigbt to assistance from the Commonwealth. the then Eederal Attorney-General( Sir Littleton Groom), as reported in Hansard,, saidI t was well understood and appreciated liy persons of all shades of political opinion that, from the very structure of the Constitution, from thc very nature of the powers committed to us, and of necessity, the States should participate to a large extent in the revenue raised from these sources (customs and excise). Let me give the committee the opinions of some of the eminent gentlemen who guided the destinies of South Australia at the time of federation. Sir Frederick Holder, at the second session of the Federal Convention held in Sydney in 1S97, saidA federation in which the Federal authority is not interested in the solvency and prosperity of the States is such a thing that we ought not to consider for a moment. In fact our first duty to-day is, and I think I can go further and say that the first duty of the Federal Parliament of the future will be, to conserve the interests of the States. The success of federation itself must depend on the success of every State in it , and tlierefore in arguing for the strength and financial stability of the StatesI am arguing not for that which is parochial but for that which is essential to the success aud strength of the Commonwealtli itself. I do not know a treasurer or a budding treasurer who would be willing to go back to his colony and advocate iiny system of federation which did not provide for -the return of practically the whole of the sum now collected from customs and excise to the State from the Federal authority. It would certainly sap the independence of made. ad misericordiam appeals could be The whole proposal (that the fit) is foreign to the spirit of the Constitution. The thing will not bear a moment's consideration. Those statements may be applied in many respects to the position in wbich tbe States now find themselves because of accepting tbe financial agreement. In the first place it will sap the independence of tbe States, because tbey will be forced from time to time to go cap in hand to tbe Commonwealth for grants-in-aid to tide tbem over tbeir financial difficulties. It is not right to place the States in that position. I could quote many more eminent authorities who are in agreement with tbe views of Sir Frederick Holder and Sir Jobn Cockburn. Tbe States certainly have a moral right to some form of assistance from tbe Commonwealth. From between tbe commencement of federation and 1910, tbe States received 75 per cent of the customs and excise revenue. During that period South Australia received an additional amount under the Surplus Revenue Act. In 1901-2 that State received from the Commonwealth £332,239, and in 1909-10, £803,057. During the first ten years of federation, South Australia received 80.44 per cent, of the customs and excise revenue collected within its borders. Tbat high percentage was obtained because of a grant to South Australia under the Surplus Revenue Act. Under the per capita payment of 25s., South Australia received last year 16.96 per cent, of tbe customs and excise revenue collected in that State. Tbat is a tremendous decrease. Western Australia and Tasmania are suffering to tbe same extent. Had tbe first agreement operated during tbe period of the per capita system, South Australia would bave received an additional £9,000,000. Tbat State is in a precarious position. Its people contribute largely to the customs and excise revenue,. although tbey bave not tbe advantages",19,Financial Agreement Validatio N Bill
103,Mr Rodgers,The bonorable mem,20,Financial Agreement Validatio N Bill
104,Mr Lacey,"Tbat is so. In 1910of the people in the eastern States, who benefit from the many industries that are there established. therefore, has a logical case for additional assistance. Although its indirect taxation under the customs and excise duties has increased enormously, its population has not increased in proportion, mainly because it has few factories compared with the other States. The honourable member for Angas( Mr Parsons) last night said that during the election campaign he had advised his constituents to vote for the referendum because, if carried, it meant tbe ratification of this agreement. It meant nothing of tbe kind. As I pointed out in my opening remarks last night, the figures that were submitted to honourable members last year by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) have not yet been answered by tbe Government. I advise the honourable member for Angas to study those figures. They show that South Australia, during the next 58 years, the period of the agreement, would under the per capita system receive £72,000,000; but under the agreement it will receive only £41,000,000, a difference of £31,000,000. Tbat applies generally to the whole of the States. Under the per capita system the States, during tbe next 58 years, would have received £823,000,000, but under tbe agreement tbey will receive only £440,000,000, a difference of £383,000,000. It is also alleged that the States will be better off under tbe new arrangement because of tbe provision of sinking funds for old and new debts. I understand that the States will be better off, not for the next twenty years, as has been stated, but only for the next five years; and thereafter they will gradually lose revenue. Last evening the honourable member for Swan( Mr posals in this agreement, but eventually Gregory) spoke in opposition to the agreement; but he failed to record a vote on the second reading; in fact, be ran away. On page 3779 of Hansard, 9th March, 1928, the honourable member for Swan, after hearing the speech of tbe honourable member for Perth, saidOn Wednesday niglit tlie honourable member ment with the principle he enunciated, but for Perth brought forward some astounding figures showing the ultimate effect of the financial agreement on the States. He was in agreement with the honourable member for Perth because he said that Sir. Lacey. that honourable member's case had not been answered by the Government, yet South Australia, last night when be bad an opportunity to oppose the agreement he did not record his vote, despite the fact that Western Australia will suffer under this agreement to the same extent as South Australia. TheH ill Labour Government appointed a royal commission to inquire into the disabilities which South Australia bas suffered through federation and tbe then Leader of tbe Opposition, Mr Butler, was a member of it. Before the commission was able to complete its work, an election occurred and the H ill Government was defeated. The Butler Government, upon assuming office, abolished the commission appointed by the H ill Government, and appointed a commission of experts to report upon the same subject. Tbis commission accepted the evidence given before tbe commission appointed by the H ill Government, and did not call any additional witnesses. It ultimately reported that South Australia had suffered to the extent of £750,000 a year through federation. In the light of that report, Mr Butler, as Premier of tbe State, should have done everything in his power to cause tbe Commonwealth Government to grant South Australia some relief. He had a great opportunity to make effective representations along this line at the first Premiers' Conference be attended, for the agreement now before us was considered at it ; but he failed to do so. As a matter of fact, one of the reasons which makes me suspect the value of this agreement to tbe States is that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are so anxious to secure its ratification. When the Premiers met the Prime Minister and Treasurer, they almost unanimously opposed the prothey agreed to them. Mr Butler is reported to have made the following remarks at the conferenceI listened with great interest to the Prime Minister's explanation of his Government's proposal and I was struck with the soundness of his arguments. I am in entire agreein the inatter of detail his proposal requires amendment. Although on that occasion he neglected to request the Commonwealth Government to make a grant-in-aid to South Australia, Mr Butler afterwards wrote to every member of this Parliament representing a South Australian constituency and requested that an effort should be made to get tbe Commonwealth to assist the State. In my opinion, Mr Butler fell upon the neck of the Prime Minister simply because be belonged to the same political party; but that does not excuse him for failing to make use of the great opportunity he had, to cause a provision to be inserted in the agreement to ensure that South Australia and other States similarly situated,should be treated in a fair and reasonable manner. On the eve of the last federal election, the Commonwealth Government appointed a royal commission to inquire into the financial affairs of South Australia. There was no necessity for this to be done, for two royal commissions had already made a similar inquiry. It was a piece of political propaganda designed to mislead the people. But the commission having made its inquiries, the Government should defer tbe discussion on the bill until the report is before us. member's time bas expired. -S o much bas been said recently about tbe financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States in general and on this agreement in particular, that it is difficult to break any new ground. No new arguments have been advanced recently in support of the agreement, and nothing very fresh bas been said against it. However, I desire to make one or two observations on the following aspects of the subject: whether the States are desirous of retaining the -per capita system; whether it should be abrogated; and whether the present proposal is just. I have read many extracts from speeches made years ago by tbe framers of our Constitution, and tbe conclusion arrived at is that men like Deakin, Barton, Reid, Cook, Pisher, Dugald Thompson and others did not assume that the per capita payments should be continued for ail time. Any impartial student of the subject must admit that the per capita system was adopted as a temporary expedient, to ensure the acceptance by the States of the Draft Constitution. The Braddon section of the Constitution, which was the forerunner of the per capita system, was not acceptable to New South Wales until a provision was inserted that it should not continue for more than ten years. At the , end of that period, the per capita system was adopted, and the period of its operation was also limited to ten years. During the whole of that decade, repeated attacks were made upon it, and it was quite evident that it was never regarded as other than an expedient until a more permanent settlement could be reached of the financial relations of tbe Commonwealth and tbe States. All that the framers of the Constitution contended for was the ensuring of tbe financial security of tbe States. As far back as 1908, Mr Andrew Fisher proposed, to pay £5,000,000 to the States annually for a number of years towards the interest on their debts "" as an equivalent to the 25s. per head."" He subsequently increased the proposed amountto £7,500,000. His scheme was not accepted and I submit that tbe per capita scheme bas, for a number of years, shown unmistakable signs of breaking down. South Australia has proposed that the distribution of the Commonwealth aid to the States should be on tbe basis of State debts. Tasmania, on tbe other hand, made a proposal that the available money should be distributed on the following basis:25s. per .head for New South Wales and Victoria; 30s. for Queensland and South Australia; 40s. for Western Australia, and 50s. for Tasmania. tial payments exists in both Canada and the United States of America. fication for its adoption here. The Tasmanian suggestion would be unacceptable to the great majority of Australian elecPremier of Queensland, has also opposed the per capita system. At tbe conference of Premiers, he saidA State with a large aud increasing population, because of the establishment of secondary industries in the favoured centres of population, would' receive increasing payments out of all proportion to those received by a primary-producing State, and would to that extent give to the wealthier States the greater proportion of the customs revenue. That is the most vulnerable point in regard to the",20,Financial Agreement Validatio N Bill

No doubt that State would pay the revenue because the customs revenue is collected from the people individually who buy these goods in the markets of the States; but where a Commonwealth is founded for mutual protection io all the interests embraced within that Commonwealth, it would be a much wiser policy to adopt some system that would at least help the weaker States or the States that were not so favourably situated for the establishment of secondary industries. Consequently, wo get to the point where we have to view this loss by the larger States from the broader or wider Australian point of view, and from that viewpoint the agreement has advantages over the present system. Mr Lyons, wlio attended the same conference, as the Labour Premier of Tasmania, made these remarksMr Lang suggests that the Commonwealth should continue paying to the States on amount based on the schedule in the States Grants Act, and that any increase based on the growth of population be credited to the sinking fund. I could not support such a proposal for a moment. It would, not compare favourably with the present proposals now before conference, because the States with the quickly increasing population would receive more than the smaller States. These extracts from the speeches of Premiers of the different States show clearly that the per capita system has always been regarded as an expedient. The right bonorable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) told us last night that he had never been enamoured of the per capita system. not say that in 1919. Mr Watt, who was then Treasurer, proposed to take 15s. off the per capita, payments, by reducing them by 2s. 6d. or Is. yearly, as might be decided upon. There was undoubtedly grave resentment against what was regarded as the unfair operation of the system, and this would mately have resulted . in the withdrawal of the payments, even if this agreement had not been entered into. Permit referendum tbe conviction ing for the issue submitted referendum, gave their tacit approval to this agreement. not shared by every one, not even by all bonorable members on this side of the House. I have my own views on the matter. am convinced that the electors assented Mr ParkMU. by sucb an overwhelming majority to tbe amendment of tbe Constitution because they believed that it would lead to the ratification of the present agreement. It was known by tbe public that the agreement had been accepted by a conference of State Premiers; that it had been accepted by every State Parliament, Labour and Nationalist in Australia; and that it bad been in operation for two years since June, 1927. Moveover, the defeat of successive referendum proposals for the amendment of the Constitution has been a somewhat melancholy aspect, of Australian political history; yet, in spite of the electors past reluctance to interfere with tbe provisions of the Constitution, the proposals in the last referendum were agreed to by a majority of nearly 1,500,000. It is true that tbe electors voted to give power to tbe Commonwealth to make agreements with tbe States, but I submit that the present financial agreement, which bas been subscribed to by all the State governments, was the particular agreement which tbe electors had in mind when they were voting. Tbe electors recognized that under this agreement millions of pounds which had formerly been paid to the States by way of per capita grants, would be applied to the payment of interest, and the reduction of debts Tbe ComB u t he did monwealth Government proposed, witb tbe concurrence of tbe States, that Australia should start to pay her debts, and that proposal was, I believe, understood and assented to by the great majority of the decent citizens of tbe country. The referendum figures u l t ii n New South Wales were: In favour of the proposal, 754,446; against the proposal, 415,84)6. There was thus a large vote against the referendum prome to now refer to the posals in New South Wales, and that was on the amendment of due to the attitude of Mr Lang, tbe State Constitution. It is my firm Labour leader. While tbe campaign that the electors in votdirector, the honourable member for Dalley at tbe ( Mr Theodore) was telling tbe electors to vote "" Yes,"" Mr Lang was advising the I know that this view is Labour supporters to vote "" No."" Tbe fact that nearly 500,000 followed his advice shows that he has more influence That is immaterial to me; in New South Wales than any other I Labour leader, Eederal or State. Why did Mr Lang oppose the agreement? He electors to vote "" No,"" he understood that himself states quite clearly his reasons. if the referendum were carried, this Here is what he said"" My advice to yon is to vote ' No ' on the Let me now quote what Mr Hill, the referendum issue, If you vote ' Yes' and it Leader of the Labour party in South is carried New South Wales w ill cease to be Australia, said on this mattera sovereign .State. If the proposed alterations to the Constitution were going to give you unification, or would lead to unification, there would be some justification. They are not going to lead to unification, and they are not going'to accord the Federal Parliament control of the finances of New South Wales. If you vote 'Yes,' you are going to allow Ministers of tlie Crown from various States who compose the Loan Council to say how much money you can borrow."" The n he goes o n to say t h a t the f in a n c i a l proposals w o u l d hamper the operations of the N e w S o u t h Wales Government. MrL a n g opposed the agreement because, he said, it w o u l d in t e r f e r e w it b tbe r i g h t s of ment which was published in the AdelaideN e w S o u t h Wales as a sovereign State. W h a t has the Leader of tbe O p p o s it i o n in t h is House( MrS c u l l in ) to say on t h a t point? M a r c h last, he s a i d I stand for this Parliament having sovereign powers and the States having only delegated powers. Some people call that unification. I am not afraid of the term. If it is unification to set up in Australia u National Parliament with complete power and State Parliaments with delegated power, then I am a unificationist. I do not think we should have only one Parliament, but we should . have only one sovereign Parliament. Thus, the Leader of the Labour party in this House differs radically on this subject from the Leader of the Labour party in the State of New South Wales, and with the Labour party's platform which provides for the absorption of State Parliaments and the creation of provincial local governing bodies. fact, the voices of the several Labour leaders and the Labour platform on this issue constitute a veritable babel. Mr Lang also opposed the agreement because of its loan provisions. Now, that is the very point that commends it to the Leader of the Federal Opposition, and the Labour party generally. They are opposed to tbe abolition of the per capita payments, but the honourable member for Yarra, in a speech in March last to which I listened with pleasure, said quite clearly that the State debts should be taken over by the Commonwealth. I submit that when Mr Lang advised tbe Financial Agreement would be ratified.' In my opinion the safe course for the electors of this State is to vote "" No "" . If the referendum is defeated .the Commonwealth Government must then completely review the financial position. Tbat statement provides clear evidence that MrH ill recognized that if the referendum were carried this agreement would be ratified, because be said that if the proposals were defeated the Federal Government would have to review its financial arrangements. I wisb now to put on record a stateRegister on Monday, 25th February, which, to my mind, succinctly sums up tbe situation. Tbe statement is as folS p e a k i ng on the agreement in lows :A ll the State Governments and Parliaments have accepted the financial agreement, which is actually in operation. The people, by referendum, have affirmed tlie Commonwealth's general right to make such agreements, the present scheme being particularly before them. On whose behalf then, can the opponents of this Financial Agreement B ill speak? -They cannot pretend to be championing the cause of the States, since the elected representatives of the States have overwhelmingly accepted the agreement. Nor can they contend that they are expressing popular opinion as against the majority votes in the Parliaments, as the electors have tacitly approved of the scheme. They are entitled to oppose the bill if they think the agreement is bad business for the Commonwealth, but that view has not been seriously put forward. In This agreement provides for three things: the taking over of State debts to the extent of £600,000,000, and the payment annually of £7,585,000 interest by the Commonwealth; the establishment of a sinking fund of 7s. 6d., to which the Commonwealth shall contribute 2s. 6d., amounting* annually to approximately £850,000, to redeem tbe debts in 5S years. The establishment of a sinking fund of 10s. for all new loans, on which the Commonwealth shall pay 5s. and which will involve the payment of £100,000 on every £40,000,000 raised. It also provides for an increase of interest on transferred property from 3 i per cent, to 5 per cent. After twenty years of discussion on this vexed question, I hope that finality ""will at last he reached. Under these proposals the evil of one government raising money for another government to spend will be largely removed; not entirely, but, at any rate, the money raised by the Oommonwealth will be hypothecated for purposes of which tbe people have approved. The present uncertainty in the financial affairs of the States will be removed. The States will receive fair treatment, while the three great principles essential to the consummation of federation, and the development of our national life, will be achieved; first, the provision of financial security for the States; secondly, tbe transfer of debts; and thirdly, the common control of borrowing. I believe that no more important question has ever engaged the attention of this House. I believe that no question is of greater importance than this to the growth and development of Australia on national lines. I congratulate the Prime Minister and members of the Government on taking their political lives in their bands and courageously and persistently carrying this proposal through from stage to stage. The importance and magnitude of their work may be to-day obscured by the haze and smoke of party prejudice, and internecine jealousy. But as independent public organs and institutions to-day recognize the intrinsic value of the work being done, so I believe that posterity will not withhold from the Prime Minister and members of the Government their praise and appreciation for the statesmanlike work they are doing in initiating and completing the present Einancial Agreement. The spectacle of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) referring disparagingly to party prejudices is enough to make the angels weep. He 'rarely rises to speak without referring to his friend, Mr Lang. He produces this King Charles's head, and when this fails him, be goes across the New South Wales border into Queensland, and refers to the woeful condition of the unfortunate people of Queensland. The honourable gentleman, in his own mind, haa settled the matter now before the committee, and, of course, obviously, it is settled. My object in rising is that which actuates most honourable members. I wish to put on record my reason for the stand I am taking with regard to the bill. I take the opportunity of doing so, particularly, because during tbe recent election the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) paid frequent visits to my constituency and criticized my political record. jority down by two-thirds. last election on this and other matters was entirely different from those at previous elections, in tbe sense that the party to which I previously belonged for pre. selection bad held tbe Wimmera seat and I was its candidate. On the last occasion I was no longer the candidate of that party. I was informed by the Treasurer, and he told tbe electors, that I held the seat by virtue of tbe fact that I was his follower. Thus we had a fight on the question as to who owned the seat. The Treasurer said that his party owned it by 22,900 votes. The result of the election was that the Page majority of 22,900 was converted into a minority of 7,500. I recognize that that has little to do with the bill, but I was tempted to digress to that extent because of tbe interjection of the honourable member for Warringah. There has been a confusion of important principles in the minds of some honourable members in connection with this bill. I believe, as a layman, not having been a State or Eederal Treasurer, that the Loan Council should be of advantage so far as borrowing is concerned. Certain figures were quoted by my friend the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) in regard to the flotation of various State and Commonwealth loans on the London market, and he instanced three loans to which I desire to refer. There was a Oommonwealth loan of £8,000,000, he said, which was floated on the 7th March, 1928, and 84.4 per cent, of it was left with the underwriters. On the 25th April of that year a Western Australian loan of £3,000,000 was oversubscribed at once. On the 17th July-the e months later-anothe r Commonwealth loan of £7,000,000 was floated, and 87 per cent, of that was left with the underwriters. The only reason that the Treasurer gave",22,Financial Agreement Validatio N Bill

112,Mr Stewart,"Tb e issue in ' tbefor this result was that it merely meant that the terms of the Western Australian loan were exceptionally favorable to the investor, the inference being that its terms were to an unbusinesslike extent favorable to the investor, and to the extent that tbey were overfavorable to him, it was an unbusinesslike transaction on the part of the Western Australian Government. But tbe reply to that is that, according to the figures quoted by the honourable member for Perth, all these loans were floated on exactly the same termsat the same rate of interest and at £98 5s. That disposes of the Treasurer's argument and I suggest that the matter requires explanation. tralia borrow through the Loan Council? particular loan. Of course there is provision for individual States to go on tbe money market, subject to the approval of the Loan Council, and obtain their own loans, so the incident does not provide valid grounds of objection to the establishment of tbe Loan Council, but it is nevertheless interesting. I wish to make it clear that my vote against this agreement is not a vote against the establishment of tbe Loan Council. I approve of that Council. My second point is that my opposition to this bill is not opposition to the principle of the consolidation of State debts. I approve of tbe consolidation of those debts. My real objection to tbe measure is that the platform of the Country Progressive party, to which I belong, has a plank providing for tbe retention of the ver capita payments pending the holding of a constitutional session to consider the constitutional relations of the States and tbe Commonwealth. Eor the greater part of the time when the negotiations that led to the submission of this b ill were in progress, a constitutional commission was sitting. It was appointed so long ago that I have almost forgotten the time when it began its work. It is still engaged in its task; we are still waiting for its report. I take it that the very fact of tbe appointment of that commission indicates that the Government considers there was some necessity for its appointment; at any rate, let us hope so. But it is recognized on all hands that the present financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth under the Constitution cannot much longer remain as they* are. The cost of government in Australia is such that I believe the people w ill very quickly revolt against the burden that is involved. countries are in a worse position. Tasmania does not deny that we are badly off. It is poor consolation to say that other countries are in a worse predicament. Every State, except Queensland, has a double-chambered legislature, there is overlapping, and there are interstate jealousies, and with the Commonwealth D i d not Western AusParliament endeavouring to function, and encroaching upon tbe duties of the States -the present Commonwealth Government has done more than any other in that direction-w e have reached the stage when tbe present conditions cannot long continue. When I was a member of the Country party its platform contained a plank that I w ill read. What is in its platform now I do not know; it changes according to circumstances. In the days to which I refer, we were very enthusiastic about this plank(a.) To advocate the early holding of a federal convention to consider the revising of the Constitution.

To aim at securing new and definite apportionments of the powers and duties of the federal and State authorities. (b) In order to bring about economical and efficient State government and administration, and to avoid costly duplication of State and federal activities, it is necessary to subdivide the present unwieldy States into manageable areas with community of interests, under their own constitution, thereby bringing about a simpler form of State government leaving all national functions to the Federal Parliament. There was a definite policy on the constitutional relations of the State and Federal Parliaments.

116,Mr Stewaet,"The optimist f r o mthat the walls of this chamber' will again ring, and before many years have past, with debate on tbe subject now under consideration. To say that this Parliament in the year 1929 shall bind future generations until 1987 to a bard and fast agreement that will dispose of the matter for time is ludicrous, to say the least of it. The Treasurer, in one of his political visits to my constituency, stated that I had opposed the financial agreement. I am glad that the Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson) is listening to me. I would have preferred to have the Treasurer also as one of my auditors, because he said that I , who am to-day opposing the financial agreement, supported it in 1923, wben he was a member of the Ministry. Tbat statement typifies what I bave always referred to as "" the Page touch."" The honourable gentleman plainly stated that this agreement is practically identical with the agreement which was submitted by bim in 1923. I shall not take up tbe time of the committee in explaining tbe difference between tbe two. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr done many notable things during the six Theodore) last night referred to this as a complete somersault on tbe part of the Treasurer; yet the honourable gentleman repeatedly told the electors of Wimmera that it was not be, but I , wbo bad somersaulted. I wish to deal with the point that has been raised repeatedly, regarding the significance of the affirmative vote that was given by the electors. After-events have proved that, in the event of an affirmative vote, being given, the supporters of this measure bad every intention of urging that the people had approved of tbe agreement itself. They are not playing the game witb those who, although strongly opposed to tbe agreement, nevertheless took a disinterested view of tbe matter and did what tbey thought was for tbe national good. That is what I did. The Leader of the Opposition and many other Labour members were bitterly opposed to the agreement, but tbey asked the people to cast an affirmative vote. the Prime Minister said to his constituents, .""If you do not care to take my advice, take that of the Leader of the Opposition."" Mr Stewart. platforms, Government members claimed that they were not asking for a "" Yes"" vote on tbe agreement, but merely on tbe proposal that power should be given to tbe Commonwealth to make agreements. If the Labour party, which represents nearly 50 per cent, of the electors, had advised its supporters to vote "" No,"" tbe referendum would not bave been carried, and this measure could not have been brought forward. I hope that tbe bill will fulfil the expectations of its sponsors; but I do not think that it will. I trust that I have made clear the reasons which have actuated me in my opposition to itam a supporter of this agreement. During tbe election campaign, I told my electors that if tbe Bruce-Page Government was returned to office it would be made law, and that if I were elected I would give it my support. The historian of the future will. regard this as the magnum opus of the present Government. It has years that it has held office, but this is an outstanding feat which will everlastingly redound to its credit. It is an attempt to deal witb a very big question that has always puzzled federalists and financiers, namely tbe taking over of the State debts. The present agreement is quite different from that which was submitted to tbe Commonwealth Parliament when tbe per capita payments were abolished in 1926. Had this agreement been placed before the House and the public at that time, it would not have been opposed by the press and the parliamentarians of the day. The State Treasurers were becoming very uneasy, and there was no guarantee that they would continue much longer to ""receive the per capita payment. We have beard a great deal regarding tbe loss wbich will be occasioned to Western Australia. Neither it nor any other State had any guarantee that when the population had largely increased tbe Commonwealth Government would continue the payment of 25s. a bead. Where would it raise tbe amount necessary when tbe his own electorate, population bad reached many millions?

If New Soutli Wales became very prosperous and largely increased its population, tbe effect of a per capita payment would be to assist those who did not really need tbe money, at the expense of the smaller States. There was the further danger .of some future Government embarking upon schemes requiring a large expenditure, and using the money obtained from this source, instead of banding it over to the States. From whatever angle we view the question, the States are entitled to stability. The underlying idea in the minds of the framers of tbe Constitution was that, as tbe States were relieved of tbe interest on their debts, their receipts from the Commonwealth under other headings would correspondingly diminish. Therefore, I can see no objection to the agreeGreen, R. ment on that score.

123,Mr Brennan (Batman) [12.3s],"Commonwealth and the States. Under this agreement, the Commonwealth will assume a responsibility for the public debt of tbe States, and will pay monthly to eac% State a fixed sum proportionate in some way to its population. State will, during tbe same period, pay to the Commonwealth the excess interest falling due each year in respect of its debt. A loan council is to be established, and what is called the consolidation of the public debt is also provided for. The establishment of a sinking fund is another feature of the agreement, and the vexed problem of payment in respect of properties transferred by tbe States to the Commonwealth is admittedly placed by it upon a more business-like and satisgracious to posterity. In addition to factory footing. We can afford to give the bill our qualified approval and blessing in so far as it relates to the consolienough to suggest that, after he is dead, dation of the debts. In that respect the agreement envisages Australian nationality and unity in accordance with tbe oft-expressed ideals of the Labour party. Tbe sinking fund is a pious aspiration which may, possibly, be honest; but, judging by our experience of the present Government in relation to finance, it is nothing better than the Monday morning resolve of the chronic inebriate. Some speakers have, with quaint claimed that the Government has a mandate to introduce this measure. That it bas a mandate to do anything is doubtful, and its method of doing it, chequered and painful. This claim is too audacious for serious argument. It is sumcient to point out that the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader and the humble workers like myself in tbe rank and file of the Labour party advocated an affirmative answer to the referendum. Indeed, we felt bound to do so, because the Government policy in that regard was adopted from the platform of Labour. To negative the grant of extended powers to the Commonwealth, or hamper the development of. the nation along those lines, is foreign to Labour's policy. In that regard it niatters not to us what government is in power, whether firmly established in popular favour, as the Labour party hopes to be ?non, or tentative and tottering, as this Government undoubtedly is. But, if any further answer be necessary, it was supplied by the Prime Minister and the Mr Brennan. Attorney-General, who admitted that the affirmative vote on the referendum was not in any sense an endorsement of this agreement. Tbe claim by tbe Treasurer and other speakers to a mandate to save Each their not too-sensitive conscience is pathetic. Even more pathetic is the swaggering self-sufficiency of those who imagine that they can bind future generations or fetter the action of this Parliament, or any other representative institution that may be functioning 50 years hence. In the fine phrase of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini), we cannot join witb those who would ""rattle the bones of the dead to silence tbe clamour of the living."" Tbe Prime Minister is banding them a legacy of £1,200,000,000 or thereabouts of public debt, he is good be may agree to a qualified alteration of tbe present agreement. Sitting suspended from 12.4.5 to 2.15 p.m. ster is disposed to be generous to posterity and, in addition to handing down to it a legacy of debts unpaid, obligations undischarged, and national commitments running into hunhumour, dreds of millions of pounds, he indicates that even during the currency of this present supposed-to-be inflexible agreement, it may be that it will be permissible for the Commonwealth and the States to vary the agreement but only upon lines indicated by himself.

I should not like to accept any responsibility for the rigbt honourable gentleman's hereafter, any more than for his present policy.

I have raised some points in this brief address of mine which, in a certain way, reconcile me to tbe passage of the bill. It, no doubt, has some useful features and some good machinery for carrying on the work of tbe nation from day to day in accordance with tbe ideals of men of narrow vision, whose eyes are more often upon tbeir feet than upon the stars. I submit that Australia can never, either within or without the commonwealth of nations, become herself a nation so long as we bave tbe present cougeries of competitive sovereignties known as States, with their elaborate and expensive machinery, their governments, their parliaments, their executives and their local pomposities. ""State rights,"" ""moral rights,"" and ""legal rights."" There are such things as moral rights and legal -rights, but, in tbe connection in wbich tbe Avords bave been used' in this debate, they are merely phrases with wbicb men invested with power seek to justify tbe exercise and conevidence that he possessed a backbone. tinuance of that power. Sovereignty was sought for very naturally, and as naturally obtained, early in Australian history. Civilization and society reached out to other isolated parts of this continent, and local government was demanded. It was mistakenly thought that witb the development of Australia along those lines, multiple sovereignties were necessary. The idea is dying hard, but as the union was slowly and painfully born, so the fiction of State rights must, if slowly, at last inevitably perish. It is to the honour of the Labour party that it has surveyed at least the road to Australian nationhood, and future generations must tread it. They will do that in their own way, according to their own lights, and in so doing, their craftsmen will be little concerned with the dead timber which this agreement seeks to strew along the track. -We have had some very interesting reminiscences on the subject of per capita payments, but; if I may be permitted to say so, first the Leader of the Opposition, then the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) and later the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) all made one slight error: They commenced their history in 1909. There are not more than five of us left now wbo were in the House when this story really began in 1908. The States bad been receiving three-fourths of tbe customs and excise revenue collected by the Federal Government, and all the surplus revenue which the Commonwealth Government did not expend. The Deakin Government, with a handful of supporters, was kept in office by the Labour party. Tbe Labour party, for some time, with the assistance of a number of members on the Opposition side of tbe House, had been pressing very hard for the introduction of an old-age pension scheme. Mr Eisher, who was taking a prominent part in the affair, was trying We bear tbe phrases to induce the Government to impose a graduated land tax to meet tbe cost of the old-age pensions. Mr Deakin absolutely refused to accept the proposal, showing for perhaps the only time during the period of bis federal leadership, some Then on the 13th March, 1908, Sir William Lyne introduced a Surplus Eevenue Bill which took from the States tbe unexpended revenue they had been receiving from the Federal Government. One week later Mr Fisher introduced a motion for the inauguration of an old-age pensions scheme, and with the assistance of several members on tbe opposite side of the House, it was carried on the voices. That happened in 1908, and was the first inroad into the revenues wbich the States had been receiving from the Commonwealth. orable member that the discussion is on the third reading of the bill. I am grateful to you for having allowed me to get in that little piece of history. If the suggestion made by the right honourable member for Balaclava were adopted, that this agreement should be limited to a period of two years, the bill would not be worth a snap of the fingers. IfI had not been going to vote for the bill, his speech would have .made me do so. During his political career he has made only one proposal for the settlement of the per capita",30,Third Beading

That is the sole contribution wbicb the right honourable member for Balaclava has made towards improving the financial relations of the CommonAvealth and the States, and that proposal fell stillborn, receiving no support. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) made what I consider a very valuable contribution to the debate, when he impressed upon the Government the enormous responsibilities Avhich tbe States bave to bear. They have to find tbe money for such things as roads, railways, charitable grants, judiciaries, and police forces, besides education and other services. In my opinion, this bill, far from being too liberal, as the right honourable members for North Sydney and Balaclava have, said, could be made still more generous, and yet the States would not receive more than tbeir due. As the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) pointed out, the States will have to receive mittee. Tbe honourable member is enfurther assistance in any case in the form of special grants. Because of tbe large populations in New South Wales and Victoria, and the concentration of manufacturing interests in those States, the rest of Australia has for years been paying tribute to them. My own State, for instance, while it buys a considerable quantity of sugar from Queensland, also purchases £6,000,000 worth of goods annually from New South Wales and Victoria. The concentration of manufactures in two States places the rest of Australia at a serious financial disadvantage, a fact which this Parliament will have to recognize. I am not a unificationist; I am a federationist. The only way to secure a strong CommonAvealth, and an effective Pederal Parliament, is to have strong State Governments, and strong State instrumentalities. Australia was in the first instance governed from Sydney, but it was then a very small entity as far as population was concerned. We found it impossible to carry on on that basis, and Ave shall find ourselves even less able to govern Australia from Canberra. Therefore, instead of trying to undermine the influence and poAvers of the States, we should, if we wish Australia to grow into a strong, national unit, let the States retain sumcient poAver to govern themselves, and especially to keep themselves solvent. member support tbe bill ?

I did not have an opportunity to speak on the second reading of tbe bill, and I desire to make my position clear now. I do not agree with the right, honourable member for North Sydney, and the right honourable member for Balaclava, that tbe sentiment in the country is in favour of unification. It is, I think entirely opposed to it. Time after time the Federal Parliament has sought greater poAvers from the people and has been refused them.

I do not agree, .however, with the proposal that the agreement should be limited to a term of ten years so as to leave it within the power of the Eederal Parliament to alter it at any time. The States were "" had "" once, and they do not want it to occur again. An old Jew once remarked"" Any man can take me down once, but when the same man does so twice I go out of business.""

Being of the greatest national importance, it has deserved the most serious attention of honourable members, but the Government has applied the ""guillotine,"" and many honourable members have had no opportunity of expressing their views. The great majority of those who have spoken are opposed to the bill. We have had the sorry spectacle in the last two or three days of honourable members opposite speaking against it, but voting for it ; it has been dealt with along party lines. The whip has been cracked, and honourable members opposite have lined up behind the Government.

I believe that the present proposal will not stand the test of time, and that we may eventually have to revert to the old system. I fail to understand the attitude adopted by tbe Premier of South Australia ( Mr member for Balaclava and the GovernButler), wbo no doubt was prevailed upon by the persuasive eloquence of the Prime Minister to accept the agreement. One of the reasons why it was accepted by South Australia was no doubt the shocking financial position of that State. the only State to which that remark applies. other States in the same predicament. The report of the Royal Commission on South Australian Disabilities has not been tabled, but we were entitled to have it before us in considering this measure. I have no doubt that when the ""guillotine"" is applied the bill will be read a third time, but I hope that the Government will deal generously with South Australia's application for a grant of £75,000. I should have liked to discuss the financial provisions of the bill, and the subject of the Loan Council, because I became acquainted with some of the work of that body when I was Agent-General for South Australia in London; but owing to the way in which the bill is being rushed through the HouseI have been denied an opportunity to do I bave only time now to make a personal so.

It seems to me that the States and the Australian people generally have been deceived, if it has been intended by the Government that this review should take place. The whole machinery of the scheme is designed to wipe out the into provide for permanent and definite payments. I am waiting to hear what the various State Premiers and Treasurers think of the suggestion made in this chamber by the right honourable ment's attitude to it. Time and circumstances may compel us to review the agreement, but its outstanding feature was its permanence, and the fact that in 58 years it would liquidate all the debts of the States. I am amazed, because I supported tbe agreement and I supported the Government. In the first place I opposed the withdrawal of the per capita payments when no agreement such as this was offered in its place, and I believe that the Government made an excellent arrangement in lieu of its original proposal, but I object to any suggestion, such as that from tbe right honourable member for Balaclava that at this late hour we should go back upon tbe agreement that has been ratified by the Parliaments of all tbe States and is understood throughout Australia. I hope that a further statement will be made by the Government on this most serious matter, because it reflects on the whole Parliament. If this House lends countenance to the review of the agreement before passing it, I shall lose faith in agreements so made.

BILL 1929. read a first time. surer) [3.7] -(B y leave) I move That the bill be now read a second time. The object of this bill is to make effective the amendment of sub-section 1 of section 21 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922-27 which was made by the amending act of 1928. The legislation of last year was designed to protect the revenue from tbe heavy loss which threatened it as a result of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria in the appeal Kellow-Falkiner Pty. Go. Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Taxation. The Income Tax [REPRESENTATIVES.] Assessment BiU. judgment had declared that the law as it Jackson, D. S. then stood required the Commissioner to Killen, W.

The judgment prevented the Commissioner from substituting a company's own accounting period for a CommonMcGrath, D.

H . the close of its own income year, or after Stewart, P. G. the close of a Commonwealth financial Tully, J. T. year where the company's year ended on Watkins, D. the 30th June. West, J. E. The practice of tbe Commissioner had been to take into consideration all distributions made by tbe company out of Tellers : its taxable income, whether made during Fenton.. J. E. or subsequent to the close of the company's income year up to the date when the Commissioner determined to apply I Mathews, J. section 21 of the company's case. Very few of tbe companies are in a position to make a distribution during an income year out of the profits of that year. As a general rule, a company waits until the close of its income year before ascertaining its profits and before deciding how much of the profits shall be distributed. The acceptance of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria already referred to had the effect of invalidating all previous de'terminations by tbe Commissioner under section 21 and all consequential assessments, because the Commissioner had not in any case applied his mind to ascertain whether or not during a Commonwealth financial year the company had made any distributions of the profits derived in that year. The 1928 act provided that the existing subsection 1 of section 21 should be replaced by a new provision which should be deemed to have retrospective operation to the date of commencement of the In come Tax Assessment Act 1922, namely,",34,Third Beading

157,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper,"Treathe 18th October, 1922. The new provision that where a company had not before snch date prior to the making of the Commissioner's determination as is fixed by the Commissioner, distributed .among its members or shareholders at least two-thirds of its taxable income, the company would be liable to pay the additional tax provided by the section. The retrospective operation of this provision made it necessary for the Commissioner to bave fixed such a date in connection with all past determinations. This bad not, however, been done and could not be done ex post facto. The 1928 act did not contain any provision definitely validating all past determinations and consequential assessments, so that tbe department was not able to take any action to claim additional tax by making assessments upon existing determinations where assessments had not already been made. The additional revenue which it was intended should be collected in such cases could not legally be collected. The authority of Parliament is now being sought to enable the Commissioner to make assessments and collect tax in such cases. Tbis bill will validate all past assessments, notwithstanding that no date had been fixed, and all assessments which have been made, notwithstanding that the company's trading year did not coincide with the Commonwealth financial year. adjourned. Debate resumed from 27th February (vide page 608) upon motion by Mr the Town and Country Union, which, so Tliat tlie bill be now read a second time. publishes no balance sheet, and altogether The bill contains two important provisions, the first being that which effects a sub-division of the duties of the Tariff Board. Hitherto, the board functioned only in f u l l meeting and now it is proposed that it shall be divided into two sections, each of which will have authority to take evidence and prepare reports. ""With that I cordially agree, believing that the work of tbe Tariff Board will be advantageous to Australian industries. There is also provision that the Board may confer witb tbe Director of tbe Bureau of Economic Research concerning certain matters. I do not approve of that. On the contrary I am hostile to it. From time to time statements have been made by chairmen of directors of companies, by Nationalist and Country party members of Parliament, by busybodies such as Rotarians, constitutional club members, and other ""stickybeak"" organizations, which appear to take a delight in interfering with the conditions of the workers and giving advice as to what should be done. All these people have been telling us from time to time that production in' Australia must be upon sound economic lines. In tbe recent amendment of tbe Arbitration' Act, which was strenuously opposed by honourable members on this side of the House, there is a provision that a judge of the court must give consideration to the probable economic effect of his award upon the industry itself and other industries that may be affected. I have no doubt that the views of tbese employers' organizations have been conveyed to the Government and have been crystallized in the legislative measures that have come before us in recent years. It would not be in order for me, in the debate on this bill, to trace the history of the various stupid and freakish industrial measures that have been passed by the Federal Parliament. provisions of the Arbitration Act are to be used to break down economic conditions in Australia. Statements have been made before the Tariff Board by various organizations, some of them of mysterious origin. One which I have in mind is far as one can see, has no offices and is a most nebulous concern which cannot be said to exist definitely anywhere. Many of tbese bodies, as I have said, arrange from time to time to be represented before the Tariff Board and always, I notice, tbey state the free trade view. Probably many bonorable members remember the extraordinary evidence given by a lecturer named Benham, of the Sydney University, last year in regard to a certain range of customs duties. His evidence was so obsolete and inapplicable to modern Australian conditions, and caused so much",35,Second Reading

159,Mr Blakeley (Darling) [3.14],"indignation that apparently the University Senate instructed him not to. offend again in his position as a lecturer attached to the University. At all events he has not been heard of since. Another professor of the Melbourne University, a gentleman whose name for the moment I forget, has published in pamphlet form, a number of speeches antagonistic to the policy of protection which the people of Australia have endorsed for so many years. These gentlemen, it should _ be noted, are regarded as the leading economists in Australia, so the possibility of the Tariff Board being influenced by their views must cause not a little Uneasiness in the minds of those who have the interests of the Commonwealth at heart. We have built up in Australia a system of high wages and good conditions unparalleled elsewhere in the civilized world. We have established the principle of 44 hours in many industries. It is true"" that the Government is doing its best to take that away from us. We have wage in a number of Again, it is true that the Government is doing its best to break down that standard. We have evidence of this in the present dispute in the timber industry. It would seem that the Government, in introducing this bill desires to have another string to its bow. It proposes to establish a Bureau of Economic Research, which will be presided over by an economist whose ideas may be at variance with those of the people of Australia. certain circumstances, the Tariff Board may seek assistance from the director of the Bureau of Economic Research-presumably on the cost of production in Australia. When we remember that the leading text books on economics are all based upon European standards of production, it is difficult to see how the conditions with which they deal can be applied to production in Australia. Eor example, it may be an economic proposition to manufacture certain articles in England, Erance or Germany; but quite uneconomic in Australia, because of our liigher standards and improved industrial conditions. In view of the danger which I foresee, I should like tbe Minister to define, if he can, the functions of the Mr Blakeley. director of the proposed bureau in consultation with members of the Tariff Board. I am also wondering what was the reason for the visit to Australia recently of the British Economic Mission, popularly known as the "" B i g Four."" Had it any bearing on the question now before the House? These glorified commercial travellers, Mr Amery and the "" B ig Four,"" came to Australia to tell us how we should run this country, and inevitably they expressed the view that many manufacturing industries in Australia were on an uneconomic basis. Honourable members will find in their report various allusions to the high protective tariff in Australia. In one section there appears the following:Protection, as its very name implies, is designed tor the weak, and the weakness may be that of infancy, that of temporary ailment, or that of inefficiency It behoves the State, therefore, to keep a very careful watch upon the whole range of protected industries infant industries are apt to take a long time to grow up and be ready to dispense with their swaddling established also the basic clothes, industries. These are only a few extracts from the report, but they are sumcient to show that the views of the "" Big Four"" are pro-English rather than pro-Australian. They are the ideas of free traders. These gentlemen have something to sell to the people of Australia, and naturally they will do everything possible to* foster British trade, rather than to encourage Australian production. Their report contains a number of what I regard as impertinent comments upon the estabThe bill provides that, in lished policy of the Commonwealth. member really mean that they were impertinent in their comments? they were.

164,Mr Speaker,"Order! The honister is constantly referring to what has been done in the British Parliament, and because of his pro-English outlook he invited these people to come to Australia to tell us how we should manage the affairs of this conntry. Obviously, the intention was to encourage British trade with Australia, to the detriment of Australian industries. Not only the Prime Minister, but 'bis supporters, probably from a feeling of loyalty, spoke in that vein. was dealing with tihe bill 1 informed Mm that he could not open up the whole question of the tariff policy-freetrad e and protection. The bill relates to the Tariff Board. The honourable member would be quite in .order in discussing tbe principles nmderlying the bill and the Tariff Aet, .and .also the proposed amendments opening up new questions. The honourable member was quite in order in discussing the economic question, and he is perfectly justified in making incidental references ,to ministerial statements. reputable English fijrms have in the past few years lestablished branches in Aaisfacalia, but tbey did not send delegations here to .ascertain 'whether there was .a market t£or .their products. Por instance, Sir Arthur Dorman when visiting Aus-fcralia saw the -possibilities of Australian 'industry, and in no time he formed a hnige .company to control the Port Kembla works. One could point to a number of -such instances. Mr J&CKSON -I s Duckham establisMng a branch of his firm here? We always welcome English capital into this .country. The .more industries that we establish the better it is for Australia; hut we oannot foster British trade, and :at the same time protect Australian industries. To attempt to do that wonld be ridiculous. With reference to the members of the 'Tariff Board, I .am one -of those who believe that good men should be well paid, but I doubt -very much whether the Government should now seek to increase the salaries of those gentlemen. I believe that in Australia can be tfound suitable and efficient men for appointment to tbe Tariff Board at the present rate of payment. Taking into consideration the desire of the Prime Minister and his followers to cut down wages and to decrease costs of production, it ill becomes the Government to introduce a bill for the. purpose of increasing the salaries of highly-paid officials who may for the time being be appointed to the Tariff Board. The bill provides for consultation between the Tariff Board and the Director of Economic Research. I do not know whether that provision has been inserted at the instigation of tbe Minister. Judging by his declarations in this House we on this side cannot -but be a little uneasy as to how the industries of Australia will fare under bis administration of tariff matters. I have been waiting for the Minister to 'declare his policy. On the 21-st March last year he said Mr .GicnLLBTT I rise to a point of order. I have no wish to present the honourable member from quoting anything .that I have said, 'but when I was :speaking on the second reading you, sir, pointed out the necessity for me to keep to the subject-matter of the bill, and I .ask that the honourable member be requested to do 'likewise.

183,Mr Martens (Herbert) [3.50],"I""When I sought leave to speak, I was told that the measures before the House had been discussed before; but I was not,, a member of this House then, and I was sent here to oppose some of those measures. If honourable members are definitely obstructing the business of the House, it is quite right to apply the guillotine. In such circumstances, I myself should be unmerciful. But in the cases to which I have referred I think that the Government treated new members unfairly. I feel this matter very keenly, especially as some honourable members ou tbe other side who helped to apply tbe gag against the Opposition, themselves came into the chamber immediately after the division and took up most of the time allotted. few days ago, I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he would refer to the Tariff Board the duty on bananas. I do not think that the present Minister was in Parliament when the present very heavy duty of 8s. 4d. a central, or l d . a lb. was imposed. For months past, right throughout Australia, the worse bananas ever produced in any part of the world have been sold to the public. The duty on bananas is unduly high. Bananas are one of the finest foods which can be given to children, and should be sold at a reasonable price. I ask tbe Minister to give the matter further consideration, with a view to having it fully investigated by the Tariff Board. I am surprised that this request should come from the honourable member for Swan, who, I understand, professes to be a primary producer. If be is, Why is he not prepared to grant protection to the banana-growers of Queensland. The Queensland growers are trying to produce bananas under white men's conditions, and arc as much entitled to protection as are any other class of primary producers. The honourable member in defaming Queensland bananas seems to be following the old course of depreciating everything Australian. We can produce good bananas here. In Melbourne, only recently, I ate some of the finest and most richly flavoured bananas I have ever had in my life. If the banana-growers are not to receive protection, the alternative is that Australians mnst eat the product of black labour. Apparently, the honourable member wants to go back to trading with F i j i . Let us consider tbe conditions under which those bananas are produced in that island. Does he.wish Australians to work under the conditions, and for the wages that are paid to the black workers there? If he does, he is most un-Australian in his views.
