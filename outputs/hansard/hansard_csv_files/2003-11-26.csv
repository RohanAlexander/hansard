Wednesday, 26 November 2003 ----Howard Government: Privatisation lish must surely be George Orwell’s Politics and the English Language, written in 1946 but still relevant to the modern political and corporate world. I was reminded of this essay a couple of weeks ago in South Australia while listening to a debate on electricity. The term ‘customer churning’ was used to describe customer dissatisfaction. You could feel and almost see Orwell smiling through the airwaves. Corporate Australia could not possibly admit to customer dissatisfaction, so ‘customer churning’ is invented. The military cannot admit to death by negligence; they use the term death by ‘friendly fire’. Governments around the world cannot admit favouring privatisation, so they substitute ‘public-private partnerships’. The term, of course, is the Australian version. In Canada it is the same but more commonly referred to as ‘P3’. In the United Kingdom the term used is ‘private financing of infrastructure’, or PFI. But they all mean privatisation. As George Orwell predicted, corruption of language is more often than not a precursor to bad government and a cover for corruption itself. He was right. Governments are attracted to PPPs because they do not show up as debt on the government debt accrual sheet. But isn’t it ironic that more and more government money is spent for fewer and fewer public services? As Nick Cohen wrote in the New Statesman of 27 October this year: … “Bastard Privatisation” a perverse twisting of capitalist ideals which ensures that all the promises of the market prove to be false. Privatisation is meant to be cheap; it is not. Privatisation is meant to shun waste; it does not. It is meant to avoid duplication; it does not. It is meant to be responsive to the consumer; it is not-it is nothing of the sort. There is supposed to be a clear incentive to be accountable. The argument is that, if privatisation fails, the organisation goes bust-yes, and pigs might fly. Privatisation offers no such things. Privatisation, or PPPs, is a wantonly expensive exercise of delivering public works. Under PPPs, private consortiums borrow funds at a higher interest rate than the government can and then build a school, build a hospital, build a bridge, build a road, deliver power or run public transport and demand mortgage payments for the next 30 to 90 years. Buy now, pay later schemes may be excusable in times of crisis, but there is no current economic crisis. Privatisation, or PPPs, in the field of utilities-such as power, transport, water, communications-destroys any notion of central responsibility, command and control, especially when it is deliberate. Who is in control of these utilities in Australia? Who indeed. Private companies need to make a profit; public companies need to provide an essential service. Competition? What competition? The dream of any company is to eliminate competition and achieve a private monopoly. Isn’t it incredible that governments support the process? PPPs reverse the role of government. They provide for a government sponsored private monopoly and a guaranteed flow of income for generations paid courtesy of the taxpayers-most of whom will be dead before the debt is repaid. Efficiency and cost reduction-you have to be kidding. FragmentaMAIN COMMITTEE",168,Notices 5 Recognises That This Battle Is A Significant

(Time expired) McEwen Electorate: Business FRAN BAILEY (McEwen-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (9.43 a.m.)-Australian tennis champions will take to a very special court next week when they face some of the world’s best players at the Davis Cup in Melbourne. They will, in fact, be playing their opponents on turf manufactured by StrathAyr Turf Systems Pty Ltd of Seymour in my electorate of McEwen. StrathAyr is a wonderful example of the hundreds of established regional businesses across my electorate that have achieved great success through the drive and determination of management and staff to produce and market innovative products. In this case, the innovative product is the modular turf tennis court. The tennis court is made up of 160 grass modules, each weighing 1.7 tonnes. Last week they were broken up and transported by 14 semitrailers to the centre court of Rod Laver Arena. This is an extraordinary accomplishment, and I want to place on record my congratulations to them. On a recent visit I saw this in action-and, importantly, saw the jobs that it provides in regional Australia. Winemakers across the Yarra Valley are representative of another industry growing in reputation both here and abroad for the quality wines produced from their cool climate vineyards. Just last week local winemakers took top honours in the Victorian Tourism Awards. Yarra Valley Winegrowers Association President, Peter Fergusson, was honoured with the prestigious Qantas award at Crown Towers in Melbourne. This award recognises the role that Peter Fergusson has played in the development of wine tourism in the Yarra Valley. As a local, I can attest that, if you see someone in a tartan tam-o’-shanter, you know that Peter Fergusson is about. He is a local identity but, most importantly, he is a real leader of the wine industry and has been a pioneer in the Yarra Valley. Yarra Valley Regional Food Group founder, Suzanne Halliday, received Tourism Victoria’s outstanding contribution by a volunteer award, while Yering Station vineyard picked up the coveted best winery award. This is an extraordinary effort by our local winemakers, and they deserve all of our support. In the Macedon Ranges, in the new part of the electorate of McEwen at the next election, Arthur Barker of Barker Trailers at Woodend is yet another example of an individual prepared to invest his capital and his labour. He is a very important community member, participating in all community events, and a leader in regional Victoria. (Time expired) Slattery, Mr Jim Hodgens, Mrs Marie Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (9.46 p.m.)-TodayI want to place on the record my condolences for the loss of one of our great community leaders, Jim Slattery. Jim passed away on 22 November and leaves a huge hole in our community. I have had the pleasure in presenting to Jim a sports achievement award, a Centenary Medal and a Commonwealth seniors award. Jim was one of those characters who make our communities thrive. He was a tireless community worker. He was very actively involved in sport, particularly in the area of baseball. He was not only a player, a team manager and an umpire but also the founder of the first women’s team in Oakleigh. Jim also established the Australian Cost Engineering Society as a volunteer. He was described by many in that society as a fine and cultured man, and his loss is a great MAIN COMMITTEE loss to both cost engineering and engineering overall. He received his Centenary Medal for services to junior baseball and also his dedication and service to Red Cross activities. Jim was the leader and coordinator of the local Red Cross Doorknock Appeal, which he did for many years. I wish to pass on to his family, and particularly his wife Avis, my condolences and many sympathies for the loss of one of our tireless community workers who has left us too soon. TodayI also want to pass on my thanks-not because she has departed but because she has left the fold of my FEA, the ALP FEA in Chisholm-to Marie Hodgens, who joined the ALP in 1970. She is one of those true believers. She has been there through thick and thin. We have had some very lean times in downtown Chisholm. Marie worked for the previous federal ALP member, Helen Mayer. She also worked for Senator Button and for Margaret Way in state parliament. Marie has served on the FEA executive for more years than I or she would probably care to remember and she has stood down after many dedicated years of service. In the last FEA she was treasurer, so she has seen me through two campaigns. As anybody in this room will know, the office of treasurer over a federal election campaign is a very demanding job. Marie did it with absolute gusto and with good grace in times of fair stress when things were going on. She could be found at all hours of the day or night to co-sign those wonderful cheques. She also ensured that our returns were done in scrupulous compliance with all AEC rules. I wish to give heartfelt thanks to her and her irascible husband, Howard, for all they have done for us. If anybody is a reader of the Age they will see Howard’s lovely columns there sometimes. They have brawled with the ALP on and off for years-they have brawled with me on and off for years-but they have been absolutely tireless workers. Without them working behind the scenes, I certainly can say that I would not be here in this position today. I want to say to Marie, thank you, thank you, thank you. Roads: Roads to Recovery Program the Bass Coast area, I spoke to a great many people about roads. Roads, road safety and the protection, upgrading and maintenance of our roads is at the top of people’s minds on Bass Coast, and there are a series of points I wish to make. The first point is that the Bass Highway needs to be continued and duplicated south of Grantville all the way through to Anderson and, over time, all the way through to Wonthaggi-but particularly all the way through to Anderson. That is something I want to work towards with locals. The second and most important point is that there is enormous local support for the Roads to Recovery program. This is a program that has delivered over $250 million directly to Victorian councils to assist them in maintaining, upgrading and improving their roads. This funding is critical to the way local roads can be maintained by local authorities. I know, from talking with people in Cowes, Ventnor, Rhyll, San Remo, Corinella, Bass, Grantville, Lang Lang and all of those areas, that there is a real belief that additional funding needs to be introduced to help with local roads. There was no program before-and I note the Roads to Recovery program was opposed by the opposition when it was first introduced-so it is important not only that we maintain the program but that we roll it over. I have made the case directly to the Deputy Prime Minister that the Roads to Recovery program should be continued, and it is interesting that in areas such as Bass Coast, where the shire is strapped for cash, this Commonwealth funding effecMAIN COMMITTEE",173,Statements By Members

If we were to remove this program, which was introduced by the current government, by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, then residents would have to pay an additional four per cent. But that is money which they currently save, and I am proud that they save that money. I believe-and, as I said, I have made the argument directly to the Deputy Prime Minister-that the Roads to Recovery program is an excellent program and that it has a practical effect on the lives of people in San Remo, Grantville, Cowes and all the townships of Bass Coast. I also believe that it is important that we commit to and roll over that program. roads on Phillip Island, in focusing on Corinella and Coronet Bay, I believe that we need to assist the local councils and that we should continue with the program. I am delighted to speak in support of and to argue for additional funding under the Roads to Recovery program for Bass Coast Shire. Friendly Fire tral to our defence and foreign affairs policies. It has enjoyed bipartisan support, quite properly, at least since the Second World War, and it is something that I strongly endorse. It has concerned me for some time though that when you look at conflicts you find that friendly fire-a totally inappropriately named activity-seems to be something American forces are more prone to than the forces of any other coalition group with whom we exercise. A little earlier this year it came to my attention that American air force pilots are actually provided with amphetamines by the air force before they leave on missions, as a standard practice. Indeed, in Afghanistan the F16 pilots who mistakenly bombed some Canadians, killing four and injuring eight, were on amphetamines at the time that incident occurred. It prompted me to put a question on notice to the Minister for Defence, and I am very unhappy with the response I have received to that question from the minister. My question was in three parts. In reply to the first part, I was advised by the minister to refer my question to the United States Air Force-hardly a responsible action for the Australian Minister for Defence. On the specific question I asked about what action the minister had taken to ensure that US Air Force pilots operating in Australia were free from these drugs, I was told that the ADF does not have a policy allowing the use of amphetamines and US pilots do not use them. I am afraid that is not a satisfactory response. This is a serious issue. This is a practice in the United States military, not just in the air force but across the services, that provides otherwise illegal amphetamines to pilots and requires them to take them before they go up in an aircraft-armed, equipped and lethal. If it were a commercial pilot flying a 747 for Qantas, they would be sacked. In fact, if they were driving a bus from Sydney down to Canberra, they would be sacked. But the United States military provides these drugs and requires its pilots to take them. The matter has now come before the courts in the United States because action has been taken against the two unfortunate F16 pilots who killed those Canadians. There are various reports about it, in a multitude of media. MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Statements By Members

He is a former pilot, judge advocate and military judge in the Marine Corps. He said: … the Air Force prevents pilots from flying if they refuse to take the pills. Fliers were given ‘go pills’ to keep them awake for nighttime missions, and ‘no-go’ pills, or sedatives, to help them sleep. Surveys show that roughly half of the American fighter pilots took amphetamines during the Desert Storm campaign. Some commanders were so alarmed by many pilots’ growing addiction to the pills that they ordered their subordinates not to use them. In fact, the US Navy cancelled their use in the 1990s and it was restored in 1999. Australian troops, whether it is here or overseas in operations with Americans, deserve to know that they are not going to be the subject of friendly fire, and our defence minister should be more serious about pursuing the issue. Cowper Electorate: St Augustine’s School Harbour hosts its men and boys camp. This year’s camp was held recently at Valla Beach, and it was attended by 270 men and boys. It is a great concept-dads, granddads, uncles and big brothers having fun camping with boys. There is egg catching, tug-of-war, informal games of touch footy and cricket, surfing, swimming and fishing-all great activities. The camp originally started with approximately 60 attendees and has grown to the current level of around 270, achieved this year. Many in this House have spoken of the importance of strong role models for childrenparticularly young boys. All the members of this House deal regularly in their day-to-day activities with issues relating to broken families. Activities such as the men and boys camp provide a great forum for strengthening families, developing bonds between fathers and sons and building a sense of community within schools. It really is a wonderful initiative. I would like to commend Dave and Robyn Harmon, who provided the original inspiration for the camp. Dave is a TAFE teacher and Robyn is a teacher who coordinates a program for children who cannot adapt to mainstream classroom situations. I would also like to congratulate the committee responsible for the men and boys camp: Dave Harmon; Ben Van den Boom, a father of six; Paul Kennedy, a local automotive upholsterer and also a father of six; and Peter Watts, a father of four. These guys have done a great job in launching a tremendous concept that is enjoyed by fathers and sons alike. I would also like to thank Mike Hogan, the Principal of St Augustine’s School, for his leadership and dedication, which have ensured that the school provides excellent opportunities for young Australians to achieve their potential. In an age of materialism, where the pace of life is getting faster and faster, the value of spending time rather than money is immeasurable. Participation in the first men and boys camp that I attended cost the princely sum of $6; and I have to say-as a dad of children at St Augustine’s School-it was the best $6 I have ever spent. The boys talked about the camp for a whole year afterwards. In their words, it was ‘real cool, Dad!’ Congratulations must go to the committee and to Mike Hogan on what is a great school initiative.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 May, on motion by Mr Williams: That this bill be now read a second time. tion Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 legislation. However, I will make several comments. The bill largely makes technical amendments to the customs legislation and tidies up some earlier drafting. These amendments flow from the trade modernisation legislation and the reengineering of the systems being developed to implement that system. The government has circulated an amendment extending the statutory cut-off date for the completion of the cargo management re-engineering project from July 2004 to July 2005. I will make some brief comments shortly about that matter. The purpose of the bill is to amend several acts in relation to the circumstances in which out-turn reports in respect of containers unloaded from a ship must be given-so that they do not have to be given if there are no containers being unloaded. The bill also amends the time at which reports in respect of goods for export that are removed from a wharf or airport have to be provided to Customs-so they have to be reported before they are removed. It also removes provisions that may narrow the class of people who can communicate electronically with Customs-and I will say something about that shortly. The bill also inserts new record keeping and evidence provisions in respect of certain electronic communications to and from Customs, and amends the false or misleading statement offence provisions so that people who cause such statements to be made will be guilty of the relevant offence. The bill also amends those provisions to limit the circumstances in which an offence will not be committed, because a person notifies Customs that the information in a communication was incorrect or inadequate, and to require any duty owing to be paid. The bill also amends the record keeping requirements to ensure that those people who cause statements to be made must keep records that verify those communications. It also corrects a technical error which, if left uncorrected, would mean that an amendment would never commence, and it inserts a provision which reinstates a person’s right to seek review of decisions relating to the old administrative penalty scheme by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and repeals and replaces the transitional arrangements that will apply in respect of exports when the new electronic systems, which are being developed by Customs, commence. Finally, the amendment to the bill as printed will extend the completion date of the CMR project, to which I have referred, by 12 months. The bill is relatively straightforward, albeit quite technical. The only potential controversy arising from the amendment is extending the July 2004 timeline for the cargo management reengineering project and the proposed changes to the offence of making a false or misleading statement. Firstly, in respect of the CMR project, that essentially surrounds the implementaMAIN COMMITTEE",177,Statements By Members

199,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (9.59 A.m.),"The opposition supports the Customs Legislation of a new computer system that will be used with progressive introduction, commencing with express airfreight and exports. All clients will be required to communicate with Customs electronically. As we know, there is a proposed amendment to the bill extending the deadline for the introduction of CMR by another 12 months. This is an ambitious project-which we concedeand, like all large and complex systems which have grown up over the years, it is probably overdue. Certainly, the investment is needed if Australia is going to keep pace with the complexity of freight movement in and out of the country, and there always comes a stage when it simply has to be done. The decision by Customs was the right one but, as we have seen, the task has been much bigger and more difficult than people ever imagined. In short, it has proven to be a monster, and the proposal to extend the time frame is the second time it has had to be done. Of course, industry is furious, as their reliance on Customs systems is total and the failure to bed down the system and the necessity for two substantial delays in the final implementation date is, as we would all understand, causing considerable concern, given the extent of investment that is required by private businesses. Essentially, nothing moves into or out of this country without the involvement of Customs. That is the difficulty-the interaction of company systems with Customs systems is so completely critical that everything must be done in lockstep, and yet, despite the plans and the promises, the reliability of the new systems in Customs is such that the industry is becoming extremely frustrated. There are issues regarding the resourcing and skill level of those persons whom Customs has assigned. I suppose there is always scope to be critical of people involved in a substantial project, but there are suggestions that those involved should perhaps have broader experience in this industry. For some, the further extension of 12 months is a blessing, unless of course they have already invested and now find that considerably more money is needed on their part to match what is required at the Customs end. In the communication of information-that other controversial area-there are several provisions in the act that make it an offence under the existing legislation to make a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular or to omit a thing or a matter from a statement without which it is false or misleading in a material particular. Once the new computer system is up and running there will be new ways in which people will be able to electronically communicate with Customs, as we would expect. With the advent of the new systems the misleading statement provisions will no longer capture all the persons who may be liable for making a false or misleading statement through the computer network. Many of the amendments are needed to reflect the changes in practice that will arise out of the changes in technology that are being implemented and to make sure responsibility is sheeted home to the appropriate people. The two proposed amendments therefore recognise the variety of commercial communication arrangements available to people with obligations to report to Customs and also that the accuracy of the information in those reports can be affected in various ways at different stages of the communication chain. The first amendment clarifies that liability for the offences of making false and misleading statements to Customs is not only on the person who communicates the statement but also on persons who cause the statement to be made. The second measure makes a similar amendment in relation to record retention obligations in the Customs Act so that all persons involved in MAIN COMMITTEE preparing or sending communications to Customs will have to keep records that verify the content of the communication and identify the source of the information included in the communication. The penalties for these new offences will be substantial, as set out in the legislation and referred to in the second reading speech. The government argues that the offences of giving false or misleading information for inclusion in a statement to Customs are as serious as those of making a false or misleading statement to Customs and hence should be subject to the same penalties. While some in the industry understandably believe that these amendments are heavy handed, there is the long standing issue of the efficiency of duty and excise collection, which is entirely dependent upon the accuracy of the information provided. This has been a major issue for Customs, and the introduction of electronic systems provides an opportunity to gain better control. Like all regulatory areas of the Customs jurisdiction, this will need careful monitoring. However, in conclusion, the opposition supports this legislation. Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003. The bill implements the largest IT undertaking in Australia’s history. The cargo management re-engineering project, or CMR, establishes an integrated system that replaces the legacy systems currently utilised by the department that handles the exchanges of complex and varied documentation involved in routine imports and exports. This bill is necessary to ensure that stringent procedures are in place for the estimated 5,000 importers, exporters and other traders who will use the new CMR software. Part1 of the bill removes the requirement on stevedores to send a report to Customs when no containers are being unloaded from a ship. Stevedores will not have to communicate a nil report to Customs where no containers are discharged for any period of time greater than three hours. However, stevedores will be required to communicate an out-turn report at the end of the three-hour period from when unloading commences. Part2 of the bill requires a report to be made to Customs after goods are removed from a wharf or airport otherwise than for export. This section is important; it is so that Customs can identify, locate and track the movement of certain prohibited and/or high-risk exports, including illicit goods or goods improperly diverted into the domestic market. Part4 of the bill amends the current false and misleading statement provisions in the Customs Act so that a person who is responsible for a statement given to Customs, regardless of where they are along the communication chain, is the person who commits an offence pursuant to the legislation. The implementation of the CMR system is important to ensure that the Australian Customs Service can continue to adequately manage the security and integrity of Australia’s borders, especially when it comes to moving items into and out of the country. The implementation of this system, in three stages, is a continued demonstration that this government remains strong in the area of border protection. The community is reminded constantly about the necessity for this. Indeed, two foreign nationals were arrested on Saturday following the detection of heroin allegedly concealed in six injection-moulding machines that arrived at the port of Melbourne from Malaysia in mid-November last year. The minister said that it was yet another example of a highly sophisticated attempt to smuggle deadly drugs into Australia which was prevented by the swift and effective work of Customs and the Australian Federal Police. That incident is not alone. Earlier this month a shipment of 195 kilograms of ecstasy tablets was MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Customs Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2003
200,Mr Dutton (Dickson) (10.08 A.m.),"I rise today to support the government’s Customslocated. It consisted of some 860,000 tablets and was found in agricultural machinery imported from Belgium on 4 October. It constituted the second-largest seizure of ecstasy tablets in Australia and has an estimated potential street value of more than $60 million. This bill reinforces the commitment by the Howard government and underlines the hard work that has been undertaken by the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison. It also underlines the determination of this government to secure our borders and to provide Customs and the other law enforcement agencies of this country with the effective means of bringing together the proper legislation for the protection of our borders that we require. We saw an example recently of the situation which underscores the need for Australia to continue down the track of strong border protection. We need to continue down this track because serious threats are still posed to Australia and to the Australian people. It is necessary for this government to continue to provide support to the Australian Customs Service in particular because, as an island state, we face many grave threats. I speak not just of peoplesmuggling and the issues which have been in the headlines again in recent days but of one of the very serious problems that faces Australian law enforcement and the Australian community today-that is, the influx of handguns and illegal weapons, some of which obviously are imported through illegal means from overseas sources. In recent months and weeks we have seen the tragic circumstances that followed the use of handguns and other weapons in serious crimes in Sydney and Melbourne. If we are serious in this country about addressing some of these issues then this bill is important. We need to provide the effective means for Customs, as I said earlier, to try and prevent some of these serious problems in our society. If we do not provide Customs and other law enforcement agencies with the means to address these very serious problems, all Australians will suffer. Part of the answer to the crime problem that presents itself in Sydney-and right across New South Wales and in other states around the country-can only be addressed if we provide Customs with the ability to stop the entry of some of these weapons into Australia. If we do not do that then we really are creating a rod for our own back. That is an untenable situation and it is one that we need to address very seriously, and that is what the Howard government continues to do. When I was reading the minister’s second reading speech in relation to this bill, I noticed that it provided a great insight into the minister’s ability in this particular area of law. I think it has been recognised far and wide that the minister, Senator Ellison, has provided a great deal of direction in this very important area of public policy. Today, as part of my commendation of this bill to the House, I want to put on the public record not just on behalf of my constituents but on behalf of all Australians our appreciation of the fine work of the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison. He has provided very substantial benefits to the advancement of many of these pieces of legislation. He has provided great direction, and I commend Senator Ellison for his leadership and his ability to provide for positive and practical outcomes not just for Customs but for areas that otherwise fall under his responsibility, such as the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and a number of other law enforcement agencies that provide the support and infrastructure to protect the Australian people. The Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 is of particular importance to the Australian people and to the import and export industry. The industry, certainly, has in many MAIN COMMITTEE forums expressed its view that this bill provides for a much more modern way of dealing with these movements. It is very generous of the industry to provide such support. It has not been an easy stage, but they have provided considerable support to the government, and I want to thank the industry for its ongoing understanding, consideration and support of the government’s direction. It is with great pleasure today that I commend the Customs Service and the outstanding job that it does in protecting the Australian community by intercepting illegal goods such as drugs and weapons. This bill implements an IT system and procedures that will allow Customs to intercept potentially dangerous and harmful goods. It is fundamental that there are adequate support mechanisms in place, and the procedures in this bill to facilitate the introduction of the CRM system in 2004 are one of those support mechanisms. I commend the bill to the House. Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (10.17 a.m.)-I commend the previous speaker for the interest he has in this matter. Supply chains are the veins of an economy and the fabric of trade both domestically and internationally. The Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 introduces supply chain management initiatives that will have a significant impact on Australian businesses, particularly small and medium sized enterprises. Supply chains are an intricate web of business relationships that exist to enable one organisation to provide goods or services to another organisation or end consumer. Increasingly, information technology underpins the highly sophisticated supply chain management systems of larger organisations and extends their use to small business as a tool to gain competitive advantage. It has often been stated that opportunities exist for Tasmanian business-and, as you know, I represent a seat in Tasmania-to use technology to overcome the additional barriers faced as a result of Tasmania’s isolation because of the body of water that separates the state from the mainland. I note that the use of technology and the Internet by Tasmanian businesses continues to grow despite the inadequate and quite expensive secondrate telecommunications services provided by the dominant carrier in Tasmania, which is Telstra. This growth in using technology can be attributed to many things, including the natural uptake as businesses become more aware of the value proposition being presented. The growth can also be attributed to a variety of Internet education and awareness programs being conducted in the state. There is an established link between the rate of technology uptake and the corresponding amount of support given to breaking down known barriers to adoption. One of the concerns I have with this bill is the introduction of public key infrastructure technology-PKI-to support secure communications. I would like to make this point particularly clear for the House today: I do not have an objection to the notion of ensuring communication between parties is commercial-in-confidence. My concern relates more specifically to the level of support that will be provided to small businesses to assist in implementing PKI. The Australian Taxation Office implemented PKI as part of the Howard government’s tax reform-a rather memorable set of reforms which delivered us the highest taxing government in Australia’s history. The ATO experience demonstrated that PKI is complicated and small businesses have a real reluctance to embrace this technology. Despite the high percentage of small businesses that use computers and the high percentage of those that use the Internet for communications, the vast majority of small businesses do not actually use the ATO’s PKI system. The key difference between the implementation of PKI by the ATO and the implementation we are seeing by Customs is that Customs are actually forcing businesses to use MAIN COMMITTEE PKI. This rather big stick approach may in fact make it much harder for businesses to export and force many small businesses to deal with bureau services. Having to wear additional costs to deal with Customs is a rather unacceptable outcome. I also note that the provisions within the bill give the CEO power to replace PKI with another technology. I do not by any means profess to be an expert on this subject, but I do understand that many people use the Internet to make electronic payments using their credit cards. Many of us do that. Given that credit card information can be passed over the Internet in a secure encrypted form, this provision within the bill is recognition by Customs that they may actually need to replace the complex PKI technology with something that is a little more user friendly. In the context of this bill I would also like to express my concern at the further delays with the cargo management re-engineering project. I note that the CMR web site enunciates that the government has decided that it is prudent to allow additional time for the system to be introduced. But I wonder if the government also decided that it was prudent to have a $100 million cost overrun as well. Clearly, incompetent management of the project within Customs has cost taxpayers a significant amount of money, and the further delays will cost more. The CMR project is significant and some say it is one of the most complex information technology projects in recent times. While I admit that my understanding of complex information technology projects is limited, it does extend to knowing that difficulties are always encountered at implementation. The provisions of this bill dealing with information obtained electronically must account for foreseeable errors in processing documentation by Customs. No doubt the new system will have problems, and we must ensure that small business does not suffer as a result of those problems. This bill fails to deal with one emerging issue that I would have thought would have been quite a high priority. There are industry concerns that the government is not adequately addressing the security aspects related to the transport of high consequence dangerous goods. I understand that the Department of Transport and Regional Services is undertaking a consultancy at the moment to examine the options for tracking the movement of dangerous goods. The movement of dangerous goods is a particularly serious issue and there are many security risks associated with their transport. The focus of current regulation does appear to be very much on safety. My understanding is that Customs do not assess the security threat of a container. Customs ensure that the contents of the container are as declared. So does anyone actually assess the security risk pertaining to a container, a rail wagon or a bulk cargo ship carrying fertiliser? Is there any agency at the moment that is interested in the security of high consequence dangerous goods movements, or are we only interested in the safe carriage of dangerous goods? I think the government needs to turn its attention to these issues in consultation with industry, because the Commonwealth government is ultimately responsible for national security and therefore should be leading this agenda. The Howard government’s management of supply chain security can only be characterised as a series of remarkable failings, particularly when it comes to meeting its fair share of responsibility in regard to aviation and maritime security. Industry should be cautious. The Howard government has an established track record of cost shifting, as evidenced by the huge cost now being shouldered by the maritime and aviation industries for increased security MAIN COMMITTEE measures in these sectors-and I have just been receiving a briefing on some particularly concerning costs that industry is going to have to bear. It would appear that the current design of the CMR systems facilitates the capture of data needed to track the movement of high consequence dangerous goods destined for import or export, so presumably intelligence agencies could be given the opportunity to conduct threat assessments on imported or exported dangerous goods. I imagine that the proposed CMR data entry could be extended quite easily to domestic carriers of high consequence dangerous goods, so this measure would give intelligence agencies the facility to conduct security threat assessments for the movements. I actually think that these matters have to be dealt with quite expeditiously, and I will be very interested to see the outcomes of the dangerous goods consultancy the government is currently undertaking But there is, of course, a broader issue of supply chain security that extends beyond the movement of dangerous goods. I note that US Customs and Border Protection have developed C-TPAT, the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism. The partnership against terrorism is a joint government-business initiative to build cooperative relationships that strengthen the overall supply chain and border security. I would urge the Minister for Justice and Customs and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to collaboratively examine this initiative as it could potentially apply to Australia and to the relationship between the supply chain and border security in Australia. I also understand the department of transport is undertaking a consultancy on containertracking technologies in conjunction with the APEC Transportation Working Group. I presume that there is information sharing between the dangerous goods consultancy and the container tracking technologies consultancy, as it would appear that there will be a significant degree of synergy between these two projects. I assume that this would be the case. I would also assume that Customs is involved in both consultancies being undertaken by the Department of Transport and Regional Services, because again it would appear that there are significant synergies with CMR. The objective of the container-tracking technologies project is to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of sea and air container track and trace technologies, whether it is in commercial use or under development with APEC economies. I imagine that the key issue with the container-tracking technologies project will be who pays. I think most recognise that new technologies allow us to track containers via satellite, but once again one of the key areas will be who is going to pay for this technology-who is going to pay for these steps. These new opportunities to tighten security within the supply chain have to be considered by the government, and we must try to leverage existing investment in information technology infrastructure to ensure that it is cost effective for industry. SoI urge the government to ensure that appropriate training and support initiatives are established to assist small businesses in the adoption of many of these new systems. Finally, I urge the government to conduct a closer examination of the CMR project to expose the cause of one of the most concerning things that we have seen here today, which is the $100 million cost overrun and the ever increasing project delays. ration) (10.27 a.m.)-At the outset, on behalf of the government, I would like to thank all of those honourable members who have participated in the debate of the Customs Legislation MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Customs Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2003
201,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and AdministAmendment Bill (No. 2) 2003. This bill contains a number of amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and other customs legislation related to the customs international trade modernisation. International trade modernisation is a major project that will significantly improve Customs’ processes for managing the movement of cargo across Australia’s borders. The legislative framework for the international trade modernisation was provided through the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001. This bill will make further amendments which are necessary to clarify and improve the operation of that act. There are seven sets of amendments in the bill. They deal with cargo reports, movement and control of export goods, electronic communications, false and misleading statements, a technical correction, review of decisions relating to the administrative penalty scheme, and transitional arrangements between Customs’ legacy export cargo systems and the new integrated cargo system. The key elements for each of these amendments have been clearly outlined in the second reading speech for this bill. Much has been made of the amendment to extend the default commencement date for amendments to the Customs Act 1901 relating to the international trade modernisation project. The effect of the amendment is to allow, as a contingency measure, for the possibility of a need to extend the maximum time for commencement of some of the trade modernisation provisions. In fact, the amendment extends that period from three years to a maximum of four years. The government is confident that Customs and industry will be doing all in their respective powers to see the full suite of trade modernisation changes, including the complex new IT applications, introduced well within that time. But, whether any or all of that period is used, we must remember that ultimately it can only be of benefit to assist the trading community’s ability to adjust to the new integrated cargo system. The international trade modernisation project involves complex and significant legislative changes, and the amendments in this bill are essential elements in that process. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.

202,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance andtems, the main components of which are known as the integrated cargo system and the Customs connect facility. The amendments come as no surprise. There has been wide speculation in the media and in some sectors of the trading community about the possibility of an extension to the commencement time for the international trade modernisation legislation known as the ITM Act. Currently, trade modernisation amendments to the Customs Act are expressed to commence upon proclamation or, if the proclamation does not occur within a period of three years beginning on the day on which the ITM Act receives the royal assent, on the first day after the end of that period-that is, on 20 July next year. As the Minister for Justice and Customs indicated to a Senate estimates hearing recently, an extension is being sought as a prudent contingency measure at this time. As mentioned, the new IT systems are central to the CMR project. As with any new IT development, the timeliness and cost of the roll-out are very important factors. But there is another even more important factor, and that is that the system works. It is somewhat disappointing that media reporting of the new Customs development has focused almost entirely on the first two factors only and very little on the sophisticated functionality of the systems that will keep the pulse of import and export trade in Australia beating. If commentators had taken a moment to concentrate on this aspect of the new Customs system they would have been aware that the integrated cargo system comprises over 800 screens, 9,000 business rules and 15,000 pages of documentation. It is expected to handle up to 3,000 concurrent users and several million export and import transactions per year. The system will process the collection of $6 billion in Commonwealth revenue annually. Furthermore, Customs is one of the few public sector organisations that has planned, funded and soon will achieve the replacement of a disparate range of outdated legacy systems with one integrated system using modern technology. Yes, this has involved a sizeable capital investment; yes, it means an added transition burden for industry, but let us focus on the outcomes post implementation: lower transaction costs for industry and a modern IT system that collects $6 billion in government revenue annually, profiles cargo movements across our borders and ensures the government’s regulatory agenda for international cargo is delivered. For all of these reasons the government is committed to doing whatever it can to ensure that the CMR project and the new systems are as robust and reliable as possible when they are introduced. Of course this means keeping a very close eye on the costs and giving all users as much notice and as much time to prepare for introduction as possible. More importantly, it means ensuring that the systems work when they commence. At the recent Senate estimates hearings, Lionel Woodward, CEO of Customs, confirmed that Customs was working towards implementing the export components of the arrangement by March 2004 and the imports component by July 2004. But, if the underpinning computer systems cannot be ready by that time, whether it be because Customs cannot turn them on by the date specified or because industry users have not had enough time to prepare their own businesses for the new reporting regime, the government will not push ahead blindly. In this context, in the next weeks or even days Customs will have to confirm once and for all for the expectant trading community, particularly for the software developers and other service providers who support them, whether it will in fact be insisting on a 1 March 2004 cut-over for export reporting. Mr Woodward has already reported that industry leaders are MAIN COMMITTEE telling him that it would be better to have more time if it means getting it right. No doubt he will make a responsible decision in the circumstances. (Extension of time granted.) In the meantime, it is also responsible for us to be looking even further forward to the cutover to the imports regime concerning import cargo reporting and declarations. It was originally considered that the three-year period was sufficient to allow not only for the development of the ICS and CCF by Customs but also for the development, testing and deployment by industry of business systems compatible with the ICS and CCF for communicating with Customs. However, partly as a result of moving the date for the robust and reliable commencement of the export arrangements and partly as a result of the sheer complexity of the systems needed to support the import arrangements, it has become apparent that more time is likely to be needed. The indications from Customs and industry are that the current time frame will place pressure on the trading community’s ability to adjust, particularly to the new import components of the system, which could, in turn, significantly disrupt trade. It is therefore proposed as a contingency measure to extend the period to four years, beginning on the day on which the ITM act received the royal assent. While this extension of time will allow a full extra year for development and testing of the ICS, it is expected that the ICS will be operational well before the end of the period. I commend these amendments to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported to the House with amendments.

I suppose it therefore focuses one’s mind more clearly upon what has gone on recently in the workplace and indeed, our desire, which until now was thought to be logical, for people to look to retiring at 55. That issue and many others are now under review, and they are under review for a variety of reasons. MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Customs Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2003
203,Upon Which Mr Mcclelland Moved By Way Of Amendment:,,187,Customs Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2003
204,Mr Brendan O’connor (Burke) (10.38 A.m.),"I rise to make some brief commentsFirst and foremost, notwithstanding whether there have been any concerns about the ageing population of this nation, it should always have been the case that there should not be the capacity to discriminate unnecessarily on the basis of age. I know because of my experience in my role as a union official before coming to this place how many employees have suffered as a result of their age-and not necessarily their skills, abilities and responsibilities. Indeed there was a view around, which was certainly shared by observers from overseas, that we had been taking a harsh view of senior members of our work force over the last 20 or so years. We did not seem to credit people with having valuable contributions to make, because of their age. I think it is now becoming a more prevalent view that that is not the case. The fact is that there is a great deal to be gained from a workplace having employees of all ages-particularly people with the experience and capacity to undertake the work. As someone said earlier in the debate, you cannot acquire experience overnight. It is one of those things that comes only through learning from one’s mistakes and learning from challenges confronted on a day-to-day, week-to-week and year-to-year basis. SoI think it is timely that we have a discussion about age discrimination and whether in fact we are heading in the right direction. Presumably the Prime Minister was referring to this need to look at the broad picture when he recently spoke at a symposium on mature age employment in Sydney. He said: ... the question of an ageless workforce is not primarily an issue of discrimination. It is primarily an issue of investing in our country’s future. To look at the notion of an ageless workforce in terms of antidiscrimination is I think to demean what is at stake and also to invest the debate with far too narrow a legalistic approach. The Prime Minister went on a little later to make this point again, when he said: There is I believe a growing belief in the community that the quality of somebody’s contribution to the workforce is measured only by individual ability, rather than age or any other categorisation. And this is not as I repeat just in terms of the rather narrow legalistic approach of an anti-discrimination attitude, there is a growing realisation in our nation that as our population ages and because of advances in medical science people live longer and as the number of people entering the workforce as a proportion, entering the workforce for the first time dwindles and the inter-generational report produced by the Federal Treasury with last year’s Budget provided a much needed factual basis to contribute to the debate. There is a growing realisation in our nation, within the Government, within the business community, that we do need to husband the resource of the mature age worker to whatever limit the individual capacities of those workers will permit. The Prime Minister’s speech contained no reference to the legislation before the House. At the time he did say: It is not our responsibility, and we certainly don’t intend to do so, to mandate individual behaviour by particular firms and by particular companies. While legislation clearly does not specify any particular action which must be taken by employers, it does specify actions which must not be taken. Furthermore, the prohibition on age discrimination contained in the legislation could form the basis of a finding by the courts as to how particular firms and companies should behave. I think the spirit of the legislation sits oddly with the Prime Minister’s assertion, when speaking of the interplay between employers and employees of different ages. He said: ... we must also recognise that one of the areas of contribution must come from the mature aged workers themselves ... And that will increasingly, for example, mean that if people wish to remain beyond MAIN COMMITTEE what are now regarded as customary retirement ages, there must be a greater willingness to be involved in part-time and contract work and the corresponding flexibility in relation to remuneration arrangements. The prospect that age discrimination legislation could form a prelude to a requirement that workers stay in the work force for longer would not sit comfortably with many people. I believe that the Prime Minister is not in touch with the nation’s feelings on the matter if he believes that people will be compelled to work longer-if, indeed, there have to be unilateral changes to their employment conditions. I think it is fair to say that, whilst we all agree that there should be a capacity for people to work and choose their retirement age, provided they are able to continue in their employment in a meaningful way, there certainly should be more effort made to ensure that the flexibility, if it is to occur, is agreed upon and is not forced upon the work force. One could be cynical and argue that the Prime Minister now wants to lift the age barrier because of his own personal ambitions, now having reached the age of 65, but I am sure it is more as a result of the changes that are taking place in this country, and it would be churlish of me to think otherwise. However, I think there is a unanimous view that the notion that people retire at the age of 55 is not now necessarily the best option for all employees. We have to review our population strategy and, as a component of that, review our immigration intake to ensure that we are not continually ageing as a population. I believe that until we do that we cannot have a holistic debate on this issue. I do think it is true that this country has succeeded economically, socially and culturally when we have had a very good immigration intake. Whilst the intake at the moment is at reasonable levels, there certainly should be consideration given to an increase to ensure that we get the required injection of energy, verve and, indeed, skills from those people who come to this land. It is axiomatic that immigration builds nations, grows economies and grows jobs. There is a notion that has been peddled by some-some deliberately and maliciously, some through ignorance-that somehow immigration costs the jobs of locals. The facts are contrary to that notion. The fact is that those nations that have welcomed high proportions of immigrants to their lands in the last couple of centuries have usually been the most successful economies and nations, because they have grown as a result of immigration. So, whilst we are looking at ways to mitigate the effects of the ageing population of this nation, we have to look at the fact that we are certainly a small nation in population terms. I think we are in a position to review an increase in immigration. I think also it is fair to sayand there has been some consideration of this by the opposition-that we should look at ways in which we can ensure that communities across this country are reinvigorated through immigration growth. Therefore, there need to be more incentives put in place to attract people to the regions and to regional communities and to not necessarily have people congregate in metropolitan cities. That is a critical issue. Only this week I had the Mayor of Young, in New South Wales, in my office. He was there to plead on behalf of his municipality and the refugees who live in his town, many of whom are employees in a local abattoir. He was there to ask me to support them being accepted as permanent residents of this nation. They are currently on temporary protection visas. One of the points he made, which was broader than the actual reasons he came to see me, was that his town was dying; his town was actually declining in population. One might think that the MAIN COMMITTEE community in which he lived was quite conservative-it is a rural community-but the fact is the people in that community embraced these people. Every worker in that abattoir had signed a petition to have those refugees on temporary protection visas, their fellow workers, stay on in their town. It was a very interesting thing for me to witness. People like to make a point that country people will not accept others from overseas, particularly if they are different culturally and ethnically. The fact was this was another example that belies the myth that people will not accept people from overseas. Not only was it illustrative for me; it also reminded me that we have communities that are in dire need of extra labour and human resources and they are crying out for an injection of that kind. Therefore, they seem to be more culturally blind, colour blind or ethnically blind than the supposedly more progressive types in metropolitan areas. People should remember that when they look at that issue. I know that is incidental to some of the discussions on age discrimination, but the Prime Minister has raised this issue in the context of this debate. In a speech he made on 27 August, he effectively said that immigration is an issue that has to be considered in relation to this. He indicated: We can maintain, as we have, a steady but manageable and acceptable increase in the immigration rate, and I know there are many in the community who see a dramatic increase in the immigration rate as being the almost instant solution for the challenge of an ageing population. I do not believe that; I do not think it is the instant solution for the challenge, but I do believe it is a critical component of meeting the challenge of an ageing population. In the same speech, the Prime Minister went on to say: Let me say that once again, I owe keeping a sense of proportion that it can make a contribution and that is why our policy is to have an immigration rate that is supported by our economic circumstances and one that meets the skill and other needs of the Australian community and one that is conducted on a completely non-discriminatory basis so far as race, ethnicity and country of origin is concerned. It is nice to hear the Prime Minister now say that he is colour blind in immigration. We know he did not have that view in the early eighties; in fact, he was peddling anti-Asian fears. We know the Prime Minister is on the record as wanting to reduce the intake of Asians into this country. It is important to note-and I am being very respectful to the Prime Minister-that he has flipped on that; he now holds the view that we should not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity. It shows that the Prime Minister can learn a thing or two. But we have to solve this debate on age discrimination by fundamentally tackling the issue of population. Therefore, we have to review the immigration intake. We have to review the way we tackle the immigration and population policies that attend to the needs of communities that are effectively dying in this country, because at the moment that is not occurring. I know it is a complex area; there are many components to it. I refute the assertions made by the Prime Minister that enough has been done in immigration and population policies to attend to the ageing of our population. I also disagree that there should be unilateral changes made so that employees who are at the latter part of their working life are made to move on to contract and part-time work if they have to maintain employment beyond the age 55. In conclusion, I support the comments that have been made by the member for Barton in relation to this matter. He will reiterate some of those matters, and I thank him for enlightening this chamber. MAIN COMMITTEE ration) (10.55 a.m.)-In summing up the cognate debate on the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 and the Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003 on behalf of the Attorney General, I would like to thank members for their respective contributions to the debate on these bills. Despite existing state and territory laws, age discrimination is an increasingly significant problem for our society. The social and economic costs of age discrimination will only increase with demographic change in Australia. We cannot afford to ignore the important social and economic contributions that older and younger Australians make to the community. I suspect that most honourable members would agree with that statement. These bills strike a careful balance between the need to eliminate unfair age discrimination and the need to permit legitimate age distinctions. The legislation will play a key role in changing negative attitudes about older and younger Australians. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee considered the bills and issued its report on 18 September. The committee commented very favourably on the extensive consultation process which informed the development of the bills and the committee also, quite appropriately, noted that there was very wide support for the bills. I would like to respond briefly to the five recommendations of the committee. I do not propose to comment at this stage on the dissenting reports. The first recommendation of the committee is that the scope of the dominant reason test in clause 16 be further defined and the clause amended to specify who bears the onus of proof in establishing the dominant reason for discrimination. The government does not consider that the recommended amendments are necessary. In the area of age discrimination, action should be unlawful only where age is the dominant consideration. It is the view of the government that this test will be most appropriate to promote the attitudinal change it seeks to achieve. The legislation, including clause 16, is designed to send a clear message that age stereotyping is unacceptable, without suggesting that age can never be a relevant consideration. The second recommendation of the committee is that the government consider expanding the workplace relations exemption at clause 39(8) to cover industrial agreements made under state law. The case for such expansion has not been made. The current exemption covers federal agreements. In the federal sphere, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Employment Advocate must have regard for the need to eliminate discrimination, including age discrimination. State industrial relations arrangements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some states make no mention of antidiscrimination provisions or the need to eliminate age discrimination. The Commonwealth cannot be confident that all state arrangements deal with the potential for age discrimination. The third recommendation of the committee is to amend clause 15, which effectively defines indirect discrimination to specify what factors must be taken into account when considering whether action is reasonable in the circumstances. Action that is reasonable cannot constitute indirect discrimination. However, inclusion of a list of matters to be taken into account in determining what is reasonable, as in the Sex Discrimination Act, could result in a more restrictive interpretation. There is likely to be a wide range of reasonable circumstances in relation to age discrimination. The explanatory memorandum identifies some of these. The legislation also needs to be flexible enough to cover all such circumstances. As the proposed amendment would not work to that end, it is not supported by the government. MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Customs Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2003
205,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and AdministThe fourth recommendation of the committee is that the government consider whether the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission requires additional funding. The general position of the government is that agencies are not provided with new resources that can and should be absorbed in the normal process of adjusting priorities as circumstances change. The commission receives a total budget to deal with the entire spread of its responsibilities, not separate budgets for particular areas of discrimination. Age discrimination already falls within the broader education and inquiry function of the commission. The government is still considering the 2003-04 budget for the commission. The fifth recommendation of the committee is to extend the concept of age discrimination to cover an aggrieved person’s relative or associate. A case for the extension of the legislation into this area of public life has not been made out. The case in the report for new provisions covering discrimination on the grounds of the age of a person’s associate appear for the moment to rest on less than compelling grounds. The opposition will have a number of amendments. I think the member for Barton is going to move them shortly in the consideration in detail stage. There will also be some government amendments. But I am delighted with the widespread support for the government’s decision to introduce age discrimination legislation. I look forward to the cooperation of the other place in achieving timely passage of these bills. I commend both bills to the House. read a second time.

207,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (11.02 A.m.),"by leave-I move opposition amendments (1)For the purposes of this Act, a person (the discriminator) discriminates against another person (the aggrieved person) on the ground of the age of the aggrieved person or the age of a relative or associate of the aggrieved person if: (a) the discriminator harasses, or treats or proposes to treat the aggrieved person less favourably than, in circumstances that are the same or are not materially different, the discriminator treats or would treat a person of a different age or who does not have a relative or associate who is of that age or age group, and (b) the discriminator does so because of: (i) the age of the aggrieved person or the age of a relative or associate of the aggrieved person; or (ii) a characteristic that appertains generally to persons of the age of the aggrieved person or the age of a relative or associate of the aggrieved person; or (iii) a characteristic that is generally imputed to persons of the age of the aggrieved person or the age of a relative or associate of the aggrieved person. (4) Clause 15, page 12 (lines 19-28), omit subsection (1), substitute: (1) For the purposes of this Act, a person (the discriminator) discriminates against another person (the aggrieved person) on the ground of the age of the aggrieved person or the age of a relative or associate of the aggrieved person if: (a) the discriminator imposes, or proposes to impose, a condition, requirement or practice; and (b) the condition, requirement or practice is not reasonable in the circumstances; and (b) the condition, requirement or practice has, or is likely to have, the effect of disadvantaging persons of the same age as the aggrieved person. (5) Clause 16, page 13 (lines 1-6), omit the section, substitute 16 Act done because of age and for other reasons If: (a) an act is done for 2 or more reasons, and (b) one of the reasons is the age of a person (whether or not it is the dominant reason for doing the act) then, for the purposes of this Act, the Act is taken to be done for that reason. I outlined the nature of these amendments in my response to the second reading debate in the House, so I will not labour the point. However, I will outline as far as I can amendments (1) and (2), which go to the issue of discrimination against a person’s relatives or associates. We understand that issue was considered by the government but rejected as a result of pressure from some business interests. We say that, while we are often accused of being beholden to sectional interests, regrettably the government was unreasonably restrained by that input and ignored the interests of the broader community. As I have indicated, it is not difficult to envisage situations where discrimination on the basis of the age of a relative or associate may arise. For example, in an employment situation an employer might discriminate against an employee who cares for an aged relative, because of the apprehension by the employer that the employee might need time off to attend to the needs of that relative. Another situation might be that of a hotelier not allowing parents with young children to stay as guests, because of the hotelier’s anticipation of the unruly behaviour of the children. I have indicated that those would be unsatisfactory states of affairs. We take the view that the legislation should set stanMAIN COMMITTEE dards and not merely provide the lowest standard of protection. We believe that the government’s capitulation because of those more limited interests is regrettable and should be reconsidered for the debate in the Senate. I jump to amendment (5), which addresses what is probably the greatest inadequacy in the government’s regime-the decision made by the government to water down the test for whether particular conduct constitutes age discrimination by requiring that age discrimination be the dominant reason for the conduct complained about. This is the most significant issue addressed in our amendments and is one of substance. The requirement that age discrimination be the dominant reason for a complaint makes the test much harder than that which applies, for instance, under the various state and territory laws that deal with age discrimination or, for that matter, under other federal antidiscrimination laws such as the Racial Discrimination Act. For consistency alone, again in terms of setting standards, we suggest to the government that, if they are to be seen as being strong in this area, they should have an equal test applicable in the area of age discrimination. Amendment (3) deals with the issue of harassment. The government’s position on age based harassment mirrors its position on relatives and associates. We understand that this issue was raised in an information paper issued by the government but, after noting that only the Northern Territory specifically banned age based harassment, the government again succumbed to those limited business concerns and declined to ban in the legislation age based harassment. However, age based harassment is a real phenomenon and should be stopped. No more should young apprentices and junior staff be bullied and treated in a demeaning manner and no longer should older Australians be subjected to derogatory taunts. These amendments have been moved in good faith. If they-in particular, the test for when discrimination occurs-are picked up, we think the government’s measures will have far more impact on those areas of discrimination not only from the point of view of a regulatory regime but, more importantly, from the point of view of having an educative effect on the development of attitudes and the breaking down of what unfortunately still exists as a culture of discrimination against Australian citizens on the basis of age. Administration) (11.07 a.m.)-I am sorry to disappoint my friend the member for Barton, who is one of the best performers on the opposition side of the House, but the government does not agree with the amendments that he has moved and so eloquently supported in this debate. The amendments seek to extend the concept of unlawful age discrimination to cover an aggrieved person’s relative or associate. They would also specifically introduce age based harassment as a ground of direct discrimination in clause 14 and, effectively, remove the dominant reason test in clause 16. Once again, a compelling case for the amendments has not been made out. The protection offered by the bill is already extensive. It has been suggested that amendments to cover relatives and associates are needed-for example, to deal with hoteliers who may exclude a person because that person has unruly children. However, as drafted, the bill would permit a complaint on behalf of children who are unlawfully excluded from premises on the basis of age. It has also been suggested that amendments are needed to cover a situation where a person is not employed because he or she may need to take time off to care for an aged relative. However, it is not at all clear that this is a matter of age based discrimination. Complex quesMAIN COMMITTEE",192,Customs Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2003
208,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance andtions of family responsibility are not reducible to questions of age discrimination. It is not realistic to look to age discrimination legislation to solve such questions. The issue of family responsibilities is addressed in other forums-for example, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Workplace Relations Act. As to harassment, the absence of a specific reference in the bill does not mean that a complaint of age based harassment cannot be brought. Harassment is covered where it amounts to direct discrimination. In particular, the bill prohibits discrimination on the ground of age in the workplace. Specific allegations of discriminatory harassment will turn on the circumstances of the particular case. This is appropriate. As to the proposed amendment of clause 16 and the dominant reason test, I have already outlined the rationale for retaining the current test.

(2) Clause 41, page 33 (after line 24), after subclause (3), insert: (3A) This Part does not make unlawful anything done by a person in direct compliance with a determination in force under subparagraph 209(1)(a)(i) of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. (3) Clause 42, page 35 (lines 16 to 26), omit the definition of exempted health program, substitute: exempted health program means a program, scheme or arrangement that: (a) relates to health goods or services or medical goods or services; and (b) to the extent that it applies to people of a particular age, is reasonably based on evidence of effectiveness, and on cost (if cost has been taken into account in relation to the program, scheme or arrangement). The evidence of effectiveness mentioned in paragraph (b) is evidence that is reasonably available from time to time about matters (such as safety, risks, benefits and health needs) that: (c) affect people of the age mentioned in that paragraph (if no comparable evidence is reasonably available from time to time in relation to people of a different age); or (d) affect people of the age mentioned in that paragraph in a different way to people of a different age (in all other cases).

The community will benefit from the enhanced role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in promoting community awareness and attitudinal change and in conciliating age discrimination complaints. It is patently false to suggest that the passage of the Age Discrimination Bill will wind back the protection available to Australian citizens. Turning to the three government amendments to the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 I am moving, amendments (1) and (2) relate to section 41, which covers pensions, allowances and benefits. The amendments are designed to make clear that decisions made in accordance with certain disallowable instruments under Commonwealth acts are not made unlawful under the bill. Amendment (1) would insert into section 41 a new subsection (2)(a) which would exempt a determination under section 169(1)(a)(i) of the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999. Amendment (2) would insert a new subsection 3(a) which would exempt a determination under section 209(1)(a)(i) of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. In part, the determinations govern the purposes for which the secretary of the Department of Family and Community Services can authorise the disclosure of information about people aged under 18 who have sought financial assistance on the grounds of being homeless. Those purposes may include facilitating reconciliation between parents and homeless young persons and protecting homeless young persons from abuse or violence. The determinations allow the secretary to authorise the disclosure of relevant information to an appropriate authority, including parents. Amendments (1) and (2) will ensure that disclosure, in accordance with this age based requirement, is not made unlawful. As the instruments in question are disallowable, any future amendment would of course also be subject to disallowance. Amendment (3) relates to section 42 of the bill. Section 42 was designed to make clear that certain health measures are not made unlawful. The specific exemptions established by sections 42(1) and (42)(2) operate by reference to a definition of ‘exempted health program’ set out in subsection (6). Exempted health programs and decisions under such programs are exempt. Broadly, the definition of ‘exempted health program’ requires programs for the provision of health and medical goods and services to be based on a range of relevant considerations. Amendment (3) would refine the current definition in four ways. Firstly, it would remove any doubt that cost may be a legitimate consideration in the formulation of health programs for the provision of goods and services. It goes almost without saying that governments have a duty to ensure that finite health resources are allocated on a reasonable basis. Secondly, the amendment would remove any doubt that it may be legitimate to provide services or goods to a single age group on the basis of evidence that relates to that age group only. The absence of comparable data for other age groups should not be a barrier to the provision of goods or services to a particular age group, where that would be beneficial. Thirdly, the amendment would remove any doubt that the formulation of programs or particular aspects of programs may be based on evidence available from time to time. The current definition is arguably too rigid in requiring programs to be based on evidence available at the time of the program’s establishment. (Extension of time granted) The amendment would, in effect, also require the review, from time to time, of the operation of relevant programs. MAIN COMMITTEE Fourthly, and finally, the amendment would make it clearer that the particular matters specified in the definition of exempted health program-safety, risk, benefits and health needsare intended as examples of matters in relation to which relevant evidence may be adduced to support an age based element of a program. They do not constitute a list of matters which must be taken into account in every case. The Attorney-General has also approved two further minor additions to the explanatory memorandum. These clarify the circumstances in which employers may advertise positions of employment and are designed to put the intended operation of clauses 14 and 50 of the bill beyond any doubt. I commend the government amendments to the House. Quite frankly, the opposition have not had sufficient opportunity for broader consultation in respect of the amendments. We note the substance of them and the rationale advanced. We will certainly take that on board before considering our final position when the matter is debated in the Senate. At this point in time, we will not oppose those amendments. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House with amendments.

Labor view this bill as largely uncontroversial and will not oppose key provisions in the House or the Senate. I do not propose to comment in detail on all elements of the bill but I do want to discuss the rent assistance and compensation recovery provisions. Schedule1 of the bill seeks to consolidate provisions for the payment of rent assistance to one place in the act, rather than the current situation where provisions for the payment of rent assistance are repeated in each of the rate calculators for each of the payments that the rent assistance may be paid with. This will simplify administration. There appear to be no significant policy changes that result from the consolidation. This said, Labor will closely scrutinise the new provisions to ensure that there are no unintended consequences. Labor recall efforts MAIN COMMITTEE",195,Customs Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2003

The change may have left some families worse off by virtue of reducing the income cut-off points for payments such as parenting payment. If there are any such consequences in this legislation, Labor will move amendments in the Senate to correct them. Labor will also reserve the right in the Senate to amend the rent assistance measures in this bill to give effect to Labor’s commitment to extend rent assistance to Austudy recipients, which is part of our Aim Higher policy. Similar amendments are currently before the Senate in the Family and Community Services (Closure of Student Financial Supplement Scheme) Bill 2003. Should they be unsuccessful, we will move them again in relation to this bill. Schedule2 of the bill includes amendments to the compensation recovery regime. These amendments will ensure that supplementary payments are not payable and may be recovered when linked compensation-affected social security payments are reduced to nil. Currently, only the income support component may be recovered when a lump sum or periodic compensation results in a nil payment rate. There is no basis for the recovery of supplementary payments such as pharmaceutical allowance, telephone allowance or pensioner education supplement that may have been paid alongside the income support payment. The inability to recover these supplementary payments is an anomaly when compared with the treatment of debts which occur as a result of ordinary income which results in an income support payment being reduced to nil. Under these circumstances, both the income support payment and supplementary payments may be recovered. This measure will only impact on individuals who receive compensation payments on or after 1 July 2004. Labor has considered these amendments carefully; however, we do wish to note the government’s track record on compensation issues. In 1997, the government forced people who received compensation payments to wait longer for access to income support. Naturally, compensation payments may include a component that is attributed for future lost earnings. It is reasonable, then, that this component is taken into account and that a preclusion period is served before support from the taxpayer is required. Before 1997, the preclusion period was calculated by reference to average weekly earnings. This allowed people who were injured to have access to income that the rest of the community earns and, in most instances, reflected the income these people earned before their injury. However, as of 20 March 1997, the government changed the formula of the preclusion period with reference to an amount equivalent to the maximum single pension rate plus the free area. This had the effect of increasing the preclusion period and requiring individuals to survive on incomes well below average weekly earnings. As if being hurt at work or somewhere else were not enough, we had this mean-spirited government consigning these people to lower standards of living. Subsequent measures to improve the situation have been insignificant compared with the near $25 million per year cut as a result of the government’s 1997 changes. Labor will support the measures in this bill but does note that there is some way to go before the treatment of compensation is fair. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.22 a.m.)-The Social Security Amendment (Further Simplification) Bill 2003 is supported by this side of the House. I would have to say that any legislation that is designed to simplify the operation of the Social Security Act is welcomed, provided it does not disadvantage those people who are in receipt of support from the government. MAIN COMMITTEE The staff at Centrelink who are responsible for implementing the Social Security Act have been under a lot of pressure since this government came to power. They are constantly in a state of flux, and they are being asked to do more and more with fewer and fewer staff. I was speaking to an employee of Centrelink as recently as three or four days ago, just prior to coming down here to Canberra. The employee said, ‘The one thing that we need is somebody to stand up for us, the staff of Centrelink. We are constantly under pressure to put in place the government’s legislation.’ It is on those grounds that I think this bill should receive particular support, because it does consolidate the rules relating to rent assistance. When you look at the Bills Digest for this piece of legislation, you see how many different areas in the Social Security Act look at rent assistance. Currently the rent assistance provision appears in so many different locations in the act that there is unnecessary duplication of provisions. I think that wherever you have got a situation where provisions are duplicated you are going to have problems, errors and great difficulty for the staff who are implementing the changes. Under the proposed changes, the specific rules for calculating rent assistance in relation to all social security payments will be in one place, and that has to be a real plus; it has to be a plus for the people in receipt of rent assistance and for the staff who are responsible for implementing rent assistance. Many members on this side of the House and, I am sure, on the other side of the House have been contacted on occasions by constituents who have had problems with their rent assistance and the way it has been calculated. After further investigation, invariably you discover that the problem has resulted from an error by the staff simply because the process is so complex and the provisions are listed in so many different areas. I really commend that aspect of this legislation. It will make things easier, better, more effective and more efficient for the staff and for the people who are receiving rent assistance. Finally, I would like to touch on compensation payments and the effect of the legislation there. In doing so, I join with the shadow minister in condemning the changes that the government have made in that area and the difficulty that changing and extending the preclusion periods has caused for a number of people, particularly when you look at the GST implications and the fact that preclusion periods were not recalculated after the GST was introduced. People who had had a preclusion period put in place prior to the implementation of the GST were more disadvantaged than those who had one put in place afterwards, keeping in mind the way the preclusion periods are calculated now. As the shadow minister said, we will be supporting the amendments, but we are concerned about the government’s treatment of people who receive compensation. We are concerned about many of the changes that this government has made to the Social Security Act and we are concerned about the implications for people who are in receipt of Austudy. We feel that they should also be entitled to rent assistance. Once again we are quite disappointed that that is not included in the bill. I support the bill. I support the bill primarily on the ground that it will provide people in receipt of Centrelink payments with a much more efficient service with fewer mistakes, and I support it from the point of view of those staff who work in the Centrelink offices and who are forced, on a daily basis, to confront the convoluted legislation that this government has passed, with greater requirements and fewer staff to deal with them.

214,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Communityto this consideration of the Social Security Amendment (Further Simplification) Bill 2003. I assure the member for Shortland that, far from trying to rearrange the compensation payments as part of this bill-with the resulting effect that that would have on people’s payments from the government-we are only applying these new changes to new recipients of pensions and compensation into the future. So in fact there is no attempt at clawback, and these changes apply fairly to all concerned. The bill consolidates the rent assistance provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 and makes a number of other minor changes and some technical amendments. The consolidation rules relating to rent assistance take up the major part of the bill, and the rent assistance provisions currently appear in many different locations in the act. The result is much unnecessary duplication of corresponding provisions. This bill will put in one place the rules for calculating rent assistance in relation to all social security payments. This will make it easier for Centrelink staff to work out a customer’s entitlement to rent assistance and to explain the basis of the calculation to customers. Centrelink customers will continue to receive the rent assistance they currently receive under the existing provisions. The bill contains a small number of minor changes to bring the law into line with current administrative practices and to ensure that the law reflects what people are currently receiving. The consolidation of rent assistance measures contained in this bill is an important part of the measures being undertaken to give effect to the government’s commitment to implement a simpler and more coherent social security system. The bill also applies the definition of ‘independence’ which currently applies to youth allowance customers to disability support pension youth customers. As a result, a small number of customers will be entitled to receive a higher rate of disability support pension payments. The bill will also amend the definition of ‘compensation affected payments’ to include certain supplementary payments which are paid as a result of a person being eligible for a social security pension allowance or benefit. These supplementary payments will be recoverable from people who receive an economic loss compensation payment. These changes will apply after 1 July 2004. However, they will affect only those customers who receive both the social security supplementary payments and compensation payments from and after that date. Finally, a small number of minor technical amendments is being made to clarify the operation of the income and assets test provisions of chapter 3 of the Social Security Act. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 December 2002, on motion by Mr Entsch: That this bill be now read a second time. Dr EMERSON (Rankin) (11.32 a.m.)-The Designs Bill 2003 repeals the Designs Act 1906 and introduces a new registration system for industrial designs. It is self-evident that it MAIN COMMITTEE might be just about time to repeal a Designs Act that was originally passed through the parliament of Australia in 1906. Of course, there have been many amendments since then, but the passage of time has been a very long one and therefore it makes sense to have a fresh lookalmost 100 years later-at the provisions of the Designs Act to see whether they serve the interests of Australia and those involved in the creation of intellectual property. It became quite evident as a result of this consideration of the adequacy of that act that a new act was indeed necessary to take us into the 21st century. Australia’s design registration system is used by companies to protect the visual appearance of manufactured goods and it is to that extent that designs legislation is in fact associated with and has the purpose of protecting intellectual property. The term ‘design’ refers to the features of shape, configuration, pattern and ornamentation that can be judged by the eye in finished products. The bill before the Main Committee today is a response to the sort of review that I mentioned in my introductory remarks. In particular, it is a response to the Australian Law Reform Commission’s 1995 report on designs. The Law Reform Commission found that the current design system has a number of problems, and I will mention a few of those. One of the problems identified in the Law Reform Commission’s report was minimal eligibility requirements for the registration of designs. Another problem identified in that process was inadequate infringement tests. A further problem was excessive costs. Finally-and quite tellingly-it was identified that there was inadequacy in preventing copying. The legislation before the Main Committee today will make design registration more difficult to obtain but easier to enforce. The new test for the design registration is ‘new and distinctive’ as opposed to the existing test of ‘new or original’. The bill will also streamline the registration process by providing registration for designs before their examination for novelty or distinctiveness. At present this examination occurs if and when the design is challenged or enforcement of the design is sought. So the whole process here is to do it up front to avoid problems that might emerge down the track. Since very few registered designs are ever the subject of litigation, this will allow the vast majority of designs to be registered very simply and effectively. The legislation before us constitutes a significant streamlining of processes, and Labor welcome that. There are areas in which the government is proposing changes that are different to the Law Reform Commission’s recommendations. For example, in respect of the treatment of spare parts the bill creates a right to repair defence to infringement of registered design alternative producers of mechanical spare parts, such as car parts. The reforms also reduce the proposed maximum term of registration. The existing term of 16 years is made up of one year plus a possible extension of a further 15 years. That will be changed to 10 years-five years plus a possible extension of a further five years. When the Labor Party considered this bill within our own processes, we identified a number of concerns with it and, for that reason, we joined with other parties in sending it to a Senate committee. The committee considered the bill and found that the proposed amendments provide a reasonable approach on these issues. On the spare parts issue, the most serious concern raised by local automotive manufacturers such as Holden and Ford was that alternative spare parts may not meet the same safety standards as original parts. However, the Senate committee decided that this issue was best dealt with through safety standards rather than MAIN COMMITTEE through these design laws. The committee also noted that there will be a formal review of the right of repair provisions in this bill by 2005. So there will be an opportunity at that time to review the operation of these amendments. As a result of the processes that we have gone through-proper parliamentary scrutiny involving a Senate inquiry into this legislation-I am pleased to indicate that Labor support the passage of this bill. I will make a couple of remarks about that. In my own electorate, I am often asked why political parties always oppose each other’s legislation. I explain that, in fact, the majority of legislation is not opposed and is passed by the opposition of the day. But, quite understandably, we do not see on the news in the evenings that the parliament today passed 15 or 10 bills on which there was a common view and a commonality of interest in passing that legislation. It is not a big news story and, in the absence of such a big news story, it is understandable that people would see only the conflict that goes on between the two parties either over highly controversial legislation or in question time, or both. I wanted to put on the record that Labor very often support government legislation where it is philosophically acceptable to us or, perhaps where there is no strong philosophical basis, where it is just a way of advancing the interest of this country-and, on that basis, we are positive about government legislation. The Main Committee here today facilitates the debate on legislation of that kind. However, I will make some remarks more broadly about the creation and protection of intellectual property. In this country we have seen over the last seven or so years, sadly, a reduction in national effort in the creation and protection of intellectual property. One of the first decisions of the Howard government was to cut the 150 per cent R&D tax concession back to 125 per cent, and there was an almost immediate response in terms of private sector investment in research and development in this country. The sad reality is that for most of the years of the Howard government private sector spending on research and development in Australia has fallen as a share of gross domestic product. Worse, in the countries with which we need to compare ourselves, because they are competitor countries, private sector spending on research and development as a share of GDP has been rising. Consequently, there has been a widening gap-almost a chasm now-between the efforts that have been applied here in Australia by the private sector and those applied by our rivals in other countries. This is a particularly unfortunate reality, because in the 21st century we-Labor-are acutely aware that today’s productivity growth is tomorrow’s living standards. While in government we set about a comprehensive program of economic reforms which were all designed to boost productivity in this country. The results, though somewhat delayed, have been quite spectacular, to the point where in the last 10 years productivity growth in this country has been more rapid than in any other country on earth other than Finland, outstripping the productivity growth of the United States. Now, tragically, that productivity growth is tapering off, and in the last six months productivity growth in Australia has in fact been negative. You cannot fundamentally restructure the Australian economy a second time and expect to get the same benefits that have flowed from the restructuring that occurred in the visionary Hawke and Keating years. We cannot do that twice, but we can examine and apply the new sources of productivity growth in Australia around the world in the 21st century. They are investment in skills and investment in ideas-that is, skills formation and innovation. The tragedy unfolding in this country for our future-the future of productivity growth and, thereMAIN COMMITTEE fore, the future of living standards-is that investment in skills formation has been lamentable since the election of the Howard government, and investment in ideas has been similarly lamentable. All of this is being allowed to happen on the basis of an economy that is motoring along quite well, but which is essentially based on a housing bubble without the anticipation now and the decisions that need to be made today to ensure that we are investing in the new sources of productivity growth. It is just not happening. Public investment in education as a share of gross domestic product in the last 10 years has fallen quite substantially. Even when you take into account private sector investment in education, which this government has required through its higher education policies to come in and take up the slack, total investment in education in Australia as a share of gross domestic product has fallen. Similarly, as I have pointed out, private sector investment in research and development has fallen. So the two major sources of productivity growth for the coming decades, for which we believe we have a responsibility, are heading south, and the government is doing nothing about it. It has brought in a designs bill. I respect the Designs Bill. We are supporting the Designs Bill. But the bad news is that this Designs Bill will not boost Australia’s productivity growth or tomorrow’s living standards to anywhere near the extent that we will have to. If you combine the neglect and the lack of investment in the two major sources of productivity growth in this country with the demographic profile of Australia, you get a completely poisonous cocktail. Any examination of population growth and the ageing of the population reveals two realities: firstly, the ageing of the population in Australia is going to continue, at an accelerating rate; and, secondly, as a consequence, total population growth in this country will begin to slow. It has already started to slow down and it will follow the countries of Europe in doing so, as our population, like the populations of those countries, starts to become older. Women are having babies later and they are having fewer babies, so we are confronting declining fertility and the slowing of the population growth of Australia to the point where it is now forecast that, around the middle of the 2030s, Australia’s population will begin to fall. We are a small country already. I do not think too many people would sign up to the outlook of a falling population in this country, but that is what is going to happen. Already the trends are so entrenched that it will not be possible to avoid that outcome. So, if we are going to deal with a falling population, there is only one other way of doing it: migration. If you have a look at the government’s attitude to migration, I will give you one more telling statistic: in the last year the net number of migrants coming to this country-that is, the migrants coming to Australia minus the Australians migrating overseas-was 40,000. Forty thousand migrants would not fill Suncorp Stadium in Queensland; they would not fill the Telstra Dome in Victoria. This is our migration policy: 40,000 people! Meanwhile, asylum seekers are being vilified so as to bring the whole migration program into disrepute and poison the minds of the Australian public. So we are confronted with a falling population, a government that is not committed to migration and therefore a very poor outlook from the year 2035 onwards. The government might see short-term political benefit in this: preying on the fears of Australians about terrorism, deliberately confusing asylum seekers with terrorism and then poisoning the minds of the public about immigration in this country. is passionate about what he is talking about, but this has absolutely nothing to do with design. MAIN COMMITTEE",199,Social Security Amendment Further Simplification Bill 2003
215,Mr Neville,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I understand the memberthe bill. ideas and skills formation. The Designs Bill is a very small contribution to that. My point is that it is literally a drop in the ocean, and I am talking about the rest of the ocean. Nevertheless, I will not take too much more of the Main Committee’s time. I am simply pointing out in this forum-and in any other forum I can-that this country will certainly head into troubled waters from the year 2035 onwards because of the lack of investment in skills formation in this country and the lack of investment in innovation and in new ideas and because of this government’s blinkered approach-it is, in fact, a prejudiced approach-to population growth and immigration in this country. I am putting that on the record. But in relation to the drop in the ocean about which we are speaking today, I am pleased to confirm that Labor will support this legislation. mission reviewed the Australian industrial design system and found a number of inadequacies. They produced 188 different recommendations about the way we could set about making a system that would be simpler and more effective in administering people’s rights to design, their ideas and their IP-and the contribution that they are making-in order to maximise the return that they receive through their good design work. Naturally, this is an important part of the innovation quotient in Australia. It is something the government has been very interested in. The government has introduced its Backing Australia’s Ability innovation action plan and the Designs Bill 2003 forms an important part of it. As I said, the Australian Law Reform Commission produced 188 different recommendations to make a system that would be simpler and more effective. The government, to its credit, has accepted the majority of those recommendations, and the bill now follows through to implement the government’s response. The existing system has become very tired. It has been in place since 1906, and it no longer provides an effective system of protection. Unfortunately, the way things are at present, it is very simple to register a design but quite difficult for the system to detect an infringement. This obviously creates a lot of difficulty, and the need to come up with a better system therefore arises. The new bill provides for much more streamlined systems of registration. Stricter requirements will be applied to eligibility under the Designs Bill, and there will be stricter infringement processes. It provides for a system under which there will be better enforcement of people’s designs and their rights to protect them, and there will also be better dispute resolution. On the whole, this is a system that will be more cost effective, because, no matter how easy it is to register your design, if it is impossible to prove an infringement then that is not a costeffective system. We have innovators in this country, people who are producing excellent designs for a range of products. We have already talked about cars and the parts that go into them, but we could also talk about a chair or anything else that has a distinctive and marketable design. Australia desires to be a producer of good design, so it is important that we have a system to protect design skills. Under the new bill, the maximum registration term will be 10 years, and there are clearer definitions. A valid design registration will be harder to obtain, but once it has been obtained it will be much easier to enforce. MAIN COMMITTEE",203,Designs Bill 2003

218,Mr Cameron Thompson (Blair) (11.48 A.m.),"The Australian Law Reform ComI was interested in what the member for Rankin had to say. As my colleague the member for Hinkler pointed out, there was not a lot in his kooky economic theories that had much to do with design in itself, but I can understand him being concerned, somewhere in the darker recesses of his mind, about problems relating to encouraging innovation. That is something that is very important. To pick up on a point that he made, bringing 40,000 people to Australia every year in order to advance our skills base has nothing to do with filling Suncorp Stadium. We do not bring 40,000 people here each year to take them to the footy. That is not what we are doing; we are trying to enhance the nation’s skills base. So, while the member for Rankin does seem to understand the need for an immigration policy and the need to advance the country’s skills base, he falls short with his confused idea that we are bringing them all here to send them to the footy. We are not. Things such as the Designs Bill are being put in place so that we can encourage and reward the skills of these migrants, as well as the skills of people who are already here in this country. We have among us some of the best designers in the world. I would like to speak to some aspects of this legislation and to point out that there are two ways in which someone seeking to negotiate this process can proceed under the new bill. They can choose to either register or publish their design. If they register their design, that will allow them to establish a date at which the design was created. They will be able to enforce their exclusive rights, provided they have had the design examined and a certificate of examination has been issued. On the other hand, publication means that the applicant will not get exclusive rights but they will prevent other people, interlopers, from coming along and encompassing some kind of exclusive right over that design-coming in on their coat-tails and seeking to benefit out of it. That publication will mean that all people will be able to use that design without infringing it. We see that principle applied in scientific discovery. You have a collaborative process under which scientists publish their works, and people are able to benefit from them. This is a system that encourages a similar kind of scheme to apply within the designs sphere, and I certainly endorse that. I think that people who follow that process of publication will be also assisting their fellow Australian designers in those areas able to benefit. This is likely to be a popular route to follow in, for example, the textile industry and other areas where designs are short lived. Perhaps members might ponder for a moment that this design category is quite separate from the notion of a patent. We are not talking about the patents system. We are talking about a design system. These are not new inventions, they are new designs. Similarly, another category that exists is to do with trademarks. Each of those three areas has their own system of implementation. It is worthwhile and very appropriate that we are looking at the design phase at the moment, because it is notable that Australian design has really come of age in recent times. We have seen some incredible success stories. The very fact that we are now exporting these Monaros to the US highlights the fact that Australian designers, whether they be the ones who design the look of the entire car or the ones who design the look of the seats or any particular part of that vehicle, are really excelling at the moment. So to have an effective design system to protect the intellectual capacity that has gone into producing those products is very worthwhile. MAIN COMMITTEE One of the things that I would like to take up is the fact that the failure of the old system occurred because the courts would focus on individual differences between designs so that only a minor change to a registered design was sufficient for a court to find that there was not an infringement. I can recall a case that would highlight this. A while ago, during a Brisbane City Council election campaign, the incumbent administration was using the Brisbane City Council logo, which is probably a trademark, in their election material. As the existing administration, I think they felt they had the rights to that design or trademark. However, the opposition at the time, being a bit cheeky, decided ‘We can use this too. We will just have to make a little change here.’ The Brisbane City Council logo is a picture that looks like the town hall of Brisbane. It has a clock tower and a palm tree out the front. By just changing the number of the leaves on the palm tree and changing the hands on the clock, the opposition was successfully able to avoid any trademark or design infringement on that particular design. So, to the chagrin of the administration at the time, these opposition documents went out with what appeared to be the logo of the Brisbane City Council on them. People naturally took that to be the case and away that went across the system. That may or may not have been the design, but it illustrates exactly the point that is being taken up here. What courts will be asked to do under this new legislation is to consider the similarities between the designs, not those kinds of minor differences. They will be looking at the overall appearance, not the individual differences-like how many leaves are on that palm tree in that particular design. The issue will be what the overall impression is. The legislation asks that courts, or anyone looking at whether or not there is an infringement, examine whether there is substantial similarity in the overall impression that is created. We have to ask whether a person who would be the target audience looking at that particular thing would get that substantial similarity in the impression of the design that they were looking at. So you can see there one of the important changes that we are picking up on in this legislation. I thought that was a very good way of illustrating a good, solid improvement. If the target audience is being fooled into thinking that it is actually a particular design, you want the legislation to be able to pick that up. You want the design protection to be effective. You cannot have some kind of quibbling little change being made and then the situation of being able to opt out of the entire system. What we are looking at here is a real step forward. I would like to speak for a moment on the spare parts industry. What we are engaging in here, in providing this new legislation, is seeking a balance between what is in the private interest of the designer and what is in the public interest of the community. When it comes to the question of spare parts, an important consideration arises. Everyone knows that, if you set out to build yourself a new Mitsubishi Magna, a new Holden Commodore or a new Peugeot out of spare parts, you are going to be paying 10, 11 or 20 times more for that vehicle than its actual purchase price. The cost of spare parts is always significantly inflated when compared to the cost of buying those parts as part of a whole vehicle. It is important in our community to try to keep prices low and to ensure that the cost of spare parts does not blow out inordinately. By excluding spare parts in the way this legislation does, the government is concerned to ensure that there is effective competition in the spare parts market. We want to have lower prices for consumers. We do not want to have the design legislation being exploited in any MAIN COMMITTEE way that might overinflate the cost of spare parts and come at a real cost to the community. It is in the community’s interest to have those prices low and to have that kind of equipment available readily and at a reasonable price. If, for example, the design rules were to provide too much protection in this regard, you could wind up with some of the established manufacturers having undue market power. That is something that comes into the question of balance-that is, you want to ensure a low price and you want to protect the rights of those manufacturers but you do not want them having undue market power. It is important that people seeking to repair or restore complex products to their original appearance-whether it be repairing your car, your washing machine, your refrigerator or whatever-are able to do that in an effective manner and in a way that is not overly expensive. I am very pleased to see these changes. I think questions such as these should be reviewed again and again by governments. With the change in technologies not only in the area of design but also in trademarks and patents there are always steps being taken by people to get around legislation and to find ways of picking up on other people’s ideas that you might call sharp practice. Governments need to be aware of what is going on out there in the marketplace so that we are able to ensure that we are not overly facilitating the pirating of people’s ideas, to ensure that the balancing act continues, to ensure that the community interest is being protected and to ensure that the community’s opportunity to receive goods at a low and competitive price is being protected. It is important that constant reviews of these three areas go on. We need to look at what people are doing, at what competitors are doing and at what steps are being taken in each of those areas and ensure that the balance is maintained. This bill is long overdue-from 1906 to now is a long time to wait for change in design rules. We have achieved a very good outcome, and I commend the parliamentary secretary and the government for the work they have done on this issue. and Resources) (12.05 p.m.)-in reply-In summing up the second reading debate on the Designs Bill 2002, I would like to thank both of the honourable members who contributed to it. I was pleased to hear the member for Rankin state Labor’s commitment to support the bill as well as his comments relating to the Senate committee’s consideration of the controversial parts of the bill and its resolution that there was, in fact, an appropriate balance. My good friend and colleague the member for Blair noted the inherent common sense and fairness of the system that we are introducing. He also noted-and rightfully so-that Australia’s design capability is certainly world class and effective protection is given through this bill. He mentioned the timely nature of this bill because, as he said, the old system is quite old and it certainly is no longer working properly. I also noted his comments in relation to community interest in maintaining fair and reasonable pricing on our motor vehicle spare parts. It is, as he rightfully said, important that we prevent dominant manufacturers from being able to have market dominance in relation to pricing. I also note the honourable member’s urging for a process to have a more timely review in this area and I certainly concur with that. The reform of the designs legislation is one of the government’s initiatives to strengthen Australia’s intellectual property system under the Backing Australia’s Ability innovation action plan. The Australian Law Reform Commission reviewed the existing system, which has been in place since 1906, as the member for Blair rightfully said.

219,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourismlonger provides effective protection, design registration is too easy to obtain and infringement is too difficult to prove. This bill implements the new design registration system that will be simpler and faster and will provide more effective protection for Australia’s designers. Key features of the new system include a streamlined registration process, stricter eligibility and infringement tests, better enforcement and dispute resolution procedures, a maximum registration term of 10 years and clearer definitions. The streamlined registration process will allow for quick and simple registration of designs. The changes to the eligibility and infringement tests will mean that a valid design registration will be harder to obtain but, once obtained, will be easier to enforce. In drafting the bill, we have conducted an extensive and wide-ranging consultation process which has included consumers, industry and IP professionals. As a result of this extensive consultation, I am confident that users and designers will welcome this new system. It will be more cost-effective and responsive to their needs and it will better protect designers’ creations from copying. The new designs registration system will encourage innovation by striking the appropriate balance between public and private interests. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

223,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, TourismThat the House take note of the following paper: Resolving Deadlocks: A discussion paper on section 57 of the Australian Constitution the possible alteration to section 57 of the Australian Constitution that goes to the reform of the Senate. It may be a surprise to some in this place or elsewhere to know that the ALP had a policy of abolishing the second chamber-the upper house or Senate-from 1919 up until 1979. However, if one were to see why that came to be the case, that policy would be understandable. In the 1919 election the ALP got 42 per cent of the vote but only returned one member to the Senate. Conversely, the Nationalists got 45 per cent of the vote and returned 17 members to fill 17 of the 18 seats. So, just after World War I, in the first election held, there was clearly a malapportionment of votes, skewing the vote very unfavourably against those the nation wanted to see comprising the Senate. The consequent Labor suspicion of the Senate was deep seated, and it was something that was felt for some time by the Labor Party. However, it did wax and wane during that period. Indeed, throughout that time Labor senators and the Labor Party generally looked to reform the Senate to ensure that it properly and effectively achieved the purpose for which it was intended-the review of legislation. Of course, many people today who have suspicions about the Senate hold those views as a result of the events of 1975. I was a pupil in secondary school when the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed by the Governor General as a result of the supply bills being blocked by the Senate. As everyone who is a student of history would know, that blocking of supply was unprecedented-in the federal sphere at least-in Australia’s history, and it occurred as a result of the conservative parties breaking with convention when the state governments of Queensland and New South Wales filled Senate vacancies, filling them not with people from the political parties of those who had departed the Senate but with people of the other political persuasion. That led to the deadlocking and the obstruction and ultimately precipitated the fall of the Whitlam government in 1975. So of course many people throughout the country are suspicious about the way in which the Senate can operate when using its ultimate power. I do believe that, whilst that has fallen from the radar, it has certainly not entirely left the national psyche. It is also important to note that a former Liberal minister, Senator Fred Chaney, who was the opposition whip in 1975, wrote a few years ago: ... I saw at close quarters the ultimate exercise of Senate authority when it denied the Whitlam government supply. It did this on the basis of a fiddled blocking majority produced by the shenanigans of the state governments in New South Wales and Queensland. Nevertheless, this: ... did not deter the conservative forces of 1975 from the view that the Senate had a right, not only to amend government legislation, but to bring a government down. That is from the mouth of a former Liberal minister who, quite honestly after departing active parliamentary politics, explained the nature of the born-to-rule attitude of the conservatives at the time and their intention to do anything, improper or otherwise, to bring down a democratically elected government. MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Ministerial Statements
224,Mr Brendan O’connor (Burke) (12.13 P.m.),"I rise to contribute to the debate onThat has of course had a bearing upon these discussions, because those events are recent history. Not only did the obstruction of the budget bills, and finally the blocking of supply, precipitate the downfall of a Labor government elected by the people twice in three years, it also enabled the current Prime Minister to become a beneficiary of the downfall. As we know, on 13 December 1975 the then Fraser opposition won office. They held government until 1983. It should therefore be noted that the current Prime Minister was a major beneficiary of what was one of the greatest assaults on Australian democracy we know of, because he became a Treasurer in that government born out of undemocratic processes. He was a donothing Treasurer, as we know. He did nothing in that time, and we had to wait until 1983 before the macroeconomic changes required for this country were undertaken by the Hawke governments and, later, by the Keating governments. Whilst John Howard was a beneficiary for seven years, I do not think anyone remembers a thing that he did in those seven years as Treasurer in the Fraser government. I think it is important that we place all of that on the record in the context of this debate. There is no doubt that, because of the way in which the government’s party acted less than 30 years ago and the fact that the current Prime Minister was one of the major beneficiaries of the most undemocratic assault upon democracy, we are, understandably, somewhat suspicious of the Prime Minister now looking to change the nature of the Senate because he believes it is obstructionist. There is some irony in the Prime Minister arguing obstructionism when he was the beneficiary of the greatest obstruction of all by the Senate. Nonetheless, there are some significant proposals being put forward. I share the view of the Leader of the Opposition and others-including the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner-that there are opportunities to be had in this discussion. If the government are genuine about bringing about significant change then I think the Labor Party will certainly be willing to engage. If we can set aside the scepticism we may have about the Prime Minister’s intentions and assume for a moment-however difficult that is-that his intentions are honest and in good faith then I think we have to look seriously at those models that have been bandied about recently in public. As people would know, there have been three models broadly referred to. Whilst they have been referred to, they are rather blurred and the details are far from clear. I want to talk now about the three models proposed. Firstly, there is the Howard proposal, which is said to be based on the report of the joint committee on constitutional review. Under this model there would be a choice of methods: a double dissolution with the option of a joint sitting, which is what currently occurs; or a joint sitting only, where an absolute majority of the total parliament would be needed plus at least half the members and senators in at least half of the states. Interestingly, the second part of that second point-that is, that there would have to be at least half the members and senators in at least half of the states-was not included in the discussion paper Resolving deadlocks: a discussion paper on possible changes to section 57 of the Australian Constitution. This would seem to add an unnecessary complication, particularly as we now have the extra MPs and senators from the territories. If a joint sitting were available to a prime minister without an election, it would enable governments with a comfortable House majority to bypass the Senate whenever they chose. That is certainly my main concern with the Howard proposal. I think the Prime Minister has already walked away from his initial position, given the concerns raised, and I must say that he did so in good faith. MAIN COMMITTEE One of the reasons that the Prime Minister has equivocated on this matter is what has been called the Lavarch model. Michael Lavarch, the former Labor Attorney-General, had put together a model that is somewhat different. Under his model, the process would be: the rejection of a bill for a first time, the rejection of a bill for a second time, an election-a normal election not a double dissolution-followed by a joint sitting. What are the implications of this proposal? If this is the proposal-and I say that because there is some blurring of the details-then the holding of a House election with a half-Senate election, rather than a double dissolution election, would reduce the chances of minor parties making significant inroads into the Senate, as is likely at a double dissolution. However, others have argued that the Lavarch model includes fixed four-year terms and a vote on leftover legislation by a joint sitting as the first activity of a new parliament. I think they are the most critical points of the Lavarch model-that is, that there be an argument put forward on why there should be fixed four-year terms in the Senate and indeed that legislation that has been blocked twice would be heard only after a general election by a joint sitting as the first activity of the new parliament. I think there is certainly a lot of merit in what the former Labor Attorney-General says in relation to those proposals. There has been another proposal put-I think it was referred to as the Robb model-on the rejection of bills seeking to implement policy that was part of the election platform. Indeed, with this model, if bills were rejected again, the government could nominate such bills for a joint sitting, have a normal election and the joint sitting could be held only after the election. The implications of this model would be that there would be a major change. It would introduce a similar system or idea to one that occurs in Britain-the idea of an election manifesto that has a special status in parliament after an election. It could be argued that, whilst this is a significant shift from the current arrangements, it certainly would provide more transparency in parliamentary government relations and it would perhaps provide greater accountability to the electorate because it would set down those things that would be passed in the event that that political party formed government subsequent to a general election. There are a number of models out there. I am coming to the view-and I know it is shared by members of the Labor Party caucus-that there is a need for significant reform of the Senate. But it cannot be just fiddling around the edges; it has to be something that provides for proper reform. The introduction of fixed four-year terms would certainly be a preferable thing, as would ensuring that, if there were to be joint sittings, legislation that would be put to that joint sitting would have already had to have been rejected at least twice before the general election, pursuant to the Lavarch model. Against the backdrop of Senate history and how the Labor Party perceives the way in which the Senate has operated at its worse, I think there is a need to consider the removal from the Constitution of the right of the Senate to block supply. Every political party has amended or blocked budget bills. Only the Liberal and National party coalition have blocked supply in this country, precipitating the downfall of an elected government. That should never happen again-to any political party in government. It should never happen again in this country. It brings our democracy into disrepute. If we are going to have a fair dinkum debate on this-if the Prime Minister is not just playing games and has changed and reformed his views-we should embrace this debate and support those elements so that there can be genuine reform of the Senate. MAIN COMMITTEE importance regarding any proposal to amend section 57 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution. I refer to the Prime Minister’s published text on this issue, Resolving deadlocks: A discussion paper on section 57 of the Australian Constitution. In this text, the Prime Minister notes at page 5 that the Australian Constitution has served Australia well, but then notes that the Constitution is not immutable. The Prime Minister cites amendments to the proportional representational amendments of 1948 and 1949 and the fostering of development of minor parties as a trigger for his proposed amendments. The Prime Minister cites the 1983 increase in the number of senators and the half-Senate election procedure currently in place. The reason that the Prime Minister has introduced this debate is found at page 7 of his text, which says: The experience of the last century in which section 57 has been invoked only six times ... indicates that section 57 in its current form is not a workable means of resolving deadlocks. With respect, I believe that the Prime Minister has failed to grasp the fundamental purpose of section 57 of the Australian Constitution. What is that purpose? I refer to P.J. Hanks in his text Australian Constitutional Law Materials and Commentary, fourth edition, at chapter 3. Our present legislative process, when functioning normally, is called the standard legislative procedure. Hanks, at paragraph 3.019, notes that section 57 affords the legislature a variation to that standard legislative procedure. He states: ... s. 57 ... provides for the enactment of legislation despite the opposition of the Senate. Hanks further notes that the purpose of this provision was the insistence of the larger states of Victoria and New South Wales on not being in a minority in the Senate. Standard legal procedure may overcome such deadlocks in the following ways: (1) via alternative procedures, (2) via prescribed restrictive procedures, (3) via financial legislation-known as special procedures-and (4) via judicial review of legislative procedure. For reasons which I will identify, section 57 is a statutory remedy to overcome a deadlock. Section 57 is not therefore part of the problem but a provision which seeks to cure a deadlock once a problem has occurred. So where does the problem lie? I submit that the problem lies in the equality powers of the Senate in section 53. If the Prime Minister would come clean on the matter, he would admit that he wishes to emasculate the powers of the Senate by repealing the equality provisions of section 53, thus effectively eliminating the bicameral Commonwealth structure in favour of a unicameral legislature with the executive effectively ruling with impunity-one more step towards dictatorship and unaccountability. The Prime Minister’s insistence that the minor parties now dominate the Senate and block supply is in sharp hypocritical contrast with the fact that Labor policy discussion paper No. 14, entitled ‘Constitutional Reform and the Resolution of Parliamentary Deadlock’, notes: ... from 1972 to 1975, the Coalition-controlled Senate rejected a record 93LaborGovernment bills, 25 more than the total number of rejections in the first 71 years of the Senate’s history. The PM himself has form regarding a number of these rejections since 1974 because, as we know, that was the year he was elected to federal parliament-and we all know what happened in November 1975 and in the December 1975 election, when Prime Minister Fraser MAIN COMMITTEE",212,Ministerial Statements
225,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (12.28 P.m.),"I wish to raise a number of issues of fundamentalwas elected and Mr Howard subsequently went on to become the Treasurer of this nation. The Prime Minister should be aware of history; we understand that he is an aficionado in that area, but he is selective in ignoring his contribution to this particular problem. This is yet another ploy by the Prime Minister to obfuscate debate on the aggregate parliamentary process by recourse to amendment of section 57 alone without having a holistic review of the operation of that provision. In chapter 1 of his paper, to which I have referred, he suggests that the solution to the Senate blocking supply is via amendment to section 57. At page 11, the Prime Minister does note that it is, in fact, section 53 that gives the Senate equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws. Hanks notes: Section 57 of the Constitution provides a mechanism by which that obstruction can be circumventedalthough the complexity of that procedure is an indication of the reluctance with which the smaller colonies gave ground during the draft conventions. Perhaps the most sobering advice the Prime Minister can take on his apparent misunderstanding of the existence and purpose of section 57 is to found in the ratio decidendi of Stephen J. in Western Australia v. Commonwealth (1975) 134 CLR 201. It states: In prescribing condition for the exercise of the power which it confers, s. 57 directs attention to the legislative history of a measure, not with a view to its translation from Bill into a centred Act but rather to identify a situation of legislative deadlock which its machinery is designed to resolve. It looks, as a matter of record, to the history of that measure in the past; no rue as to the consequences of prorogation can alter that record as historical fact, and it is only with that fact that s. 57 is concerned. So, in short, if it is the intention of the Prime Minister to overcome legislative deadlock, the statutory remedy afforded under section 57 is not the way to go about it. Hanks notes that the: ... section 57 procedure has now been exploited only six times, although only once (in 1974) has it been pushed through to its final stages ... Therefore, I put to this committee that there is no respite to be found in amending section 57 if it is the intention to reduce or eliminate the power of the Senate to block supply. Rather, the Prime Minister is kicking the cat in approaching section 57, which affords one of the few statutory respites against the prevailing Senate powers. The solution, I am afraid to say, is more complex than a simple review of section 57. Nor will the elimination of Senate power to block supply solve the problem, for this will cause more destabilising influences in the current complex battle of powers between the bicameral structure and the complex power relationships between the legislature, executive and judicature. I therefore bring to the parliament’s attention the need for a comprehensive review of the legislative framework to be commenced and I fully endorse the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Simon Crean, who said in his statement on 8 October 2003 that a joint selection committee should be appointed. As I have noted repeatedly about the conduct of this 40th parliament, and the 38th and 39th, this government is fixated on a de minimus, quick fix and reductionist methodology. Like removing one card from the card house and the whole house will come down, amend section 57 alone or with a few amendments-and not consider carefully the constitutional impacts on the fundamental shifts and the separation of powers doctrine-and there will be more problems created than the Prime Minister’s references to the amendments of 1948, 1949 and 1983. The Prime Minister will go down in history as making the Constitution even more unworkable than the problem he claims needs fixing now. He will create more problems in the MAIN COMMITTEE operation of the Constitution than he will solve. Against this background, I support Simon Crean and his call for a joint select committee on this most vital issue. In terms of the Prime Minister’s opportunities to call an election when it suits him, it is also farcical that we are faced with the real prospect of a double dissolution because of the mounting legislation in the Senate as we speak. I do not think there are too many of us on this side of the House who do not believe we are looking down the barrel of a double dissolution election next year, particularly with very important areas such as the full privatisation of Telstra and the changes to our media laws through the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill to be debated. I understand this bill is coming back to the House of Representatives on Thursday. In my view, it is a very cynical attempt by the Prime Minister to curry favour with Australia’s two biggest media proprietors and for him to be re-elected for a fourth term. You can be sure that with the present composition of the Senate, that particular billand the full privatisation of Telstra-will have no chance of succeeding. Hence we are looking at the prospect of a double dissolution election. What does that say for democracy? On the one hand we know that the Prime Minister does not want to have a double dissolution election, because he realises the composition of the Senate will be even more hostile next year. He cannot call a double dissolution election after 12 August, because that would be less than six months before the anniversary of the first sitting day of this parliament. We can all reasonably expect that he will probably call a double dissolution election some time in the second half of next year and we are probably looking at an election some time around 18 September. It is absurd that we have this situation and that this is allowed under our Constitution. There is a need for reform, but not because the Prime Minister wants to take charge of when a federal election can be held. This is very cynical and people should be made aware of the real agenda. Conceivably we could have a normal general election as late as March or April 2005, but we do not know that. There is even the prospect that he could call a double dissolution election early next year. This might be the second last sitting week of this parliament. Who knows? It is all that uncertainty and the constant speculation about the timing of the election that makes it even more necessary to enshrine four-year parliamentary terms in our Constitution, through a referendum. It works very well in New South Wales. It saves the taxpayer a considerable amount of money and it gives the government of the day an opportunity to implement the policy platform they went to the election on. The current situation is that, once 18 months to two years has elapsed in the life of a parliament, there is constant speculation about when the next federal election is going to be held. That cannot be good for democracy. I want to state what I have said many times in the House about the seriousness of calling a double dissolution election-and what I believe could potentially be a most cynical double dissolution election, where the Prime Minister would expect editorial support from the major commercial media players in Australia by promising Mr Packer that he would get Fairfax and promising Mr Murdoch that he would get a television network. You have only got to understand the incredible amount of power and influence that the Packer and Murdoch families exercise over both sides of politics in this country to know that it is not in the public interest to allow such a situation. In the present environment and the ordinary cycle of general elecMAIN COMMITTEE tions, there is no way the Senate would allow the media ownership bill to get through the Senate and thrash our democracy, as is proposed by the Prime Minister. I would hope that the government has a really hard look at that bill. Amendments to the bill were moved in the Senate, particularly by Senator Harradine, which would have freed up the so-called constrictions on media proprietors. But because Senator Harradine made it quite plain in his amendment that it would not allow Mr Packer to buy Fairfax and Mr Murdoch to buy a television network, not surprisingly those amendments were defeated. I think that is shocking, because there is form on both sides of the parliament in relation to giving media proprietors what they want at the expense of the public interest and the future of our democracy. I think it is a most serious piece of legislation and something that must be defeated. Even if the Prime Minister does get his way and we do have a double dissolution election, I would hope that the Senate is hostile and that the numbers will be there in a joint sitting of parliament to defeat that bill. That legislation, more than any legislation before the House at the moment, has grave consequences for the public interest and the future of our democracy. I will not stop speaking out on that legislation. I have nothing personal against Mr Packer or Mr Murdoch in terms of their contributions to this country, but to allow media ownership to concentrate in Australia is a very serious matter. (Time expired) ter for allowing other members of parliament to debate these proposed changes to section 57 of the Constitution. I might also say that my colleague the member for Greenway was kind enough to relieve me in the House and thus afford me the opportunity to at least participate in this debate. I think it would have been unfortunate had I not been able to participate. Mr Deputy Speaker, both you and I served on a joint select committee looking at changes to the Constitution in relation to the head of state. Even though I think it is fair to say we may not have shared a common view, I think we both agreed that the process of getting out there and trying to access the views and concerns of the public was right. I would argue that insufficient attention was drawn to that in the propositions that were finally put to the people. But I certainly stand here as a member who is concerned about constitutional reform and parliamentary reform. Ordinarily I would not reflect on a contribution by the honourable member for Calare, for whom I have a great regard and with whom I often agree. However, it is wrong to suggest that the only people interested in parliamentary or constitutional reform are either Independents or minor party candidates. There are people of goodwill on both sides interested in improving this place. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, we have a more than adequate record of wanting to reform the place. I recall that, with support of all parties, we instituted the Main Committee in the last Labor government and it has since proved itself. Indeed, it is being followed elsewhere and it has certainly helped stop bills being guillotined. But as to these two options, I find it somewhat ironic that they are being proposed, because the Whitlam government was subjected to an extraordinary number of bills being rejected in its short three years of government. In fact, more bills got rejected in the Senate in those three years than the total number of bills rejected in the previous 71 years of our parliament. Between 1972 and 1975, the opposition rejected a record 93 government bills-25 more than the total rejected in the previous 71 years. During the period of John Howard’s government 1,269 bills have been passed by the Senate-with or without amendment-and only 25 bills have MAIN COMMITTEE",215,Ministerial Statements

What has happened in six-plus years of this government is a huge contrast to what happened in the three years of the Whitlam Labor government. But where does the opposition stand in relation to these proposals? Fundamentally the Labor Party’s position has been that governments should, by and large, be allowed to govern. The very nature of the Senate changed in 1949 when proportional representation-authored by Arthur Calwell-was introduced. That had the effect of changing the numbers in the Senate over time to the point now where it is quite unlikely-although it may happen-that any future government will get a majority in the Senate. The Labor Party principally is concerned with that issue. The Leader of the Opposition has said that we are willing to entertain these propositions subject to a fixed four-year term and the constitutional removal of the power to reject supply that the Senate has-but has exercised only once. A number of speakers in this debate have referred to supply. Ironically, now that the budget has been brought forward to May from August, there are no supply bills going forward later in the year. The issue is one of principle rather than one of reality because of the budget having been brought forward to May. The member for Lowe commented on New South Wales and the fixed four-year term. I, like a lot of people, was very sceptical about the introduction of a fixed four-year term in New South Wales, but I have to say my scepticism has been removed. I think it has worked very well. There will always be swings and roundabouts, as is the case with elections, but I do not see that either major party in New South Wales will move to change fixed four-year terms. In fact, we have fixed four-year terms for local government too. It is now well and truly entrenched as part of the furniture. I do not think there will be any change there. Victoria has also moved now for fixed four-year terms both for local government and the state house. In relation to proposals to have a fixed four-year term for the Senate, I have a slightly different view. You may remember-I think it was in 1987-that the constitutional reform put up by the Hawke government proposed a fixed four-year term. It also proposed some radical things like freedom of religion, and states being required to offer fair compensation for resumed land. These proposals were opposed by the Liberal Party, and the then member for Flinders, Peter Reith, made his reputation by and large by opposing them. However, I was always of the view that to get a fixed four-year term for the House, having an eight-year term for the Senate was a small price to pay. Lionel Bowen was the Attorney General at the time. At the time-you would recall this, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley-the upper house in New South Wales had 12-year terms, so it was nothing radical. I can live with the proposition of having general elections for all the members of the House of Representatives and half the Senate. I think you do get a sufficient refreshing of contemporary sentiment amongst the population to make it a viable proposition. We will not get any constitutional reform unless both major parties bite the bullet and support it. I must say that I am strongly in favour. We are increasingly becoming an anachronism in having a three-year term and, on average, going to the people every 2½ years. I have great difficulty with the first of the two proposals, which is that after a bill has been rejected twice by the Senate there should be a joint sitting. I much more favour option 2, which is that a bill must be rejected twice in one parliament and again in the subsequent parliament to provide a MAIN COMMITTEE joint sitting. This is a reasonable way around some of the existing problems. I would argue for the retention of the current provisions of double dissolutions. It may be the case that a government feels so strongly that it wants to take all of the Senate out by way of a double dissolution, although increasingly there are costs to pay in relation to that. The Prime Minister has not always had a view of the Senate as being, as he said recently, ‘a house of obstruction’. In fact, on previous occasions he has been very supportive of the powers of the Senate to delay and reject legislation. In fact, there is more in the Hansard about his views about the importance of the Senate as a house of review and the importance of being able to delay and amend and change legislation and indeed obstruct legislation than there is of his more current view. But we should try and put those sorts of things aside. We should look at what the challenge is for moving forward with the Constitution. I sincerely hope that the government will move forward. The Labor Party have insisted on a couple of things. I sincerely hope that they can be accommodated so that when we do move forward and take a proposition to the people we do it with both the major parties agreeing rather than disagreeing. To sum up, I welcome the opportunity to make a small contribution to this debate. I again thank the Prime Minister for allowing it. I must say that I am rather surprised at the small number of members who took the opportunity to speak, but maybe we are trying to do too much too quickly, particularly at this time of the year. ticular provision under section 57 of the Constitution. In the few minutes that I have, I want to put some comments on the public record. In my view, the Senate plays an extremely important role, and one which should not be diminished by the government of the day. We would then find that the government of the day would, when it suits them, find that the Senate is extremely beneficial to them and can work in their favour. However, it can go both ways. The reality is that, over the many years since Federation, the Senate has been a hindrance to some governments and has provided opportunities for others. The view that Prime Minister Howard and this government have is that, because they are currently frustrated by the non-passage of legislation through the Senate, they should reform, review and completely change the system of democracy that we have in this country. I do not believe that the community actually believe that. I think they understand it very clearly. They see it purely as the government being frustrated and trying to get its own way, beyond that for which the government was elected-the so-called mandate which John Howard talks about. Talking about a mandate, the Senate has a mandate. People did know what they were doing when they elected people to the Senate. They elected minor parties, Independents and a bevy of individuals separate to and quite distinct from those in the House of Representatives. When the community votes, they understand the important role that the Senate plays in terms of its charter as the house of review. There is no doubt that bad bills proposed by this government have been either amended or rejected by the Senate. There is no doubt about that; I do not argue about that for a moment. But I actually think that is a good thing. Not only does it keep a government honest but it also makes a government think about the legislation that it has before the parliament. Often, in their excitement, exuberance and enthusiasm to get things done, governments rush into the MAIN COMMITTEE",218,Ministerial Statements
227,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (12.55 P.m.),"It certainly is a privilege for me to speak on this parparliament legislation that is badly written and badly thought out and which has not had the full scope of debate and a sufficient amount of time out in the community to be fully appreciated. So it is important that members of parliament think very carefully and very long before they go down the path of so-called reform purely for their own political advantage at a particular point in time, which may not suit them in the future. We are talking about reform of the Constitution and, in particular, section 57. However, on the idea of four-year terms, I think the community is ready for four-year terms-there is no doubt about that-and we just heard the member for Chifley speak quite eloquently on the issue and, in particular, that people are also ready to have eight-year terms. We go to elections very often, and the average 2½-year term is a real detriment to a having a fully functioning government. It would not matter whether Labor or the Liberal coalition was in government, I think a four-year term would better suit the people of Australia. Voting less often would be a better thing. Not only is there a good financial argument for that, because it would be cheaper, but there is also a good democratic argument, because you should give a government-including this government-the full scope of four years or thereabouts to implement its agenda, whether or not we like that agenda. It would give people more opportunity to see what the government is about, what its mandate stands for and to make a fuller assessment come the next election. I think this would be a better outcome for everybody. On the issue of reform of the Senate, I think that reform is needed, and Labor supports reform, but I certainly do not support the sort of constitutional change on deadlock provisions that the government is proposing. I think it is a myopic view with very short-term advantages for a government which is frustrated because it has very bad legislation on the table. Unless it improves that legislation, that legislation will never pass the Senate, because that is the work of the Senate and the job that the Senate should do. Debate interrupted. Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m. MAIN COMMITTEE The following answers to questions were circulated: Employment and Workplace Relations: Spouse Travel Entitlements (Question No. 1811) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, upon notice, on 13 May 2003: (1) Since March 1996, under Remuneration Tribunal Guidelines, which departmental officers and/or public office-holders have had an entitlement for their spouses to travel, both domestically and internationally, and what conditions apply for approval of such travel. (2) What are the details of travel including destinations, reasons for travel and the itemised cost of travel undertaken by spouses of departmental and/or public office-holders in this period. (1) The Remuneration Tribunal has not issued any Guidelines on spouse travel. From July 2000 there were Tribunal Determinations that contained provisions relating to an entitlement to, or conditions for, spouse travel for office holders. However in relation to departmental officers the Tribunal has not had responsibility for determining remuneration or related matters for these officers, apart from Secretaries which were under Tribunal jurisdiction up to December 1999. Since 26 July 2000 a number of Tribunal determinations have contained a provision in relation to a spouse accompanying a public office holder at Commonwealth expense where it is certified to be demonstrably in the interest of the Commonwealth. The provision is currently contained in the Full-time Offices Determination 2003/11, the Specified Statutory Offices Determination 2003/06, the Part-time Offices Determination 2003/03, the Judicial and Related Offices Determination 2002/21, and the Principal Executive Offices Determination 1999/15. There have been long standing Tribunal provisions relating to domestic and overseas spouse travel provisions for members of parliament. The current entitlements and the conditions for approval, are set out in the Members of the Parliament Entitlements Determination 2003/14. Some of these provisions have changed since 1996, and the changes can be identified by reference to earlier determinations, in particular Determination Number 22 of 1995 (Members of Parliament – Travelling Allowance). Copies of Determinations made after 1997 are available on the Tribunal website www.remtribunal.gov.au. Earlier Determinations were included with the Tribunal Annual Reports published each year up to and including 1997. (2) A general list of spouse travel undertaken in conjunction with official travel by Australian Government departmental officers or public office holders is not maintained. The information sought is not readily available. The staff resources and costs involved to extract and collate the information would be excessive and cannot be justified. Information on parliamentarians travel expenditure is available in the report tabled every six months, entitled Parliamentarians’ Travel Paid by the Department of Finance and Administration which does include some information on spouse travel allowance claims.",220,Ministerial Statements

Services (Question No. 2478) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: Further to the answers to questions Nos 1620 to 1635 and 1637 (Hansard, 12 August 2003, page 18168) what are the Chief Executive Officers of the Minister’s departments and agencies doing to ensure that they do not retain the services of any barrister or solicitor who has previously been made bankrupt. The Department and portfolio agencies use their panel firms of solicitors to instruct barristers. Engagement of barristers is done in accordance with the Attorney-General’s Legal Services Directions on Engagement of Counsel. The Australian Government policy in relation to such matters, as set down by the Attorney-General, is intended to ensure that Departments and agencies do not engage counsel ‘who use insolvency as a means of avoiding tax’. The policy is not directed at preventing the briefing of all counsel who are, or have been, insolvent. The Department and portfolio agencies have now formalised arrangements with panel firms and the Office of Legal Services Coordination in the Attorney-General’s Department to ensure that no counsel will be engaged who has been identified as using insolvency as a means of avoiding tax.

The Office’s new Complaints Management System commenced operation on 1 July 2001 and is able to produce more detailed figures. 2 The staffing figures provided are for the number of people allocated to these functions for each of the six-month periods. The positions may not have been filled for the entirety of the period due to absences on leave, training or short term vacancies. 3 For the periods 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2002, the staff assigned to the audit function were also responsible for the Commissioner’s own motion investigations under subsection 40(2) of the Privacy Act. Justice System: Legal Representation (Question No. 2507) What proportion of matters involved an unrepresented party in the (a) High Court of Australia, (b) Federal Court of Australia, (c) Federal Magistrates Court, (d) Family Court of Australia, and (e) Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in (i) 2001-2002, and (ii) 2002-2003. (a) High Court of Australia The High Court advises that the proportion of matters in the High Court that involved an unrepresented party was 30% in 2001-2002 and 19% in 2002-2003. (b) Federal Court of Australia The Federal Court advises that the proportion of cases in the Federal Court that involved at least one party who was not represented at some stage in the proceeding was 41% in 2001-2002 and 37.7% in 2002-2003. (c) Family Court of Australia The Family Court advises that in the family law jurisdiction it is typical for parties to be represented at some stages of the proceedings but not at others and for this to vary from case to case, registry to registry and, it is believed, over time. Cases seldom involve parties who are either completely represented or completely unrepresented. A survey of court files conducted by the ALRC in the course of its review of the civil justice system (ALRC 89 Managing Justice: Review of the Federal Civil Justice System) found that 41% of matters surveyed involved at least one party who was unrepresented or partially represented during the course",231,Questions On Notice
