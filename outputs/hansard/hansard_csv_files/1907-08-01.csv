I understand he intends to take up a constitutional objection on the subject."" There is in the statement about as much truth and as much untruth as is usual in connection with the information supplied by this journal. The intention of the paragraph is obviously to place honourable memburs who sit on the Opposition corner benches in a false position by making it appear that we contemplate attacking the Government during the very regrettable absence of the Prime Minister, though it has been stated over and over again that that will not be done. . The facts of the case are these:. Yesterday^ in conversation with the Attorney-General, I informed him that it was my intention, and possibly that of other honourable members, to take a further opportunity, before tbe measure leaves this Chamber, to discuss the BountiesB ill from the general financial aspect. I thought it only fair that the Government should know that; but in future I shall be more careful about treating Ministers with such candour. Sir WILLIAM LYNE ment Whip told me last night that he had been communicated with by the honourable and learned member for Flinders, who intended, on the motion for the third reading of the BountiesB ill , to move an amendment which would have the effect of postponing the further consideration of .the measure until the Budget speech had been delivered. ' Mr W. H . IRVINE the honourable gentleman was absolutely misinformed. Sir WILLIAM LYNE the subject was afterwards made to me by the Attorney-General. I gave this information to a representative of the Age, and I think that I was justified in doing so, seeing that it came to me through the Government Whip, and one of my colleagues. Mr W. H . IRVINE , I do not doubt the accuracy of what the honourable gentleman says;, but I decline to take responsibility for the information which he received from his colleagues. I have told the 'House exactly what occurred. The paragraph which I have read conveys an entirely false, impression as to what took place.

CATTS -Has the attention of the Acting Prime Minister been called to the following paragraph, which appears in to-day's Arguspresident of the Chamber of Commerce, in his annual address to-night, suggested that the Northern Territory might be handed over to Great Britain, to be populated with blacks from India. Never in the world's history, he said, had a vigorous white population been reared in the tropics, and if the Northern Territory was to be kept for white men only it must be kept empty for ever. The danger of a black population was only real if that population was not under proper control, and the solution of the difficulty might be found if England resumed the government of. the Territory as provided when the grant was made to South Australia. I wish to know if the Government favours the introduction of Indians into Australia, and whether the British Government has the right to resume the Northern Territory ?

Of course I am not a step? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -It seems to me The circumstances to which I have referred that any statement made should be in conshow that the system then obtaining, and nexion with the policy of the Government still in vogue, is quite inadequate for the at the time of making the Budget speech. purposes of defending a great Empire like I move That, in order to effectively defend the Comwere not for the quarrels in which Great monwealth against possible enemies, it is imBritainmay embroil us, we need never fear perative that all able-bodied adult males should war, or make any preparations for our debe trained to the use of arms and instructed in fence.

When that day comes we shall have 1o depend-as we ought to depend nowupon ourselves alone. I do say that both those who look to the future of this country as a part of the British Empire, and those who, perhaps, have other aspirations, ought seriously to consider the necescan be delegated only with the very greatsity of putting our house in order. At present we live in a fool's paradise. We have a system of defence neither adequate nor effective in any! way. No doubt, individually, the units of this force are everyancient or modern times in which a thing that can be desired. I do not know whether they are now armed as they ought to be, but individually-as men I mean-the y are most excellent. But to defend a country possessing a coast line of 8,000 miles, a country committed to a policy certainly irritating to the last degree democracy is the last word in governmentto some nations, no longer to be despised or spoken of as barbarian, and outside_.the pale of civilized peoples, we must rely upon some much more effective means of defence. Some day, unless I am much mistaken, those nations will inevitably adopt other means of enforcing those desires already made known to us. No one, who is not deliberately blind, can fail to recognise the quite acute position now existing between the inhabitants of the western slope of the United States of America and those of Japan. Nothing but the fact that America possesses a population of 80,000,000, and that any attempt to crush such a country would demand the forces of a nation at least similarly numerous, does, I believe, cause Japan to hesitate to declare war. We have a population of 5,000,000, we are isolated from the rest of the world, and we have here a second rate, or third rate, naval detach-' ment, which, under the terms of the Naval Agreement, may, at any moment, be withdrawn. obvious necessity of having a first line of defence. Honourable members will see, by perusing the terms of my motion, that I do not propose to confine universal training to military purposesI desire it to extend to all purposes, both military and naval. And when I speak of universal training, I wish to emphasize the fact that it is a system of universal training, and not of universal service, which I am advocating. It is particularly a system of universal training for home defence-for home defence only. We are not now-and I hope that we never shall be-a n aggressive nation. We desire nothing more than to be left in peace. But to secure peace it is necessary, I think, to be prepared in some measure for war. It does certainly seem that it is necessary to set forth this fundamental fact: that it is the primary and sacred duty of every citizen to defend his country. Because it is a primary and sacred duty, it ought not to be delegated. It is a personal duty which est amount of risk. I have said beforeand I say now-that I defy any honourable member, or any citizen in the Commonwealth, to cite one case in country ever maintained its national independence, and the freedom of its demo-. cratic institutions, when once it handed over the business of its defence to a mercenary or professional soldiery. There are some democrats who seem to imagine that that it is the natural and inevitable result of evolution, proceeding from the least to the most effective method. But instead of that being so, democracy is most unnatural -usin g the word to connote the uncommon. It is a pyramid, so to speak, which is no longer on its base, but upon its apex. Government has, wherever free to do so, always tended to pass into the hands of those persons who possessed the most determined character, and who had, perhaps, the most force behind them. Primitive government is government by one man, and we can only maintain the equilibrium of the pyramid upon its apex by the most jealous care and ceaseless vigilance. The French revolution showed that conclusively. In France the most perfect System of democracy existed, but it merely paved the way to a military despotism. Rome had a most perfect system of democracy, and yet fell a ripe plum into the hands of Caesar. The Grecian States were not less fortunate. I wish to say nothing about the None of them were able to stand against the Macedonians who were governed by a king. The Athenians, whilst under an oligarchy, occupied a position very superior as a fighting nation to! that which they occupied under a pure democracy. As we have gone so far in establishing an order of things in which every man and woman has an equal right to all the privileges and. benefits conferred upon any person in the country, we must at least do something either school can consistently object to. the towards fitting, ourselves to maintain this proposal .merely because it is compulsory happy but unusual state of affairs. in its nature.

24,Mr Hughes,"The great point isquires that every.child in this State shall be vaccinated. Although a man may be perfectly convinced that, for the best of reasons, his child ought not to be vaccinated, the law requires that it shall be. It appears to me, therefore, that to urge that a proposal involves compulsion is not to say anything against the proposal itself. The arguments of those who oppose it must be directed against the principle. The question of whether it is bad or good must be considered as well as that of whether there is any other method by which these ends may be served, quite apart from the principle of compulsion, which may be necessary to give effect to it. The principle of compulsion in itself is odious and intolerable. No man ought to be compelled to do anything unless it is for the benefit of the community, or himself or his family. But when once it has been determined that something is essential to the well-being of the community, civilization never hesitates to apply compulsion in order to secure it. It must be generally admitted that it is necessary to defend one's country; and it is equally clear that the present system does not provide an adequate system of defence. With the forces at present at our disposal, we cannot view with equanimity the possibilityof an invasion of a serious character. No man can say that /with these forces we could defend ourselves from such an invasion. The present system then stands condemned, and not an .unnecessary hour should elapse before we replace it with an effective one. There are three, if not more, alternatives by which we may secure an effective defence force. One of these is to create a sufficiently large standing army to meet all probable contingencies. There are at least two reasons why we cannot do this. In the first place, it would be an enormously expensive undertaking. A regular army capable of ccy -ing with all probable and possible invasions would involve an expenditure which the Commonwealth is not in a position to meet. In addition to that it would mean the creation of a military caste most undesirable in this country. It would be impossible to have a sufficiently strong standing army without withdrawing from production the very flower of the nation, and by keeping them engaged in an unproductive avenue we should lose the product of their labour and at the same time create amongst'these men a desire for war. A professional soldier sees nothing in peace. He wants war. War offers him an opportunity for advancement and distinction, and sometimes for profit. The professional soldier is always for war; he hopes to gain preferment by it. The maintenance of a large standing army stimulates too that spirit of jingoism, which at times is already too noticeable. Lastly, such a proposal is impossible, because it would be a dangerous menace to democracy. The people of this country for thai, if for no other reason, would never. agree to an augmentation of the regular forces sufficient to cope with any emergency. Then we have the volunteer system. From the mouths of many excellent men, both in this country and in others, a continuous flow of eulogy of the volunteer system comes from time to time. Such a system is an excellent one. It is true that one volunteer is often worth two-per haps ten-presse d men, but he is certainly not worth fifty, and sometimes he is not worth two. As a matter of fact, the volunteers offering are quite insufficient in numbers to do what is necessary. In England they have been steadily diminishing. Notwithstanding the fact that during, the Boer war the patriotism and the courage of the English were inflamed to fever heat, the war strengths of the volunteer regiments were never made up. Only 19,000 volunteers were accepted for active service in that war. Some of those who offered their services were physically unfit for duty, the majority did not volunteer. The whole of the volunteer forces are very much depleted, and recruiting is becoming more difficult. In spite of these facts one can understand how it is that the volunteer system is so popular, since it affords to those who do no't volunteer some excuse for their failure to do their duly. It is from the mouths of such men that we hear the greatest eulogy of the system. The volunteer who deliberately determines to give his time to his country-wh o spends every Saturday afternoon in fitting himself by drill and rifle practice to defend his country-is regarded as little less than a fool by those who go to football matches or spend their Saturday afternoons in other ways. But when the time comes to oppose a proposal for universal training, these unpatriotic or short-sighted citizens one and all declare themselves very much in favour of that system, because by it alone are they able to evade their plain and obvious duty. The third alternative, and to any mind the -most effective, is that which I advocate. Under it every adult male would have an we insist as a natural corollary that every opportunity to be trained to defend his man shall be educated; to permit the concountry... Honourable members have restituency, which has the full power of the cently had an opportunity of reading some franchise, to be ignorant and unlettered, very excellent articles by Colonel Reay would be to invite disaster, and we who on the Swiss system.

There is hardly a German Socialist in Parliament or outside it who is not agitating for the abolition of the existing system in Germany and the substitution of the Swiss system; for they realize that there is all the difference in the world between the two. The German system takes a man away from civil life for two or three years, and makes a professional soldier of him. long enough to unfit many a man for peaceful .and industrial pursuits. the: period of training is, practically speaking, a holiday of six weeks, at the end of which a man returns. to civil life, physically and morally, benefited, and better able, by reason of improved health and strength and self-control, to compete in the industrial world. system of a nation of peace, and the other the system of a nation of war. country, judging by the policy of its rulers, has that system which best suits it. The army in Switzerland, is not a dear one. To maintain this army of altogether some 500,000 men-^-or without counting the Landsturm-of some 250,000 men, there is involved an expenditure of ,£1,500,000, inclusive of the amount contributed by those who are exempt.

The scheme which I outlined on a previous occasion is this: The Act passed to bring about the proposed change should apply only to those who, at the time of its passing, are under the age of twenty-one years. Every youth on reaching the age of eighteen years should, if physically fit, be liable to undergo within the year forty days continuous training, and twenty-one detached drills, to perfect him in rifle shooting, discipline, and drill. This training should continue, with such modifications as particular cases might call for, until he reached the age of twenty-one years. Once a man is lit . for service, it will be unnecessary to subject him to any red-tape system requiring attendance at drill for long periods, all that would be necessary being to keep him efficient. creation of a body of men sufficiently numerous and expert in the art of warfare to be able to defend their country. ing might easily be given without unduly interfering with civil occupations. It would, for instance, be easy to arrange that in those parts of the country where the ordinary avocations of shearing, harvesting, and the like leave slack times during which there is not a great demand upon those who follow them, the training should take place during such intervals of comparative leisure. A man having reached the age of twenty-one years, and having attained efficiency., seven days of continuous training a year would be sufficient to keep him efficient. The time so spent would be an enjoyable holiday, beneficial alike, to the men and to their fellow citizens The system I advocate is neither more nor less than the revival of the ancient and salutary legislation that made the name of England respected throughout the known world; I ' refer to that which compelled English yeomen to submit themselves to military training, and to make themselves efficient in the use of the bow. When this training in marksmanship was compulsory the bowmen of England were able to hold their own against the best armies of the Continent. Unfortunately we have now got into a way which, though easy and pleasant, is dangerous. We entrust the defence of our country to a mercenary army and, as a democrat, I fear (hat this will prove the beginning of the end unless we recognise our national and political danger Mr Hughes. and prepare to undertake the duty of fitting ourselves for the defence of tlie country. This service is essential to the maintenance of our free institutions, and indeed, to our national 'existence. In this morning's newspaper it is reported that a petition, signed by a number of excellent Melbourne gentlemen, has been presented to the Hague Convention. They eulogize the efforts of the Convention to promote universal peace. That the world should lay down its arms is a consummation to be devoutly wished. Singularly enough, many of those who signed the petition, and are desirous that, in the interests of international peace, international quarrels should be submitted to a tribunal of arbitration, bitterly opposed the erection of Arbitration Courts to settle industrial disputes in their own land. We shall be very old men if we live to see the day when the world will What is desired is the lay down its arms. A great deal has been spoken lately about the rights of private property in war time. An endeavour is being made to introduce into warfare the Therefore, subsequent trainamenities which are proper in times of peace. But war is a brutal and bloody game, which cannot be conducted on an afternoon-tea-party basis. Because it is so serious, we should be prepared for it. A declaration of war should affect every member of the community; it should not concern only the paid soldiery, who, between periods of national tribulation, are despised and scorned. War is a business which should be brought home to every member of the community. Jingoism will die a natural death under the systenj I advocate. Those who pursue peaceful arts suffer loss in war time; but soldiers hope to gain promotion through active service. Now, our citizens throw up their hats and cheer when war is announced, because they hope it will not affect them ultimately, while the accounts of victories and defeats make the reading of their daily newspaper more interesting. If they themselves had to go and fight, their sensations would be different. Those who will not defend their country should have no voice in its government. They should not be regarded as citizens, they should not even be denizens, or, at most, only pariahs and outcasts. In olden clays, every citizen of Rome was willing and anxious to defend his country. So it is' in Switzerland to-day. We, too, in spirit are ready to do this; but we are not prepared to undergo the training necessary to make us capable of doing it. Strangely enough, those who cry for peace are generally most pugnacious in disposition. They will have peace even if they have to k ill off half the population of the world to get it. man as a reason why, as a nation, we should not take precautions against injuries which are regarded as necessary in connection with our private affairs. If a man breaks into my house, I have him arrested, or, if he is a small man, look after him myself. It matters not to me whether he is an Englishman, an Irishman, or an Australian, a brother or a foreigner. protect myself against him. those who are always crying "" peace, peace,"" call the police to their aid if assaulted. It is useless to cry ""peace"" when there is no peace. We should be prepared for the serious contingency of warfare, which will inevitably overtaike us sooner or later. Our population is less than 5,000,000, and we propose to maintain the policy of excluding coloured persons from the country, although Australia is within a few days' steaming distance of countries inhabited by nearly 1,000,000,000 of coloured people. We can maintain this policy only by preparing to defend ourselves by an armed force. There are one or two other points upon which I wish to touch briefly. will not, I think, involve very great expenditure, though it will cost more than our present system of defence. But whatever it costs, it must be adopted, or some equally effective alternative chosen. To go on as we are going will be impossible once our citizens become alive to their in terests and the dangers which confront us. It is merely my business to bring forward this scheme, and to ask the Minister of Defence to make the necessary inquiries in respect to its details. I have pointed out the dangers which we have to fear, and I believe that there is no effective alternative to my proposal. There is in Switzerland, and we have here, a cadet force which can be made a stepping-stone to adult training. The preparatory training of school boys between the ages of ten and fifteen will do much to fit them for the further training which they should be required to undergo at the age of eighteen. During that interval something might be done with a quasi-compulsory systemI mean a system under which some reward or some encouragement should be given to those who did submit themselves to it [44] inducing them to continue to do so. Then when a lad reached the period at which he would be liable for training, instead of having to serve forty days for three years, They speak of the brotherhood of he would probably become so proficient during the first year that he would not be required to give up more than one quarter of the prescribed time in any subsequent year. The effect, too, of this training upon the physical health of the nation can hardly be exaggerated. Both here and in Great Britain-perhap s in Great Britainparticularly-ther e is a very great and obvious degeneration in the If he' tries to rob me, I physique of the people. Perhaps it is due Similarly, to the chaotic industrial system which prevails in both countries. But I am very sure that the physical training which men would get under the system which I have outlined would be' immensely beneficial to them-that it would re-act upon^the moral and mental sides of their nature, that it would make them better men, more effective citizens, more capable industrial units, better able to compete with foreign nations, and more alive to the duties of citizenship in which perhaps more than any other people, they f a l l short of perfection. I have heard a good deal of criticism in regard to the number of persons who record their votes at our elections. Their apathy in this respect can only result from a complete inability to The system I advocate appreciate the very great privileges of citizenship. These privileges are not sufficiently valued because they cost nothing. The duties of citizenship are entirely disregarded because of that fact. Every privilege ought to carry with it a correlative duty. The system which I have advocated would have a marked effect upon the morale, the phvsiaue, and the tone of the nation, and, I am satisfied, would do a great deal for us nationallv and industrially. quite sure that honourable members will desire an opportunity to peruse in Hansard the remarks of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, and therefore I move That the debate be now adjourned.

55,Mr Wilson,"Thos e parties I prebers appear desirous of showing that these small establishments are tinning fish in Queensland to-day. If that be so, they are not doing it from philanthropic motives. do professional work from philanthropic motives ? not very philanthropic just now. to prevent a wasteful expenditure of the taxpayers' money. I take it that in the few cases in which fish are being tinned in Queensland, the work is in the hands of small companies. The industry is more or less a commercial success. Exactly similar operations are being conducted at Port Fairy and Warmambool. The honourable member for Wannon will perhaps know that it was the experience of the factory established at Port Fairy that it was useless to undertake the canning of fish unless a better class of fish were forthcoming. At that port and at Warmambool a large quantity of barracouta were tinned. But it was impossible to induce people to purchase these fish. I believe that the largest portion of the trade done by these factories was with the interior of Queensland and Western Australia. ing inferior fish to Queensland when we have good fish there? pity that residents of the southern portion of the Continent are not afforded an opportunity of tasting them. sistance of the honourable member and we will see that the people in the southern parts of the Continent are supplied with them. wishes to squander the public money until the proposed bounty is exhausted, and then allow the industry to go the wall. Honourable members will recognise that, since we have canning factories in our electorates, it would be to the interest of the honourable member for Wannon and myself to support the granting of this bounty. I am satisfied, however, that although this might temporarily revive the industry, these factories would close down again as soon as the bounty closed. Barracouta, trumpeter, and other fish are to be found along the southern coast, and we have heard to-day [44]2 that other fish suitable for canning are also plentiful on the Queensland coast. The people, however, prefer the imported tinned fish. Much has been said as to the . very large importations of fish, and if honourable members .had an opportunity of analyzing these importations, they would discover that they consist largely of fish that are not to be found in Australian waters. For the most part they comprise salmon, herrings, sardines, and bloaters, and, unfortunately, we have in Australian waters nothing to compare with them. It would be better for us to make an effort to stock our waters with fish suitable for canning than to spend money in this way. Mr Dannevig, the New South Wales fisheries expert, recently stated that Port Phillip, among other Australian bays, was eminently suitable for the establishment of hatcheries, with a view to the stocking of our waters with flounders, turbot, sole and other fish of that description. Such fish, however, .are not suitable for canning. Fish of the sardine and salmon type are most largely treated in that way. Having regard to the varieties of fish at present in our waters, there is no justification for this proposal. we have in Australian waters. knows that from time to time efforts have been made in Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania, and, I believe, to some extent in South Australia, to add to the varieties of fish to be found along our coasts, and that many attempts have been made by deep-sea fishing to discover new varieties. Many years ago a trawler was sent out to Victoria to fish in Bass Strait for new varieties, but the efforts of the crew were unsuccessful. When, as the result of creating hatcheries for stocking Australian waters with fish suitable for canning, we had secured a ' good supply of such fish along our coast, we might well be asked to grant bounties for the encouragement of the industry of fish canning, but I do not think the time is yet ripe for this proposal. I therefore move That the item be left out. speaking to the motion for the second reading of this Bill, I pointed out that fish canning had been undertaken in Queensland with a certain degree of success.

81,Mr Johnson (Lang) [4.20],"Myin some other direction than that of canning; at any rate, there is nothing in the report to justify this item, for if you must first catch your hare before you can cook it, you must also first catch your fish, and the right kind of fish, too, before you can can it. other honourable members, I cannot find in the report any satisfying information. For instance, we are told a good deal about the advantages of deep-sea fishing; but all the deep-sea fishing that I know on the coasts of Australia, with the exception of that for mullet, and, sometimes, barracouta, is line-fishing. for canning purposes would never pay. The position clearly proves that before we start' to make arrangements for a canning industry, we ought to be quite sure we have the fish to can. I suggest to the Minister the advisability of granting this bounty, if he must grant it, in an indirect way. if he so desires, add this money to the £ 8 , 0 0 0 already provided on the Estimates for trawling operations. By that means, the fishing grounds of Australia could be explored, and honourable members would be provided with sufficient data to enable them to intelligently deal with the subject. We are asked to provide no less than £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 . a year for a considerable period; and I ask whether we ought to do so without further data than that before us ? I do not think that we can be so false to our trust as to do anything of the kind. 'Surely it is getting more than a joke when we can pass appropriations of the public funds for hare-brained schemes of this character. My constituency borders the sea, and contains a number of fishermen, who, I feel sure, would be the first to ridicule a proposal to can the fish caught in the seas about Port Jackson-expensiv e fish caught by deep-line fishing. These fishermen would be the first to realize, the absurdity of any project of the kind, and, as taxpayers, they would resent the encroachment on the public purse. The Attorney-General should have told us why it is necessary to provide so large an amount. This item is the largest in the list; and., appropriately enough, it is the item about which there is least' information. Do we always pass these measures by contraries? Are we to pass this large amount simply because it is unexplained ? The Committee must be forgetting its duty to the public of Australia, as the trustees of the public purse, if we pass a large annual payment of this character without further information thai* that before us. There are two or three points which honourable members have not noted in reference to the industry of canning fish. We were told by the honourable member for Capricornia that this item, if passed, would be of great benefit to fishermen, and would create a class of longshore men on the northern coast of Australia. If that were the result, it would be of great service; but, according, to clause 3, sub-clause 2, it is prpvided Surely line-fishing that the manufacturer shall be deemed to be the producer, and the-bounty shall be paid to the manufacturer only. It will be seen, therefore, that this £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 for five years', will not go to the' fishermen, but to the manufacturers. In the case of the' Warmambool factory, the bounty would go to the manufacturer, and so at Let the Attorney-General, Port Fairy, while in the case of the Portland factory, the money would go to an. English firm who carry on the business. We know that fishermen all over Australia are, unfortunately, a very poor and deserving class; and they should be encouraged in every way. When they docatch any fish, they can always get a market. instances in which the fishermen get large hauls of barracouta, which have to be thrown away; but if the honourable member for Gippsland had his choice betweencanned barracouta and canned salmon, which would he take? We do not desire by means of this Bill to give bounties to industries which have proved admitted failures in the paSt. Let us first proceed with our trawling operations, and develop the fish industry, so as to create better classes of fish. When we have done that, and our waters are teeming with fish, as are the waters of other countries, it w ill be time enough to talk of a bounty for canning. By that time, however, there will be any amount of capital forthcoming to start the industry. ney-General) [4.30] I ask the Committee to reject the amendment. With all due respect to the opinions which have beenexpressed, I say that the fish preserving industry is deserving of all the encouragement that we can give to it.

The -matter was discussed at the last Conference of Premiers. We are intrusted with matters appertaining to defence, and, therefore, the Government take the view that we should encourage an occupation which will create a hardy 'body of men whose services would be of the greatest value in time of national trouble. For defence reasons alone we think it highly desirable to encourage the fishing industry. I believe in the Lytton district, in Queensland, the fishermen have proved themselves splendidly fitted for naval defence, while at Queenscliff, in Victoria, fishermen are enrolled in the Defence Force. Australia will have to look more and more to her coastal defence, and we must do what we can to encourage the creation of a body of fishermen who will best serve us in time of need. ported preserved fish in tins to a value of ^310,656. rings, and salmon. are not mentioned in the official return.

Those figures show that in Australia there is a large demand for fish, and, as honourable members will recollect, during the drought the possibility action of a combine. In Melbourne tons of obtaining a cheap fish supply for our poorer classes became a matter of serious moment.

The Government is acting upon the advice of -nevig is not only one of the best fish experts in Australia, but has also a European reputation, and I am glad that our consultations in regard to the trawler have given us an opportunity to appreciate his capacity. He informed me, in a conversation which I had with him relative to the preparation of this item, that he believes that the trawler will discover large sources -of fish supply, the existence of which has been indicated by the researches which have already been made. The Government desires to encourage the people of the Commonwealth to take advantage of those resources. Ministers hope that the result of the bounty will be that large numbers of men will engage in deep sea fishing, and that considerable employment will be given in connection with the canning of fish. The President of the New South Wales Fisheries Commission statesWith regard to seine fishery, the sea mullet, the pilchard, the herring, mackerel, and garfish abound in countless millions. The question of the supply of fish available for the industry is not open to dispute. Mr Dannevig concurs in that statement. As regards Queensland, Mr Saville Kent, who is admittedly a man of high attainments, has made this reportQueensland possesses a fish fauna remarkable both for the abundance of its species and for the structural variety of its constituents. All told, In 1906, the Commonwealth imthe number of combined marine and fresh-water species authoritatively recorded up to date falls but little short of goo. In other words, it embraces two-thirds of the entire marine and freshwater fish fauna of the Australian Continent. Out of the foregoing total number, over 300 species may be classified as of more or less value for human food. They present almost unlimited possibilities of profitable employment. The waters abound with shoals of fish akin to the European mackerel, herring, anchovy, and pilchard, which up to the present date have been literally allowed to run to waste. poor people cannot afford to buy fish. can be said to be the food of the poorer classes in Australia. of fresh fish are sometimes destroyed. 1 Mr .GROOM -That is an unfortunate The fish supply of South occurrence, but we hope, by increasing competition, and opening up new sources of supply, to make fish more generally available to our people. The honourable The Commonwealth arrangements member for Corangamite doubts whether we possess large supplies of fish, but the statements which I have read shouldconvince him that there are immense stores of useful fish in Australian waters. According to the reportOn the coasts of Tasmania and Victoria, such, fish as trumpeter, trevally, barracouta, kingfish, rock cod, flounder, and many others are caught in abundance, and owing to the absence of fish curing establishments, large quantities are at times wasted, or are merely utilized as manure.

That impresses one as a very fine phrase when it is heard for the first time. But the Attorney-General has used it in connection with every item with which we have dealt-and there are eighteen of them. He further stated that' the effect of the bounty would be the production of a number of hardy men who would man our navy in the hour of danger. that the naval policy of the Government is represented by a proposal to grant a bounty Great efforts are. made . in upon tinned fish.. According to theAttorney-General that is the only way ire which we can secure a trustworthy navafi ""force in time of national emergency.

The Attorney-General went further, and touched upon the commercial' aspect of this proposal. Apparently he thought that if he could show that millions of pounds could be made out of the canned? fish industry I would support this proposal. But I would remind him that the fishmongers of the old world are one of thewealthiest corporations in Great Britain, and if the prospects of the industry had? been in any way alluring they would have embarked upon it long ago. The honourable member for Fawkner has in France, 147,000; in Italy, been looking after well-earned interest in the fishing industry, but, so far, has failed to find it. The Attorney-General went a little further, and quoted the views of certain experts upon piscatorial matters, including those of Mr Farnell, the Chairman of the Fisheries Commission of New South Wales. That gentleman is an enthusiastic fisherman. While serving in theNew South Wales Parliament some years ago, he visited Great Britain for the express; purpose of floating a company to exploit Australian waters for the canning of fish. He endeavoured to induce the fishmongers of Great Britain to invest their money here, but without success. Then at his own expense he conducted trawling experimentsoutside Sydney Heads, and for a couple of"" hundred miles upon either side of it, but the results were .very unsatisfactory. The Government have not yet even called for tenders for the construction of the proposed' trawler for the Commonwealth service. Mort's Dock. trawler is constructed does not interest me.

109,Mr Joseph Cook,"I agree with allmeans of increasing the facilities for the supply of fresh fish to the people would be devised, I, for one, would vote for it without the slightest compunction. But this proposal will not do anything in that direction. Some bounties for the disposal of our surplus fruits, the manufacture of our cotton, and the distribution, upon a profitable basis, of other products of that kind, have been provided. There is some reason for the application of a bounty to such purposes in a Bounties Bill, but although we are told by the experts that there is a dearth of fish to meet the necessities of our own people, we have before us a proposal to grant a bounty on fish, canned, and preserved, so that they may be sent to other countries. This is not the way in which to expend a large sum of money. Then why has the canning of fish been singled out for so large a bounty ? I think that the appropriation to be made in connection with this item is the largest provided for in the schedule. We are asked to devote £50,000 to the payment of bounties to encourage the canning of fish, and yet the great trouble in Australia is that 1 we cannot obtain the necessary supplies for canning purposes. We have already voted a sum of £8,000 for the purchase of a deep-sea trawler. agreed to nearly twelve months ago, and the proposal is a very proper one. I should like to know, however, what has. been done in connection with the experiment. It seems to me that we are as near to the obtaining of a trawler as we were when we agreed to the vote. Had there been the slightest disposition to embark upon this profitable field of enterprise, the trawler would have been .in operation before to-day, and a goodly portion of our coast-line would already have been explored. Having regard to our engineering works, it should not be difficult to secure a trawler worth £8,000. Minister and others are constantly telling us of the dearth of employment in the engineering trade, and yet notwithstanding all the facilities for ship-building in Australia, no attempt appears to have been made to proceed with the construction) of a -trawler, authorized practically twelve months ago. This indicates a want of enterprise on the part of the Government in respect of an industry which they profess so strong a desire to encourage. There is a great deal in the report of the experts as to the value of fresh fish as a food, and as to its commercial value in various countries, but there is only an incidental referMr Josefh Cook. ence to the canning industry. Any one reading the report would come to the conclusion that the problem that confronts usin this connection relates, not to the preservation! of surplus fish supplies, but to theobtaining of the fresh fish necessary as a food for the people of Australia. We need! to take action very speedily in this direction. In some of the suburbs of Sydney, planted directly on the sea-shore, fish today are as dear as they are 100 miles from where they are caught. There is something wrong about such a condition of affairs. Those who know anything of the suburbs of Sydney will confirm my statement in this regard. I believe that fresh fish are not cheap to-day in any part of Australia, and the fishermen are not toowell paid. If fish is to be pressed intothe service of the people as an article of"" diet in the way that it is used in other countries, the processes of distributing it will have to be cheapened very materially.. To vote £50,000 for the canning and preserving of fish in these circumstances would be to agree to an absolute waste of public money. It would be an expenditure justifiable from no point of view. I cannot imagine what has prompted That expenditure was the Government to rush to the assistance of this industry in the way proposed. In my judgment, we can never succeed unless we start at the beginning, and, instead of proposing a bounty in connection with the treatment of the surplus of an industry, endeavour to stimulate the fisheries themselves.. Our first requirement is a supply of freshfish. We may very well leave the canning and tinning of fish until we have an abundance of surplus to treat in that way. ' This shows what an ill-digested mass of proposals we have before us. I hope that the item will be struck out, and that the Committee will agree inThe this way to save an expenditure of £50,000 of the money of the people. If the Government mean to spend this money in an effort to make fish more available to the people, surely they can devise a simple scheme to stimulate the distribution of the fish. We are told in the report that in Canada there are 73,000 personsengaged in fisheries. We cannot hope to succeed to the same extent, since we have not at hand such markets as they have. Thefishermen of Canada have the great British market as well as those of the United. States and the Continent of Europe to exploit. We can never hope to compete with them so far as fresh, or even canned, fish are concerned. That being so, the figures but if my capital were sufficient, I could in the report are misleading, in"" so far as hold out, and perhaps ultimately create a they are made to apply to Australia.

The report goes on to say that these fish are caught in abundance, and that owing to the absence of canning establishments, large quantities are wasted. It is because of the presence of enormous quantities of barracouta on our coasts that I shall ask the Committee to accept the amendment I have, foreshadowed. Occasionally there is a large glut on the Victorian market, and at Queenscliffe, Geelong, and Port Fairy thousands of barracouta have to be thrown into the sea simply because it does not pay to send them to Melbourne. Fishermen have from time to time endeavoured to carry on smoking operations, and they would meet with much success if it were not that they cannot afford the initial capital. I hope that the Attorney-General will not tell me that my amendment would only lead to the creation of numerous small industries, because one of my main reasons for submitting it is that it will encourage the establishment of a large number, of small co-operative smoked-fish factories in the smaller fishing towns. If that be not the result of this bounty, then -the money will simply go into the pockets of one large' manufacturing firm, and the fishermen will reap no benefit. It is small industries that have made Switzerland the prosperous country it is to-day. There, in addition to the daily labour of.the head of the household, in every home there is carried on a small industry. We do not desire to have all the manufacturing and industrial pro-' cesses centralized in the capital cities of the States, but rather that they should be spread over the Commonwealth, and thus add to the prosperity of the seaside towns. The Attorney-General was gratified to think that cotton could be grown by small farmers; and he will make a great mistake if he does not accept this chance to develop small co-operative smoked-fish factories. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [5.29] -On e honourable member has placed himself in a ridiculous position in the course of the discussion. The honourable member for Dalley spoke at some length, and with some force, as anopponent of the bounty on fish, but I find that at an earlier stage he saidThere are one or two industries in Australia, such as the fisheries industry, the establishment trawler to open up our fishing grounds. of which those who believe in the bountv system misrht advocate with some degree of reason. Of course, we expect the Opposition to haggle over proposals made from this side, but when, after considerable waste of time, they press questions to a division, they are found to have only six or seven votesThe honourable member also spoke of the application of the bounty system to, amongst other industriesDeep-sea fisheries, in connection with which it might meet with some success. Later on, in forecasting the position which he might take up, he saidA political Ishmaelite is one who fights for his own hand, and if I find honourable members, advocating the claims of producers in their electorates, it may be taken for granted that themember for Dalley, who does not, as the members of the Labour Party insinuated, fight in his own personal. interests, will, on every occasion, see that the industries in which his constituentsare engaged are not neglected. That, of course,, is a most miserable position to have to take up, but I find honourable member after honourable member on both sides of the House showing, by their speeches that, when any proposed legislation suits their own constituent's, they say goodbye to principles, and I should be a traitor to my trust if I did not look after the interests of those who sent me here. The honourable member has a large number of constituents who are interested in fishing, yet now opposes the proposed encouragement to the industry. I rose merely to point out that the time of the Committee is being wasted by unnecessary arguments, and to draw attention to the ridiculous and inconsistent position in which many of the members of the Opposition have placed themselves. remarks which we have just heard from the honourable member for Cook are unbecoming to one who addresses the Committee with a smile of self-satisfaction and amusement. We realize that he did not mean what he said; but, unfortunately, the smug smile which indicated his inborn sense of humour cannot be transcribed in the pages of Hansard; and lest his words may create misapprehension in the minds of those who read his speech, I have risen to say' that, in resisting encroachments upon the public revenue, the members of the Opposition are actuated only by the highest motives. It is with these that we are prepared to credit the honourable member and our opponents. year Parliament voted the sum of £8,000 for the purchase and equipment of a It is believed that the waters of Australia contain vast stores of very valuable food supplies; but the proposal to vote -£10,000 a vear, for a period of five years, for the encouragement of the canning of fish, seems to me to be premature-",34,Bounties Bill

Buti f a division is taken on the whole item, I shall certainly vote against it. AlthoughI have not been in attendance throughout this debate, I have heard sufficient to enable me to form one or two opinions which I think are worthy of expression. the words "" in tins, or casks'' were omitted from the item, a great many men having surplus supplies of fish would be able to claim the bounty. I would point out, however, that apart from the mysterious regulations which are spoken of in such cryptic phraseology, it would be just as easy for a man to secure the bounty under the item as it stands as it would be if those words were struck out. desirous of claiming the bounty would have to do would be to fill casks with, say, barracouta, and, producing them to the officer administering the Act, say to him, "" Here are preserved fish in casks, and I claim bounty upon them."" It would be unnecessary for him to close the cask or even tin the fish he had preserved, and therefore the omission of these words would not make the provision any wider. I wish to draw attention to the extraordinary form in which this B ill is framed. As it stands, the Bill will enable the Government to scramble half a million of money in any way they please. misled by the heading to the fourth column of this schedule, which reads, "" Maximum amounts which may be paid in any one year.'' When we turn to the body of the B ill , however, we find that it gives the Minister unlimited and unconditional power to make regulations to so increase or reduce the amounts appearing in that column; that he could, if he chose, devote the total appropriation of £ 5 3 0 , 0 0 0 to any one of these items, and neglect the rest. There is no escape from that conclusion. there is, I should like him to point it out to the Committee. One would naturally conclude, from the heading to the fourth column of the schedule, that ;£io,ooo is This bounty would not be the maximum amount which may be paid in any one year in respect of a bounty on preserved fish; but when we turn to clause 9, I am preparagraph a, we find that it provides thatThe Governor General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing all matters which by this Act are required or permitted to be prescribed or are necessary or convenient to be prescribed for giving effect to this 'Act, and in particular for any of the following purposes :(a) For varying the amounts set out in the fourth column of the First Schedule as the maximum amount of bounty payable in respect of any goods. I assert, as a lawyer, that there is absolutely nothing in this B ill to prevent the Minister, by means of regulations, from giving £ 5 ° ; ° o o o r £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 under the most It has been contended that if insignificant item in this schedule. When some of my honourable friends have had, as I have had, a political experience extending over twenty-five years, they will recognise that this practice of giving a Minister power to make regulations by which he can stultify the opinions of Parliament, as expressed by its approval of a definite schedule such as this, should be abolished. All that a man I should like to point out that we have already struck out from the schedule four items-thos e relating to olives, palm fruit , peanuts, and sunflower seeds-cover ing a proposed total expenditure of £ 1 1 7 , 0 0 0 , out of the total appropria-' tion of £ 5 3 0 , 0 0 0.

The Minister, however, still retains power to make regulations, by which he can distribute the total appropriation of £ 4 1 3 , 0 0 0 as he pleases over these different items. Mr J. H .

But we could prescribe under clause 9 that the regulations shall not take effect at an earlier date than that on which they have been laid before Parliament, or we could say that they should not take effect until fourteen days have elapsed after they have been placed before both Houses. In such case, according to the Acts Interpretation Act, it would be competent for any honourable member during the fourteen days to fable a motion disallowing the regulations. According to section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act of 1904,. regulations are to be laid before Parliament, and they take effect from the date of their notification in the Gazette. If either House passes a resolution, of which notice has been given, within fifteen days arfter the regulations have been laid before each House, disallowing them, they cease to have effect. I suggest that no date be specified for the coming into force of the regulations until Parliament has had an opportunity, under the section to which I have just referred, to express its opinion as to whether or not they shall take effect. We should then see whether any substantial addition had been made to the maximum prescribed in each case. The House would thus be able to check the expenditure, and, at the same time, it would save the policy of' the Minisreasonable discretion within certain limits. try, which is to allow alterations to be made without the introduction of a new Bill in every case. I had not the advantage of hearing all the remarks of the honourable member, for 1 Parkes, but, coming from one who is usually accurate, or within a reasonable degree of accuracy, I must say that the latter portion of his speech somewhat surprised me. Considering the length of time the honourable member has been in Parliament, he should be aware that under the Audit Act there is power, in regard to the Estimates, to transfer votes from one item in a subdivision to another. that that has been the practice for years, and I say that it is a wrong practice. Secretary for Public Works in New South Wales, the honourable member should be aware that it is a common practice to transfer items from one heading to another, where one vote is exhausted, and another vote has not been used. railways and roads. . ence?

With all respect to the honourable member's judgment, I regard it as a very necessary practice. it. honourable member to agree; but, in my view, it is a very necessary practice. It is inevitable that in framing Estimates a number of possibilities may be overlooked, and, therefore, there must be some trust placed in the hands; of the Executive; and I regard it as a ber say that fish and mohair were in the same sub-division ? to the technical possibilities under this particular Bill, but I object to the suggestion of the honourable member for Parkes that the practice as a whole is a bad one. It is a practice which must be followed if we are to have Executive Government; or, otherwise, the Treasurer's advance account, which is only another form of trusting the Executive, will have to be much larger. member for Wentworth has just pointed out that under the practice it would be possible to divert a bounty from fish to mohair. would be any very great danger in that.

195,Mr Watson,"I do not know that thereopinion, the Committee are not parting with any large measure of their liberty in assenting^ to the practice of transferring from one item to another. [6.25] -This Bill differs very materially from the general Estimates, in so far as every item in the schedule is a separate and distinct Department, a separate and distinct sub-division, a separate and distinct appropriation. While it may be very proper under the Audit Act to transfer votes within a sub-division of a Department a sub-division. this Bill presents quite another case. If we vote £50,000 as a bonus to the fish industry, the money might by regulation be transferred to the rice industry; and that would be much more serious than giving the Government power to manipulate the votes in the interests of a division under the general Estimates. increase the rate of the bounty, but only the total amount on any particular item. Could take money, which had been voted for one purpose, and apply it to a totally different purpose; it would not be merely manipulating votes with the object of securing the complete administration of the Department, but it would be devoting the money to quite a distinct object. If the provision of the Audit Act referred to by the honourable member for South Sydney be applied to a Bill of this kind, it will open up a vista of strange and serious possibilities, unless we assume, as, of course, we have a right to assume, the administration is going to be honest. Another fundamental difference between this Bill and an ordinary money Bill, or the Estimates, is that once this Bill is passed we shall have absolutely no further control over the expenditure of these amounts. It may be a matter of amending the Audit Act, but there ought to be some distinction made in the direction-1 have indicated. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m. agree with the honourable and learned member for Parkes that if our legislation is not to be farcical we should amend those provisions of the Bill which conflict with the fourth column of the schedule. The honourable member for South Sydney told the Committee that the practice of allowing Ministers to vary the amounts voted by Parliament prevails in regard to the Estimates, and I agree with him that it has obtained in the past, but the variation is confined to the amounts set down in each subdivision. I. do not regard it as a hurtful practice within those limits. But in this case it is different; for it must be remembered that the sum set down as the "" maximum "" amount to be devoted to the encouragement of any particular industry seriously weighs with honourable members in coming>to a decision in regard to the items of the schedule. By way of illustration, let me point out that an important party in the Chamber has laid down the rule that the expenditure for defence is not to exceed a certain amount. If the amounts voted for various Departments could be so varied that the defence Estimates could be increased, in spite of this, honourable mem-' bers would not agree to those Estimates without requiring that there should be no addition to the sum voted for defence. In this case, the same principle should apply, but at the present time, we do not know whether £10,000 or £30,000 is to be given for the encouragement of the fishing industry. Some of the items in the schedule were agreed to by a very narrow majority; but probably they would not have been agreed to at all if it had been known that the maximum amount, payable would be £10,000 instead of £2,000. Opposition have said that they wish that the amounts shall be subject to variation. that. I have always held that Parliament should keep as close a control as possible upon the expenditure of the country, and I am seeking to apply that principle to the Bill. I hope that the Minister will recommit such portions of the measure as will enable us to insure that the amounts given for particular items shall be those which we desire to give. With regard to the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corio, the declared object of the bounty is the encouragement of fishermen whose existence would form a valuable reserve for coastal defence.

As what we wish to do is to encourage the fishing industry, and not the secondary industry of canning, I shall support it. It has always been my opinion that the object of bounties is to encourage primary production:, and for that reason I desire, to see a bounty offered of which those engaged jo the fishing industry can take advantage. The great objection to many bounty proposals is that they make it possible for a few large firms to obtain possession of large sums of public money, instead of giving legitimate encouragement to the primary producers. In any electorate, a large number of persons make their living by fishing. There are two important fishing towns in the electorate, but the fishing industry is not a very flourishing one, because of the difficulty of obtaining a market for the fish. T have seen quantities of fish left on the piers as unsaleable. If there were better arrangements for its transport inland, there would be a much better sale, and a consequent larger consumption of fish. The want of an adequate market now causes great loss, and those engaged in the fishing industry are often idle because there is no regular demand to supply. I have always desired to assist in the development of Australian industries, than which none is more important than the fishing industry. Many honourable members, whose sentiments appear to .me thoroughly anti-Australian, are continually speaking about the need for population. Let me draw their attention to the value of the fishing industry in other countries. In the United Kingdom, no fewer than 106,000 persons are engaged in that industry, the value of its products being £9,500,000, while in Canada, 73,000 persons are so engaged, their efforts resulting in products valued at ,£5,000,000. . I .canrot see how those who say that we should increase our population can oppose the development of this industry. to the development of this or any other industry. develop an industry is to encourage it with a bounty and protect it with import duties. -In the western districts of Victoria, we have had experience of what a bounty will do for the butter industry. No one will say that that industry has gone back because of the granting of the butter bounty. Seeing that so many persons obtain a livelihood in other countries as fishermen, surely in Australia we imay expect that the fishing industry will give employment to a large part of our population, having in view the great extent of our coast line, and the possibilities of our coastal waters. I suggest the omission of the words "" in tins and casks "" and the substitution for them of the words "" as prescribed."" The bounty should not go to large firms, but should be paid ""to small men. The statement of the Minister that the work of administration will be very great if a great number of small producers have to be considered, will apply to every item in the schedule. [7.56] I compliment the honourable member for Wannon upon the fact that in his first speech he has made a very sensible proposal for the amendment of this item. One could see that he had thought but the. subject upon which he spoke. But in suggesting that those who oppose the granting of this bounty are against the establishment of the fishing industry, he did an injustice to the free-trade members of the Committee, their policy being to establish every industry that is native 1.0 the country. Still, we wish to establish industries under healthy conditions! We think that it is useless to bolster up with bounties or protective duties industries which cannot existwithout assistance. It is not that free traders are opposed to the establishment of industries, but that they desire the establishment of healthy industries. In Victoria alone does the view prevail that we are opposed to the establishment of industries, I desire the establishment of the fishing industry, and voted for a trawler to explore our coastal waters, with a view to discovering the possibilities of deep-sea fishingTrawling has been conducted experimentally by the New South Wales Government with very successful results. Here is an industry which, according to the Commission which investigated the matter in New South Wales, must succeedJust as it has proved a success in Canada, so will it be a success in Australia. The offer of a bounty, is not required to establish an enterprise of this kind. According to the report of the State experts, we have a home market for preserved fish which is worth £310,000 annually. All that we require now is enterprise, and that enterprise will be forthcoming when the trawler has got to work. The honourable member for",42,Bounties Bill

I quite agree with the honourable member that the proposed bounty will find its way into the pockets of the middleman, whereas the desire is that the primary producer shall receive it. The report of the Conference of State experts saysUnquestionably, the careful and skilfully conducted surveys of our deep-sea fishing grounds, which will become possible when the fisheries' vessel is completed and put into commission, will greatly enlarge and systematize our knowledge of the available fish supplies of the seas adjacent to our coasts. Let us prove that the fish are here in payable quantities, and the preserving and packing processes will be no more difficult in Australia than they are in Canada and otherparts of the world. In Tasmania, I understand, there are seasons of the year when a man has merely to stand at the water's edge, and with a fork shoot out the fish which abound there. I have been as. sured by the honourable member for Denison that he has known tens of thousands of tons of fish to be caught in that way. The trawling experiments which were conducted in New South Wales have shown that the fish exist along our coasts in payable ouantities, and therefore I say that the industry requires no artificial bolstering up. honourable member declared that we required the trawler to prove that we have the fish. experiments conducted in New South Wales by Mr Farnell were a great success. bers were informed earlier in the debate that they were a failure. success, undoubtedly. At the same time that trawler was not equipped in the way that the vessel which the Government propose to have constructed will be. All that is required to make this industry a success is ordinary British enterprise, and we have plenty of that in Australia. If we can show the capitalist that he will obtain a fair return for his outlay, he will be only too pleased to invest his money in the enterprise. to work and prove that the fish exist along . the manufacturer With an adequate and regular supply of fish, arid with the financial stimulus offered by the liberal bounty provided for in the B ill , there is good reason to hope that fish canning will become a highly important industry.

Of course, the answer to that is that, if pinelikely to be conflict. Personally, I have apples are dried fruit, the amendment is unnecessary, whereas if they are not dried fruit, I am afraid the amendment goes beyond our power. I think that the Speaker, on one occasion, ruled that at this stage of a Bill, involving an appropriation, we cannot vary the scope; we may omit or reduce, but we cannot enlarge either the amount or the scope of the appropriation. As to that ruling, I speak only from recollection. I do not see why pine-apples should not be included, if that be. possible. difficulty is as I have stated. the amendment was not in order. I should not have put it to the Committee. In reply to the objection raised by the Attorney-General as to the increase of the expenditure, I remind him that we propose by this schedule to vote £6,000, as the utmost that can be spent on this particular item in one year. If the Government go beyond that sum in this expenditure, they will be exceeding the amount allowed by the Bill. Regarding the objection as to the altering of the destination of the bounty, the Bill already allows the Government to fix any amount they think proper as the maximum. Under clause 9, the Government, if they so desire, may, by regulation, devote £400,000 to this particular item, and neglect expenditure upon all the other items. Under the circumstances I think the proposed amendment is quite in order. ment, intend any disrespect to the Chair; and I am anxious to help the honourable member for Wide Bay. in having canned pine-apples included. am bound, however, by my position, to have regard to the constitutional aspect of the question. Would it be possible to take the Speaker's ruling on the point? Otherwise, in the House, the point may be raised, and it may be necessary to recommit the Bill. I think that by consent the Speaker may be referred to. and, although it has occasionally happened that the ruling of the Chairman has been referred to Mr Speaker, it is much better that the Committee should arrange its own business. If every time a ruling is given in Committee, a reference is made to Mr Speaker, there is no objection to the point being referred to Mr Speaker. HadI known, that this question would be raised I should have armed myself with the authorities necessary to enable me to put the matter clearly before the Committee.

I am sure that the I am afraid the honor-, Chairman will not regard the action of the Committee in wishing to refer this matter to Mr Speaker as reflecting upon him, because the same thing has been done on many previous occasions. able member for Wide Bay that something should be done to encourage the export of I ask the honourable memwhat seems likely to become one of our staple products; but it would be unwise to run the risk of the Bill being ruled I take the honourable out of order. For that reason I think we should take Mr Speaker's decision on the point now. The practice already obtains of referring important questions of this character to him, although the Standing Orders-in my opinion, unwisely-appea r That was the not to contemplate action of this kind. InNew South Wales, the Standing Orders of the Legislative Assembly provide for references to Mr Speaker, but under our procedure, these references are made only with the consent of the Committee generally. It is highly desirable that we should prevent the growing up of two practicesone governing procedure in the House, and the other governing procedure in Committee.

I am in sympathy with the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay, and was desirous of making provision in the schedule for the encouragement of industries which, in my opinion, should be encouraged, and for which no bounty is allotted. But I have refrained from moving amendments, because I felt Mr Speaker would have to that they would be unconstitutional.

On that point, I do not feel so confident. not an opportunity to consult the authorities on this point, but the question wassprung upon me suddenly. The Attorney General, I believe, had gone into the matter in anticipation of an amendment of this kind. He first took the point that the amendment is out of order because it would increase the proposed expenditure; but I ruled that as £6,000 is appropriated as the maximum annual bounty for dried fruits, the Government could not expend more than that sum in any one year, and, therefore, the amendment would not increase the expenditure. The Attorney General seems inclined now to waive that point, and says that he does not feel confident in regard to it. His second point was that the amendment would alter the destination of the proposed bounty. I pointed out that if that were so, we had already altered the destination of the bounty proposed for the production of fish, and that, if my ruling in this case does not honourable member for East Sydney. I take bold good, the former amendment should not have been accepted. I also pointed out that under paragraph a of clause 9 the Government has power to alter the destination of every vote in the schedule. The appropriation covered by the message from the Crown amounts to £530,000, but the amounts in the schedule total nearly £600,000. Under the provision to which I refer, the Government could alter the destination of the various votes, giving nearly the whole sum for the production of cotton or the production of preserved fish. I maintain that in accepting the amendment I was not accepting a provision conferring more power upon the Government in regard to the variation of expenditure than is conferred by the clause which I have mentioned. think we may well have regard to the analogy afforded by the Estimates. They are covered by a message from the Governor General, but can a Committee of Supply change the destination of any amount therein set down? Can it appropriate part of a sum set down for a definite object for some other object? If it can, the ruling of Mr Chairman must be upheld. My impression, is that a Committee has not the power to. change the destination of appropriations recommended by a message from the Crown. It may reduce an amount, but it may not increase it or change the destination of an appropriation. In this instance, several difficulties arise. If the amendment were agreed to the item would readFruits-Dried and Canned Pineapples. dried fruit, then it is undoubtedly covered by the word which already appears in the schedule. "" Dried"" is a general term. There are two kinds of dried fruit excepted, viz., currants and raisins. I repeat that if canned pineapple is a dried fruit the term "" d r i e d "" covers it ; but if it is not, I am afraid that the amendment becomes objectionable. to debate the point, which was first raised by the Attorney-General, viz., that if we agreed to the amendment proposed we should be exceeding* the message of Appropriation. That objection, it seems to me, cannot be sustained. The more sensible reasoning to my mind was that of the right it that in this particular item of the sche-",48,Bounties Bill

The bounty provided for in this item, however, is so small that it would be impossible for the manufacturer to pass on any portion of it to the producer. Tens of thousands of tons of fruit are now being preserved, and if the honourable member's amendment were adopted the bounty would go to the manufacturer, whilst the producer would get nothing, and a new industry would certainly not be established. gard this item as one of very great importance. staple industries, and should be fostered by every legitimate means. I do not think it would be wise to adopt the amendment, because in dealing with the prospects of the preserved fruit industry the Conference of experts' reportIt was accordingly decided not to recommend .1 bonus as requested by the associations referred to. At the sam» time careful consideration was given to the prospects of the fruit industry in Australia as a whole, and means were considered which might lead to its expansion. The highly favorable conditions of climate and soil which prevail over large portions of the Commonwealth point to fruit-growing becoming a highly important industry. Many of the choicest fruits bring a high price when dried or candied, and this work may be successfully carried out by families or small co-operative associations. This is the point to which I desire to draw special attentionThe extent to which jams, jellies, preserved fruits, pulp and frui t juices are already produced in the Commonwealth, and the fact that these products are being exported indicate that the industries are already well established. Jams, jellies and preserved fruits are already being exported on a commercial basis, and there is therefore no need for a bounty in respect of them. There are, however, important possibilities in connection with the exportation of dried fruits, and I hope therefore that the Committee will pass the item as it stands. is evident there is no hope of ray securing the omission of the word "" dried "" from the item.

I have been making some inquiries, and I understand that the industry which it is proposed to establish is a very important one. If it is possible to establish it successfully in Australia, which looks probable from the information available, it ought to assume very lajge dimensions, and have a great effect on our staple industry. The inquiries I have made impress *me with the idea that it will be impossible to erect a plant, or a number of Fruit-growing is one of our plants, sufficiently large to carry on the in.dustry on a commercial scale, so as to permit of successful competition with exported goods, unless a considerable time is allowed. A very large plant is essential, and at least eighteen months or two years will be taken up in erecting the necessary buildings and machinery. That being so, unless the time at which the bonus is to commence be extended for nearly two years, the bonus might lapse before it could be taken advantage of. As I am sure that is not the wish of the Minister; I suggest that he might extend the time for the coming into operation of the bonus to a year ahead, or the ist July, 1908. ber think the bonus is sufficient ? particularly from wool-buyers in Sydney, and one, who seemed to have a pretty good knowledge of this industry-h e having, prior to coming out to Australia, had experience in all the detailed work of top making-sai d he thought that the bonus would prove sufficient. From inquiries he himself had made, on behalf of a continental firm, he had come to the conclusion that there was only a small margin, so far as could then be seen, against the local manufacturer; in fact, he said that, after the industry was established, and the product became known in the markets of the world, he had no doubt it would be able to do without a bonus. But this woolbuyer was of opinion that a plant on a scale sufficiently large to enable Australian tops to compete with tops in other parts of the world could not be erected under two years. I suggested to him twelve months as a reasonable limit, and I now move That after the words "" two years"" there be inserted the words ""commencing from ist Julv, 1908.""",52,Bounties Bill

That is the maximum amount; and I am assuming that in each of these years the maximum amount will be taken out. For instance, in the case of olives, I have allowed for the reduction made; and so in regard to the other items, and have arrived at the result which I have -just indicated.

But the regulations may have been eight months in operation before they are laid before Parliament; and I suggest that clause 9 should be recommitted with a view to providing that the regulations shall not take effect until after they have been laid on the table of the House. Theni f some honourable member challenges the regulations, no Minister will dare to specify a date until the question has been decided. General) [9.45] -The object of the second schedule is to prevent the appropriations in 'each year exceeding certain amounts. Originally the appropriation of a certain .amount was provided for, to be spent at the rate of so much per annum. During the debate several honourable members have contended that the amounts fixed as the maxima for specific items are not sufficient, and have urged that the Government should, when necessary, take from one item to give to another. My reply to them is that the maximum appropriations for each year are fixed, but that power is given to the Government to vary these maximum amounts by regulation. It is not at all likely that, in the first years of the bounty period, when industries will be in the experimental stage, the maximum amounts set down will be claimed. For instance, it is not likely that £6,000 will be claimed this year for the production of ginned cotton; but as time progresses, and the industry, expands, the demand will probably exceed £6,000. To meet it, we shall have power to increase the maximum by regulation. I cannot accept the suggestion that no regulation shall 'have the force of law until it has been laid upon the table for a certain length of time, because it will be necessary in the case of manv administrative regulations, that they should take effect at once. no regulation under paragraph a of clause 9 shall come into force until it has laid on the table for a certain period. to accept an amendment of that kind, and I shall be glad if the honourable and learned member will draft one. I thought h.s ureposal applied to all regulations. understood the Attorney-General to say that clause 9 empowers the Government to vary by regulation the maximum amounts in the fcurth column by taking from one item, and adding to another. I should like to know in respect to ginned cotton, for example, for which the -maximum amount which may be paid in any one vear is £6,000, if any part of that sum could be applied for the encouragement of some other industry. General) [9.53]--If the maximum amounts set down in the fourth column of the first schedule are multiplied by the years during which the bounties may be paid, they will be found to total something like £650,000, while the Bill provides for an appropriation cut of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of only £530,000. There is the further limitation that the expenditure in any one year shall not exceed certain amounts. Power is taken, however, to increase by regulation the maximum amounts annually payable'in respect to any item. For instance, we could increase the maximum payment for ginned cotton in any one year from £6,000 to £7,000, but we could not expend more than £530,000 during the period for which the bounties' will be in force. money from other items and use it to increase the bounty on cotton? fer from one item to another, merely a; variation of the maximum amount pavable in respect to any goods in any one year. We cannot, however, increase the total amount payable in respect to any goods during the period for which the bounties are in force. Moreover, the total expenditure in each year is limited by the second schedule. It cannot exceed £68,000 in the year ending 30th June, 1908; £128,000 next year, and so on. down maximum amounts if the Government is to have power to increase them by regulations?

The scheme of the Bill is to fix a maximum expenditure in connection with each item. In the form in which the measure now stands, if there were an unexpended balance upon any item, that balance could be expended by increasingthe maximum amount which is payable in any one year.

But do not let us put one of these bounties on an insecure footing. Let the people whom, we are asking to take up these industries be told, "" There is this amount of money for you by Act of Parliament if you earn it. If you do not earn it in the first year, but do so in any succeeding year, come along and you will still get it . "" We are giving the Government power to meet those people in that way. That is all the Acting Prime Minister wants. Naturally the Government want power to that extent. We provide so much a year. Perhaps no application will be made in'the first, second or third year; but in the fourth or. fifth year applications may be put in with a rush. The Government ought to have power in that case to use up the money that has been lying there for those people in the previous years. That additional power, which is the only one 'the Government want, is a proper power to give them, because we intend the whole of the money appropriated by this measure to be used for the whole time, and we do not want to shut out any one during any year. If the Ajtorney-General makes that clear, we shall be acting fairly by all these people, and there will be nothing to prevent the Government from dealing with some special case. If they find they want more for a particular industry, they can come to this House for it, without tampering with the money belonging to other industries. It has taken a great deal .of time and explanation to arrive at an understanding satisfactory to a member with an ordinary mind. member for Arigas made it clear an hour ago. to me until I heard the Attorney-General and the leader of the Opposition. . Another difficulty that presents itself to.me is this: Opposition. I understand that the MinisAre we allowed under the Constitution to. have an accumulation of money? No doubt that, point has not escaped the. notice of the Attorney-General. If we have to divide the whole of our surplus every year among the. States, will it be possible to retain these unexpended balances from year to year? There might be a considerable accumulation at the end of a financial year of money appropriated by this measure, but if , under the financial provisions of the Constitution,-the States de-' mand the return to them of the whole of the surplus at the end of the year, what will be the position? I do not think it would be wise to transfer amounts from one vote to' another. If , as the honourable member forAngas said, such a thing has been provided for,' it ""was done unwittingly by the Committee, and the Attorney-General ought to have the clause altered. I know he has promised to do so. time before the facts were wormed out, and I think the honourable and learned gentleman had something else in his mind than the interpretation of the honourable and learned member for Angas. honourable and learned member. ing that of the Attorney-General, and ' f so I do not want to do him an injustice. When I am legislating here as a member of the Committee, I desire to know exactly what I am doing, and .so I should like the legal members to tell us the meaning of the proposal in the'fewest possible words. We cannot help it if we make a mistake unwittingly. I am very glad that this discussion has taken place, and that these, long explanations have 'been given. For"" my own information, because it will be useful hereafter, I should like to know how the constitutional, difficulty regarding the accumulation of unexpended votes appropriated by this Bill is to be-met.

The leader of the Opposition said that it would be unfair to allow money to be diverted in this way from one item to another, because in some cases three or four years would necessarily elapse between the inception of an industry and the time when the bounty relating to it could be claimed. If the Committee had had power to increase the amounts set apart in respect of these items, I am satisfied, from the tenor of the debate, that additions would have been made to the bounties on cotton, rubber, and rice. I look to this provision as being likely to afford an opportunity to supplement the amounts set apart to encourage those industries. the result if, for a period of five years, no claim were made for the bounty under one of these' items ? For instance, it is proposed that £[25,000 shall be expended in an effort to encourage the production of linseed, and that sum is to be distributed over a period of five years. Are we to understand that a man is to be permitted to refrain from claiming the bounty until the last year, when there would be an accumulation of £25,000? He would thus be able to scoop the lot. for the country if . the whole amount could be claimed. adopted, and these amounts are to be specially ear marked, a good many people will wait until practically the last moment before stepping in to claim the bounty. which the honourable and learned member has referred, a certain quantity must be produced. It would be impossible, for any one in one year to raise sufficient linseed to entitle him to claim the whole sum of £25,000. Williamstown Woollen Mills set to work to secure the bounty granted by the Victorian Government, and closed down as soon as it had obtained it. the Government from guarding against! that which the honourable and learned member suggests. It is in their power not to add to the amount yearly payable in respect of any bounty if they think that anything of the kind which he suggests is being attempted. bers wish to prevent the Government from applying the unexpended balances in respect of some .of these items to others relating to industries that are taken up, and should be encouraged. I do not think it is reasonable to suggest that the Government would attempt to cripple any of the smaller industries in their desire to encourage the larger ones If they did not desire an industry to flourish they certainly would not provide for it in the schedule. Hie Parliament itself cannot do much to encourage an industry. It can empower the Government to expend a large sum of money with that object in view, but the success of the movement depends entirely upon the administration of the law. The greater the trust we repose in the Depart; ment charged with the administration of this measure, the better it will be, and I hoDe that the Minister will carefully consider the point I have endeavoured to make. somewhat surprised at the argument which the honourable and learned member for Corio has advanced. Business men must know that any one who desired to earn one of these bounties would have to set to work at once fo secure it. When the honourable and learned member suggests that a man might wait until practically the last moment before taking steps to earn one of these bounties, and thus secure a lump sum of £25,000 in one year, he must imagine that this Bill is to apply to an island like that on which Robinson Crusoe lived for some time-to a country where competition is unknown.

Anv one desirous of earning one of these bounties will set to work as soon as possible to secure it. We may have implicit confidence in the capacity of the present Government to administer this measure, and to distribute the moneys voted in connection with it in an equitable manner; but we have to remember that the appropriation under it will extend over a number of years, and that during that time many changes of Government may take place. Honourable members in the Opposition corner have urged that the total appropriation under this Bill should be devoted to one or two industries, so that if they entered into possession of the Treasury tench they would probably be disposed to devote the amount set apart in respect of some of the smaller items in the schedule to one or two of the principal ones. That would be unfair to those who, on the passing of this Bill,took steps to establish some of these smaller industries. We must have finality in this matter, and I contend that the various amounts in the schedule should either be used for the purposes for which they are appropriated or not at all. When the honourable and learned member for Corio was speaking, I interjected that the matter would have to come before Parliament if the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Angasa suggestion which the Attorney General accepted some time ago-were acted upon. and learned member for Corio thereupon pointed out that the matter would be in the hands of Parliament under any circumstances. It will be seen, however, that Parliament would be in a different position from that it now occupies in relation to the Bill. If I do not approve of an item in a Bill, I can vote against it without any injury to the Government, but if it be thought the Government are spending money in a wrong direction, and I vote against them, it amounts to a want of confidence vote. Under such circumstance* the independence of honourable members sitting behind the Government is taken away; and it is far better not to allow such questions to become party matters.
