Will he consider the advisableness of reducing telephone charges and altering the present system so a9 to popularize the telephone service, And bring it within reasonable reach of every householder? orable member's questions are:1.

Minister for Repatriation) [11.9] -Be fore the Committee proceeds to consider the items which make up the Estimates for this Department, I wish to make a general statement about the operations of the War Service Homes Commission from its inception, in order that the Committee may be seized of the true position to-day in contra-distinction to what would appear, from statements that have been published, in the press, to be the position. The Commission was appointed to provide homes for soldiers and their eligible dependants. This was to be done at cost price, allowing no profit to any one in respect of land, material, or labour. The scheme received the approval of the country and of Parliament, and its terms are embodied in the War Service Homes Act. There was at the time a very strong public desire that the work of building these homes, which meant the creation of a business Department, and was an experimental proceeding on the part of the country, should be intrusted to a Commission entirely removed from political control. Effect was given to that desire by Parliament, and the Act conferred on the WaiService Homes Commissioner the power to acquire all necessary land and building material, and to engage the service necessary for the carrying out of the scheme. He was given the right to select his own staff, though it was to be composed, so far as they might be eligible and competent, of returned soldiers. Prom the beginning there was no political, no Ministerial, interference with the Commissioner. that there was not. c able members to recollect how insistent was the demand that there should be no political interference, and that the Commissioner should be empowered to carry on the duties of his Department unimpeded. The records of the Department any attempt by a responsible Minister to interfere with the business side of the Commissioner's work. The Commissioner was given a free charter in the building up of his organization on approved business lines, and the selection of officers. Dr. EiUtLE PAGE -Had the Deputy Commissioners to be approved by the Minister, or were they appointed entirely by the Commissioner? by the Commissioner. Under the Act, the only person for whose appointment responsibility rests with the Government is the Commissioner; the business managers in the various States were appointed by him. The only direction that the Government gave to the Commissioner was that, so far as they might be eligible and competent, returned soldiers should be selected to fill the positions in his Department. Subject to that limitation, the Commissioner had a free hand in the building up of his organization. But, so that he might not have to commence operations "" off the rocks,"" so to speak, the services of the Commonwealth Bank were secured to carry on the construction programme of the Commonwealth during the period in which he was getting ready. The Bank was empowered, as was the Commissioner, not only to build, but also to purchase and otherwise acquire already-erected properties. At the time there was a worldwide shortage of houses, and the demand for homes was as acute in Australia as elsewhere. In order that returned men might not have to wait unreasonably long for houses, the Bank, like the Commissioner, was empowered to purchase, to a limited extent, .already-erected houses, though its chief work was to buy land and material, provide plans and specifications, and erect dwellings.",19,Estimates 1921 1922

March of this year, the Commission operated under two systems-that is to say, through the agency of the Commonwealth Bank, and by means of its own organization. In the statement. I have to make to-day, I have no desire to pursue unduly any officer of the Commission or to rest blame on any particular officer; but I should be wanting in my duty to both this Committee and the country if I were not to make a clear and candid statement as to what I believe was responsible for some of the mistakes that are frankly admitted in connection with the War Service Homes Department. mind honoraible members of the condition of affairs that existed at the 'inception of the scheme and of the strong public demand for the appointment of a business Commissioner. was appointed Commissioner in February, 1919; the Act was proclaimed in March, 1919, and he was allowed the period between then and September of the same year to get his building organization ready. In fairness to Lieut members will recognise, therefore, that it Colonel Walker and the Commission generally, I would refresh the minds of honourable members as to the conditions which prevailed at that time. They were completely abnormal. There was a lack of material, a dearth of lalbour, and an unwillingness on the part of the general building community to enter into extensive contracts either for the supply of material or the building of houses. stances the Commissioner and the Government had to set about the building of home3.

I repeat that it was absolutely impossible to get supplies of material; that there was a shortage of workmen, and an unwillingness on the part of the building community to undertake risks. Government restrict the operations of the Commonwealth Bank? aware, they were not restricted. I know of no restriction that was placed on the Bank. I want honourable members to review the building operations of, not only Australia, but other countries, during this period. I remind them that the I again reBritish Government itself embarked on a great building scheme, i Mr Lloyd George, in his initial programme, set out to build 300,000 houses. To use a colloquialism, he "" pulled out"" after only Lieut -Colonel Walker 5,000 had ibeen built. His building department was disbanded, and the Government retired from the enterprise of trying to provide homes through Government instrumentalities. America had a somewhat similar experience. Honourable would be unfair not to go back and look at the abnormal conditions which then prevailed. Who will say that, in any one of our capital cities, or in any of our important towns, no person in the building world of recent years has not made gigantic losses ? Examine the books of men of long business experience in any of the State capitals. They will tell you frankly that they have suffered colossal losses, and that the period during which In these difficult circumthe Commonwealth Government was engaged through its Commissioner in building homes was the most anxious in the history of business. Both in the acquisiThey had come tion and purchase of material, as well as in connection with contracts for the supply of material; there have been very heavy losses, and I venture to say that the experience of the Commission does not stand alone. As a matter of fact, I have positive proof that it does not.

12,Mr Rodgers,"So far as I amtracts into which it entered for the building of War Service Homes, as well as the experience of the Commission itself, was that many contractors failed to carry out their work. Some of them failed completely, and were unable to complete houses upon the erection of which they had started. I state these facts so that honourable members may not gaze only on the operations of the Commission. Throughout the whole world losses of this ' kind have occurred. In every country the building world has had to write down its assets, so that the experience of the Commission is by no means novel. pray the Committee, therefore, when discussing the operations of the Commission, to have special regard to the abnormal period through which we have been passing. Coming more particularly to the Commission, its organization, and its operations, I admit frankly that it was not organized on business lines. It was the duty of the Commissioner, and not of the Minister, to secure that proper business organization. The Government gave him a fair period in which to build up his scheme. Act was proclaimed in March, 1919, and it was not until September of the same year that the Commission started its first work. To tell the Committee in detail of the directions in which the organization was defective, I should have to traverse the ground already covered by the Public Accounts Committee. ThatI do not propose to do. The Public Accounts Committee has made, and is continuing, a searching inquiry into the operations of the Commission, and I do not propose to go in detail over the ground they are covering. I shall content myself with the statement that the operations of the Commission failed, not in all respects, because I do not admit that it did, but failed mainly through lack of business organization and because it did not have the proper man at its head as business or-, ganizer. by my colleague, Senator E.

The Government erred, perhaps, in n of offering a better remuneration. I think that the salary fixed for the Commissioner should have been double what it was, in order to secure the right class of man. I mention that, however, merely I in passing. We. are not able to attract to the Public Service of this country the highest class of men-the men with the best brains-if we offer a low remuneration. There are larger rewards and better opportunities outside. offered? It was of the highest importance that the man at the helm of a great business concern of this kind should be of outstanding ability-that he should have, first of all, a practical knowledge of the building As I have already said, the world and a thorough knowledge of building materials and supplies, that he should be familiar with the class of work the men were engaged on, and, above all, that he should have a knowledge of finance. A man big enough to answer to all these requirements is not to be found in this country looking for a job at £1,500 a year. dition to salary, attaches to the office of Commissioner ? cally no allowances in the way of emoluments to the Commissioner. He does hot receive any commission, but is paid outof-pocket expenses when travelling on the work of the Commission. Next in importance to the Commissioner are the Deputy Commissioners, who are, so to speak, the business managers in the States, and who, The Commissioner was selected as a matter of fact, carry ont the building programme. It is the Commissioner's fmsiness to lay out his plans, and it is for keen business men, as Deputy Commissioners, to carry them into effect. Again, I have to say that in his selection of the Deputy Commissioners, or business missioner was very unfortunate.",21,Honourable Membebs Hear Hear

It is my duty, however, to point out in what respect the work of the Commission has failed. In Victoria, during the short period in which the Commission has been in existence, there have been three Deputy Commissioners or business managers, while in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania there have been four each. In the short period in which the Commission has conducted operations, it has been found impossible to secure continuity of service in view of the fact that so many changes have had to be made in the management of important branches. I am not referring, in any statement which I have made or am about to make, to any officer who is now in charge of a branch. these changes? sion a document furnished by the Departkeep two aspects in mind, whether the ment setting forth detailed reasons for contracts have had to be recast or terthe changes.

The established a new one, with a different Government take the responsibility for set of books. I am unable to give the cost of the houses built by day labour. When I last addressed honourable members upon this subject, I pointed out that, aside from the political aspect of the day labour system, it was impossible to enter into a definite contract with a soldier in advance, and to tell him what his house would cost under that system. He was to get it at cost price; but it would be impossible to inform him, until some time after the job had been completed, exactly what it had cost. The late Commissioner, and the Government, regarded it as being essential to acquire material on contract for the building of these homes. Here, again, I have to make the frank admission that the Commissioner completely misjudged the number of houses which could be built, or in respect of which financial arrangements could be under1 taken. The Commissioner entered into contracts far in excess of requirements, and I have had an uncongenial task in re-arranging some of them.

25,Mr Rodgers,"I have in my possesvernment have endeavoured, however, tohaving re-organized the whole system in connection with the War Service Homes Department. As a matter of deliberate policy the Government have abandoned the principle of building homes. That is to say, they are no longer master-builders through the Oommissioii. The Government have recognised that times are returning in the direction of the normal; that supplies of building material have been becoming more freely available upon the market; and that labour has grown more plentiful and more reasonable. The amount of industrial trouble which the Commission was called upon to face represents no small factor in the increased cost of houses. There were such difficulties as strikes, retrospective awards of the Courts, and a desire on the part of some of those engaged on the day-labour system to give the Commission less than a fair return for the wages paid them. Now, however, the Government are providing homes under the contract system. Their obligations will be limited to financing those homes and supervising the assets. This policy has necessitated very many fundamental changes which, however, the Government have not hesitated to effect. They have brought into existence what they believe to be an effective and essential organization. With regard to the heavy stocks of material already held, and coming to hand in respect of contracts which have not yet been terminated, the Government have appointed a Central Disposals Board, with State subsidiary Boards. All material has been removed from the direct control of the Commission, and all the depots, plant, and building organization generally, have been vested in the Boards for realization. And, in the process of utilization under the contract system, and of the realization of the remainder"", the Government are endeavouring, through these Boards, to do the best they possibly can do with all the excess material. Along these lines; very capable assistance has been rendered by experienced business men. in the original purchase. at this moment to disposal. [Extension of time granted.] The Central Disposals Board and subsidiary Boards comprise [541] men of experience whose bond fides generally are unchallengable. The Central Board determines the policy of realization. No attempt is being made, in the disposal of material, either to secure unreasonable prices or to further disturb the already disturbed market. It has been recognised that those in the trade have already suffered severely; and the Government, in getting rid of the materials, have refrained from coming into the field as a serious competitor with long-established firms. However, a well-organized method of disposal has brought about realizations, to date, of about £125,000 worth of material-al l sold upon very satisfactory terms, so far as current mar 7 ket values are concerned. I do not refer to cost prices. There will be heavy losses when considering the difference between the purchase price and realization price. That, however, is inescapable. Honourable members may inquire from any establishment, in any branch of business activity, and they will be informed that stocks cannot be sold to-day at the prices at which they were bought during the period which I have under review. percentage of loss ? sible for me to say what the losses will be, but the balance-sheet of the Department will disclose the whole of the business. I do not propose to give the Committee figures which, at the present moment, I am unable to support; but the Government have in Colonel Evans a most able official. This gentleman was formerly a .paymaster in the. Australian Imperial Force, and he had charge of the disposal of materials belonging to the Australian Imperial Force at the termination of hostilities. He has concentrated upon his task, with a small staff, and has already produced magnificent results and considerable savings; and, in fact, he is doing his work altogether satisfactorily. In connection with the whole business aspect, the Commission, and I , personally, have had the advantage of the services of General McCay, who is especially fitted for this class of investigatory work, much of it being of a legal character. This gentleman has given devoted and absolutely concentrated attention to a very difficult job; he has not spared himself",23,Honourable Membebs Hear Hear

The method of disposal, I emphasize, is a carefully organized one. is cognisant of existing trade organizations. Upon the subsidiary Boards are men of the calibre of Mr Jiohn Harrison, of Sydney, who knows all that is to be known about building and about the commercial side of the provision of homes for soldiers; and of Mr William Fletcher, of Perth. I refer to men of ripe experience, who have given their services freely and willingly in an endeavour to put the business side of War Service Homes activities upon a satisfactory footing. In regard to general building operations-thos e we are carrying on to-day, namely, the financing of homes and the preparation of plans, specifications, contracts, and conditionsthe Commission has completely altered its system, and adopted a simplified method more suitable to small units such as soldiers' homes; but it is confronted with the greatest difficulty in endeavouring to have a home built for the soldier under the statutory limit of £800. The cost of building has not come down; on the contrary, it has gone up. Minister instances in which houses which would have cost £1,500 to build a year ago, can be built to-day for £1,250. member, of course, will not attempt to pit his knowledge of the building world against that of experts who have supplied the Commission with figures, and are prepared to stand by them. been building. that you can get the work done at a lower price to-day. statement by saying that the cost of building has not come down in proportion to the general decline in other departments of life. It is to-day very costly to undertake any building. For example, we cannot build a brick house of the standard set by the War Service Homes Commission for the statutory limit of £800. We cannot get contractors to build houses at that price. of the bad name the Department has got. position confronts the well-organized .system of the Victorian State Savings The Disposals Board Bank. It is unable to build in brick today, and is not attempting to do so. A minimum brick house, conforming to the standard set by the War Service Homes Commission, would cost, including land, all services, and all equipment, at least £890, without leaving any profit to the contractor. The figures have been carefully checked. They are based on schedule quantities and at current rates. made for the land ? £75. In the metropolitan area of Melbourne to-day land cannot be got in a decent position at under £3 per foot. I mention these facts because it is unfair to leave the soldiers or the community under the impression that homes can be built at cheap rates. However, we are having trial contracts under two systems. In the first case, in order not to encumber the contractor by loading the contract with supplies, we are calling for tenders where the contractor will supply everything except the land. In the second place we are calling for tenders where we . provide the land and the building material at schedule prices at prime cost, that is to say, at current market values. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts will know from the examinations they have made that it is practically impossible to build a standard house within the statutory limit -The following are the' details of minimum standard brick and minimum standard timber. homes, with the estimated costs of construction :Brick Bomes.

The effect of this re-arrangement will be to vastly reduce the cost to the taxpayers and the soldiers of the homes to be provided in future. I do not know that there are any other features of the building operations with which I need deal at this stage. ' There are some matters that are the subject of current criticism, and upon these the War Service Homes Commission has been judged. The main consideration which should weigh with honourable members, when criticising the War Service Homes Commission, should not be whether Mr Caldwell had, or had not, something which he should have been -allowed to sell to the Government, and that it is thought the Government shoxdd have bought. The operations of the War Service Homes Commission should not be judged on such a statement. AllI wish to say about the matter ' in passing is that the Minister himself will make his own explanation of the Caldwell episode. I had something to do with the Vanikoro Island timber question, subsequently to the occurrences complained of in the press, with which my honourable colleague was connected. Had the negotiations between Caldwell and the Government been completed on the terms placed before us, Caldwell could not have obtained the rights he sought, because they had been bespoken years before by another firm which had 'lodged its application with the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific.

I have also received a telegram from the Secretary of State, from which it appears that the company has appealed to the Colonial Office as well. 3. I find on looking into the earlier records that on application was made by Messrs.

Although no actual undertaking was given to the company, it seems that but for the absence of the plan in question they would in all probability have been granted a lease; and, in the circumstances, I venture to suggest to Your Excellency that it would be equitable if the Commonwealth Government were to afford Mr Fairley an opportunity of explaining his position in the matter, and, if possible, of coming to an understanding. 4.

The matter passed away from me when the Government decided on the evidence before it that Fairley's firm had an equitable and fair claim by reason of an application lodged seven years ago. I wish now to refer briefly to the timber purchases in Victoria and Queensland. They were the subject of investigation by the Public Accounts Committee, which inquired into them exhaustively, and visited the areas concerned, finally reporting that, having regard ta the abnormal conditions existing at the time, the purchase was in the circumstances justified. cism has been published, in this State concerning the terms of the Driver contract.

I say definitely that both in the original and in the reconstructed contract the terms provide for a 10 per cent, reduction on current prices, and that those current prices are, and have been adopted, both by the Commission and by Mr Driver, as the wholesale sawmillers' prices, not the prices of the Timber Merchants Association; that, is, the Government or Commission gets its timber on a wholesale, not on a retail, basis. I refer, m Mr. Driver's case, to what was known as the Nott contract. In Queensland the position is unsatisfactory. I make no comment of any kind on the purchase there-that is not within my provinceI am speaking of the unsatisfactory condition of the m ill has .been analyzed, will not advise the in a; industry generally, which affects the War Service Homes Commission as it does every one else. position is unsatisfactory in this resipect, because I recognise the communal in terests of such places as Beaudesert, Canungra, and Killarney, and it would give the Government the greatest pleasure to be abi* to start the mills, and revivify the districts that live on them. We know well how closely the small v i llages that I have mentioned are connected with the timber industry, and that famiI obtained lies who live in them have been associated with the industry for a lifetime. But the Commission and the Government are confronted with this state of affairs. We hold very large stocks of sawn timber in our depots and at mills in Queensland, and if we recommenced milling operations until we had substantially' 1 reduced those stocks, we should increase our present troubles, and depress the timiber market of the iState, accentuating the present difficulties. [Extension of time granted.] It is the desire of the Government to get clear, as soon as possible, of the business part of the War Service Homes scheme, but we wish to get clear of it without making w i l f u l losses, and without sacrificing the interests of the taxpayers or of the soldiers. Recently the business adviser of the Government in this matter, Major-General MclCay, acA good deal of press criticompanied by a very experienced ,miller, visited Queensland and the timber areas there, saw the residents, went f u l l y into the matter, making a most careful and exhaustive investigation, and, finally, recommended the Government not to resume milling operations.

I regret that. I am unable to state clearly and definitely now a policy regarding these milling areas. They were bought at a time when the Commission believed the timber to bo required. In addition to these areas in Queensland, we'have a running contract with the Yarraman Mills for 6,000,000 feet a year. 0 The selling organization over which General MoCay presides has made some excellent sales of Queensland pine timber. The realization of the Yarraman timber on such sales as have been made shows a substantial profit. It is, however, impossible for me at this stage to define clearly the policy under which these areas w ill be dealt with in the future, or to state what the loss in regard to them will be. The purchase was, in the opinion of the Government, justified at the time it was made, and the investigation of the Accounts Committee' justified it . The Government, however, has a most difficult task in dealing w it h these areas, a far more difficult one than those who criticise the administration can conceive. arrangement under the circumstances prevailing when it was made seemed a good one, and it is too early yet to sav that it was not. A t this stage no one could prove whether it was or was not. That will depend upon two things, first of all, the quantity of timber that w ill ultimately be obtained, and secondly, the price that will be secured for the timber. We can only say that the area comprises what is probably the best timber of its class in the whole of the Commomvealth. D r . EAB LE PAGE -Can say what would have been the loss had Lahey's offer been accepted? at the moment to make an analysis. Realizing that there is a general desire that the Estimates shall be passed to-day, I do not propose to speak at length, more especially as my views with regard to the administration of the War Service Homes Commission have already been placed fully before the Committee. I propose on this occasion only to traverse some of the statements made by the Assistant Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Rodgers). The honourable gentleman frankly admitted that the administration of the War Service Homes Commission had been a bungle from first to last. ment. differ. is malting an improper use of a candid statement. orable gentleman's denial; but, in my opinion, there has never been associated with any Department greater maladministration than has occurred in connection with the War Service Homes Commission. The Minister has tried to gloss over the actual facts, and to make it appear that the Government have little responsibility in the matter. He has told us that the Act provided for the appointment of a Commissioner, who should in t u r n appoint Deputy Commissioners, and that it conferred very wide powers on the Commissioner. He also said that as a matter of policy these positions were confined to returned soldiers. I point out that no such restriction was imposed by the Act. That condition was imposed as a matter of Government policy, and the Government The itself must accept the responsibility for the acts of those whom it appoints to public positions. Lieutenant-Colonel Walker was appointed Commissioner of War Servioe Homes, and according to his own statements, as published in the press, and embodied in circulars addressed to honourable members, he was informed by the Government that he would be expected to carry out the scheme with"" the utmost expedition. He was advised that a very large number of retun?*^ ""ijldieirs desired to acquire homes, ana was told that houses should be built as quicKly as the Minister possible. He was instructed to make the most complete preparations for the expeditious carrying out of the work. Having received these instructions, and, perhaps, being unacquainted with parliamentary procedure, and unaccustomed to the control of so large a Department, he took it for granted that he was to go straight ahead. He laid out his plans accordingly, and commenced by asking the Government for a vote of £10,000,000 to enable him to carry out his programme. That fact has not been mentioned by the Minister. The request for £10,C00,000",33,Robeet Best I T Was Additional Australia By Which The Whole Of The

127,Mr Charlton,"I accept the honwas refused by the Treasurer. The Commissioner was provided with a vote of £7,000,000 , and was given the right to use for the purposes of his building programme the moneys coming in during the year by way of repayments on homes acquired, which, it was estimated, would amount to £800,000. had no promise of £800,000 at that time. Practically no repayments were then being made. able gentleman says that the Commissioner's vote was cut down to £7,000,000 ? member to make his own statement. gentleman missed that point. I am putting the facts as I know them. amount placed at the disposal of the Com-' missioner at the time was £7,800,000. that it was £7,000,000 ? member joined with the rest of the Committee in passing that amount. Minister's statement that the amount placed at the disposal of the Commissioner at the time was only £6,000,000 serves to strengthen my case. The accounts of the Commission had to be certified, and to pass through the Treasury. When the Minister found that in the first four months of the financial year the Commissioner had expended the whole of that £6,000,000 , which was designed to carry him over the whole year, why did he not take action? Is there no responsibility on the part of the Government? patriation cannot attend here to answer for himself, but his reply to the honourable member's question would probably be that he permitted these heavy outgoings in the early part of the year on the promise of the Commissioner that the expenditure for the rest of the financial year would be considerably less. that by October of that year the whole vote had practically been exhausted. November there was practically a cessation of operations. gave a direction in regard to the purchase of already erected houses. many people in New South Wales and also in other States who had entered into contracts with the War Service Homes Commission for the sale of already erected so. He houses found it impossible to obtain payment. The Minister w ill recollect that there was a large number of such cases. When these complaints w,ere brought before the House we were told that there was no money available for the payment of these people-that the vote had been exhausted. A deputation subsequently waited on the ex-Treasurer ( Sir Joseph honourable Cook), and put the position to him, with the result that he promised to carefully The consider it . In January or February of the following year he placed the matter before the Cabinet, and made available It was not. an additional £1,000,000 . Is that not so? It was not. member puts that question to me, I shall say that his statement is not correct. It was I , not the ex-Treasurer, who promised the additional £1,000,000 . The able gentleman admits, after all, that my statement as to £7,000,000 being placed at the disposal of the Commissioner was correct. He says that an additional £1,000,000 was promised, not by the Treasurer, but by himself. All this goes to show that the facts are as I have contended. The Minister cannot cover them up. He might as well make a frank statement. D r. EABLE PAGE -There is not enough earth to keep down the smell. first four months of the financial year the Revote of £6,000,000, which was designed to cover the purposes of the Commission for the whole of the financial year, was expended. Surelyi t was the duty of those who control the public purse to draw the attention of the Commissioner at that time to the fact that he was spending his vote more rapidly than he should. If that was not done, he would naturally form the impression that he was still to go ahead, and that money would be found for him as required. He would assume that if , for instance, he could build, within the year, so many thousand homes, and that In the month of they would cost, say, £10,000,000, the Government, in view of its request to h i m",34,Robeet Best I T Was Additional Australia By Which The Whole Of The

146,Mr Charlton,"Quite so. In theto expedite the carrying out of the scheme, would make available the additional amount. That is where the trouble occurred. I am not going to say that the job was not too big for the Commissioner. Whatever might have been his impression as to the authority conferred upon him, there was certainly an obligation on the part of the Government to draw his attention to the rapid way in which he was exhausting the funds placed at his disposal. As I have said, his accounts had to pass through the Treasury, and he should have been told that no more money would be available for his work during the financial year. The Government cannot escape their responsibility in this matter. Then, again, we find the Assistant Minister putting up another smoke screen. He says that the day-labour system is responsible for the delay in advising the soldiers of the cost of their homes. A bald statement of that kind would lead one to believe that the day-labour system was responsible for the fact that returned men who have been in occupation of War Service Homes from twelve to eighteen months are yet unable to ascertain what they have to pay for them. The soldiers will think that the day-labour system is responsible for the trouble. statement. gentleman made it, not once, but on three different occasions, and on the third occasion I interjected. adopted the contract system in preference to the day-labour system in order that a soldier might know at once what his home was going to cost. gentleman said that the Commission was unable to state the cost of houses built by day labour. The only inference to be drawn from his statement was that this was due to some fault in the day-labour system. As a matter of fact, men who for nearly two years have been living in War Service Homes built by day labour, have not been advised as to what they have to pay for them. Will any one say that the fault rests with the day-labour system ? When a job has been completed, the cost, under any proper business system, should be known within a reasonable time. For what purpose are the officers of the Commission employed? Is it not expected of them that they shiill have a proper costing system, so that tiie cost of building a home may be readily determined? The trouble in this regard is due, not to the day-labour system, but to the absolute lack of system shown in connection with the building of the group houses on which day labour was chiefly employed. The Commission did not give the men a constant supply of materials. If honourable members were employing men on day labour, would they expect them to put on their coats and go home if the material for their use was not available as required ? These men have wives and families to support, and those respon"" sible for the carrying out of the building of group houses should have seen that there was a regular supply of building material. As it was, in many cases, great delay occurred. The men on the job had to be paid, and the soldiers suffered bocause of these delays. we should adopt the contract system? many failures in connection with the contract system. has been lost by the contract system. lost in connection with contracts that had to be determined. rests not with the day-labour system, but with the administration of the service. The Minister should have admitted frankly that the Commission has never been on a proper footing. The whole thing has been bungled from beginning to end. the purchase of land. were purchased in every State. suitable areas. Mir. CHARLTON -Quite so.

Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. of the Committee. [Quorum formed.] Rodgers) has enunciated a new policy. He announced this morning that the Government will endeavour to build homes by contract, the Commission to find the material where desired. The implication is that, if conditions are acceptable to the Commission some contractors will be permitted to find their own supplies, while others will be carrying on with materials furnished direct by the Commission. the system a trial. permitting certain contractors to furnish their own materials is almost sure to bring about certain results. There will be "" nothing doing,"" so far as concerns the timber mills controlled by the Government. Those forest areas, and the mills therein, will have to be closed. On the other hand, if the Commissioner is to find the material for contractors, the mills will be utilized. Now, seeing that the Government have purchased the timber areas, I hold that they will not be justified in launching the new venture, the effect of which must be to put a stop to activities at the Government ""mills. The Minister has stated that, on account of the cessation of operations during the past few months, there are large quantities of timber on hand in the forest areas. A Disposals Board has been appointed. It is to be given authority to sell surplus stock, upon which, the Minister has admitted, there must be heavy losses. the utilization requirements of the Commission. the event of the success of the system by which contractors are to furnish their own supplies, will be infinitesimal. There will be no need to keep the forest areas going. I can see further bungling ahead. Considerable public money has been spent on the areas; large contracts have been entered into. The Driver contract is a very considerable one. The Commission is required to pay Mr Driver at the rate of 10 per cent, less than market values for the timber which he supplies, and a certain sum is to be deducted per 100 super, feet in order to repay to the Commonwealth the amount spent in purchasing the forest areas on which Mr Driver is working. What is to become of those stand ? He has his contract. If the Commission takes no more timber from him is it not likely that litigation will be precipitated? Is it not probable that the Commonwealth authorities will be faced with considerable costs? If Mr Driver went to law he would probably find that he had a good case. supply from that source be made one of .the conditions of permitting contractors to furnish their own materials? no such suggestion has been made. More than sufficient blunders have occurred in the past. considered over and over again. There has been no blunder here. imminent danger of another blunder. It is not my intention-and I am sure that it is not that of the party which I have the honour at present to lead-to accept any more responsibility for further bungling in respect of War Service Homes. The Government must take the responsibility. can no longer shelter themselves behind the day-labour system, behind the late Commissioner, behind incapable minor officials. The Minister mentioned this morning that the stocks in hand which will be turned over to the Disposals Board are worth about £750,000. The Board is to get rid of that value of material. of utilization and realization, keeping always in mind the requirements of the Commission. realize by selling the stocks.

The only reason why they have retained office has been because the press and a large section of the public fear that, if a change is made, men from this side would occupy the Treasury bench, men in whom those influential factors have no confidence. Because they have not approved of this party, they have felt , themselves justified in maintaining in office Ministers who cannot shirk responsibility for maladministration. What is to be said concerning our obligations to the returned soldiers to whom we promised so much? For they must pay for the bungling. faulty system, add to the cost of a humble workinan's home while he is struggling to maintain a young and growing family, where will he be landed ?

Charlton. Mr .CHARLTON -Yes. Action was taken by the cessation of all building operations, but nothing was done. rect statement. nothing I say is correct. I am sorry that I have not the time that I would like to argue this matter out with the Minister. It is nearly twelve months since the War Service Homes scheme fell to pieces, and we. had to cease building operations. Since then some mills have been producing timber, and the timber has been stacked in different parts of the Commonwealth. We have now a 'proposiI f the Government, by a tion put forward to dispose of that tim ber. But what has been the complaint in connection with the building of houses ? That, in the first few months, when we were rushing things, green timber was used and put into the homes, where it shrank to such an extent Through ill-health, that a finger could easily be in serted in the cracks in the walls. Now we have a quantity of timber which has been stacked for some time; it is fairly seasoned, and we are sending out agents on his to t r y to dispose of it . If we get r i d of it in this way, it simply means that we must again give the soldier green timber I shall in his home. This seasoned timber should notrbe disposed of, but should be put into the soldiers' homes. There is much to be said against the new policy just propounded. Honourable members are not justified in adopting it . If this Parliament did its duty it would afford no f u r ther opportunity for bungling, but would take control of the matter in a thorough way, and send about its business a Government which have been responsible for this maladministration, giving some other party the opportunity of showing whether I say that that is. not a it cannot put the administration of War Service Homes into better shape.

I hope to be able to expose in more detail than the Minister has given us the opportunity of hearing, the unsuccessful manner in which repatriation matters have been handled, particularly in the building of War Service Homes. I propose, also, to point out some of the losses suffered not only by the soldiers themselves, but also by the various Governments of Australia, ( who, after all, really represent the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. I shall endeavour to show that, although in some instances the value of the homes built for the soldiers may be reduced to £700 or £800, as the case may be, that sum may still not be the intrinsic value of the home, owing to various charges which should not have been incurred, being i m posed by the methods adopted by the Commission. I propose to demonstrate that the soldier is not being given a f a i r deal through being asked to pay these charges, and that the alleged value is not in ' the home, and I hope to secure terms for h i m which, at any rate, will give him something like a f a i r deal. I trust that what I say will move the Committee to demand that the unjustified and unjustifiable drain that the War Service Homes administration has been on the resources of the Commonwealth shall stop, and that no more money shall be allowed to go down that particular sink so uselessly and so wastefully. The first step to that end w ill be to fix the reof absentee soldiers and put in crops sponsibility for the whole conduct of the Department, not on some outside Commission, or on some one outside this House, but on a Minister who is able to take his f u l l share of it , and who ehould not be able to come here and confess that all sorts of bungling has occurred in his Department, and that money has been spent in all sorts of ways beyond his knowledge. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has just pointed out that apparently £6,000,000 No was spent in four months, although it represented provision for the whole year. were not correct. whatever the amount was, the fact remains that the total provision for the year was spent in four or five months, and, after a certain date, there was no money available for the building of homes. When the Minister says that he has no control over the Commissioner, because an Act of Parliament deprives him of it , he surely forgets that this Parliament looks to him, as the responsible person through whom the money voted by the House goes, to see that the interests of the people of Australia are preserved. In this regard the whole of the administration of repatriation reflects great discredit on the various Governments of Australia. I know that it was a herculean problem, but it was one that presented a wonderful opportunity, which we did not avail ourselves of, for mobilizing the national spirit of Australia. In view of the amount of money we proposed to spend, and which, in fact, we have spent up to the present time, we had a wonderful opportunity of giving a new stimulus to industry and a new direction to settlement. On the one hand, the men who fought so gallantly and nobly on the other side of the world came back to us with a high spirit of determination to do the best they could for their country; and, on the other hand, we had a generous appreciation on the part of the people of Australia of the work those men had done, and a determination to give them the best possible deal. This determination was evidenced in many districts, such as my own, by bands of men going out as working bees to work on the farms which would be available for them on their return. That was the spirit in which, as a whole nation, we should have faced the problem of repatriation; but, unfortunately for our intentions",39,Robeet Best I T Was Additional Australia By Which The Whole Of The

Holding the purse strings as it did, and supplying became one of the most progressive the money, it could have insisted on a greater measure of co-operation, which might have spared us such things as have happened in New South Wales and Queensland, where men have been settled on farms shown to be really a saltwater marsh, or at spots like Beerburrum, where hundreds of soldiers have been compelled to leave their farms in despair. prevent these cases when the States have ful l control of the land. money; we have provided £27,000,000 up to the present in connection with land settlement, and surely the Commonwealth should have had some say in seeing that the men got something like a fair deal. I am pleased to see that the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) is now supporting, in connection with immigration, a scheme on exactly similar lines to those which could have been adopted in regard to repatriation. Many schemes which were put forward by people who were interested in the question could have been carried out in a national and comprehensive way. For instance, I put before the Premier of New 'South Wales a scheme that would have settled 50,000 soldiers on the northern rivers of the State, and transformed several millions of acres of unused fertile land into productive districts, and liberal treatment, it would have been provided a continually'increasing national asset. It was brought down to Melbourne and submitted to a Conference of State Ministers, convened by the Minister for Repatriation ('Senator E. D. Millen). Unfortunately, the influenza epidemic brought body of men, but the greater proportion that Conference to an untimely close, and I supposed that a great deal of the trouble generosity. that subsequently arose from the failure to carry out what was definitely determined upon at that Conference as repatriation off of those proceedings. Here, however, we had an opportunity which we could have availed ourselves of, and in regard have accrued -were missed. to which the Commonwealth had plenty of warning. Projects were put forward which, had they been carried into effect, would have 'added new provinces to Australia, and led to dense settlement, Revolutionary War, when 4,000 soldiers, of good calibre, were settled in one State, Ohio, which, by their efforts, in the Union. I do .not wish to labour this phase of the question, but merely to point out how regrettable it is that we should have lost the opportunity that presented itself. 'In view of certain matters that we have in our minds, perhaps it is, after all, a good thing that the administration passed in part out of our hands into those of the State Governments, for we seem to have made a considerable bungle of the work we retained. As to war pensions it would, in my opinion, have paid us to act in a more generous way. We now see men refused this right on the most trivial grounds, frequently on the quibble that the injuries are not war injuries, but are due to some other cause. This is a kind of administration that the National Parliament should resent and alter. I know of one man, blind in both eyes, who, after three years' service, was sent back as medically unfit; and, because he presented a nervous state which was suspected to have 'arisen from syphilis, he was refused a pension. Even now, when it is known that such was not the cause of his illness, and that it was due to cerebral tumour, he has no pen-' sion, and is compelled to live on the charity of friends. There are dozens of such cases. Eveni f it had involved extra expenditure to give our returned soldiers money well spent, for then there would have been an absence of that sense of grievance which now prevails in almost every part of the Commonwealth. No doubt there are malingerers in every big of the returned men are worthy of our The administration of the War Service Homes is a work that the Commonwealth kept entirely in its own hands.

A t any rate, this Commissioner was appointed deliberately by the Government, with a f u l l knowledge of the facts of the position. The practice had arisen, even during the war, of appointing highly-paid officials, in an effort to transfer to them bhe responsibility which really attached to the Government, and, unfortunately, at the same time, Parliament also lost its control over administration. The fact remains, however, that, after all, the Ministeri n charge had complete financial control, and, therefore, he cannot escape the responsibilty for supervision of the Commissioner. eight months ago the Minister described in this House the way in which the Commissioner had conducted the business of his office, and told us that he had continued to build houses for sums in excess of the legal warrant. The Minister went on to say that the Commissioner had been doing this for many months; in deed, I think the honourable gentleman told us that the Commissioner had continued doing so for two years. made the statement in reply to a question. However, if the Commissioner conducted himself in such a way, why d i d not the Government discharge him ? As we know, the Government did discharge the Commissioner, but it was not because he was incompetent, but because he had been made insolvent seven years before, or five years before he was appointed. was discharged, so long as he was' discharged ? Dr. EARLEPAGE I think the House should have been given definite reasons for his discharge, and then the Government would have been able to take the f u l l responsibilty off its own was discharged because of some technical fault in his appointment, we are rendered helpless. During the whole work of the War Service Homes Commission there seems to have been a lack of coordination-n o definite scheme of preparation. A t the beginning a tentative arrangement w i th the Commonwealth Bank was suggested; and, if my memory is right, the evidence given before the Public Accounts Committee shows that the Minister interviewed the manager of that Bank and discussed the position with him. An agreement was then arrived at that all the homes required should be built by the Bank, which should finance the scheme, leaving the Government to decide the eligibility of the applicants, the purchase of land, and the general lines of policy. If such an arrangement had been made from the beginning, and adhered i to, I venture to say that, as experience has shown, we should have escaped much muddle, confusion, and loss. Althoughi t is true that some of the houses built by the Bank have given rise to complaint, it has Some seven or secured the erection of an enormous number of satisfactory houses, and has always kept the average cost below £ 7 0 0 , which was the maximum originally fixed. If we had stuck to that arrangement, we should have saved £ 1 0 0 on each house; but, unfortunately, the Government departed from it , and started negotiations with the various State Savings Banks. Later on the Government went again to the Commonwealth Bank; but it was found that, owing to the completed negotiations, the work had to be redistributed. Subsequently, the W a r Service Homes Commission determined to build homes on its own account in addition. In connection with the appointment of the War Service Homes Commissioner, there are matters that call for explanation and comment, especially in view of the absence of any reasons beyond the technical one to which I have referred for his dismissal.

Millen) was unaware of the fact that the Commissioner was insolvent at the time of his appointment; but the facts, as stated by the Assistant Minister( Mr Rodgers) in June of this year, do not bear out that view. That honourable gentleman pointed out that applications were invited, and the late Commissioner applied, and was appointed to the position. Before he was appointed, the Minister for Repatriation, in order to obtain some information as to his eligibility, caused three telegrams of inquiry to be sent to different men of standing in Australia. Three replies were received to these inquiries, two of.them favorable, and the thir d as follows: Your telegram yesterday. Party is brave and energetic.

In this case, the telegram stated first that the applicant was a builder, good for outside work, but no good as an administrator, and that he was an insolvent. According to the estimate of the Government itself, the expenditure upon War Service Homes would run asked to believe that the Ministeri n charge, who had the appointment of the man who would control this expenditure, did not bother to see the replies to the telegrams he had sent asking for credentials. We can only conclude either that the Minister was culpably negligent received appointments here? in regard to the matter, or that he knew at the time that the Commissioner was an back from Europe because they were not insolvent.

I admit at once that no ordinary man could have handled it successfully; and I agree with the contention already urged here to-day that this House erred in the beginning when it fixed a salary of £1,500 for a man who was to ultimately expend £50,000.000 within ten years. At that salary, the Government could not expect to have such a wide field of selection as they would have had if a greater inducement had been offered. Government are no more responsible than is Parliament itself. But, unfortunately, there seems to have beeu a continuous succession of unsatisfactory appointments. In one instance, we are told that the appointee ""is a good outside man, able to handle men, but may not be much of an adioinistrator."" credit of any man to say that he has some qualifications and not others. each of the States Deputy Commissioners were appointed who were not qualified for the joh Eodgers) read to the Committee to-day a list of the officers in each State, and in practically every State there have been at least four Deputy Commissioners, whilst in Tasmania there have been six or seven.

[Extension of time granted!] that they were all dismissed on account of incompetence. months of the creation of the Commission, it came into conflict with the Commonwealth Bank, apparently for no other Whatever reason than that the Bank was getting Walker's military through its work expeditiously and well. If there was any other reason, I should like to hear it. After a certain date, the Bank was practically debarred from carrying on its work in connection with War Service Homes. On 28th June, 1920, the Minister for Bepatriation (Senator E. D. Millen) is reported in the Melbourne Argus to have stated that 767 homes had been completed, and of those the Commonwealth Bank had built 731, and the Commissioner 36-that in spite of the fact that the Commission had been operating for three or four months longer than tbe Commonwealth Bank. That friction For that limitation, the between the Bank and the Commissioner had a most unfortunate result on the whole of the operations undertaken since. Originally it was agreed that the Commissioner should build on the group system, and that the Bank should undertake the building of isolated homes. But after a time it became difficult for any applicant It is not to the diswhose house was to be built by the Bank to get a certificate of eligibility from the In Department within anything like a reasonable time, and many who had approved of the Bank's design and were preThe Assistant Minister( Mr pared to enter into a contract with it for the erection of a home, were actually canvassed, when they applied for their certificates of eligibility, to have their work carried out by the Commissioner. That, in itself, was not a serious matter if other things had been equal. But the Commonwealth Bank had at its disposal a great staff and a high degree of Not only does there seem to organization, whereas the Commission was only building up its staff. The Bank and its architects were able to keep in continuous, touch with the contractors, each of whom had his small organization and gang of regular workers. The result was that the Bank had no difficulty in getting tenders for jobs, and was able always to build under the £700 originally fixed by this House as the maximum amount that should be available for each, home. The Commissioner, on the other hand, largely because of the fact that, necessarily, at the beginning, his staff was not skilled or well trained, appointed inspectors who were very inquisitorial, and who interfered so much with the contractors that after a time few would continue their jobs. I have met in Sydney a man who claimed",43,Wotic Resulted From The Untimely Cutting

209,Dr. Eaele Page,"Within eighteento be tbe only contractor who finished a group of houses for the Commissioner. AH other contract jobs were thrown up because the contractors could get no satisfaction. Then the Commissioner decided to embark upon the day-labour system, and he drafted a huge building programme, which necessitated the acquisition of tremendous stores of material. He bought millions of feet of timber, millions of bricks, hundreds of baths, and so on, until his operations created a shortage of building materials, and the price of building rose, not only against the soldiers, but against everybody who wanted to erect a house. Instead of getting the contractors to look after the construction work, he entered into competition with them, and had to pay more than the award rates in order to keep workmen on the jobs. This made labour more difficult to get, and, because the Commissioner did not, as an ordinary business man would have done, and as the Commonwealth Bank and the State instrumentalities in South Australia, Western Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland do-arrang e for their supplies in the ordinary business way-h e found it increasingly difficult to get building material, and so commenced to force up the prices. The operations of the Commissioner constitute one of the principal reasons why building has been so expensive in recent years. He purchased huge quantities of material. All over the country, depots were established, and because it was impossible to keep them under proper supervision much of the material deteriorated through exposure to weather, and quantities of it were stolen. Two or three months ago one could see at Concord millions of bricks which had been acquired by the Commissioner. A t Belmore enamel baths were being used by boys for wickets. losses were occurring by the continual securing eligibility certificates.

Not only was there f r i c without his approval. some explanation as to how it was possible there came about friction between the for the Commissioner to expend hundreds of thousands of pounds without the approval of the Minister. When this Parliament increased the maximum per house to £800 the Commonwealth Bank received instructions that it was to sign no more contracts. It had s h o w that it could build cheaper than the Commissioner to the extent of from £100 to £200 per house. It had always built below the maximum of £700, and often was producing a better house than the Comm. '-v.er built for a larger amount. The Commissioner having declared that he could not build a house for £700, Parliament increased the amount to £800. As socn as that was done, the organization-the Commonwealth Bank-whic h up to that time, had buil t hundreds of homes more than any other author it y in the Commonwealth, was told that it could sign no more contracts. I should like an explanation as to why that organization, which belongs to the Commonwealth, which conducts its operations for the benefit of the country, and whose profits belong to the Australian people, was debarred from undertaking further War Service Homes work. I do not know whether there is any other reason than that they have done the job in such a way that they have put the other organizations to shame. which the Governor of the Bank could be prevented from doing it . give h i m any contracts.

The saw-milling operations of the Commission deserve a great deal more light than the Minister has shed on them. It has been said that because certain purand hauled to the station and utilized chases have been re-sold to Mr Driver, they must possess .the value given for them.

He was not content to buy one big proposition, and bought two. He bought these two big propositions in Queensland without regard to the fact that he had made a contract under which he was supplied with 6,000,000 feet of timber a year. He bought at a time when it would have been possible for him to enter into an agreement with practically any of the sawmillers for supplies at rates about 10 per cent, lower than those charged to the general public, and such an agreement would not have compelled him to find any capital. tough t huge tracts of timber conn try in Queensland, and timber mills, and took nil the risks of the saw-milling business, when he could have made a contract at rates which would have slid up and down with market prices. He bought timber propositions which, in my opinion, the Government will be lucky to get rid of even at considerable loss. I said last year that, if it could get Mr Lahey to take his proposition back, with £50,000 to boot, it would do better than by conThen he sudtinuing to hold it. The reason given for purchasing these properties was that, if the price of timber continued as high as it was at the time-whe n it was at its peak-and if the timber was there that was said to be there, and were all cut within ten years, the saving would be just about equivalent to the interest on the money invested and at risk during Is it not a fact that the whole period. But what has happened ? Having bought these properties, the Commission came to an arrangement with Messrs. Lahey, who were patriotic men, to continue working the mills and keep' them in order. There were certain settlements in their immediate neighbourhood which it was desired to maintain by providing constant employment for the. workers residing in them. But, having allowed the mills to be worked for a couple of months, the Commissioner shut them down, and they have been idle ever since. The logs were not pulled in from the bush, nor was much of the sawn timber that was there sold or utilized. have been sold. been sold at a considerable loss, in view of what they were worth when cut eighteen months ago. fortunately, a good deal of experience with pine saw-milling, and I know that if a log is left lying for six months in the bush, the greater part of its value is destroyed by the borer. This proposition could have been sold satisfactorily four or five months ago, but apparently the Minister has turned down the offer. I have asked what would have been lost had the sale taken place, and I think that But instead of doing that, he members should have that information. I am satisfied that the longer we keep these propositions the greater will be tbe loss in connection with them.

For the sake of the financial position of the Commonwealth I would have liked the Government to accept an offer foil both propositions, even though it showed no profit, or, indeed, a loss of £25,000 or £50,000. What is going to be the futur e of the propositions? Are we going to hold them indefinitely ? Is the National Government to become a saw-miller, or is it going to get out of the business at the earliest passible moment? One aspect of the timber question which has been a good deal ventilated in the press is the offer of Mr Caldwell of certain properties in the Islands. I think that the Minister rather missed the point on which Mr Caldwell has been insisting, which is that his bona fides have been impugned in a certain report which was put before Parliament. Whether he was or was not the actual holder of an option, unquestionably he appeared to hold it , not merely in his own estimation, but also in that of the Resident Commissioner. holder of an option. Dr. EARLE PAGE -He certainly appeared to be the holder of one, and it is very unusual for the recommendation of a Resident Commissioner in the South Seas to be passed over as was this recommendation. A definite recommendation was over-ridden by the H i g h Commissioner for the Western Pacific.

As a land buyer he seems to have suffered fro m a form of megalomania, and bought four times I ana speaking as much land as he has been able to build on. There has been practically a land boom during the last few years, and, therefore, much of the land was bought at very high prices, and a great deal of what has been bought, and some of that which is being b u i l t on, is very unsatisfactory. member say the number of allotments now available ? 2,302 acres were bought, and that 632 acres have been buil t on. ments of those bought remain unbuilt on. member say that the price of land has gone down ? that ; I sa.y that the land was bought at the top of the market in many cases, and unnecessarily ahead of requirements, and that in many instances it is totally unsuitable. For example, land purchased near Newcastle is converted into a swamp whenever an inch of rain falls, and other not the land, some of which has been built on, was the subject of mining concessions, which have had to be bought out at a cost greater than the original price of the land.

The Commissioner adopted the system It is the case, of building houses in groups, under which nuite a number were in course of construction at the same time and at the same stage. The result was that if , during the early stages of construction, rain fell, all the men had to knock off work-ther e was no work under shelter for them to do-and the building costs to the soldiers were thus increased.

In addition, much of the theft of material that took place during the building of these large groups would have been avoided. It is impossible to induce returned men to take over many of these group houses. They say that a group of thirty or forty houses allmuch of the one type of construction suggests to them an internment camp. They do not want to live in groups. They have had enough of the war, and they do not want to be reminded of it . The cost of building many of the group houses is so much in excess of their actual value that they will not be taken over by the soldiers, these homes. I understand that in Vicwith the result that they are either vacant or are being rented by civilians. I do not think it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to provide homes for civilians throughout Australia. There are other directions in which we could more profitably employ our funds. Then, again, the method of construction adopted in building many of the group houses, as well as individual houses, has been such that competent valuers consider them to be worth considerably less than their actual cost/ I have the opinion of practically a hundred builders who made an investigation, and who state that the market value of a number of War Service Homes in New South Wales to-day is, at the very most, £600, although none of them cost less than £800 to build.

[Extension of time granted-] I have here statement after statement, made on oath, .regarding the cost of certain War Service Homes and their market value at the present time, which is considerably less than the cost of building, and considerably more than the estimate. Another complaint is that the cost in numerous cases has largely exceeded the original estimate supplied to the applicant. This has resulted in great hardship to the soldiers who have had the ill-fortune to take possession. In many instances they find it most difficult to make the repayments on the basis of the increased cost. Some of the men have actually had to be ejected, while in other cases applicants have said that it is useless for them to take over toria there is not one War Service Home built by the Commission the cost of which is actually known by the men. I understood the Minister to say that, until the cost can be ascertained, the occupiers are in possession as tenants. ber is referring to occupiers of War Service Homes at Bell and Coburg, where a tenants' association has been formed, I have only to say that those soldiers have had the benefit of a Ministerial statement to the effect that they can acquire their homes at the statutory limit.

The expenditure on the construction of homes in each State has been on an enlistment basis. the honourable land held by the Commission, even if it be correct as stated by the Minister that only 1,000 allotments are held than 1,000 allotments available for building purposes in excess of the requirements of the War Service Homes Commission. honourable gentleman mean by "" in excess of requirements "" ? serve, roughly speaking, 1,000 allotments as against the thousands of applicants for homes that have been received. know what is the acreage of the land held by the Commission?

If it should be considered that, in any one of the States, there are too many jobs to be let to one contractor, that State should be divided into sections-north , south, east, and west-and tenders called accordingly. is recommending what has been done. There has been a cessation of building under the day-labour system. No day labour building job has been let sinoe the Government's announcement of policy. day-labour job proceeding at all ? to the finishing off of just a few which had been started in that manner. to finish them on such a system as would afford an accurate knowledge of when their completion might be expected, and of what their cost would be. It is notorious that many buildings have been in hand for almost a year; I understand that some have been in course of construction for even longer. I know, personally, of one house which has been waiting for several months or more to be roofed. The large stocks of materials of all I was just about kinds on hand should be sold at public auction at the best price obtainable, and the losses written off. All contracts entered into for the supply of material should be terminated on the best possible terms. Estates which have been purchased and have not yet been built upon Administration at present is should be sold by public auction. The soldier, after all, has a right to some consideration concerning where he shall reside. I do not believe in group settlements; the soldiers themselves disapprove of the principle, at any rate, in large groups. It should be possible to create a land purchase sub-department to deal with the question of buying, and to inspect separate blocks. I repeat that any estates on hand and not yet built upon should be disposed of without delay. The forests which have been purchased by the Comtime and other conditions of the sale might well be l e f t to the discretion of a competent head, so that there would be This official should be as little loss as possible. These are the main lines on which I suggest the reconstruction of the Department as regards present commitments. My proposals, if accepted, would permit the muddle to Tenders should be be cleaned up, and a fresh start made. The continuance of the Government in saw-milling activities is bound to result in further loss. All over Australia there are the white wrecks of dismantled mills. Everywhere there are broken firms. It would often appear that the larger the amount of capital behind these saw-milling concerns the greater has been the mess, for saw-milling requires personal supervision in order to insure success. I maintain that the obligations of the Government to the returned soldier must be fulfilled . Arrangements have been made, I understand, w it h the Governments of South Australia and Western Australia whereby the W a r Service Homes required in those States are to It would be well be built in conjunction with the Workers' Homes Departments already existing there. Presumably, the Federal Government will continue to carry out the building of homes for soldiers in the remaining four States.

There should be a competent Commissioner, given ful l power and authority. In eaqh State an Eligibility Department should be formed which would examine the claims of applicants. If these were found satisfactory, a certificate should be issued entitling the with the supervision of the erection of applicants to the benefits conferred by the Act. A Land Department should be created This organization would deal with transfers of land, the purchase of 'single building sites, and the transaction of legal matters. is aware, of course, that there is already a legal section actively at work. be created under the title of the Purchase and Mortgage Department. This would supervise the purchase of already erected houses, and deal -with the settling of mortgages and the like. In my view, the purchase of existing houses should be restricted as much as possible. should be a Designing Department, in charge of a competent architect, and in each State competitive designs should be invited from returned soldier architects and others. I suggest that these designs should comprise twenty-four types of houses, suitable for the particular State in which they are to be built. Professional experience has proved that the maximum number of designs necessary does not exceed twelve for city houses and twelve for country types. The designs should b© judged by competent adjudicators before being accepted by the Department, and a substantial premium should be offered for the best batch of debeen proved, even by the experience of signs, the Department having the power to select the twenty-four best from among the total number submitted. With respect to the Building Department, I submit that, after a'soldier has selected a design, tenders should be called for the construction of the house. Before a tender is accepted the soldier should be given an opportunity to express his approval or otherwise of the conditions, so that, prior to finally approving, he would know exactly what the cost would be. It is a scandal that, at the present time, many soldiers who, for months, have occupied homes built by the Commission, do not yet know what th6 ultimate cost will be. Contracts should be proceeded with If the latter immediately after tenders have been accepted. Supervision might, well be carried on by the whole of the architects in the various States. This could be easily accomplished by the medium of the Institutes of Architects. The institutes should submit to the Government names of the various qualified architects in the different States, and the work in connection houses could then be portioned among them. Upon the certificate of the particular architect selected to supervise a home, the Government would pay the contractor. Architects should receive commission, to be agreed upon between the Government and the institutes. The institutes would be required and agreeable, no doubt, to accept responsibility for adequate supervision; this would insure that the work would be properly and thoroughly carried out. It would be accepted, doubtless, as a matter of honour, that the institutes should see that construction proceeded in a thoroughly satisfactory manner;'and the cost There would not be nearly so great as if the Government were obliged to engage individual competent architects and pay them the usual professional fees. Finally, I emphasize that a scheme such as that which has been outlined can only be carried out on the tender principle. Soldiers', homes must in every instance be built by contract. There is no other satisfactory method of dealing with a scheme of such magnitude-on e involving, as it does, activities scattered all over the country. That the day-labour system does not work satisfactorily has the Queensland Labour Government, which decided, only a short while ago, to substitute the contract system for the day-labour principle in respect to the building of homes under the State housing scheme. The costs of administration under the day-labour system are far greater than when Avork is done by contract. The administrative staff has to include bookkeepers, checkers, timekeepers, storemen, officers to select materials, and many other officials.

I have always regarded facility which such a measure affords to the working of the parliamentary chine, but I believe that it is one that should be brought into use only by a deliberate vote of both Houses of the Legislature, and by making it the law of the nation.

I wish to preface my remarks by reminding the House that it is only a little while ago that, acting under the instruction of the Committee of Public Accounts, I made a statement in defence of iSenator Millen against what we believed to be entirely unwarranted insinuations. I say this because I am entirely opposed to the suggestion of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), and I desire very briefly to give my reasons. It is noticeable that the suggestion that Senator Millen should be heard in this Chamber is made by the Prime Minister because of certain statements made by another Minister. If there is any difference of that 'kind amongst Ministers, it should be settled by themselves in Cabinet. is quite wrong.

342,Mr Fowler,"I understood the Minister for Repatriation, it was necessary to hear a statement of the case from Senator Millen's point of view. ever, to come to the general principle, it opinion, our soldiers ihad been robbed of, has happened occasionally, I believe, that persons guilty of offences against Parliament, or against a particular Chamber, have been called to the Bar and reproved. That is a practice which has much antiquity behind it, aud to which I cannot object; but it is a principle of our representative government that no persons shall take part in a debate in this Chamber, or influence its conclusions in any way, except .those who have been sent 'here by the direct mandate of the constituencies. I object also to the suggestion that, even occasionally, a person of standing, as was instanced by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) as occurring in the State of Victoria, might come to the Bar of a Chamber and give his views on certain questions. That is a very grave practice to establish, in view of the danger that an eloquent orator may seriously mislead the deliberations of those who have been sent to Parliament from the constituencies. On that point I take my stand, along with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), against the establishment of a precedent which I believe to be txnconstitutional and undemocratic, and likely to lead to grave difficulties, 'and dangers in the future. ister and Attorney-General) [4.34] -In view of the opinions that have been ex. pressed, it is idle for me to press my suggestion that Senator Millen be heard, either on the floor or at the Bar of the House. I , therefore, withdraw the proposal. In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed, vide page 13583) : Division 156 (Bepatriation Commission), £2,529,429. I feel sure that members of the House, and the public outside, when they read the speeches made to-day by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), and the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page), will say that there ought to be a thorough investigation into the [542]-2 matter that we are now discussing. On the 13th May of this year, wishful toHowknow the amount of money that, in my I asked this questionWhat is the total amount claimed by the Kirkpatrick firm of architects for fees respecting plans for returned soldiers' homes? The reply wasThe claims submitted to date for preparation of plans, specifications, and supervision of construction total £44,535. We have been told by the Leader of the Country party that there are twelve standardized plans for the cities, and twelve for the country; and I am confident that such plans could be obtained for, at most, £500. Mr Nahum Barnet, one of the best architects in Victoria, whose name is known all over Australia, has, to my knowledge, prepared plans much more difficult than those for soldiers' homes, and accepted £20 as a fee. At such a rate we could obtain twenty-five plans for £500. I maintain that the Kirkpatrick firm has robbed the soldiers of Australia; and I may say that one of the leading men of the firm was of the necessary age, but never went to the Front. Why do I speak so severely? No trade union or other body of men showed so much loyalty to the British race as did the organization of the architects. When those architect soldiers returned to Melbourne, they were given a reception, and each of the gentlemen who organized that reception had to take two guests. Never has any trade union or ""any other body set such a splendid example. Do honourable members think for a moment that if some of these loyal architects had been asked to prepare the plans they, would have robbed the soldiers of £44,000? And why was such an. amount of money paid ? I accuse Sir Denison Miller, the manager of the Commonwealth Bank, of favouring his blood relatives, or relatives by ' marriage-that is how this infamy was perpetrated. Ask any architect if such fees are reasonable. There is not the slightest doubt that, at any rate, twelve standardized plans could have been, got for £500. I do not blame the Assistant Minister( Mr Rodgers), as that gentleman well knows', but somebody mint be to blame. I have never yet been ablet to ascertain the relationship between Sir Denison Miller, the manager of the Coni-i monwealth Bank, and the Kirkpatriek",57,Chapman H E Is An I Am Taking Advantage Of The Liberty That

344,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [4.35],"firm, and we are still ignorant of the extent of the infamy. I say, advisedly, that if ever there was a clear case of nepotism this appears to be one. tion I asked wasWhat is tiie total sum paid to this firm for such plans? The reply wasI t is understood that the Commonwealth Bank has made certain payments to the architects mentioned in respect of these claims, but, so far, the claims between the Bank and the Commission have not been adjusted. I do not know whether there has been an adjustment yet. The manager of the Commonwealth Bank ought to be under the control of this Parliament, for, in the words of the late Lord Forrest, "" h e has too much power."". Even the ex-TreaBurer( Sir Joseph Cook) acknowledged, in 1 this chamber, that he had no controli n other words, that Sir Denison Miller can do almost whatever he pleases. So much for that infamy. The Institute of Victorian Architects and the kindred bodies in the other States, if they had been applied to, would gladly have provided plans; but this big Kirkpatrick .firm, boosted in monetary power by the manager of the Commonwealth Bank, has taken advantage of the returned soldiers. As to the suggestion made by the Prime Minister, I regard the custom of calling people to the Bar as an idiotic one, dating from almost primeval times; but there is no great difference between the Bar and the Table. bered that the great Cobbett, for some aspersions on the British Parliament, was made to kneel down at the Bar and tender a humble apology. However, he was man enough to remark, as he Tose and dusted his knees, ' ' I always said this was a dirty House,"" and thus he got level. Such an absurd custom should be allowed to sink into oblivion. Mr Ashworth, the President Employers Federation has made accusations so serious that it behoves the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) and Senator E. D. Millen to demand an inquiry by a High Court Judge. inquiry is being continued by the Public Accounts Committee, but I have ascertained that the final report of that Committee was handed in the other day. Ministers are accused of malignant of the truth, and I demand, as a member, that the matter shall. be threshed Dr. Maloney. before a Judge. H a d we agreed that SenatorE . D . Millen should appear at the Bar of the House, I certainly should The next queshave asked that Mr Ashworth, who, without the protection of any rights or privi leges, is making statements in the press day after day, should also be called. The other day I asked the Prime Minister whether, in view of the serious charges made, he would consider the advisability of appointing a High Court Judge to in quire into them; but, notwithstanding that further charges are being made, the right honourable gentleman has not seen any reason to change his attitude. Even yesterday there were further charges; in deed, the columns of the press are reeking with charges against this most mismanaged Department. In the old days if , under similar circumstances, a Government had refused to face the music, M in isters would have handed in their resignations. Mr Ashworth was never on my side in politics. Apart from our difference of political opinion, I have alwaj's found him a straight, white man. He has earned a great deal of credit from those who know him by the position he has taken up in this matter. It is up to the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) and the Minister for Repatriation (SenatorE . D . Millen) to appoint a Commission to in quire into his charges. The Minister( Mr Rodgers) spoke of an application for timber areas in the Solomons which was made by Messrs. Fairley, Rigby, and Company on the 26th October, 1913, It w ill be rememwhich is over eight years ago. The Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) was in error in the statement he . made in connection, with this matter, as is shown by the letter from Mr Barnett, Acting Resident Commissioner, Tulagi, to Fairley, Rigby, and Company, dated 1st May, 1915, from which I quote the following : The matter of your application for a licence of the to cut, fell, . and remove kauri timber from the Island of Vanikoro has been inadvertently overlooked. That was two years after the application was made. I visited the Solomon Islands It has been stated that an en route to Rabaul, and made inquiries there from Government officers, planters, and others whom I met about that unfortunate man, MrJ . T.

The Act is still in existence, and the duty of the Minister is to administer it u n t i l Parof homes, and that the Government liament repeals or alters it . I desire to know what is to be the system of the administration of this Department in the future. The discussion of this matter upon the Estimates gives to Parliament no opportunity of expressing its view in regard to the f u t u re administration of the War Service Homes. that an amending B ill has been framed to delimit very substantially the powers"" prepared to adopt, and are adopting, of the Commissioner. store Ministerial control ? to hear that. The restoration of Ministerial control is the first step towards the reform of the Department; but side by side w i th that, there must be a complete curtailment of the ambitious schemes of the ex-Commissioner. against the administration of the War Service Homes activities and repatriation 1 generally is that there has been a tendency to forget the soldier in the desire of the controlling, bodies to bring into existence some peculiar fads of their own. One administrator regards these activities as an opportunity for the creation of garden cities, and he sets up expensive machinery for the opening up of new localities on the group system. desires that all the soldiers shall be brought together in certain streets. Buti t seems to me that the governing principle of the administration of all these Departments should be that they are created for the purpose of giving the soldier what he himself wants. War Service Homes Commission set out very early in its history to see that the soldier should not have what he wanted, but should be compelled to take something that the Commissioner wished him to have. principle is still being followed under the new administration. Many soldiers desire to buy houses thab are already constructed, and if the whole of the soldiers could have been housed in such homes there would have been no need for the But the Assistant expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds which this Department has cost the country in administration. Of course, we are told that Australia is short should try to build new ones. That matter belongs to the sphere of the State Governments; and if our duty merely is, as I conceive it is, to help the soldier to get a home for himself, we should leave the matter to the State authorities, and employ Commonwealth money as the soldier most desires it to be employed. that policy up to 20 per cent, of the limited? If I am the unhappy soldier to make the twenty-first application, why I am glad should I be denied the right to buy the house in which I am living? A soldier has been living in a particular house for a number of years; his children have been born in it ; he selected the house because it was near to his wife's relaM y complaint tives or to his own. But he is not to be helped to buy that house.

But the soldiers have no right to complain,, and I doubt whether they do complain, if , when they have selected their own houses and made their own arrangements, they find they have made a bad bargain. They cannot blame the Department for that. Department. cannot blame the Department unless it interferes with the exercise of their discretion. It would be wise to have a branch of the Department to which the soldier could apply for advice and for an inspection and valuation, but to compel men to turn down houses they wish to buy in order to set up a huge building scheme and create garden cities, is not to act in accordance with the objects for which the Department was created, and it is upon that rock that the administration has been wrecked. ""We have been told, so far as anything definite can be gauged from the figures, that the total amount to be spent upon the erection of soldiers' homes this year is something less than £3,000,000, whereas last year, I understand, the expenditure was upwards of £6,000,000. We should have a definite statement upon this point. We should be able to say to the soldier applicants how many houses we intend to build this year. Instead of keeping them in suspense, as some of them have been kept for as long as two years, waiting to know whether they are to get a house at all, we should say now definitely that we do not intend to build more than so many houses this year, and as there are so many applicants waiting, any other soldiers desiring houses will have to wait two or three years for them. diers will go to somebody else for a house, and the Commissioner will not have so much to do. the point. Once we create these Departments their principal work becomes that of creating excuses for their continuation and extension. That is very evident in connection with some branches of the Department under consideration. I ask that the Assistant Minister( Mr Rodgers) come down to this Committee -at the earliest possible moment, not with indefinite figures that can be argued about, but with a definite statement. It is a fact that there are in the hands of the Department a certain number of allotments that have not been used. The exact number of them must be known in the Department. in this debate it has been stated that the number was "" somewhere about 1,000."" It is inevitable in big schemes such as this that there should be a number of allotments on hand. I do not think that the number is unreasonable. It is for want of definite information of what the Department is doing, and is going to do, that nine-tenths of the criticism arises. If a soldier comes to me for advice, I say, '' If you are in a hurry, go to the Bank, and make your own arrangements."" I think that is a fair thing to do, but the Department is not doing it . The Assistant Minister seemed to be a little annoyed at an interjection made by me with regard to the suspension of work. I can produce a score of letters from the Deputy Commissioner in Sydney to the effect that a certain person's application has been received, but that until he receives instructions nothing is being done. That statement would not have been repeated as often as it has been to every New South Wales member of this Committee unless it were a fact that the work has been suspended.

384,Mr Rodgebs,"I have informed' thethe soldiers, as well as this Committee, are entitled to know what is going to be done in the next half-year. the Assistant Minister's statement this morning I take it that the amount available for this year is quite insufficient to meet the reasonable demands of the soldiers and to keep the promises that have beeD made to them. To my mind, it is a most wicked thing for the Department to allow the soldier to go on believing that his home will be provided when there; is no intention to provide it . I have a case in my electorate in which a young man wished to be married. He ' put i a an application for a house, and his marriage has been postponed three or four times in the belief that within a few months the matter would be settled. His application is so f a r down in the list that, if the statement made to the Committee this morning is true, he has been grievously misled. Ib is not fair to keep a man waiting for two years when he can go to the bank and make his own arrangements, probably on the basis of 7 per cent, interest. By doing the business through the Department he w ill save a \ per cent, or 1 per cent., and will derive the advantage of the extended terms which the Commonwealth allows; but he may prefer to pay the higher rate, so that he may have his home at once. We ought to have before us a definite measure for the reconstruction of this Department upon quite restricted lines as compared with what has been attempted previously. We should look to what fh e soldier wants, and should t r y to satisfy his wants, rather than attempt schemes for the reconstruction of cities and suburbs which have been indulged in too much by those who have been placed in charge. failures of the War Service Homes administration are much more in the public eye than its successes, and it is a fact known to any honourable member who takes the trouble to look around him in the localities in which soldiers' homes are built that for every failure there are a dozen successes. not come under the notice of Parliament. Criticism of the administration has been based too much upon the exceptional in stances of failure to provide wellbuilt homes, and too little upon the failures which have been due to the fact It h in k that the Commissioner appointed by the Minister failed to realize the nature of the job he had undertaken. the returned men are satisfied: say, in my electorate, about 95 per cent, of those who have got houses. got houses, but what about the others? think any of those who have not got homes are satisfied. They have a righ t to' be told exactly where they' stand. I object strongly to the continual interference w i th the man who wants either to buy a house already constructed or to. buy his land, and employ an architectand builder to build under his own supervision, to his own plan, the mortgage on the property to be taken over subsequently by the Department. Such applications ought to be encouraged. If every soldier could be induced to employ his own architect and builder, and to supervise the erection of his own home, it would eliminate a large percentage of the present complaints. I know of many cases in which that has been done, but I do not know of one such case in which the soldier has been dissatisfied. If he builds a house with a leaky roof, or w it h other, defects, he can only, blame himself, his architect, or his builder. It is easy to be wise, like the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) after the event. The honourable member was not in the atmosphere in which this Act was conceived. It is very easy, in theee calmer days, to see what ought to have been done. We, who were here, know that it the grandiose waa not possible to do the things which many of us wanted to do. We had to concede to the soldiers many things that they thought were for their good, but Naturally, the which, in our judgment, were not desirable. We shall get very little good by an investigation of the mistakes made in those years, because the conditions then operating are not the conditions under which we work to-day. The tragedy of the whole business is that the millions, which ought to have been spent in buyThese successes do ing homes for soldiers-existin g homes or homes constructed by them-hav e been devoted to enterprises for building homes ten, fifteen or twenty years hence. That mistake we can all deplore, .but the position that confronts us to-day is one in which we are asked to provide for the-",64,Maloney I Withdraw The Avowed It I Will Prove Tho Above Facts

389,Mr Hector Lamond,"I do notimmediate future. I am disappointed to hear the statement by the Assistant M i nister that the late Treasurer"" ( Sir Joseph Cook) thought it impossible to raise more money for this purpose. We must raise more money for this purpose, or i m mediately tell the soldier tliat the scheme will end a year or so from now. Whatever is done the soldier should be told. It is not fair to dylude him into the belief that he is going to get Government assistance to build a home when we know that the money is not available, and that the home will not be erected. Eroni every point of view the matter ought to be determined as quickly as possible, because many of the soldiers to-day are able toi go to financial institutions and make arrangements for building their homes. Many of the banks that are not lending money for the purpose of speculative building are quite willing to lend it to men for building homes, because they are the men who are most likely to prove satisfactory customers to the banks. I would like to say one word w i th regard to the statement that houses which cost £800 are only worth £ 6 0 0. That statement appears to have been made on the authority of some builders, and it may, or may not, represent their actual view of the facts. So far as my experience goes, the only complaints upon the score of value that I have received have been the complaints of soldiers who, having to remove from the locality in which their homes were situated, have had their houses sold at a value f a r exceeding what the Department charged for them, and they regard it as an injustice that the profits of the transsilenced me for the time being. When I action should not be given to them, in stead of the Department. Those cases indicate to me what I believe to be the fact, that the great majorit y of the soldiers for whom homes have been provided by the Department have acquired their homes at a lower price than they would otherwise have paid. They may not have obtained them in the locality in which they desired them, b u t in spite of the fact that their homes were built at the pinnacle of high price®, they could hot have purchased them for the price they paid had not the Government been behind them. I am satisfied that the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) will be making a good bargain if he takes over the homes on the depreciated value that the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) has indicated. I think it would be desirable if we could discuss the future of the Department under a B ill for an Act to effect reforms. A t present the Minister is charged w i th the administration of the old Act . He is supposed to appoint a Commissioner, who has powers the abuse of which has brought us to the present position. The remedy seems to me to be to bring in a B ill at the earliest possible moment constituting a Department under the direct control of the Minister, and w i th very much curtailed powers by comparison w i th those of the great Department established some time ago. I regret that the Committee has not had an opportunity of hearing. SenatorE . D . Millen. I think he made a great mistake in attempting to get a man to supervise the expenditure of such a. huge sum of money at the miserable salary offered. I think that was the great blunder the honourable senator made. He did it with a view to conserving as much of the money under his control as possible for the benefit of the soldiers themselves. a promise to the Opposition that the salary would not exceed £1,500. 0 tirely from the view that compulsion was placed upon the Minister. I have looked up the records, but, as interjections are disorderly, they are not always recorded. I remember interjecting to the Assistant Ministeri n charge that the salary was "" altogether inadequate,"" and he said that the Minister was satisfied that the salary was enough. That statement, of course, looked up the records I found that .the honourable member for Wannon( Mr. Rodgers) stated in his speech that, in his judgment, the salary was "" altogether in adequate "" for the work performed. I am satisfied that the members of the Parliament then in existence were men of a type who would not have agreed to a proposition that the Department could get a competent man to supervise properly work involving the expenditure of £25,000,000 to £30,000,000 at a salary which would be paid to the chief accountant in many business houses. It seems to me that, in his desire to meet the prophets of that false economy .which is preached in Parliament so often, the Minister came to grief. He got a man from among the few who were ready to take a job at such a price, and this man, who had been clothed by Parlia-",65,Maloney I Withdraw The Avowed It I Will Prove Tho Above Facts

392,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime M in said previously, that the Line shoulding, or from defects in the Act under which he was appointed, for which Parliament is responsible. much of the criticism directed against the Minister fails. first the circumstances under which the Department of Repatriation was established. The Minister, in organizing that Department, had no chart to guide h i m ; there was no similar organization elsewhere which he could follow. Nevertheless, he has built up a Department which not only has functioned but, viewing its operations as a whole, has worked in a manner which must be regarded as satisfactory. Let me take, as a case in point, the provision of War Service Homes. The criticism which has been published in the newspapers would make it appear that nothing has been done or that that which has been done is bad-.that all the houses that have been built or bought are defective. No fewer than 17,344 houses have been built or bought. Ninety-eight per cent, of these are excellent houses. That seems to have been overlooked. In New South Wales there are 2,301 of these houses, of which forty-seven were faulty, and of these forty-seven, twenty-seven were built by the Commonwealth Bank and twenty by the War Service Homes Commissioner, but all by contract. Therefore, in New South Wales, only 2 per cent, of the houses built or bought were faulty, and in the other States the percentage has been even smaller. every case the faults have been put right. Has any private builder done better ? houses we are not dealing with a matter with which we are not familiar. We all live in houses, and some of us have had houses built. is a somewhat chequered one. throughout my lif e been a fervent believer in day labour, and I have been foolish enough to stand by my principles, and to build with day labour. Consequently, my building has cost me a great deal of money, though I have, of course, the satisfaction of knowing that it is all day-labour work. A t Sassafras I have a house which cost £1,100, and in which there are no bricks save in the chimney, and I am willin g to exchange this house for any War Service Home erected on that site. I have seen many of these homes. They are excellent houses. I do not know of any with which, at their cost, they need fear comparison. In addition to the 17,344 houses which have been built or That being so bought, 26,000 homes and farms have been provided for returned soldiers, so. Let us consider that 43,344 returned men or their dependants have been accommodated. The gritics say nothing of the good work done; overlooking the 9S per cent., and cry aloud about the 2 per cent, of fault y houses. . Of course, what has been done falls f a r short of perfection, but have returned men been dealt with as well, or anything like as well, in Canada, New Zealand, SouthA f r i c a , or Great Britain? I say unhesitatingly that the work done by the Repatriation Department of Australia stands out by contrast w it h that done in any one of the belligerent countries. I do not contend that everything is satisfactory in the affairs of the Department, but I say that what is not satisfactory is due to the acts of the ex-Commissioner and the powers deliberately given to him by Parliament.

But after making all allowances for red-tape, the major trouble lies in the Act itself. It requires amendment. for Cowper quoted a case of a soldier blinded in both eyes.

I do not agree that the onus should be on the soldier to establish the claim that his injuries have others at the earliest possible moment. been due to the war. be on the Commonwealth Government. We must assume that any man who joined the Australian Imperial Force was, prior to enlistment, in sound health. Otherwise he ought no,t to have. been passed by the medical officers. I may be wrong, but that is my view, and if this House gives it the opportunity, the Government will before the House rises pass an amending Bill to remedy this defect in the Act. As to the other points. listened very carefully to what the honourable member for Cowper had to say, and where his suggestions have not been anticipated by the Assistant Minister's speech, most of them are deserving of consideration. With many of them. I agree entirely. at the earliest possible moment, make such amendments in the Act as will enable us to put the Department on a business-like and satisfactory basis. Honourable members seem to have set their faces against the system of day labour for the construction of War Service Homes. All I can say is that the policy of the Government is to make such arrangements with the States as will enable us to hand these matters over to them, but for reasons that, perhaps, will has just referred to outside critibe obvious to honourable members, we have not yet beeu able to come to au agreement with the State of New South Wales, although we do not despair of being . able to do so.

I hold strongly to the view that the trouble that has arisen is due entirely to the deliberate The honourable member act of this Legislature in appointing a Commissioner, and giving him statutory authority to deal with all these matters.

That is something already done. We have had to deal with a very great undertaking under conditions quite abnormal, and, on the whole; I venture to say that what has been done does not merit that criticism which has been directed against it. The criticisms in certain sections of the press has been I of a very venomoiis kind.

412,Mr Mcgrath (Ballarat) [6.2],"Ithreats as to what would be done when tbe War Service Homes Estimates . came before the Committee. Evidently the Country party has again climbed down, and there is not to be a fight. The party apparently is going once more to accept the assurances of the Prime Minister, and everything, so far as the Government are concerned, is to be all right. Country party says that he is going to -submit a motion. would have concluded his speech by submitting the equivalent of a motion of censure. has been arrived at between the Government and the Country party. The Prime Minister has made terms with the Country party, and has been endeavouring in his speech to cover up that fact. Unfortunately, the Government Were making promises of what they were going to do for our returned soldiers at a time when, instead of merely talking, lihey should have been doing something for them. No provision for the housing of our returned soldiers was made until the Armistice had been signed and our men were coming back in their tens of thousands. scheme should have been launched long before the war closed. I can appreciate some of the difficulties which the Minister (Senator E. D. Millen) has experienced in administering his Department. The cry of ""Preference to returned soldiers"" having been raised, he was limited in his choice of a Commissioner. I firmly believe that, having regard to the way in which such appointments are made, a big blunder was made in so limiting his choice. The Government would not dream of selecting for such a position any returned man who had not, at least, held the rank of colonel. An officer might be a splendid leader of men in the battlefield and yet quite incapable of successfully administering the War Service Homes Act. The Minister, unfortunately, made a very bad choice. It is idle for the Prime Minister to tell us that his choice was limited because of the small salary offered. As a matter of fact, the Bill, as introduced by the Government, fixed the salary of the Commissioner at £1,500 a year. The responsibility in that respect, therefore, rests only with the Government. They had a majority behind them, and, had they wished, could have fixed the salary at £15,000 a year. They believed, however, that a salary of £1,500 per annum would enable them to secure a capable man for the post. I realize, however, that we shall not mend the position by indulging in critiLeader of the cism of what has occurred. We have to look to the future. I am not satisfied that the erection of War Service Homes even now is to proceed on better lines. The work, apparently, is at a complete standstill, and owing to the commitments that Evidently some arrangement have to be met, the amount actually available for expenditure this year will be very small. Thousands of men enlisted from my district, but I do not know of any soldiers there who are bothering themselves about the War Service Homes Act. They are sick and tired of waiting for the benefits for which it provides. The Assistant Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Rodger,s) has said that his Department is free from political influence, and that one of the faults of the system is that under the Act the Minister has no control over the Commission. As to the statement that the Department is free from The War Service Homes political influence, I have only to say that, in my electorate, one War Service Home has been built, and that was built for a soldier who is the son-in-law of a Minister. No other returned man has been able to induce the Commission to build a house for Mm in Ballarat. able member want to suggest ? been brought to bear on the authorities. I do not merely suggestI say straight out that influence of some kind has been brought to bear. absolutely. Having heard the rumour, I examined the file of applications from Ballarat, and I can say definitely that no influence of any kind has been exercised. The application referred to by the honourable member was dealt with in its proper order. cannot induce the Commission to deal with other applications?

The honourable member gave many sound reasons in favour of the purchase of already erected houses. could be advanced. It is not every soldier who can afford to pay the big monthly instalments required in respect of a house costing £800, but quite a number would be able to meet the payments in respect of an already erected house that could be purchased for about £400.

I have not heard one complaint concerning the houses purchased i u Ballarat while Captain Tait was administering the Victorian Branch. Whatever may be the odium attaching to him now, I can only say that he always extended courtesy to applicants, and gave them satisfaction. I have now to deal with dismissals from the War Service Homes Commission. I received to-day an extraordinary letter. I think the writer, whom I know, CaptainT a it some time is a reliable man, but I cannot vouch for the truth of the statements in his letter. Referring to the men who have been dismissed recently from the service of the Commission, he writesWe are all married men, and were clerks at the works, and have lately been retrenched and single men kept on. We are the clerks who should have been kept on, as we know building construction and the materials. We ask to be reinstated as early as possible. All of us time clerks have'had office experience, whereas the. majority of those kept on have never been in an office in their lives. I arranged w it h the DeputyI do not think the Minister will countenance that sort of thing. The Commission is in need of men of experience. The writer continuesThe management is faulty, and some clerks The dearth of apwho are the pets can do what they like.

A grave mistake was made in taking the administration of the War Pensions Department from the Commissioner for Invalid and Old-age Pensions, cause it is only work. Commissioner's office could do all that is necessary, and there would then not be a duplication of overhead expenses. In the War Pensions Department 'a major and other officials have to be paid, and it seems totally unnecessary to incur this expenditure, particularly when the results are not nearly so satisfactory as they were when the work was controlled by the Commissioner of Invalid and Old age'Pensions. Victorian members, in particular, know that the officers in that Department are most courteous and sympathetic, not only to honourable members, bub to pensioners.

I desire to be quite frank, and say that I have a l ways admired a person who says, ""Peccavi!"" and is willing to acknowledge the mistakes he has made, because when faults are admitted uhey are not so likely to be repeated. The Assistant Minister said that a portion of the work of the War Service Homes Commission had got into a "" bog,"" and I think we have learned a most valuable lesson. The War Service Homes Commission started as master builders in a large way, but ended in thorough muddle and disaster. The Assistant Minister said that the Commission had now abandoned the attempt to act as a master builder; but I do not know whether that means that the Government are going to suspend operations at Canberra, because if they do not we shall be in an extraordinary position. They have admitted that there has been a bungle and a failure in attempting to build soldiers' cottages, and it would be interesting to know how they expect to succeed in constructing the palatial marble halls of the Eederal Capital. The lesson which, I think, this absolute failure teaches, and which the Assistant Minister has admitted, is that Commonwealth or State trading enterprises cannot succeed. especially those in the StateI represent, are being ground between the two millSurely all the stones of State and Commonwealth enI have terprises.

But there is one phase of the activities of the Commission in regard to which I heard no satisfactory information .this morning. I refer to the purchase of saw-mills desert. It is of no use to cry over spilt milk; but I am bound to say that the whole purchase was thoroughly unsound in principle, unlbusiness-like, and altogether a very bad bargain. That, I think, the Assistant Minister himself must admit. What the ultimate loss will be no one can say; but the present position, I repeat, is altogether unhappy. Something like £250,000 was paid by the Commonwealth for these mills, which were worked for a short period, but are now, and have ibeen for many months, idle. Many hundreds of logs have been allowed to deteriorate and rot in the scrub, about the dumps, and at the mills. The mills, of course, are fast deteriorating; and as for the tram lines and other parts of the plant, they, too, are daily losing value. There is obviously, also, the loss incurred in the matter of interest on the capital sum involved. There is another aspect of these purchases, and that has to do with the small community which has been thriving on the mills, and has owed its existence to the enterprise, skill, and shrewd business experience of the former owners. Today, owing to the Commonwealth having ceased operations, that community has been thrown into a state of great distress. There°is, and has Ibeen for months, considerable unemployment among the mill hands and (business people generally. Included in these are, of course, numbers of returned soldiers.

I bad hoped that the Assistant Minister would give some idea to-day concerning how those very bad bargains were to be cleared, or concerning the intentions of the Government generally. But as I listened I failed to catch auy ray of hope or comfort either for the public purse or for those unfortunates who have beeu thrown out of employment.

The first offer was rejected without any inspection, that is the principal cause of complaint. However, this applicant was then advised to secure a piece of land; and he secured a block for £116. The site was approved, as also the price, and he was requested to call at the head office to arrange about the transfer, and take the necessary preliminary steps for having a house built. He was informed that tenders would be called at once, and that he would be notified when a satisfactory tender was accepted. until the end of the year 1919, when he was asked to call at the office of a solicitor, dressed to Nurse So-and-So, of the same and pay registration fees, &e., amounting 'to £1 12s.

The Bank wrote to him as follows:If you ore prepared to deposit £242 into your account in the Commonwealth Bank the tender can be accepted, and the contract signed.

459,He Heard Nothing Further Mr Parker Moloney,"Yes. Acase is the fact that a lower tender had been received, much below the one they ivanted him to accept, and which he was offered £100 to accept. On 29th January of this year, nothing having been done in the meantime, another letter came to him in regard to his home. After mixing him up with two other people, they evidently had a look round the Department, and found his case. At any rate, they made a fresh start. the Minister much inconvenience. not blame the Minister for this sort of thing, but he certainly is surrounded by an incompetent and hopeless staff and f the trouble is that we are not likely to get much relief. At any rate, this man was requested to call and make final arrangements. A t last he thought he had come to finality. Therefore, in January of this year, he went along to the Department. He signed all necessary documents, and, on the 31st May, nearly six months later, he was informed that there were six tenders, only one of which was satisfactory. He was told, however, tliat nothing could be done at that stage.' hick. were several similar cases. I had a letter from a man at Albury who was in the same predicament. On the 10th October, the soldier to whom I have been referring was asked to sign security documents, and to pay fees amounting to £4 9s. 6d. He then asked whether, if he paid that amount, he could be guaranteed that there would be no further trouble, and he was assured that there would be no more delay. That was at the end of two years. He told the Department then that he would secure a contractor of his own who was prepared to do the work for £685. He gave promissory notes for £20 and £17 in connection with the building. He was assured that there would be no further delay. On the 30th October, he was informed that, until he paid £10 19s. 7d the interest owing, noa thing could be done. It was owing to the bungling and delay, due solely to the Department, that the interest had accrued. The man refused to pay it, and he said that he would place his case in the hands of a member of the Eederal Parliament. Then there was a series of telegrams to and from the head office in Melbourne, and, up to the date of his last letter, this man had not been able to get anything done. He has sent the account which he received for municipal rates. This is not a case that stands alone. I suppose every honourable member has had similar instances brought under his notice. For the general rate on his land he has been charged £2 7s. 6d. There are arrears amounting to £1 3 s. 4d., a special loan rate of 7s. 6d., and 6s. 7d. for other arrears. Including legal fees, the total amount charged is £48 12s. 8d. The most unfortunate aspect is that we have no guarantee that this kind, of thing is not going to continue. able members in the corner have been threatening for weeks to do.many things to this Government, but nothing has resulted. is supported by the evidence on the files, I think I can assure the honourable member that it constitutes a commitment which w ill be carried out. As far as inhad hard terest is concerned, such a case will not go to the Adjustment Board, but the Commissioner will deal with it at once, and no interest will be charged where the Commissioner is at fault. will be welcome news to this and several other returned men in similar circumj stances. Another ray of hope will come into his life; but I hope he will get what has been only too long denied him. Chanter) -The honourable member's time has expired. It seems to me that in the first three minutes of his speech to-day the Assistant Minister for Bepatriation ( Mr Rodgers) destroyed the whole of the case he endeavoured to present, because he informed the Committee that the late Commissioner was incompetent. It was quite a considerable time before any remedial measures were adopted by the Government, and then, I think, action was taken in the wrong way. The Assistant Minister told us that the Commissioner was left entirely without interference.

However, without wearying the Committee, I wish to submit a few cases which will drive home the necessity for recasting the administration. The pensions were granted on a liberal scale, and, again, it is the administration that is at fault.

I not sent in the correspondence. The charge of the Minister is ridiculous, because I have settled hundreds of such cases, which have all gone through the I now come to a broader matter. Some little time ago, on the 29th August, I wrote a letter to the then Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) urging that something should be done for the widows of soldiers who could not maintain themselves and their children on the pensions allowed. I stated at the time that I did not think an increase of the total amount for pensions was necessary, but that the allocation of the pensions could be much improved. I suggested to the Treasurer that where a widow had been left with children, aged parents, or other dependants, they should be given the maxiyou did not mum pension, as allowed by the Act, with an allowance for those dependent on them. That suggestion I sent to the » executives of the League throughout Australia, and they agreed that it was a way out of a difficulty that was felt to press harshly, The Treasurer wrote to me on the 10th September, and said he had referred the matter to the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen); but, so far as I know, nothing has been done. I again urge upon the Assistant Minister the necessity of doing something for these poor women and children, who are suffering from the loss of their bread-winners. It may not be difficult for the widow of a soldier to live on her pension if she has no one dependent on her, but where soldiers' widows cannot leave their homes because they have young children, or have to support an aged or crippled relative, they are struggling painfully and hopelessly to do not. try to meet their obligations. I have found in many parts of Australia cases of the deepest suffering on this 'account. I ask the Minister to do something to remove this blot from the fair name of Australia. Nothing is too bad to say of a country which permits the widows and children of men who died for it at the ' Front to go to ruin, it may be, in order to avoid starvation. Women will do anything for the protection of their children, and some of these soldiers' widows are in desperate straits.",81,Maloney Ther E Is Something £826 Said To Be The Lowest Tender And

I assume that the whole matter is still open for discussion, and there are one or two questions I wish to ask the Assistant Minister in connection 'with it. I notice that, in connection with the administration of old-age and invalid pensions, the vote for salaries amounts to £30,000, whilst in connection with the administration of war pensions the salaries amount to £37,000. Medical expenses in connection with old-age and invalid pensions amount to £5,000, and, in connection with war pensions, to £18,000. Other expenses in connection with old-age and invalid pensions amount to £50,000, and, in connection with war pensions, to £55,000. These figures show administration costs 15 amounting to £85,000 for old-age and 27 invalid pensions, and amounting to £110,000 for war pensions. From the 12 Estimates, I find that the vote last year for salaries and contingencies in connection with war pensions was £65,000; but apparently there is no vote down for Moloney, Parker the purpose this year.

A man in my district was engaged in a business and when the Government called on those who' were prepared to volunteer for the war he said he was prepared to volunteer, but he did not consider that he was medically fit. However, he went before the doctors, and they passed him. He went into camp, and, although he suffered from hasmorrhage on several occasions, he would not be released. His business disappeared, and although he had been kept in camp for twelve months and had become permanently incapacitated through haemorrhages', time after time he has been refused a pension. hope, be provided for in the amending legislation which is promised.

If the management of the contractor is good he gets good work from the employee; if the management is bad, he gets bad work. But an attempt is made to-night to load upon the workmen employed by the Commissioner the responsibility for the failures due to the incapacity of those who were intrusted w it h the carrying out of the scheme. some men who invested an enormous sum of money in the acquisition of a big area of land in my district; they had capital and brains. Their anxiety was to make profit, and to get the best work they could out of the men they employed; there was no ' ' Government stroke'' on that job. but they were so rotten that they could not get the Government to take them off their hands.

They tried to unload the houses on the Government. that they did not compare even w it h those b u i lt by the Government, and the builders are still trying to unload them. Success or failure is wholly a matter of control; everything depends on the administration. What does the W ar Service Homes Department suffer from ? In order to cover up bad management an endeavour is being made to load the blame on to the workmen, and now the Government propose to go back to the two things they have always denouncedpolitical responsibility, and the odious contract system, which simply means that the amount which otherwise would be paid to the workmen in higher wages goes into the pockets of the contractors, who pay low wages for bad labour, and use rotten material. ton organization to supervise the carrying out of the contracts. entirely out of order.. I have no objection to participating in them., but I like the forms of the House to be observed. I went to see CaptainT a it when he was Deputy Commissioner of Victoriai n regard to a contractor who had complained that the Department was absolutely robbing him.; he could not get supplies from the Commission; he could not pay his wages, and his whole business was tied up. He was doing the work at his own price with material supplied by the Commission. His grievance was that he could not get the material w it h which to continue the work. I carried that complaint to Captain Tait. He said, "" Here is that man's record. The material has been on the ground for three weeks. Bring him here and I wil l talk to h im I know of face to face. The trouble with him is that he is carrying out this job w it h cheap labour. Here are letters from some of the men. Most of them are non-unionists, and incompetent workmen. He is simply paying them about two-thirds of the proper wage, and some he w ill ' not pay at all, and they refuse to They built scores of houses, work for him any longeru n t i l they get their money."" I repeated that to the contractor, who replied, "" That is a lie. I have paid all the men their wages."" I told h i m he had better come w it h me to see Captain Tait. He came as fa r as A t Brunswick. I reCaptain Tait's door, and I said fco him, "" Captain Tait will see you."" He replied, "" I will see But the houses were so rotten him in two minutes."" But from that day to this.the interview has never taken place. When the Government evolved their War Servioe Homes policy they decided that they would choose a suitable man as Commissioner, and give h i m arbitrary power-as much power as is given to the Governor of the Commonwealth, Bank. It is apparent, of course, that the Minister who had the choosing of the man was speculating; it was a gamble as to whether or not he would select the right man. Even some of the men who conducted the late war f a i l e d ; time after time generals had to be recalled from the Front because of in capacity. Only experience could demon"" strate the appointee's worth. In appointing the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank the Treasurer of the day evidently had the luck to make a wise selection, with the result that nobody has questioned the administration of that gentleman. When, however j a man is chosen for some other position, and time proves that he is not making a success of his job, he, and the Government responsible for. his appointment, are the object of general denunciation.

Some of the ablest men in the public life of this country were men who proved themselves incapable of managing their own affairs. Thef a u l t w it h the man who was appointed Commissioner was that he was incompetent, and nothing more outrageous has been done than the raising of the matter of his in solvency when the Government desired to get r i d of him. Lieut -Colonel Walker was selected because the Government said that he was a capable business man, and because as a soldier he had had. experience in the massing of men for the accomplishment of great works. organizers do, he had to build up masses, of material and men if he was to build homes on a gigantic scale. out his scheme; but suppose that he had not been in the employ of the Government-suppos e he had been a capitalist trying to compete with the public demand for thousands of houses for the soldiers who were returning from the Front, many of them w i th wives-suppos e a private corporation had been catering for this demand, would not the same position in regard to scarcity of men and material have arisen from the very demands of the public? That is self-evident, and as it was only a proper business proposition that the man seeking to. carry out this gigantic work should, first of all, mass his material and men, Lieut -Colonel Walker endeavoured to do that. Various things have resulted,' of course, but the f a u l t does not lie with the productive forces engaged in carrying out the work; it has not been the men on the job-the men who have wielded the pick and shovel, the carpenter, and the bricklayer have not been responsible. These results are due to the fact that upon the productive energies of the men engaged in the erection of those houses there has been foisted an army of parasites. The scheme has been overloaded with managerial expenses, largely arising from the incapacity of the Commissioner to shoulder his responsibilities. E u t after all it is easy for money they were receiving. anybody to be wise after the event. The Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) spoke this afternoon of material lef t in the sun and of certain losses which had occurred through the houses not having been built more expeditiously. The most economical method is to build houses in the mass and for the workmen, as one job is completed, to go on to"" the next. Private corporations in the United States of America adopt that very system -on e gang of men excavates for the foundations, and as they move off to the next building site, other men follow them and put in the foundations, and they in turn are followed by the bricklayers, and later the carpenters.

It will, however, concentrate on this matter immediately the House rises, and I undertake to see the wheels of industry going again in those districts, and I can understand >the natural desire that exists in the localities affected. I think it would be foolish on my part, or on the part of the Government, to enunciate an immature policy now. It will devote itself to the most earnest consideration of the best solution of the question in the interests' of .the returned soldiers, the taxpayers, and the localities concerned. I cannot at this juncture declare the policy that will be adopted; and the carrying of an amendment, I submit, cannot have the effect of securing an advance declaration of policy to-night. I ask the honourable member to accept my assurance that the Government will concentrate on this matter, that it will consider it very carefully, and that it will at the earliest possible date announce a policy which, I hope, will set the wheels of industry in motion by the end of February next. I do not wish to appear churlish, and. I I think that the honourable gendo not want to waste one second of the time of the Committee unnecessarily; but, to be perfectly frank with the Assistant Minister( Mr Rodgers) I am not satisfied with the explanation he has made. As for the Government ""concentrating"" on this question and giving it their "" most careful consideration,"" that is what I have been thinking and hoping they have been doing for many months past. Without desiring to be discourteous .to the Assistant. Minister, I must, in fairness to I ask the honourable those I represent, submit an amendment. I move That the proposed vote be reduced by £1 as a request to the Government to take prompt steps to stop the loss of public money and It unemployment caused by the cessation of work at their Canungra and Beaudesert mills. candid admissions pf the Assistant Minister( Mr Rodgers) have removed much of the necessity for convincI t has reports ing debate.

If Parliament is to effectively deal with the whole subject, it should do so on the submission of that report. It is beyond doubt that the Commission' for the erection of homes for returned men has provided one of the greatest muddles ever associated with government in this country. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) said that others have referred to day labour as being the chief cause of the costliness of the buildings that have been erected. That certainly was partly the cause. In this concern of such great magnitude, where the supervision was indifferent, day labour has proved ineffective. But one might criticise the defects in the working of the War Service Homes Commission for hours without doing much good at the present time. ' The Government are now seized of the position, and doubtless when Parliament resumes again, and the final report of the Public Accounts Committee has been presented, honourable members will be able to consider what action should be taken to put things on a sound footing. In my opinion, a grave mistake was made when we took the business out of the hands of the Commonwealth Bank, which, unquestionably, on the whole "" delivered the goods"" while keeping within the bounds of the regulations. The men for whom it constructed houses have, generally, got better houses, and the work of construction was managed by it more efficiently than by the Commission. But one does not care to probe info things at this juncture; that may be done later. Prom South Australia scarcely a complaint has come, so that it would seem almost a waste of public money to go there to carry into that State the investigation of the Committee. In the matter of providing homes for our returned men, we should have followed the lines of experience, and not have rushed into a mammoth undertaking such as the world had never known. I hope that the Government will take the earliest opportunity to pull out, and put things on a proper footing. If that is not done before Parliament meets again, it will deserve all the castigation that can be given to it. [543]2 Question put. The Committee divided.

It has been stated repeatedly that there are almost as many instructors there as cadets. If that is so, it is a regrettable state of affairs. A footnote indicates that it is expected that the Estimates w ill be reduced in the second half of the financial year by four commissioned officers, twenty-four petty officers and men, and three assistant masters; but even if the number be reduced as stated we shall not be justified in expending all this money' on the College, taking into consideration the small number of cadets there. ter for the Navy) [10.1] I shall be pleased to supply the information. We are endeavouring, as f a r as practicable, to retrench at the College, but it must be a gradual process in order not to interfere with the instruction of the cadets in training there. They are getting excellent instruction. A f t e r passing through the College they are sent to Great Britain, where, in competition with students from a similar Collegei n the Old Country, many of them have come out with flying colours. This, I think, is a great compliment to our Naval College, and also to Australia. If we are to have an efficient Navy we must have some institution at which its f u t u r e officers may be thoroughly trained. I visited the College last year and was very much impressed by a l l that I saw there, especially the splendid system of training that had been adopted. The cadets are taught navigation, gunnery, torpedo practice, engineering (theoretical and practical), mathematics, physics, and chemistry. It was my privilege to present the prizes to the successful students. One cadet had taken honours in five subjects, b u t was only allowed three prizes. I made caref u l inquiries into the system of training, and found that if students were subjected to any unusual mental strain they were sent into the engineering room, or given a course of physical training, which resulted in the much-needed mental rest, and buil t them up, thus enabling them to resume their studies with vigour. I found that the students in residence were exceeding the number likely to be required as lieutenants, the Naval Board, I determined uppn a scheme of retrenchment, which has resulted in an estimated saving of £7,000, but which, I believe, w ill really be about £10,000 this year. We are still considering a development of this policy, and possibly the training of the H . M . S . Tingira lads will be carried out at the College, if practicable. This should result in a still further saving. D r . EABLE PAGE -Does the Minister think that another visit to the College would result in a saving of another £10,000 ? like to say that it would. I can assure honourable members that the Estimates were very carefully reviewed and heavy reductions made before being submitted to Parliament. We have done everything possible to keep expenditure' down, and in this matter the Board has rendered very great assistance. There are fewer naval vessels in commission, but"" I do not think we shouldeconomize at the risk of efficiency. I trust that the course I have indicated w ill commend itself to honourable members, and that the Estimates will be accepted by the Committee. timated at an earlier stage of the Defence vote that I thought it would be possible to make substantial reductions in the Naval Estimates, but before moving in respect of any particular item, I should like the Minister( MrL a i r d Smith) to explain five very substantial increases in various branches of this Department. The first is to be found in the medical services, seamanship, the vote for which, speaking in round figures, is £21,000, as compared w i th the actual expenditure last year of £14,000, or an increase of £7,000. Then there is the Royal Australian Naval Reserve vote of £110,000, against an actual expenditure of £85,000 last year, or an increase of £25,000. For Naval establishments the estimated expenditure this year is £158,000, compared with an actual expenditure of £82,000 last year, an increase of £ 7 6 , 0 0 0; and the amount to be paid to credit of Trust Fund for uniform, clothing, and other necessaries is £50,000, compared with an greater actual expenditure of £15,000 last year, or an increase of £35,000.

The item, £1,000, for the Director of Naval Medical Services last year appeared as "" Borne for pay under division No. 78, Permanent Naval Forces (Sea-going),"" so it is not an increase. The recommendations of the Basio Wage Commission have influenced the Government in paying certain increments. The last Estimates provided for only portion of the year. The Naval Board finds the utmost difficulty in retaining the services of its medical men owing to greater attractions outside. These gentlemen must get a fair remuneration for their services if we are to retain them. Speaking from memory, I think we have been advertising for three medical officers simply because those in the Department have taken positions outside. are there in commission? ago I issued a statement explanatory of the Naval Estimates in the hope that it would be of assistance to honourable members. At page 4 of that statement the strength of the sea-going fleet is given as follows:-Two light cruisers, Melbourne and Brisbane; one training cruiser, Sydney; two sloops, Geranium and Marguerite; three modern destroyers, ANZAC and two "" IS"" class destroyers; one "" River"" class destroyer, Huon; one submarine parent ship, Platypus; three "" J "" class submarines; ,and one yacht, the Franklin, which is used as a tender to the Royal Australian Naval College. The Geranium is employed on survey work on the north coast of Australia, and has given good service for the expenditure incurred in respect of her. The [honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) desired information as to the increased vote in respect of the Royal AusI n contralian Naval Reserve totalling £27,291. -The increase under "" Pay"" is to provide, ' first of all, for the resumption of training, which was suspended owing to the war, and will involve an additional expenditure of £10,646. Then we have provision for full year of staff appointed during 1920-21, which accounts for £4,510, while increments under awards and regulations involve an increase of £1,046; making a total under "" P a y "" of £16,202. The £7,984. We are now reverting to the ordinary training, and I am convinced that considerable savings will eventually be made in our total Estimates when we have in the Naval Reserve a number of these trained men, who proved themselves of much use during the war. I would also direct the attention of the honourable member to division ""Naval Establishments,"" which appears at page 197 of these Estimates.' There we have provision made for the full year's payment of the basic wage allowance, including child endowment, which was payable during only a portion of the year 1920-21, and in respect of which there is an increase of £924. Other additions are accounted for as follows:-Increment s under awards and regulations, £750; provision for salaries of officers, who were paid under another division in the Estimates for 1920-21, £1,016; provision for weeks pay of permanent staff in lieu of temporary staff at present employed, £4,410, cost of living allowance to officers in the United Kingdon charged to other votes in 1920-1921.

567,Mr Laird Smith,"Somehonorable members of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the administration of Cockatoo Island. They complained of the great number of men who were employed as temporary hands. I found, on going into the matter, that men who in some cases had been working in the office for over ten years were still regarded as temporary employees. After going into the question with the Naval Board, I decided to re-organize the office. require midshipmen. I can appreciate The war being over, I was able to make changes which were previously impossible. While the war was inprogress, our principal ships were overseas, and a great deal of the work now done at the Navy Offices in Lonsdale-street was then carried Estimates were before us on a previous out by a staff in Great Britain. Our ships having returned to Australian waters that work is once more being done at this end. I found it necessary to reorganize the whole staff. After careful inquiry by a Board appointed for the purpose, and subsequently by the Naval Board, it was determined that certain men who were filling offices that were likely to be permanent should be appointed to the permanent staff. As a consequence, we have these increases in respect of establishment and so forth. I hope this explanation will be satisfactory to the honourable member for Balaclava. After the strenuous way in which I used my voice last night I do not feel disposed to speak at length; but there are one or two matters relating to these Estimates concerning which I have a few observa,tions to offer. I endorse ithe remarks made by the Minister for the Navy( Mr tion will be adopted. The Naval ColLaird Smith) with regard to the training of midshipmen at the Naval College at Jervis Bay. During the warI think it was in 1915 or 1916-whe n the first batch of Australian midshipmen reached the Grand Pleet at Scapa, the late Admiral Sir Robert Lowry, who, was then in charge of the Fleet on the north-east coast of Scotland, remarked to me that they wore the smartest lot of midshipmen that had come under his notice. They were absolutely efficient, and were a splendid advertisement for the Australian Naval College. Then again, in an examination held recently in England for the rank of engineer sub-lieutenant, AusThere was nothing to give any sense of tralian candidates were first, second, and third on the list. We should endeavour to carry on the Royal Australian Naval College, although I agree that the expenditure should be kept as low as possible. We do not know what will be the effect of the Washington Conference on our Navy. I do not want to prophesy in (his case, but I am certain that the Australian Navy of the future will consist of light cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and, naturally, aircraft. All these ships will the difficulty of .the Minister and the Naval Board in trying to adjust the expenditure on the College to the measure of efficiency that is being secured. The Minister will remember that when the occasion I suggested several directions in which the Naval College might be put to good use. One of my suggestions-and this is a very important matter-relate d to the flying branch. Every flying man, whether civilian OT military, should undergo a course at the Naval College at Jervis Bay in order that he may obtain proficiency in what I might describe as "" sea sense."" An airman working over a ship of war, unless he is conversant with her helm movements, will experience great difficulty in effectively dropping his bombs. Airmen will also experience difficulty unless they have the ""sea sense"" of which I speak, when they have to go out with our ships in certain formations. It is for these reasons that I urge that all airmen should be required to undergo training at the Naval College. I would ask the Minister to make a note of this matter. It is of much importance, and I hope that my suggeslege might also be used to educate officers of the mercantile marine in the very important work of the convoy system. During the war a huge amount of work was put iu by the Admiralty in teaching officers of the mercantile marine how to convoy ships. I was for a time submarine officer on the Carmania, which was employed in conveying American officers and troops from New York to Liverpool. Sometimes as many as eighteen or twenty vessels of from 20,000 tons to 30,000 tons burthen would be steaming along in four columns abreast, at night, without a light to guide the officers. direction or to warn those on board a",92,Depabtment Of The Navy
568,Mr Marks (Wentworth) [10.21],"vessel of the proximity of other ships, and on many occasions there were narrow escapes from collisions which would have resulted in serious loss of life. It was only because the officers of those vessels were highly trained in the convoy system that we got the American troops safely across. I may remind honourable members that 65 per cent, of the American troops that went to England were taken aver on British bottoms, with a British naval convoy. The Royal Australian Naval College might well be used to train officers of the mercantile marine in the convoy system. Officers of the mercantile marine have the right to go in certain numbers to the Royal Naval College at Greenwich, and there spend several days every year in getting "" brushed up "" in the latest ideas of modern navigation. The same facilities might very well be extended to members of the mercantile marine to attend the Naval College at Jervis Bay. The honourable .member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) suggested that the Army and Naval medical services should be combined. gestion. degree of jealousy on the part of the various services, and once we started to amalgamate those services, in which there are divergent ranks and officers in various grades we should have trouble. Better results will be obtained iby keepmates can be reduced, I would like the ing the Army and Navy medical services distinct, as they are to-day. There is an item in these Estimates relating to the training ship Tingira, which costs £64,000 a year. It is really a most excellent institution, and well handled. Prom discussions that I have had with the MinisterI know that he is considering the desirableness of transferring that Laird Smith), partial as it was, was pervessel to Jervis Bay, and so saving the expense of maintaining double staffs. The lads might be kept on shore, and sent to sea now and again on a smaller ship. In that way some portion of this expenditure of £64,000 per annum might be saved. I am very glad that no criticism has been levelled at the item of £5,000 for the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve. sents a new movement. The proposal is to train the yachtsmen of Australia so that, if necessary, they may be employed in the future as naval officers. This scheme, once it has been fairly started, will involve the Commonwealth in very little cost. When the war broke out in England there were no officers available for the auxiliary services, such as sub 1 marine chasing, mine sweeping, &c, and officers had to be obtained from Canada and New Zealand. Unfortunately, the authorities did not seek to obtain any from Australia, where we have a very fine body of yachtsmen. While I was at the Royal Naval College at Greenwich some 600 yachtsmen were put through all branches of navigation, and also went through gunnery courses and other training. The proposal is that we shall adopt the same scheme, although on a smaller scale, so that we may have this reserve force of highly-trained men' on which to fall back should trouhle at any time arise. I am pleased that this item has been included in the Estimates, and I hope that no exception will be taken to it. I know the Minister, with the assistance of the Naval Board, has done everything possible to .secure efficiency at a minimum That is not a practical sugof cost. . The vote for this Department There is always a certain seems to me to be a large one, and it is; but, as the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) said, we are ""treading water"" in order to see what actually happens at the Washington Disarmament Conference.

According to the cabled information, she was making substantial cuts in her naval programme; but I understand that in connection with the upkeep and maintenance of our Fleet we are increasing, rather than decreasing, our naval expenditure this year. There should be a substantial reduction, because some of our larger vessels are now out of commission, and the cost of maintenance and upkeep must be considerably less. crease in the pay of officers and men. Mr ""WATT -The Minister does not explain that. . There is an increase in the personnel of some of the establishments as shown by the Estimates. There is hardly one branch of the Naval establishments, as indicated by the figures supplied by the Minister, that does not show an increase. With a view to assist the Government to economize in expenditure of Consolidated Revenue, and to indicate our desire for naval disarmament, following the example of Great Britain, I move That the proposed vote £200,000.

WATT Britain, in 1913-14, the Estimates for naval expenditure amounted to £45,000,000; and, in 1921-22, after a reduction being made at the request of the House, the amount was left at £82,000,000. Great Britain is spending 33s. per head on her Navy, and before the reduction of our Estimates by £130,000, to which I have agreed, we were spending only 13s. per head. It will therefore be seen that the expenditure is not excessive. I have been assured by the members of the Naval Board that if we make any further reduction it for his position if he cannot give an exwill be false economy. tude of a Department. vote is further reduced ships will he unable to go to sea to the same extent, and, in consequence, the men will not be trained as they should be. The honourable member for Balaclava has complained because I have not given the Committee sufficient information. I have made a careful search through Hansard, and I find that this is the first occasion on which any explanation of any note has been given on the Naval Estimates. This is, I believe, the first occasion on which information has been sought, and I direct the attention of the Committee to the attitude of the honourable member for Balaclava when Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer when the Estimates for 1918-19 were under consideration. At 11.57 .a.m. he moved, vide Hansard, number 88, page 9827That tbe time allotted for tbe consideration of the whole of the Estimates be until 4.30 p.m. to-day; and that the time allotted for all resolutions and stages of the Appropriation Bill be until 5.30 p.m. to-day. He admitted that honourable members might consider that somewhat harsh ' treatment. The time that he allowed be reduced by the Committee was only four-and-a-half hours for the consideration of the whole Estimates, and the naval vote on that unless the explanations occasion amounted to £2,505,435. accepted that explanation without any discussion whatever. A gentleman with a thorough knowledge of political quesadvised me that an explanation was necessary. He also said, "" Cannot you I shall. see that this is for electioneering purposes. It would be very nice for some of your opponents to make use of the fact that no explanation was given.""

If we follow what is occurring at Washington, and what is being done by the League of Nations, it is certain that the naval votes and the strengths of the world's navies will be reduced.

There are two items in Division 88, sub-division 2 (Contingencies) that have yet to be explained. One is the amount of £75,000 for "" general expenses and upkeep of dockyard and other services, maintenance of machinery and floating craft, temporary assistance, and all other expenditure incidental to the Sydney Naval Establishments."" second item is, "" General expenses and upkeep, including travelling expenses, stationery, fuel and light, telephones, and all other expenditure incidental to other Naval Establishments-£30,000. "" The two items make a total of £105,000, as against £30,000 voted last year. Knowing something of how these Estimates were formerly prepared, I cannot understand why the increase was asked for, or why it should be deemed by the Government or the Committee to be necessary. In Division 89 there is £50,000 set down to be paid to the credit of a trust fund called the ""Uniform, Clothing, and Necessaries (Naval) Account."" amount voted last year was £15,000, and that amount was expended. There must be some special reason why all the charges for uniform in the Department have been increased so substantially, yet there has been no explanation forthcoming. support the amendment, and I think the Minister should briefly give us an explanation of these two divisions. ter for the Navy) [11.20] I shall be very glad to give the information sought. The total amount asked for in Division 88, sub-division 2, is £105,000, as against £36,877 expended in 1920-21. The increase is due in the first place to the cost Bell, G. J. of upkeep of Garden Island Dockyard services, maintenance of machinery, yard lighting, maintenance of harbour craft, including wages, coal, and repairs, being included under this item .instead of under Subdivision 1 of Division 79 (item 3), ""Repair and maintenance of ships,"" as in previous years. In the second place, at the naval establishments at Flinders, vote be reduced by Swan Island and Osborne House, Geelong, which was previously charged to other votes. Additional expenditure is the Flinders Naval Depot being heavier than at Williamstown. Moreover, awards and basic wage allowance, including child .endowment, and increase under awards, are payable for the f u l l year in 1921-22, whereas they were paid for only a portion of 1920-21. Regarding the item ""Uniform, clothing, and necessaries,"" the reason for the increase of £35,000 is that at present clothThe ing stocks are very low, and it is imperative that some replenishment be made as early as possible, in order that the clothing may be available for issue on repayment*. A large proportion of the orders for uniform clothing is placed with the Commonwealth Clothing Factory. This money is simply placed into a trust fund. The men buy the clothing, which is made in our own factory, and we allow them to have it at cost price. We should all be proud to see how well these men are clothed under these conditions.

Proposed vote, £100,000. do not know why the Committee should be asked to vote this -large sum, in addition to the £300,000 we have already voted on the Works Estimates. It w ill be noted that the proposed vote for civil aviation is £28,794, and for military aviation £71,406.

I realize, however, that it is not much use asking for a reduction of the vote, unless the Government are prepared to make it . view of the fact that we have already voted £300,000 for this branch, we are not justified in voting another £71,000. I make this protest because I do not wish to be held in any way responsible when this branch of the Service grows large in the future. I venture to say that w it h in two or three years' time the amount involved w i ll be £1,000,000. Then we shall ciomplain of the expenditure, and now is the time to register a protest. .

Tenders have also been accepted for aerial mail services between Brisbane and Sydney, and Sydney and Adelaide, while tenders have been called for another service from Charleville to Cloncurry. I say at once that the £17,000 which is set down for the development of civil aviation is not sufiicient for uhese purposes. Sir GRANVILLERYRIE H o n o r able members had much to say in favour of civil aviation when the Works Estimates were under consideration, and then urged that every encouragement should be given to its development.

That is the course that should be taken, and one which every honourable member would approve. apparently, every honourable member, judging by opinion, believes in the steady and resolute development of civil aviation on this Continent.

I think it would be an i m position upon honourable members at this late hour to go into this matter as f u l l y as its importance deserves, but I may mention that the total amount payable under the Articles of the Peace Treaty was fixed at no less than £6,600,000,000.

He said, some time ago, that he declined to be one to trade with Germany. The people of Australia, in their anger at what had taken place during the war, applauded that statement. But we know that the Prime Minister has been regenerated. Honourable members will, no doubt, be able to derive a certain amount of amusement from the right honourable gentleman's utterances; but in my view this question is so important that a settlement of it should not be delayed any longer. With deference to the honourable member for Balaclava, I think that we cannot risk a failure to obtain an expression of the Prime Minister opinion of honourable members before the close of the session, and that I should therefore submit my motion to-night. The Minister for Trade and Customs. ( Mr Greene) has informed me that if there is a general expression of opinion by members of the Committee in favour of my "" motion, he will take certain steps forthwith to abolish the existing restrictions against trading with Germany. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has informed me that he is in favour of a motion approving of the removal of restrictions on trade and commerce with Germany, and the Leader of the Country party (Dr.' Earle Page) has given me a similar assurance.

If such a ""laboratory, situated in Western Australia or Queensland, can do something of advantage to the whole of Australia, and not merely to tlie Statei n which it is situated, it w ill be carrying on a work of value. I hope the Minister appreciates the wonderf u l work that has been done. Some members of this Committee, including members of tlie Opposition, saw w it h me a demonstration in that little laboratory in Perth, and I think they w ill agree that it is doing particularly useful work.

[12.56 a.m.] -It has been very refreshing to hear the speech of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs). Just why the honourable member should feel this responsibility thrust upon h i m I am at a loss to see for the time being. Ho enunciated views that have been expressed for some years past from this side of the House; and I think it is the feeling of the majority of the people of this country, just as it is the feeling of the people in all the Allied countries since the conclusion of the war, that it is an utterly foolish policy to take up the attitude of the Prime. Minister( Mr. Hughes), who said, shortly after the war was over, "" If you want to trade w it h Germany you must get a new leader."" He has maintained that attitude right up to his last public utterance on the subject. whether we trade with Germany or not, if it is in the power of the Prime Minister we shall still have the same leader. I hope, however, that he wil l not have the settlement of that very vexed question of leadership in his own hands. . Having said this very often, he now finds himself in a dilemma as the .Leader of a Government which is the only Government in the countries that were recently at war with Germany which is pursuing that stupid policy. He is looking for a way out in order to get r i d of the responsibility which necessarily and essentially is his own. Rinding himself unable to take up that responsibility, he haa evidently arranged with the honourable member for Capricornia to show him a way out. is, the Prime Minister wil l take credit to himself; he will be on the right side, anyway. so. Latterly he said, "" I w ill not trade with Germany. I will nob consent to it . "" Now, when he finds every other country in the world doing what he has so long refused to do, he says, "" Parliament must take the responsibility for this action."" The responsibility should not be thrust upon Parliament; it rests upon the Government.

A few days ago I asked the Prime Minister why should not the Australian wool, of which Germany is buying thousands of pounds' worth from England, be bought direct from Australia, and he, as usual, camouflaged the position by replying that any one with wool to sell could sell it to Germany. It is obvious, of course, that if we do not trade direct with Germany that country will not trade with us. got what Australia and the other countries which are represented at Washington are merely striving for; that is, she has got disarmament. £300,000,000 a year in the upkeep of her Army and Navy, and now her factories are working day and night. four, the other day, express the hope that Germany would soon be in the League of Nations? lieve so. I could not imagine our 'Prime Minister saying that. How can Germany pay her huge war indemnity if the present foolish policy is persisted in? As a matter of fact, German goods are coming here now through indirect channels. I am glad that the Government and its supporters have come to the way of thinking of honourable members on this side of the chamber, who have declared the policy of the Prime Minister in this matter to be a foolish one. The right, honourable gentleman, recognising the stupidity of his ,position, is trying to get out of it in his usual way by saying to honourable members, "" You take the responsibility."" Later, if he is confronted with his declaration about the leadership, he will tell the electors that Parliament, not he, was responsible. I object to him shirking his responsibility in the matter; but now that he must know that the majority of his own supporters have come back to sanity on this matter, let him do the sensible thing. A t all events, he can rest assured that I and members ou this side of the House will stand where we have consistently stood. misrepresenting the Prime Minister and myself in saying that the right honourable gentleman made an arrangement with me. I assure him that that is not so. This is what I wrote to the Prime Minister yesterday morning, after I had stated in the House my intention to move the amendmentMy dear Prime Minister,In accordance with your request-repeate d at least twice-that honourable members should express their opinion regarding trade with Germany, I made the following statement this morning when tlie House met:-"" I desire to give notice that I propose when the Estimates for the Trade and Customs DepartGermany has already ment come on for discussion to move as a friendly amendment' That item No. 1 be reduced by the sum"" of £1 as an intimation to the Government that, in the opinion of the Committee, the restrictions on trade and commerce between tbe Commonwealth of AusShe saves tralia and Germany and Austria should be removed forthwith.' "" I hope yon will see no objection to this method of procedure. The Prime Minister met me somewhere about 12 o'clock, and said, in answer to my inquiry, that it would be all right.

667,Mr Foley,"Reverting to theto conform with standards fixed by the Department, the contracts being made on the understanding that tbe goods sent will pass the departmental officials. Before jute goods are despatched from India, credit notes have to be sent from Australia, Avhich means that the Indian manufacturers are paid in advance. I wish to give one or two examples of what actually happens, to the prejudice of our merchants, and ultimately to that of our farmers and graziers, because they have to pay more for their bags, sacks, and packs. In one case brought under my notice 100 bales of jute -goods purchased at high prices were condemned in bond by the Customs officials, but when the importers sent back the shipment to Bengal, complaining that it was not up to the standard contracted for, the manufacturers, who had already received their money, replied that the goods were up to the requirements of the contract, and threw them back on to the hands of the merchants here. Another firm have had the'ir contracts reitems in these Estimates. jected for the same reason, and were prevented from disposing of the bags to New Zealand merchants, who were quite prepared to accept them. I agree with the Minister that we should do all that is possible to maintain the good name which Australia has enjoyed hitherto by requiring that goods contained in any receptacle should be up to the Australian standard, but in this case the New Zealand people knew quite well what they were to get, and therefore the action of the Department in preventing Australian merchants from disposing of these goods was somewhat arbitrary. the bags? through some of them. They were not up to the Australian standard. In the recent boom times many mushroom firms, with little or no capital, came into existence. They managed to get a few pounds together and dealt in this class of goods with merchants in Calcutta and elsewhere in India. obliged to forward credit notes, with the result that merchants who were doing legitimate business were placed at a serious disadvantage. The importers of this class of goods say there is a way out of the difficulty. They contend that the addition of £d. per dozen (bags would enable the Government to pay for the services of an inspector in India to see that the goods were up to Australian standard. Merchants here would then have some assurance that they were getting what they paid for, and, in turn, they would be able to supply our farmers with jute goods up to the Australian standard. America has inspectors in India, and as a result is getting the best class of jute goods, while we in Australia, not being represented in the same way, are having the inferior goods foisted upon us, and we are obliged to get rid of them as best we can. I put these facts before the Minister for what they may be worth, and trust that some action will be taken along the lines I have indicated. a.m.] I desire, before I conclude, to submit an amendment that the vote be reduced by £25,000, but before doing so I should like to speak about one or two I emphasize and support the remarks made by the honourable members for Dampier( Mr Gregory) and Swan( Mr Prowse) as to the value of the Eorest Products Laboratory in Perth. This institution, established through the generosity of private donors in that State, is doing splendid work in investigating the suitability of certain timbers for the manufacture of paper. Its activities should not be circumscribed in any way. Rather, it should be given the opportunity to test other timbers throughout Australia. A special plant, received two or three months ago, should enable the laboratory to carry out other tests as to the suitability of Australian timbers for' the manufacture of mechanical pulp. In northern New South Wales considerable expenditure has been incurred in microscopical tests and pulping processes of the softwood timbers which in their character closely approximate to the American timbers from which paper pulp is made. These timbers ought to be tested in other respects in Perth in the They were not way that the hardwood timbers of that State have been tested.

Having regard to the estimated huge reduction O in the Customs revenue-and judging by present returns that estimate seems likely to be exceeded-ther e should be room for a reduction of £25,000 in these Estimates. At the risk of being regarded as a nuisance for daring to speak at this early hour of the morning, I propose to refer to the retarding influence which the Navigation Aet has upOn Albany, one of the very excellent ports and districts of the Commonwealth. On many occasions, as the Minister( Mr Greene) is aware, at the request of various bodies in Albany and the surrounding district, I have waited upon him and his officials with respect to this matter. Finally, I joined with the whole of my. fellow-representatives of Western Australia in this Parliament in a deputation that waited on the Prime Minister, who promised, to make certain inquiries, and has not yet been able to furnish us with a definite answer to our request. This is no laughing matter. Certain honourable members, who appear to be prepared now to treat it lightly, may find their own operation of the Navigation Act. The with the object of bettering the conditions of seamen engaged in the coastal trade. That is an important consideration, but it is equally important that the should not be seriously retarded by the operation of that law. Prior to the Act being proclaimed, at least two Interstate steamers called every month at the Since then the port has been served by only one Inter-State steamer per month. The Minister knows the volume of trade that is done there. He has recently taken a record of the passengers who leave Albany by sea; but that is not a fair criterion. Many people cannot wait for the particular day of the month on which it has been decided by the authorities that a steamer shall call at Albany. Business will not wait, and the business people of the town have, therefore, to journey to the west in order to go east. They have to pay as much to reach Fremantle as it would cost them to travel direct from Adelaide to Albany if a .steamer were available. The the whole State of Victoria, and, because of the reduced service, business people there have to take in a month's stores at a time. Local merchants are thus unable to compete with the traders in the centralized portions of the State.

This is a very serious matter, but I shall be satisfied if the Minister will give me an assurance that he will send one of his officials to Albany in order to obtain first-hand information. A trip to that beautiful district might serve as a Christmas holiday for one of the officers of the Department. Albany is certainly the finest watering place in Australia. If an officer were sent there to make inquiries from the Chamber of Commerce and the workmen 'of the district-the lumpers there cannot get enough work to keep the wolf from the door-the Minister would obtain information that would enable him to fully appreciate the real position, and I am sure that the Parliament, when that information was placed before it , would be prepared to relieve the people of Albany and the surrounding district of the inconvenience to which they are at present subjected by reason of the operation of the Act. With regard to the question of trading with Germany, I would say briefly Chanter) -That question is* not now before the Chair. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) withdrew his amendment in order to allow of a general debate on the whole of the Estimates relating to the Department of Trade and Customs -About twelve monthsago an embargo submit that, although the amendment moved by the honourable member for Capricornia has been withdrawn, honourable members are entitled, in dealing with the Estimates of this Department, to discuss the question of trading with Germany. The chief business of the Department deals with the imposition and collection of duties and the volume of trade passing between this country and others, including Germany. Chanter) I have no recollection of saying that I would restrict debate in any way. I suggested to the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) that he should withdraw a specific amendment in order to allow a general debate to take place, and if I allowed a debate on that amendment to take place at this stage, I would not be keeping faith with the honourable member for Capricornia nor the Committee.' There is no other way of keeping faith with the Committee, Mr Chairman, as the whole Department is opened up 'by permitting the honourable member for Capricornia to withdraw his amendment. Unless we can discuss the question of ""trading with Germany on the Estimates of the Trade and Customs Department, we cannot do it at any other time. I think it would be wise to allow the debate to cover the whole ground comprised in the Estimates for this Department. so desires, I shall not restrict honourable members; but in my opinion trading with , Germany is not a question for the Committee to deal with at this juncture. country is now trading with Germany, and by Australia refusing to do so we are stultifying our own interests We are anxious to sell goods to Germany, and they are going to that country through various channels.

It has heen demonstrated beyond the shadow of doubt that newsprint can be manufactured with 75 per cent, of hardwood pulp; but we do not know whether it can be'produced in commercial quantities. We propose carnying out extensive experiments'with the plant which has been imported. The tanning investigations have been restricted this year, but I am hoping that they will be continued extensively next year. The funds at present at our disposal are limited, and we are obliged to make this a mark-time year. For the same reason, we have not been able to take up the work of bringing the various States into line in connection with research work, which the States are doing. Some branches of research work are being (Undertaken in practically all the States, but the expenditure incurred appears on their Estimates and not on ours. States have refused to give up certain investigation, and we are not in tlie position to force them until we are able to fully equip the'Institute and secure the services of sufficient scientific men.

Technically, they would be forfeited, and the Department probably decided to teach these return them to India. We are concentrating on this sewing.

With respect to the proposal of the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) for the reduction of the Estimates by £25,000, 1 remind the honourable member that he has asked me, practically in the same breath, to consent to increased expenditure-cer tainly not to any considerable extentbut in three several directions at the same time. My great difficulty in framing the Estimates for the Department is to make both ends meet. ' While it is true that, on the permanent staff, there will be found a greater number of officials than last year, that is due entirely to transferring temporary employees in carrying out those most desirable provisions for the proper inspection and supervision of our primary products which are sent abroad. have been, of course, certain extensions in regard to the Navigation Department, and some respecting lighthouses, but, outside of those new activities, I emphasize that there has been no extension of the staff of the Department whatever. increase of the personnel of the collecting branches ? recent' years there has been thrown upon the Customs Department a vast amount of new work. I may mention, for instance, the matter of the supervision of passports. that work now? our giving it up, seeing that practically all the nations require persons visiting their shores to be provided with passports. In my view, this provision will be a salutary precaution for some years to come, what with the threatened spread of Bolshevism, and like evils. This one responsibility has placed upon the officers of my Department an enormous additional burden of work. which is made for passports cover the expense incurred? the issue of passports at this end is concerned. I say frankly that, if it were not for the self-sacrifice of the officers of the Department, it would be impossible to carry on operations with the present personnel. some relief was afforded. , Collector I have been receiving repeated urgent requests for additional staff. However, I have asked the officers, in view of the existing financial stringency, to do their best to cany on. Even since I have been in the Department the work has grown enormously. I have got my officers to compile certain figures regarding one item alone, in order to demonstrate the extent of this growth. In 1913 the original files which went through * the Central Administration Office of the Customs Department numbered 24,500. Last year the number was more than There 65,000. A comparison of the figures will afford some idea of the enormous increase. it been due to a different method of administration which brings more into the head office? matter of the growth of business, and of the addition of new activities. I may mention, as an example, -the subject of lighthouses. The supervision of that branch of Commonwealth responsibility . amounts, in itself, to a fairly large task. Then there are matters of navigation, of film censorship, science aud industry, the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, the Board of Trade, and the whole of the Public Trustee work, which, alone, is an immense consideration. At -present also we have all the clearance office work; that has to do with enemy debts to and from Germany. All the files concerned with these varied activities pour through the one funnel at the 'central office of the Department. Their heavy responsibilities are taxing officers night and day in order that the work may be kept pace with. The staff is loyally standing up to the strain, but I sometimes feel that I charge am asking too much. I assure the honourable member for Cowper that there is no room to make the "" cut"" which he desires, while at the same time leaving the Department in a position to carry on with reasonable efficiency.

Mr MoWILLIAM'S -In the different States colouring widely varies Western Australian f r u it is easily the brightest; but it is not nearly equal in flavour to that which is grown in the colder climates. of importance, because if the colouring regulations are insisted upon some of the finest apples grown in Tasmania will be classed as inferior in grade. I desire to point out one direction in which the Minister could effect a considerable saving in tlje application of the Navigation Act, and could do so without dispensing with the services of a single individual, but merely by instilling a littlo common-sense into the heads of those administering the Act. When the Navigation Act was being dealt with in this Legislature, the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Tudor), and the then Attorney-General, the present Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), gave assurances that the river boats-the 10-ton "" wood-hookers "" and the like-woul d not be brought within the scope of the measure. Despite that, the present administration haled the people who run these river craft before a Court, and there was a subsequent appeal to the High Court. The private parties succeeded in their appeal, but they were put to considerable loss, while they were being fought with the aid of Commonwealth money. was taken was a friendly one, instituted by arrangement, to determine exactly, by resort to the High Court, the limits of the Constitution in respect of the NavigationAct. wealth, I am glad to say, had to pay the vital importance, when the crops may not costs; hut the representatives of the river craft interests nevertheless suffered financially. I was glad to hear the Minister for Trade and Customs say, in reply to remarks of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse), that he would give attention to a provision of the Act which is pressing heavily on certain classes .of the community. There is a strong, feeling There is proposed a in Tasmania that the State is not getting a fair deal, owing to the fact that ships which had been calling for years before the war are now prevented from taking Tasmania in their trips. To a very deserving class of the community the matter is serious. Last year these. people were unable to secure freight space for half the quantity of frui t which they had grown and desired to send to England. This question of colouring is Tens of thousands of cases of some of the best apples grown in Australia were left to rot in the orchards. The mail boats, in addition to carrying a considerable number of tourists in the season, lifted a certain quantity of frui t and conveyed it to Englandi n quick time. I do not ask the Minister to make a general application of the special provision for all time, but I would remind him that the Prime Minister has very properly said, ""Those who say that shipping has reached normal conditions are talking nonsense.'' Honourable members know that over-sea shipping has not returned to normal. Last year I saw many an orchardist's income perishing on the ground, because there was no means of transporting the fruit to England. At that time the same class of fruit was selling in the Old Country at between 35s. and 30s. a case. All parts of Australia now contribute to the English mail contract. From Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia, fruit-growers can ship their frui t in the mail boats; but these vessels are prevented from going to Tasmania. I am not pleading for that State because it is small in area; but it is suffering to a greater degree than any other State in the Union from the operation of the Navigation Act. Furthermore, whilst this season every other State has been blessed with plenteous rains, it is having one of the driest years experi-",114,Granville Eyrie I Have Just Trade W I Th Germany And Austria

I appeal to the Minister to give them the use of the mail boats for this year. It would not interfere with the Inter-State shipping. The passengers who, during the tourist jseajson, travel from Sydney to Hobart on mail boats will not travel by the smaller Inter-State steamers. I make a final appeal to the Minister to l if t the embargo for this one year only, and then, perhaps during the coming year, we may get sufficient bottoms to take away our fruit. It is a serious matter to the people, who have no other means of support but the revenue they derive from the sale of their produce, to deprive them of the legitimate means of conveying it to market, and an injustice will be inflicted upon them, which I am sure this House, when it passed the Navigation Bill, never intended. In connection with the amount of work said to be entailed upon the Customs staff, I would like to know from the Minister whether new officers have been appointed to supervise exports, or whether the existing staff will have this work tacked on to their other duties. -A t a more convenient opportunity at a later hour of the morning, I hope to say a few words about the matter raised by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), namely, the rescission of existing legislation forbidding trade with Germany. The observations I have to make on that subject will come more appropriately when the honourable member submits his amendment. In the meantime, I desire to say something on a mattor concerning which, some time ago, I addressed a series of questions to the Minister for Trade and Customs. April of the present year, I asked the Minister1. Is there any form of censorship (other than the prohibition of obscene publications) subsisting with regard to the importation of books and other kinds of literature? 2. If so, who determines the suitability or able, because it is carried on without any otherwise of such books or other literature for of those excuses which were available to admission to the Commonwealth? 3. Is the Minister, or are his departmental officers, assisted or advised by any person or persons outside the Public Service in determining such suitability or otherwise? The Minister's reply to those questions was1. Yes; in the form of a Proclamation dated 31st January, 1921. 2. The Minister, on a report made by a departmental officer detailed for the purpose. 3. Yes; in instances where such a course is deemed desirable. On the 11th May, 1921, I asked the M in isterWill he supply1. The titles of the books the importation of which into the Commonwealth has been prohibited during the last two years, and the names of the authors? 2. The names of the persons, other than members of the Public Service, who during that period have assisted or advised his Department in discriminating against certain publications? He replied1. It is considered that to supply the names of the books would be to give undue publicity to their titles. 2. It is not considered desirable to furnish the information sought. We gather from the Minister's replies to my questions that part of his departmental duty is to exercise a kind of 1 oblique censorship over the reading of the public. Honourable members have a lively recollection. of what this country suffered under the censorship for the four years of the late disastrous war. It was the duty and privilege of honourable members of the "" Labour party to inveigh against Government interference with the liberty of the people of this country to read what they choose in order to inform their minds on current events, which at thattime were of the very -highest importance. ""We thought, however, when at the close of the war the Prime Minister announced the cessation of this mischievous interference, when he announced, not in these words, but in words conveying this meaning, that this In policy of putting our heads in the sand was to be departed from, and the light of knowledge was to be let in, that the censorship was really at an end.

This seems a convenient opportunity to make a protest to tlie Minister, and I ask him now if. he stillrefuses to disclose the names of the persons who act in this arbitrary way, determining for him what books the people of Australia shall read ? Will the Minister let us have the names, and, if not, tell us on what principle he withholds them? The war is over. Military necessity can no longer be pleaded. Members of this Parliament are entitled to know, on behalf of the country, who exercises these very important judicial functions. Ignorance in any circumstances is a bad thing. Want of knowledge at any time is worth illuminating and curing; but ignorance, induced by the deliberate action of a Government, is reprehensible in the very highest degree The blame rests upon those responsible persons for deliberately making themselves the instruments of ignorance and misrepresentation. I hope that in future better counsels will prevail. In the case of one book in particular I made special representations to the Minister. I do not know whether it was because of these representations, or whether it was because the Minister, for the first time, took the trouble to acquaint himself with what' the book contained, but he was good enough to remove the prohibition. The fact that he did so, and courteously informed me of it,, merely serves to illustrate the better the wrong that I am endeavouring to expose. The fact that it is necessary for an individual member of this House to apply for the admission of a literary work, and that it is admitted, condemns the stronger the action of the Government in making it part of their policy to vest in strangers of strong and biased political views the right to say what we shall and shall not read. we get the facts in spite of the press and in spite of the Government.

Russia, it is true, if I may say so in passing, labours under an unexampled calamity. arising from the failure of its crop, and consequential famine. Opportunity is taken from this fact to blame the Government, and to charge it with not permitting relief to proceed to Russia from other countries; whereas, in truth and in fact, the great wrong to Russia is that other countries, in their obstinacy, refuse to recognise, de facto and de jure, the Government of Russia. I need say no more on that point, but merely say that, following the amendment of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), I shall move that the proposed vote be reduced by 10s., as a protest against the action of the Government in arbitrarily, improperly, and obliquely exercising the discredited censorship, and preventing the introduction of literary works to which the people of this country, in their untrammelled discretion, ought to be absolutely entitled. wish to draw the attention of the Minister( Mr Greene) to what appears to be a conflict between the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth authorities in connection with the grading of dairy products. been determined. cheese and butter have been held up owing to the fact that, first, the State authorities, and, secondly, the Commonwealth authorities, grade the products. the recent Premiers' Conference, agreed that the Commonwealth should be the sole authority to determine that matter. that explanation from the Minister, because I understand that new regulations have just been issued.

Men in Australia who cherish feelings of people should not forget how much German blood there is in the British race. When the Roman Legions departed from the British Isles their place was taken by a new race, Jutes, Angles, and Saxons, mostly of Teutonic and not of Celtic origin. The very name of England is of German origin. We have 30,000 or 40,000 Germans in Australia, many of whom came to this country at our invitation and whose sons fought for Australia during the war. It is not necessary that I should mention the names of several of our brave Generals and other officers who were of German descent.

In 1854 England fought with Russia on behalf of the Turks. In 1914 Russia was in alliance with England and France against the Turks. In 1899 England went to war with the Boer Republi6s.

From all quarters of the Committee to-night the view has been expressed that we should renew trading with Germany, and we have not heard any protest against that course. phatically against it, and also against the method adopted by the honourable member for Capricornia in bringing this matter before the House. able member is objecting on the ground that, owing to the peculiar economic position of Germany, the re-opening of trading relations with her will lead to serious competition with the products of our own industries. aware that the Government propose to introduce a Rill to deal particularly with that aspect of the question. We feel that it would not be right to renew trading with Germany until that Bill has received the assent of this House. Of course honourable members know that 'for quite a long time there has been no restriction upon our export of goodis to Germany; the only restriction is upon importations from Germany. dumping B ill introduced first. saying, and when that has been passed the Government will be prepared to issue a proclamation repealing the existing proclamation which prohibits the importation of goods from Germany. What i's in> our minds is not to make the proclamation immediately operative, but to allow a reasonable time to lapse between a sudden influx of German goods, particularly of some lines, might upset the trading position of a large number of people. 'That is undesirable, but if rea-' sonable notice of the lifting of the restriction is given, I do not think anybody will have ground for complaint. In the circumstances I suggest that the honourable member for Capricornia, having accomplished his purpose, should not press his amendment to a division. I would not like an important motion of this bind to be disposed of without offering a very few observations upon it. I listened with intense interest, although under great difficulties, to the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), and the little I heard of his remarks filled me with a very strong longing to hear the remainder.

It was not very long before that restriction was partly removed-a t all events, it was removed at the close of the war-and we were permitted to export our goods to Germany.

It is unfortunate that war breeds hatreds, but it is infinitely more to be deplored that these hatreds should be fostered and maintained for years after the war has come to an end. The quicker we forget these international bigotries the better, especially when, with the perspective which we can now employ, all of us are able to take a saner and juster view of the origin and genesis of the war. Some of us have tried to take that view earlier. At all events, the honourable member is to be congratulated. is not by any means a friendly attempt ou his part to let the Prime Minister down lightly, and that he has made no arrangements with the Prime Minister on the subject. iu the still watches of the night, when these two honourable gentlemen have been going home together, steering their course by the stars in silence, the honourable member for Capricornia has heard the right honourable the Prime Minister say, not to him, but to himself, "" I wish to GodI could get rid of that German restriction without moving it myself."" There may have been no other communication than that to the honourable member for Capricornia.

My remarks will be few at this juncture, as I am hoping for an opportunity at the proper time to discuss this important question. There is no more important question to Australia than this, and it should at least be placed upon the business sheet and submitted to the House by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government, and a statement made so that honourable members, in casting their votes, may possess the very latest information from all parts of the world. ""Without doubt the question of currency will affect the opening up of trade relations with Germany. I am quite confident that the Prime Minister is able to enlighten me, at any rate, upon this matter, so that I may be able to cast an intelligent vote. At present I shall vote against the amendment. The Government will be placed in a very awkward position if the amendment is carried. I am surprised at any member objecting to the postponement of this important, and all important, question at 4 o'clock in the morning, so that it may receive at the proper time more adequate and proper consideration. I have reason to protest, first, against the method adopted in bringing the question before the Committee, and, secondly, against the opening up of trade relations with Germany. I will not agree to re-opening trade with Germany until such time as I can be supplied with information which will convince me that it will be in the interests of Australia. What does it matter to me whether we are out of step with other nations or not? I am responsible to my constituents for the vote I cast, and I am not going to open up relaitions with Germany under any conditions, unless we find that it is absolutely essential in the interests of the Commonwealth, and will be to the advantage of the Australian people. I hope that the amendment will not be carried, and that the Government will in due time submit proposals for the consideration of honourable members. Amendment negatived. Proposed vote agreed to. Proposed vote, £810,911, agreed to. Proposed vote, £7,455,533. I want to make a last appeal to the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) on the matter of country telephones. If the Postmaster-General has not funds sufficient to provide these facilities, and if there are means of borrowing money for the work, I hope the Government will not be backward in the matter. I am sure the Committee will be prepared to provide reasonable funds for the necessary extension of the telephone system in the country. I and other honourable members have stressed the necessity of this for many years, and I know the Postmaster-General is well aware of the urgency of it. If money can be borrowed, I would like him to allocate sums at his disposal so that this particular branch of his service may receive more attention than it is intended to give it at present. A great many, lines have been approved of, the deposits that have been asked for have been paid, and everything has, apparently, been in order when, at the last moment, word has come that the work will not be proceeded with this year for lack of funds. This is often a serious matter to persons who have been waiting month after month for connexious. I think that if the Postmaster-General will study his Estimates closely, he will find that by the re-allocation of the moneys set down under the various heads he will be able to get some of these lines constructed. Certainly, I hope that he will consider my suggestion that this should be done.

I should like to know from the Postmaster-General whether there is any chance of his getting the £1,000,000 that he told us he intended'to ask for, in order to proceed with telephone construction, which is now held up. There is no Treasurer. fortunate that members should be asked to deal with questions of finance at a time when there is no Treasurer, because it prevents us from knowing the real position. I take it that the Postmaster General intends to press for the £1,000,000 that he has spoken of? more. That money is for Works and Buildings. more than £1,000,000 will be needed to catch up with the arrears of works. However, I leave now the subject of telephones and mail services, because it has been discussed so often that it should not be necessary to refer to' it again. I come to another matter, the inadequate pay of many of the officers of the Postmaster-General's time to time. I have had letters on this subject from postmasters in my electorate, and I intend to make a comparison between the salaries of Commonwealth Postal officials and those of State officials, in many cases doing similar work. In no branch of the Public Sendee are the salaries so paltry as in the Postmaster General's Department. The post-offices of the Commonwealth are divided into sevengrades, the Newcastle office for example being in the No. 1 Grade. Honourable members may be surprised to learn that a postmaster in charge of a Grade1 office who has to control 140 officers, and through whose hands passes between £90,000 and £100,000 a year, gets only £500 a year. A person in private employment controlling an equally large staff, and with similar monetary responsibilities, would be paid from £1,500 to £2,000 a year. A sixth-grade postmaster in my electorate, a man of fortynine years of age, with thirty-two years' service dren ? we want in this country. given ample evidence that he is a good and useful servant of the Commonwealth, yet he is paid only £264 a year, less £26 deducted for rent. That man is over a staff of six others', and controls an office which has a telephone exchange with 100 subscribers. A school teacher in the same town who has only eighteen years' service, little more than half that of the postmaster, and with only two juniors under him, gets £500 a year. When permanent divisional returning officers were appointed by the Commonwealth, a man left the Department of PublicI n struction in New South Wales to join the Commonwealth Service. A t one time it was the ambition of many of those in the service of the States to get into the Commonwealth .Service, but this mail, after six years' service in the Commonwealth, is now getting only £220 a year, while those who were his fellow employees in the State Service are getting £400 a year. That is a disgrace to the Commonwealth. Let me now compare the pay of the railway telegraph officers of the State of New South Wales with that of the Department. From Commonwealth telegraph officers under the Postmaster-General. One railway telegraph operator with only ten years' service gets £315 per annum, and a Commonwealth postal officer in a town only a few miles away gets £280 per annum. An officer with thirty-six years' experience who is in the Commonwealth telegraph service receives £212 per annum; and a State railway telegraph operator gets £255 per annum. In another case in which the length of the services of two officers are the same, namely, six years, the man on the railway staff is paid by the State £255 a year, and the man on the Commonwealth staff gets only £126 a year. I do not suggest that the pay of the State railway telegraph officers is too high, or even high enough, but the telegraph officers in the employment of the Postmaster-General are in a much less enviable position. But the permanent employees of the Postmaster-General's Department, bad as their lot is, are better off than those connected with allowance and semi-official offices.

It is said that not a great deal of business is transacted in these allowance offices, which are usually given to those who have some other business upon which they depend. the same position. Those in charge of them are expected to have other sources of income, and must be prepared for long hours of business. they have little time for anything else. If there is one thing that ought to be remedied, it is the condition in which those who are in charge of allowance and semi-official offices are placed. The cases I have quoted disclose a state of affairs that should not be tolerated. I have a copy of an award for bank officials in New South Wales,""made a few days ago by Judge Rolin. Bank officers, as clerical workers, are always regarded as being low down in the scale of remuneration, but by comparison with the pay of some of our postal officials, New South Wales bank officers are in clover. according to this award, that a bank official with ten years' service will get £285 per annum. This, it is true, is a paltry wage, but compared with that paid to the postmaster with 32 years' service, whose case I quoted a few moments ago, it appears to be quite respectable. If the Postmaster-General gets this £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 of which he speaks, I hope that some improvement will be made in the pay of postmasters and our allowance and semi-allowance post-offices. The post-office should not necessarily show a* surplus upon its operations -'bu t in all parts of the Commonwealth. the regime of the late Postmaster-General( Mr Webster), there was in one year a surplus of about £600,000, which was paid into the Consolidated^ Revenue. Post Office has an important effect upon the development of out-back country. Improved postal facilities will help to keep people out of our cities, and, perhaps, gO far to cure the curse of centralization. If the Postmaster-General could get £6,000,000, and made a proposal for its expenditure upon improved postal, telephonic, and telegraphic communications, he would have the hearty support of a majority of the members of this Parliament, and of the general community also. Although the hour is late, I cannot allow the occasion to pass without adding a few words to what has already been said about Semi-official offices are in much the necessity of urging the Postmaster General( Mr Wise) to bring pressure upon his colleagues in the Cabinet to find the money which he himself believes to be Indeed, very often absolutely necessary to place his Department on a satisfactory footing. This is the desire of all honourable members, and of the people generally. I am surprised that the Government, of which I am a supporter, should so long have neglected to find the means to advance this very important work. They have been able to obtain money for expenditure for many other governmental activities concerning which protests have been made by members from both sides of the House during the debate on these Estimates. No protest whatever is made concerning expenditure for the improvement of telegraphic, telephonic, I find, and postal facilities. The Postmaster General, and also the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), know quite well that no honourable member would record a vote against any proposal for increased expenditure in the Postal Department. Therefore I am surprised that the Government have not already taken such action as may be necessary to borrow the money whioh the Postmaster-General says is essential to carry out necessary works, not only in the country districts although I name them first, because their need is greatest It is the one Department that can do a very great deal to improve the lot of those engaged in developing the outback districts of the Commonwealth. Other Departments of the Public Service are not so favourably placed in this respect. It is admitted that improved means of The work of our communication and transport are essential if we are going to settle the remote portions of the Commonwealth with a contented rural population. In my own electorate many applications have been lodged for telephones and similar facilities, and approval has been given by the Department for the construction of these",125,Postmasteb Genebal S Depabtment

I have boasted on many occasions that this is their avowed policy, but recently I have been extremely disappointed at the receipt of copies of letters from the Deputy Postmaster-General, in Hobart, to applicants for telephones, intimating that the work could not be proceeded with, because funds were not available. The Treasurer last year assured the House that money would be provided, and I contend it is the duty of the Government to do so. The money could be borrowed without any difficulty. There would be noprotest from any honourable member or section of the people if a loan were placed on the market next week for £7,500,000, which the Postmaster-General tells us is required. The Departmental revenue would be sufficient to meet interest charges and provide for a sinking fund for the redemption of the loan. Therefore, the Government should not hesitate. It is absurd to say that all these works should be paid for out of revenue. The revenue of the Department could not stand the strain, and it is not fair that those who have already telephonic and postal facilities should be asked to contribute perhaps by way of increased charges, to the funds necessary to extend these conveniences to others who are nob in such a fortunate position. objection to the application of surplus revenue from existing charges to provide for interest and a sinking fund on a loan for the purpose of extending these facilities and bringing the departmental services up to date. There is no question as to the Committee being in deadly earnest about this matter, and I am sure that the Postmaster General is alive to the necessity of the situation. I hope he will take an early opportunity to bring under the notice of the head of the Government the strong terms in which honourable members have expressed themselves on this subject. If that be done, I am perfectly certain that the Prime Minister and, in fact, the whole Cabinet will realize the necessity for what we are asking, and that the requisite provision will he made at an early date. Regarding the administration of the DeMr Bell. partment, I have no complaint to make. The Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) is hard-working, courteous at all times, very much in earnest, find much concerned with regard to the efficiency of his Department. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I hope that at an early date the necessary funds will be provided to afford him an opportunity to put his Department on such a footing that he will be able to give absolute satisfaction to the whole community. a.m.] I have no desire at this early hour to speak at length. I regret the circumstances under which we are conducting this debate, but I want to support the remarks made by the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell), and the suggestion that a loan should be floated in order that the Department may catch up with its arrears of work in respect of the extension of telephonic facilities and the erection of post-office buildings. It is a curious position with which we are confronted. The pioneers out-back want these facilities. The general public would readily support any proposal to grant them; the majority of the honourable members of this Parliament say that they should be granted; and yet nothing is done by the Government. not take action? There would be no ber of the Government I cannot say, but something ought to be done. We are talking about a big immigration scheme and the necessity for developing the great waste spaces of this Continent. Buti f ^we are going to deny to the people who go out-back the ordinary facilities which should be freely granted to them, then I see no prospect of successful immigrant settlement or of any general development of the interior of Australia. In my electorate, in -northern Victoria, there has been a fair amount of soldier settlement. I have referred to this matter before, and make no apology for again alluding to it . These soldiers have been settled in dense Mallee scrub. There we have whole communities of them. They have no tele'graphic communication with the outside world, and I cannot get any for them.

I understand that of recent years a profit has been made by the Department, and it seems to me that the proposal to float a loan to enable it to overtake its arrears of work is a sound proposition that should be favourably considered by the Government. Whatever may be the ways and means adopted, I insist that something must be done for the people out-back. It is time that representatives of rural districts in this House, irrespective of party, combined and organized to try to force the Government to do something for these people. It is not fair to induce people to go into the out-back and then leave them stranded as we are doing to-day. shall have my support in endeavouring to obtain postal and telephonic facilities for them. member is in favour of these facilities being granted, and yet nothing is done. not the necessary funds, but they are proposing to raise the money. that the honourable member and other staunch supporters of the Government will bring pressure to bear on them and insist upon these much-needed facilities being conceded. I could speak at greater length in this strain, but I shall not do so. I have been agitating, and I intend to do a great deal moreI am going to keep on agitating until I get something done for these people. Let me refer now to the Mildura Post Office, the facts relating to which have already been put before the Postmaster General( Mr Wise). There we have a post-office which is hopelessly overtaxed. The employees are herded in a small building where they have to cope with a tremendous volume of business. It is an absolute scandal that, in a district of high temperatures, so many employees should be crowded into this small building. A new.up-to-date building is urgently needed there. is the case of' Red Cliffs. There 'we have a.population of 2,000, and the postal 'business is carried on in what I can only describe as a shed. I have not so much criticism to offer.with regard to the lack of postal facilities at Red Cliffs, because it is a comparatively new settleThe Postal Department ment. It gives every promise, however, of being a large town, one that will equal Mildura, and possibly have a still greater population, and I ask the Postmaster General to have erected there a substantial post-office to cope with the large volume of work that undoubtedly will have to be dealt with within a very short period. I again urge the Government to try to do something for the pioneers of not only northern Victoria, but every other State. I gather from conversations with honourable members that the position is the same in every State. From one .end of Australia to the other we have the same lamentable story. .We urge people to go into the back country, and there we leave them in the silence of the bush, devoid of any communication with the outside world. I join with other honourable members who have urged -that the Government should borrow something like £7,000,000 to provide for the extension of telephonic and mail services. As the representative of a district that is fairly well provided for, I have not many complaints to make regarding local wants; but I realize that if we are going to develop Australia we must extend our postal and telephonic services. No greater incentive could be offered to people to go out-back. I know of deaths that have occurred in remote settlements because of the lack of a ready means of communication with centres from which medical assistance could be obtained. Many people hesitate to go into the far interior because they know that years are likely to elapse before they will be linked up with the outside world. There is a general feeling that our postal and' telephone facilities should be extended, and I am convinced that the country would unanimously support the Government in arranging a loan for this special purpose. There are two or three other matters to which I must refer. First of all, I unite with the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney^ in asking the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) to take Then, there a little interest in the salaries to which he has referred.

781,Mr Mcgrath (Ballarat) [4.24 A.m.].,"Committee with examples, although I could give quite a number. Many postal officials in New South Wales have also to conduct Savings Bank business for the Commonwealth Bank, but for this they receive no additional remuneration. On the other hand, the State Savings Bank business in many small townships is conducted, by the local policeman, who receives from the State an allowance of £30 per annum and, in addition, 2s. for every £100 deposited with his branch. His additional remuneration, therefore, amounts in some cases to perhaps £50 a year. It is very unfair that our postal officials should receive no additional payment for the extra work devolving upon them in connection with the Commonwealth Savings Bank. I hope that the Postmaster-General grievance. I wish also to mention the contract offices. A t the outset I would congratulate the Postmaster-General on having considerably improved the position of those in charge of such offices. In that respect I think he is the best Postmaster General we have had for. many years. Those who are in charge of semi-official contract offices want to know in what position they stand. Are tSey regarded by the Department as temporary or permanent officers? Many of them have been in charge of such offices from ten to twenty years. ployee in the Department is granted annual leave, and even temporary employees after twelve months' service are entitled to leave; but men who have been in charge of semi-official and contract offices for twenty years cannot obtain leave except ati their own expense. Under an award of the Court temporary employees, after twelve months' service, are entitled to eighteen days' leave per annum. It seems to me that persons in charge of semi-official and contract offices should enjoy the same privilege. They feel that they are entitled to annual leave, other sorters. 'The Department is takand it would not cost the Department much to grant that concession. I hope that the Postmaster-General will do so. Clause 27 of the Letter Carriers Award provides that any temporary officer working continuously for twelve months shall be entitled to eighteen days' leave ofabsence, exclusive of Sundays and holidays. The wording of the award could not be plainer, but certain departmental officials seem to be constantly seeking foT means to defeat it. The award provides that'after twelve months' continuous service these temporary officials are to have eighteen days' leave; but case after case has been brought under my notice where they have been dismissed after serving twelve months, and the answer of the Deputy Postmaster-General is that' their, services, are dispensed with because the Department cannot see two months' continuous work ahead for them after their eighteen days' leave has expired. It seems to me to be one-way of defeating the award, and now that attention has been drawn to the matter .1 trust the Minister will see that it is given prompt attention. In Ballarat the letter-carriers have also received an award, and the Judge who heard thei case, in delivering will remedy this his award, said that the men claimed to be entitled to the £15 per annum awarded by Mr Justice Powers, and later the same award was made by Mr Justice Starke. The award stated that £15 per year was to be paid to letter-carriers ""and assistants doing sorters' work in the mail branch. The heads of the Department say that the mail branch applies only to capital cities, and on account of this interpretation the assistants of Ballarat are deprived of what they contend is their right. ' These men are working side by side with the sorters of Ballarat, and doing exactly the same work, and taking Every permanent emthe same responsibilities. The salary of a sorter is £210 per annum, and that of an assistant £168. They are not only getting £42 less salary than the award, but are denied the bonus of £15. When the award was made that the sorters should receive a fixed salary with a bonus of £15 per annum it was clearly understood what was meant; but the Department, to deprive the men of the bonus, did'not appoint any sorters, but classified them as assistant sorters. They are doing the work of sorters, and work with ing an undue advantage by calling them assistant sorters, and paying them £42' per year less, and depriving them of a bonus of £15 per annum, which the award provides. That is a mean and miserable spirit to display towards employees. We% stand by arbitration and conciliation, but when men go to the Arbitration Court and receive an award it is upset on a technical point. In this case the Department claims that the award applies only",128,Postmasteb Genebal S Depabtment
782,Mr Mcch,"ath.to capital cities; but tbe work of sorting is just as important in a city sucb as Ballarat as it is in Melbourne. Tbe sorters have to know the destination of every communication, their memory has to be good, and they have to pass an examination before they can act as assistant sorters. Some of the sorters have to memorize at least 5,000 addresses, and to perform their duties in an expeditious and intelligent manner. It is a most ""unfair way in which to treat men who render honest service, and the Postmaster General, through his officials, should see that more just treatment is meted out to them. I trust that inquiries will be made, not through the heads of Departments, but through postmasters who know the work. If that is done the men will be quite satisfied, because they are sure that it cannot be said that their work is not the same as that of a sorter. If it can be facilities in country districts is agitating proved to the contrary after exhaustive inquiries they will accept the decision. I desire also to refer to the case of a man named Gardiner, who was sent to Beaufort as a postal assistant. He is a married man with a wife and family, and, as it is impossible for him to secure a house he has to board at an hotel, and his wife and family have to live in Melbourne. He is compelled to maintain two homes on a salary of about £3 per week, and his position is so acute that he is actually borrowing money to meet his current liabilities. I have appealed to the Minister on frequent occasions to send a single man to Beaufort, and allow Gardiner to be transferred to a town where house accommodation is available. This matter has been before the Department for at least six months, and numerous promises have been made. It was said that this officer refused to transfer to Bendigo, but the only com.munication he received in connection with .the matter was over the telephone. Xaunceston the postal officials are endeavouring to carry out their business in the same room in which the Customs work is handled. The room is open to the public, and when ithe Customs official leaves the premises, he cannot place any parcels under lock and key, and if they should be lost the responsibility will rest upon the Postal Department. I brought this matter under the notice of the Department of Trade and Customs and the Postal and Telegraph Department seven or eight months ago, and received an assurance that an alteration would be made, but nothing has been done. It hardly seems necessary to bring, under the .notice of the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) the totally inadequate salaries paid to the officers in his Department. The work of the Department needs re-organizing from beginning to end, because we cannot expect men to assist in. conducting an enormous business on -paltry salaries such as the Department is paying, particularly in country districts. Many of these officers have to put up with a great deal of inconvenience, and in some cases hardship, ""and it is time practical consideration was shown them.. The lack of telegraphic and telephonic the minds of many people. I h one small district in the electorate which I represent there is a keen demand for telephones, and when I applied a little while ago for an instrument on behalf of a resident in the locality I was informed that there were 149 applications prior to mine. We are informed every time we submit such complaints that the shortage of material is the cause of delay, but it is useless accusing the present Postmaster General on that account. There has, however, been a lamentable lack of foresight, and we should have reached the stage when a more satisfactory service could be rendered. Immediate arrangements should be made for providing some of the material obtained locally. Large numbers of telegraph and telephone posts will be required, and if the Minister has any idea when the wire and insulators will be available his Department should get to work to obtain what posts can be secured here, so that further delay will not be experienced when shipments from overseas arrive. The posts, of course, should not be obtained too far in advance, but the position could be carefully watched. Despite the promises made, returned soldiers are not getting fair treatment in the Post and Telegraph and other Departments. I receive complaints in this regard from all parts of the Commonwealth. I do not blame the Postmaster General personally, because I know that he is interested in returned men, and is anxious to do his duty. They",129,Postmasteb Genebal S Depabtment
783,Mr Jackson (Bass) [4.29 A.m.],In,130,Postmasteb Genebal S Depabtment
784,Mr Fleming (Eobertson) [4.30 A.m.].,"are, however, not receiving fair treatment. To qualify for appointment in the telephone workshops in Melbourne, certain returned soldiers passed an examination (No. 535), which was held on December, 1914-February, 1915. The first twelve successful candidates, five of whom -were returned soldiers, received appointments prior to the date on which the Act giving preference was passed by Parliament. As the number of candidates to be registered was fifty, it is reasonable to assume, considering twelve candidates were appointed in four months, that their appointments would not have been delayed to any extent if the measure had not been made law. placed in a very serious position, and they have assured me that while they .were on active service they lost four years; but they have now lost two years in addition. The Act is not only being used to keep them in their ordinary positions, but is being employed to their actual detriment. One would expect that the fact of a man having gone to the war should be sufiicient in itself to accord him the preference which Parliament has decided he should have. The successful returned soldiers of whom I have been speaking five in number received their appointments, but only as from 18th July of this year, and at the minimum salary. appointments have been made of junior and cadet mechanics with no war service, despite the advice of the Prime Minister that promotions were to be suspended. Many now receive the maximum salary. These men say'We ask that our appointments ibe dated back prior to the date when the next examination was 'held for junior mechanics to qualify for the position of mechanic. Appointments have in some cases been dated back, as the last examination of Jfaval Staff clerks was held in April, 1918, and all soldier or sailor candidates were appointed as from 1st January, 1918. Evidently, in some other Departments these men are getting the preference which was deliberately provided for them; but in the Postmaster-General's Department, not only have they failed to receive that benefit, but they are actually losing a greater percentage of time than is represented by the years in which they were away on active service. I again suggest that something should be done in the direction of preparing for Mr Fleming. that mass of material which must sooner or later come to hand, so that, from the moment of its arrival it may be put to use. When our men went to the war, Parliament considered that f u l l provision had been made that, at least, they should not lose anything by joining the Australian Imperial Force. Here, however, is afforded definite proof of returned soldiers being penalized as an outcome of the loyal service which they gave to their country. Notwithstanding all the money which has been voted for the use of the Postmaster-General's Department, there is not sufficient to clean up arrears. They have been If the whole of it were spent there would still remain a tremendous amount of urgent work to be put in hand. There would still be, for example, 4,000 to 5,000 metropolitan telephone connexions in respect of which applications are in hand, beside numerous country telephonic applications, none of which can be dealt with. There are many paying trunk line proposals in regard to which investigations have been made, and authorizations issued. The work, how, ever, cannot be put in hand because supplies are not available; and supplies are not available because the Department has had to go without reasonable monetary assistance. There are still In the meantime, other services, which have been approved of after departmental inquiry. But all must stand over,' at 'any rate, until next year. On top of the present arrears there will be accumulated applications covering another twelve months. This congestion in a great Department has become so serious that unless the trouble is dealt with in a business-like manner, and without further delay, the confusion must become far worse confounded. We must grapple with the situation. A wise and practical suggestion has been offered; indeed it is the only business-like proposition. A special loan must be raised for the Postmaster General's services. It is most unfair that business men urgently requiring telephone facilities should be compelled to wait for months or years before their requirements can be satisfied. Such a state of affairs would not be tolerated for a moment in a privately-conducted enterprise. There are still other matters worthy of urgent attention. For example, there is that of the purchase of sites in various parts of the country. Although the work.",130,Postmasteb Genebal S Depabtment
785,Mr Bowden (Nepean) [4.49 A.m.],"thereon is crying out for attention, the proposals have had to be put on one side because no money has been voted which can be applied to such purposes. During the war the public were ready to accept certain inconveniences, but the time has come when some solution must be found for these ever-growing problems. They are not merely those of one State or city, but of the whole of Australia. Everywhere there is chaos or a condition bordering upon it . I know of several postal sites in my electorate where something ought to be done without delay. Blocks of land which could have been purchased last year for one-third of the value placed on them this year will cost still more before the Postmaster-General's Department will have taken them over. We are paying hundreds per cent, for the delay occasioned in such directions as these. I wish to. refer to the matter of the partial decentralization of work from the main metropolitan head-quarters, and the extended powers given to district inspectors. This alteration represents a move in the right direction; but the inspectors should have been given increased status and some additional remuneration. The responsibilities which they are required to incur in the discharge of their duties are much greater than before, their work has been very considerably increased, and there should be some financial acknowledgment of the fact. Much has been said concerning returned soldier employees. Unlike the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr manent men. I appeal to the PostmasterFleming), when I receive a letter having to do with a matter outside of my electorate I make a practice of sending it on to the representative concerned. I have particulars of numerous cases of reasonable complaint which I would be justified in making known;,but I shall refer to one only as being typical. A young man who had been a wireless operator enlisted during the early stages of the war and applied to serve as a wireless operator on the transports. Before he had left Sydney, however, he was told that his services were required in the Postmaster-General's Department and that he could not be given leave. Being an enthusiast and a loyal young man, he said he was determined to get away with the troops. He was told that in order to do go he would have to resign. He took that course and served on various transports for five years, during which period he was once torpedoed. For some time after his return he failed to secure employment. He has since returned to the Postmaster-General's service as a postal official. He had had about seven years' experience in the Department prior to enlisting, but those seven years have been lost to him. He has had to start afresh, and his seniority has been affected, simply because he went to the war. This case is not isolated. I am sure that every honourable member would stand behind the PostmasterGenerali f he were prepared to make a determined effort to get out of the muddle in which he finds himself. I hope the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) will persist in his endeavours to secure more money, for his highly important Department. The Minister is a most able administrator, but he is severely handicapped, and, unfortunately, while the Ministerial head may be, and is in this instance, kindly disposed towards returned men, there are bound to be some errors creeping into his administration, to the detriment of former soldiers. I have had much to do with letter-carriers, who consider that they have had reasonable cause for complaint. Among these are numbers of returned soldiers, temporarily employed. They are now finding themselves put off to make room for others who have successfully undergone examinations and must be found jobs as perGeneral to see that no returned soldiers are displaced. Their work as letter carriers is of an outdoor character and, for that reason, it eminently suits the health of the men. The Minister has been endeavouring to find other branches of employment for them, but I trust that there will be found to be outdoor avenues which will be made available. I desire to devote a few moments' attention to the need for better post-office facilities at Mentone, which is a flourishing centre in my electorate. Promises have been made for years past. A postmaster formerly stationed there, had to move on account of the high rent charged by the owner of the building in which he was established. The local municipal council was approached with a view of giving consent to the use of a building for the purpose of a post-office. This,",131,Postmasteb Genebal S Depabtment

In other words, no further cases before the Minister( Mr Wise) in examinations should be held until those this Committee, because such matters I who have already qualified have received take to his Department, where I have appointments. never had any refusal to give them consideration.' If it is a matter of policy the Minister speedily fixes it up himself, and does everything it is possible for him governed by the Public Service regulato do. Therefore, I am not going ,to tions. waste the time of the Committee by discussing matters which can be better atference to the statutory age and nontended to in the Department.

793,Mr Foley,"Then it would be betterall his time to make ends meet, hut, rightly or wrongly, he thinks that the Public Service is the place for his children. I do not hold the same view. I do not think that the Public Service gives one sufficient scope. A t any rate, this man's boy passed the Public Service examination and qualified to fill a position in the post-office, but when the services of a boy were required in his district a boy from a distant part was brought in to £11 the position. An exceedingly important aspect of the postal question has been lost sight of by those who have preceded me, or, at any rate, has not been adequately presented by them; that is, thai we still appear to be living among the relics or, shall I say, the wreck of the old ideals, or the unwritten law that all postal, telephonic, and telegraphic development should be under-; taken out of revenue, and not out of loan money. I admit that these Estimates show a slight measure of reform in this respect, but this Parliament, and the people of Australia must face the newer conditions. Our endeavour to carry out postal and telephonic work out of revenue has made us lag frightfully behind in all forms of development. The people must make up their minds that in order to provide adequate postal facilities of every description it will be necessary in future to have the works financed out of loan moneys, so that there will be no need to wait until they can be built out of revenue. I would like to have discussed other aspects of the administration of this important Department, but so much has been said and so little time is left to say any more that I leave the question now in the hope that in the future we shall have no excuse offered for not building new post-offices or establishing telephones in country districts, on the ground that the Department has no funds available for the purpose. a.m.] I wish to draw the attention of the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) to a condition of affairs in his Department which I think might be altered by him, acting in conjunction with the Public Service Commissioner. I refer to the classification of post-offices, which affects partment is £35,186, as against last not only the importance of the offices concerned, but also the salaries of the staffs operating in them. Although a post-office outside a city may be quite as important as one in a capital city, and may even be doing more work, it is graded as a country office, and the postmaster in charge of it , and all the staff under him, are placed on the level of all other officers in country post-offices. the same trouble in Launceston. wrong. The business of the Postal Department should not be measured by location or by the fact that one office is situated in a capital city, while another is in a town outside the metropolis of a State. The system of classification to which I object has led to chaos in the Department, but I understand ithat it cannot be altered without an amendment of the Public Service regulations. the head office of a State cannot be anywhere but in the capital of the State. needs to be rectified. We have the anomalous position that a Postmaster superintending a staff of forty or fifty officers in a very important post-office, and a man who has over thirty years' service is not receiving two-thirds of the salary of a headmaster of a public school with only half-a-dozen teachers on his staff. That is the position in two different services operating alongside one another throughout the States. It is wrong to have those men receiving perhaps a httlo more than £300 a year, and controlling departments where the income runs into thousands of pounds, and where there is a staff of perhaps thirty or forty employees under them. A private firm v would pay such officers a salary of from £1,000 to £1,500 a year. It is a disgraceful state of affairs, and the sooner the system of grading is altered the better. a.m.] I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister the question of the employment of returned soldiers in the Postal Department, particularly those in temporary employment.
