SS. senting the Minister for Supply and Shipping whether the vessel River Mitta, which left Melbourne on or about the 20th October for Sydney has not yet berthed in .Sydney, or, if it has berthed, transport of motor bodies from Adelaide has not yet had its cargo unloaded. As this experience is typical of vessels trading between interstate ports of Australia, will the Minister have prepared for the information of the House a statement showing the average time taken from the point of departure in Melbourne to the point of unloading in Sydney of interstate vessels carrying cargo? What does the Government propose to do to speed up the movement of interstate vessels and the discharge of cargoes in order that shortages throughout the Commonwealth may be speedily relieved? has happened to the steamer Rvoer Mitta. If its trip and the subsequent handling of during the year ended the 30th June, the cargo have been the same as usual, I cannot do anything about it. If there is some abnormality which the Australian Government can rectify, we shall try to do so. I shall endeavour to obtain for the honourable member the information he seeks, and supply it to him. the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping a question regarding the accumulation of cargo, particularly motor bodies, at Port Adelaide. This matter was discussed on a previous occasion with the Minister for Supply and Shipping, and certain ships were sent to South Australia. Has the Minister seen a statement in the Adelaide Advertiser pointing out that the accumulation of motor bodies is endangering the employment of workers in Adelaide, and that ships cannot be obtained to load the bodies. Has the Minister noted that ships have left Port Adelaide without motor bodies, although they had space available, and that other ships wth space unoccupied had passed Port Adelaide without stopping to pick up motor bodies? Will the Minister inquire into the matter, seeing that the present situation is seriously affecting rhe workers engaged in the industry in South"" RIVER MITTA ""-TRA.NSPO.K T OF Australia, as well as the motor assembling works in other parts of Australia? statement referred to by the honourable member. I know that there has been some difficulty about getting ships for the to other parts of Australia, and I am sure that the Minister for Supply and Shipping will try to overcome the difficulty if it is possible to do so. The trouble is largely due to the scarcity of ships for the interstate trade. The Commonwealth Shipping Board is trying to overcome this difficulty by building more ships suitable for the trade. In the meantime, many motor bodies are being transported by road. Works and Housing seen a press statement by the Director of Housing that, last, 45,2S2 houses were started in Australia? Can the Minister say how many were actually completed and occupied? houses were finished. We published the number of houses commenced in order to indicate the activity in the building industry. Before the war, the number of bouses commenced very nearly equalled the number of houses finished in any one year. Since the cessation of war, however, the difference between the commencement rate and 'finishing rate has sometimes been as high as 40 per cent., due partly to the ineffective control exercised in some of the States after the Commonwealth relinquished control. Control by the .States is now operating more effectively, and the gap between the starting rate and the finishing rate is beginning to diminish. We are now gradually getting back to the position that existed before the war. I shall obtain the exact figures and furnish them to the right honourable gentleman.",12,Petrol Rationing

The honourable gentleman made some inquiries and gave me replies that seemed satisfactory. However, I find that I must bring this matter before him again. I propose to read a few sentences from a letter addressed to me by the Australian Association of Relatives and Friends of the Mentally 111. These sentences, which will be sufficiently explanatory, readMembers of the a'bove association 'are greatly disturbed because they are being worried and harassed to pay out of a basic wage on top of the taxation claimed for social services from them as units of the Australian Commonwealth, a regular sum of money to the Public Trustee for their patients in public State mental hospitals. One member has, over the past sixteen years, paid £800 in payments. He has had a policeman sent on three separate occasions to view his working man's home by the trustees. Now he is being threatened that, if he does not .pay the amount demanded, he will be brought before the court. The trustees made a proposition to this member that, if lie hands over the home (a cottage) they will allow him to live in it free of rent until he dies, and they will not ask any more money of him fo'r the maintenance of his wife who has been a patient in Mont Park for the past sixteen years. This patient works hard for the Government for which he receives nothing . . . . This case is only one out of thousands of unfair treatment of decent citizens. able member has quoted sufficient to make her question clear. Mrs. BLACKBURN -Will the Minister authorize an investigation of the whole of the problems of the mentally ill and their relatives, or those who are responsible for them, in order to ensure that none but fully qualified psychiatrists and doctors may hold positions in public mental hospitals; that hone but fully trained nursing staffs shall attend patients in all mental hospitals; that invalid pensions shall be paid; that permanent domestic staffs shall do all the institutional work, or if patients are employed they shall be paid fairly for the service they give; that patients shall have the benefit of craft classes under suitable teachers, wherever their capacity would justify such occupation; and, finally, that the status of the mentally present prevails to something more in keeping with an enlightened age? member has asked a series of questions. I shall not make a long reply or ask her to place it on the notice-paper. I shall pass on the question to the Minister for Health and Social Services for examination and reply. I may inform the honourable member, however, that the whole of the matters raised by her come within the jurisdiction of the State governments. The Minister for Health and Social Services is trying to overcome most of these difficulties by consultations and conferences with the State health authorities which are designed to bring mental institutions within the same category as hospitals under the Hospitals Benefits Act.

With regard to the general dollar position, one of the two Australian officers who had been visiting London to participate in the dollar discussions has returned to Australia within the last fortnight, but we have not yet been able to obtain a complete picture of the dollar situation and its effects upon imports from dollar areas. Despite much pressure at an earlier stage no additional restrictions were placed upon imports from dollar areas because the United Kingdom Government itself had exercised no such discrimination. However, the Australian 'Government has always kept a fairly substantial restriction on imports from dollar areas. The situation is being examined by a special staff which has been directed to consider import licences. I speak of import licences because I know that inconvenience can be caused by the recalling of licences. The Minister for Trade and Customs and I are to meet in conference on Tuesday afternoon to hear a report on the progress made in the review of import Hcences, and also to hear statements on the general dollar situation in relation to imports. I shall endeavour to obtain the figures which have been given to the British House of Commons, and will try to get information from the Chancellor of the British Exchequer concerning where the dollars have gone. If possible, I shall make a short statement on the position before this sessional period ends. I may say, however, that a review of interim reports last night indicated that the dollar position is rather bad, and dollars available for purchases by this country are in very short supply. It looks in other countries, apart from beas though the Government will have to impose even more restrictions on imports from dollar areas. The honourable member for Warringah will have had an opportunity of informing his mind on how the Canadian Government is meeting the situation to-day.

If I may be permitted to make passing reference to this matter, there was no proposal at that time of order. for the nationalization of banking in Australia. I understand that Alderman Chandler did a certain amount of canvassing in the United States of America, in quite a proper manner, for the purpose of ascertaining whether it. would be posUnion out of tbe open-cut method of sible to convert loans held by the Brisbane City Council. my capacity as chairman of the Loan Council, the function of which is to ensure that the best possible results shall be obtained from the conversion of loans, I intimated to Alderman Chandler that, as certain Australian governmental loans were coming clue for conversion in the United States of America, including some Queensland loans, he should desist from his canvassing, as terms might be arranged might, prejudice the terms for the conversion of the governmental loans. However, this matter had nothing whatever to do with the Australian Government. I was involved only because I was chairman of the Loan Council. The matter had not, been discussed by the Ausits coal resources, not only to meet, the tralian. Government. Any difficulties in regard to international securities in the United States of America arose some time ago. They are not of recent date. The honourable member may rest assured that the trade agreement which was made at Geneva, and which has been laid on the table of this House, will not be affected in any way by legislative action such as that mentioned. COAL. Government's policy of decentralization, will the Prime Minister explain to the House whether the Australian Government is endeavouring to coerce the Queensland Government to place the coal industry of that State under the Joint Coal Board of New South Wales? Is it a fact that the Australian Government, under the influence of the "" more militant miners' federation"", to use the words of Mr"" Jock"" Campbell, a member of the executive of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labour party those words, the honourable member is out the Australian Government, under the influence of the ""more militant miner*' federation"", is endeavouring to force members of the Australian Workers winning coal, with the object of replacing Acting in them by members of the Communist controlled miners' federation? made perfectly clear the position of the Commonwealth regarding the development, of coal resources in Queensland. The Premier of Queensland, Mr Hanlon, and I have had discussions regarding supervision by the Joint Coal Board over the development of Queensland's coal under conditions which resources. The Australian Government's only interest, in this matter is purely a national one, because we believe that the opportunities for expansion in Queensland are very great indeed. We desired to ascertain whether the State, with Commonwealth assistance, could develop requirements of its expansion, but'also, if possible, to take part, in the export, trade. There are various places like Noumea and other islands in the Pacific from for Wentworth which we require goods necessary for the Australian economy. Perhaps, at a later stage, Queensland will be able to make a. contribution to the coal needs of the southern States. We conveyed to the Premier of Queensland our views on this matter. About a week ago, I had a. telephone conversation with Mr Hanlon, and I emphasized that the Commonwealth was not attempting to coerce Queensland regarding the development and handling of its coal resources. If the State requires Commonwealth assistance by the establishment of a. Joint Coal Board, we shall consider the position. The conditions of any agreement would include the development of the Blair Athol field, and any mutual arrangement between the Commonwealth and the State would require legislative sanction.

I understand that representatives of the miners' federation w ill interview the Premier of Queensland to-day or next Monday to discuss the subject generally. I have made the Commonwealth's position perfectly clear, because newspaper statements can often lead to some f r i c tion. In this instance, there is no f r i c tion between the Commonwealth and Queensland, and so f a r as tlie Commonwealth is concerned, there w ill not be any friction. I made it clear to Mr Hanlon, or one of his officers, by telephone yesterday, that we were prepared to discuss with hi m the terms of an agreement for the development and management of the State's coal resources.

I now ask him whether he has reached a decision? on the Estimates, I did inform the honourable member for Reid that I would convey his request to the Treasurer. I have done so, and the Treasurer is now considering the matter. Commerce and Agriculture whether it is a fact that during the year ended the 30th June last, out of 3,500 tons of tallow shipped abroad from Australia, 3,200 tons were sold to India at £130 a ton, compared with the Australian ceiling price of £32 5s. a ton? Isi t also a fact that the difference between the export and the local prices is being credited to a pool? W ill the Minister distribute the money in the pool to the Government about the owners of the live-stock who produced the tallow? If so, how will the distribution be made? during the year ended the 30th June, last, considerable quantities of what is known as white-collar mutton tallow were exported to India. Those were the only shipments of tallow from Australia, because of the shortage of tallow for local soap-making. The reason why the whitecollar mutton tallow was exported to India is that it is essential in the manufacture of textiles. Unless we supplied that white-collar mutton tallow to India, it would not be possible to obtain textile supplies for the Australian people. It is true that the export price was approximately £130 a ton, but the internal price for the same kind of tallow is considerably higher than £32 5s. a ton. The manufacturers of tallow operate a voluntary pool, and the Department of ComD u r in g the consideration merce and Agriculture' gives them considerable assistance in its operation and administration. They operate the pool so as to equalize the price obtained for I tallow exported with tallow sold in Australia. WOOL. this morning contained the following report:WOOL BOYCOTT ULTIMATUM.

When I was in London, I was approached by the London representatives of Qantas Empire Airways, who desired to be considered in any scheme for bringing people to Australia by air. At that stage we had not thought of extending the sponsorI have heard of no ship of persons transported by air as well as by sea. The cost factor is important. I am told, however, that it may be possible, if an agreement is negotiated, to bring people from Britain to Australia for about £200 each. In that event, we possibly could get the British Government-'and that is one of the difficulties, of course-to agree to pay the same amount of sponsorship under the assisted passage scheme for transport by air as well as by sea. sea transport after deducting £10 from the total fare. The Australian Government pays the other half. If the scheme comes to fruition, the honourable member will find that his figure of 2,000 a year is too conservative. I am thinking in terms of 10,000 a year. HOG CASINGS. Hog casings.",17,Tallow

53,Mr Pollard,"I lay on the tableCALL FROM THE CHAIR. questions be placed on the notice-paper. Speaker. At question time it has been your practice to call honourable members on both sides alternately. Those who do not get the call one day get it on the next day, if possible. I have risen consistently for three days without getting the call. That does not appear to be consistent with your announced method of calling honourable members. -Strictly there is no point of order involved in the call from the Chair. The only requirement of the Standing Orders is that the Chair shall give the call to the honourable member he first notices. Question time is a very valuable part of the day's proceedings in that it gives to honourable members generally the right to question the Executive. Originally, it was found -that in the first 35 minutes it was possible for twenty questions to be asked and answered but this week the average number of questions asked and answered in that period has been only thirteen, largely because of the very lengthy questions and answers. Honourable members should give consideration to others by shortening their questions, and Ministers, I think, ought to shorten their answers. It is true that the method I have adopted in giving the call is to alternate between both sides of the House and between the two parties on the Opposition side, as far as practicable. possible to carry that out. strictly, but I do so to the best of my ability. I keep a list, and I start from the bottom and top of it on alternate days. have not had the benefit of the honourable member's wisdom, but I have tried to do my best by everybody. it is fair, when there are twice as many members on this side of the House as on the other, that every member of the Opposition should get the call while only half the number on this side are able to get it? expect everybody to ask questions. Under all governments, it has been usual for more questions to be asked by Opposition members than by Government supthe Government side have any grounds for complaint. noticed during tbe last few days, notwithstanding what the honourable member for Griffith says, that few Government supporters ask questions as compared with members of the Opposition; but it is becoming a practice for certain Government supporters to get the call twice and sometimes three times on the one day, while some honourable members of the Opposition side cannot get the call at all. Honourable members ask questions of a Minister who is representing a Minister in the Senate who is in charge of the department concerned, and all the Minister in this House can say is that he will place the matter before his colleague. Would it not be better for such questions to be placed on the notice-paper, thus saving valuable time? The length of time occupied over questions now as compared with a few years ago has increased so much that a meeting of the Standing Orders Committee should be held to discuss the procedure regarding the asking and answering of questions. by the Standing Orders, and the call is given, in accordance with the Standing Orders and the precedents which have been established, first to one side of the It is not always House and then to the other. It is: true that an honourable member on one side of the House might ask two or three questions during question time.;, hut I do not intend to depart from the time honoured practice under which the call goes first to one side and then to the other, whether or not this results in the calling of the same person twice. If the House thinks that the Standing Orders should be altered, it may alter them, but while they remain as they are, I will administer them as they are.

62,Mr Speaker,"The Chair is boundDebate resumed from tbe 20th November (vide page 2429), on motion by That the bill be now read a second time. This bill proposes to bring patriotic funds under government control, where they will be administered by the Repatriation Department under regulations issued by that department. The bill makes three exceptions, namely, the Australian Red Cross Society, the Royal Australian Navy Relief Fund and the Royal Australian Air Force Welfare Fund. It is easily understood why the Australian Red Cross Society should be exempt. Its work is worldwide, and is continued both in peace and in war. I can understand why the other two organizations have been exempted, but I fail to understand why certain other organizations are not also to be exempt. I want to' know whether the Government intends to exempt the funds held by the Legacy Club, the Carry-On Club, which does somewhat similar work, the Poppy Day Appeal Fund, which is devoted to helping necessitous ex-servicemen, and also the HMAS. Sydney Fund, amounting to about £200,000, which was raised after the loss of HMAS. Sydney for the purpose of replacing that ship. When Great Britain presented Australia with the cruiser Shropshire, the money in the HMAS. Sydney Fund was not needed for the purpose for which it was raised, and it is still held by the Government. Some municipal councils which contributed large amounts to the fund, have since wished to withdraw their contributions so that they might be given to the Food for Britain Fund, but the money is still held by the Government, and may eventually be disposed of at the direction of some remote official. Sub-section 1 of proposed new section 118A states(1.) The Governor General may make regulations in relation to(a) the establishment of patriotic funds; Legacy Club, and there was no suggestion (6) the raising of moneys and acquiring of assets for patriotic funds; (c) tlie control and distribution of moneys and assets raised or acquired by patriotic funds; (d) the winding-up of patriotic funds and 'disposal of the assets and moneys of the funds; and (e) the provision of penalties, not exceeding a fine or F if t y pounds or imprisonment for six months, for any breach of the regulations. (2.) In this section"" patriotic f u n d s "" means .any funds established, or to be established, for the purpose of providing comforts or financial or other assistance for(a) members of the Defence Force or their families or dependants; The Legacy Fund in Australia was established to help indigent ex-servicemen and their dependants. I say that advisedly as one who has been a member of the first Legacy Club since its inception. Members have devoted their time to assisting ex-servicemen. Under the provision which I have just, emoted this fund, or any similar fund, can be taken over by the department. Will the Minister for Repatriation say whether it is intended to do this? The very name of the organization arose from the fact that servicemen who, though perhaps like myself, were very scared during their war service, but were not badly scarred, believed that they had inherited from their dead comrades a. legacy and an obligation to look after their families and those dependent on them. The organization has now operated for many years, and has been responsible for the education of thousands of children. Members have made personal contact with the families of ex-servicemen who lost their lives. There is a system of adoption under which a member takes under his charge a junior legatee, sees that he is educated, and then placed in employment, all without charge on the Government. The fame of this organization has gone abroad, and in a recent issue of the Christian Science Monitor glowing reference was made to the work of the Legacy Club in Australia, the methods and organization of which are now being copied in Great Britain. However, in the second-reading speech of the Minister, no reference was made to the that its funds might not be taken over. ber need not be unduly alarmed, about",19,Australian Nation Al Universitybill No 2 1947

65,Mr Barnard,"The honourable memthat. There is no intention to interfere with a lot of these funds. those that will not be interfered with? Three organizations have' been specifically exempt, but no others have been mentioned. Ministers merely throw bills upon the table, and, with but brief explanation, expect the House to approve of them. The Government refuses to accept amendments, and the bills become law. the departments and are tabled. Frequently, however, they do not come before us for discussion. After lying on the table of the Housef or the prescribed period, they become law, frequently without the knowledge of honourable members. If the rules of debate permitted, I . could cite many examples of regulations that would not have stood the test of challenge. Regulations were made on an A i r Force matter, some time ago, which resulted in deductions of hundreds of pounds being made from the pay-of certain members of the A i r Force. The men protested against these deductions being made, and took the matter to court, securing a verdict in their favour. Government appealed to the H i g h Court, and won, but only now is that matter will be equitably adjusted. The Minister for Eepatriation shows very little interest in this bill. He contents himself with saying, "" You need not worry about it, "", giving us a kind of halfbaked assurance. The moneys standing to the credit of the patriotic funds have been provided by the people for ex-servicemen and their dependants. The Legacy Club, to which I have referred, was founded by a handful of men, who carried out a notable task without assistance for very many years. Only comparatively lately has the Legacy Club been able to get on its feet financially. Yet, when we show some perturbation as to the disposal of patriotic funds, the Minister, indifferently, says, "" Y o n need not worry about it "" . The ex-servicemen's organizations have done a great deal of very valuable work in solving difficult problems for the ex-servicemen and their dependants. ment was established by an anti-socialist government, of the past, but, it has lost its character since the present socialist Government assumed office. Both the Repatriation Department and the War Service Homes Commission, which were formerly We l l , why not name staffed solely by ex-servicemen, have now lost their identity, having been merged into the general Public Service. honourable member to discuss the bill. mentalities are no longer what they used to be. Other organizations are responsible for the collection of patriotic funds. Later, regulations are drafted by I have mentioned the ""PoppyD a y "" appeal, which may not register with some of my bearers in this House. It is an appeal for funds for ex-servicemen which is conducted in a big way in Victoria. The Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia is hostile to any interference with the fund established as a result of that appeal. If the Government intends to take over that fund it will be in trouble with the league. It, would be quite wrong for moneys ii be rally given by the people for ex-servicemen and their dependants to be taken over by the Government. The Minister should give us more information about this proposal; but, he merely sits in his The place and says nothing. Probably we shall have a brief reply from him and nothing more. I trust that honourable members opposite will raise their voices in protest against this shabby treatment. If the honourable gentleman thinks that he can brush aside, in that cavalier way, the sentiments expressed by the ex-servicemen's organization, we shall fight the bill. We shall oppose every clause of it , and we shall fight it outside the Parliament as well. In a very brief address last night, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr. Haylen). suggested that we could very easily accept the bill, because of the sympathy of the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Barnard) for the ex-servicemen. Even though we may admit that the Minister and his Government are in this matter sympathetic towards ex-servicefinancial men, there is no reason why we should accept the bill for that reason alone.

I suggest that instead of terpret what is meant by that provision. placing the funds to which the bill refers Under this bill, power is to be given to under the control of a public department the Government, not only to seize unexbound by red tape a responsible committee pended patriotic funds, but also to seize of ex-service members of the Parliament and dispose of the assets created by the should be appointed to advise the Governexpenditure of such funds. I do not ment on the subject. This is not an believe the Minister would pretend that original suggestion, for it was advanced there is any doubt about that. Subfirst by the honourable member for Parkes Mr Bowden. Without( Mr Haylen). I do not advocate the establishment of another board of public servants, but I believe that responsible ex-servicemen who are members of the Parliament or associated with some repatriation organizations could be constituted as a committee to adjudicate on what should be done with patriotic funds concerning the satisfactory disbursement of which there were reasonable doubts. I know that certain funds have been in existence for twenty years or more. I have had experience with some of them myself. Such funds may have been vested in trustees and the trustess may have died or they may have moved to the four corners of the earth, with the result that, at the moment, nothing can be done with the funds in question. It is desirable that use the money in ways not approved by legislation should be passed to meet such cases. done in New South Wales, where dormant funds come under tbe control of the Government. plaint about the taking of proper measures to deal with dormant funds. If such funds cannot be used for the purposes for which they were raised authority should exist to take charge of them; but the proposed new section 118A in this bill goes much farther than that. The Minister should explain explicitly the meaning of paragraphs c and d of subsection 1 of this proposed new section, for it seems to me that they provide that the Government may take over the control and distribution of all moneys and assets raised or acquired by patriotic funds and may wind up any such funds and dispose of the assets and money involved. This proposed new section is in my opinion entirely unsatisfactory, and is fundamentally unsound. If it be agreed to-as no doubt it will, for the Government has the numbers-man y injustices will follow, and many grievances will arise. [11.40] I support the views expressed like an assurance from the Minister that by the honourable member for Gippsland funds of the kind to which I have referred ( Mr Bowden). Ex-servicemeri's organiwill zations have been doing a very fine job for that will be so. These funds were accumany years in assisting needy comrades. mulated as the result of house to house Some of their activities undoubtedly come within the scope of the Eepatriation Commission, but because of delays by that body in reaching decisions, the ex-servicemen themselves considered it necessary to take steps which make it possible to give prompt assistance to needy comrades and their dependants. I have in mind a distressed diggers' fund which was established by the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia after the last war. It was substantially supported by generous-minded citizens, and its funds were also strengthened by the proceeds of sporting fixtures and the like. If this bill is passed in its present form, I fear that the Repatriation Commission may be able to assume control of such a fund, and it may the people who raised it. gentleman define such a fund as a patriotic fund? opinion, fall within the definition in the bill, for the measure is drawn in the widest possible terms. In the branch of the league to which I belong we have a committee operating which determines what disbursements shall be made from the funds available for the purpose. The disbursements are not limited to ex-servicemen who are members of the league. A great deal of good was done during the depression by disbursements from this fund. People who had not a shilling to spend were granted relief from the fund at the time they needed it most, and they were able to buy essential clothing, foodstuffs and the like. If their application had had to go before a public authority all sorts of delays may have occurred. Organizations of the kind that I have in mind were able to avoid inordinate delays, and to grant assistance when and where it was needed. It will be no answer for the Minister to say that the Government does not propose to interfere with the operation of such funds. The terms of the bill are so wide (Corangamite) that anything could be done. I should not be interfered with; in fact, the bill ought to be amended to ensure that",21,Australia N Soldiers Repatriation Bill No 2 1947 Second Reading

74,Mr Mcdonald,"It would, in mycanvassing at a time when taxation was very high. People intimated how much they were prepared regularly, and collectors called to receive their subscriptions. In one small district that I know of more than £7,000 was collected during the war years. A substantial amount was distributed. When the war ended a. considerable sum of money was still held in the fund. A public meeting was called, trustees were appointed, and eventually the funds were distributed in equal shares to the Australian Red Cross Society, the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, and the Legion of ex-Servicemen. I suggest that the Government should make a clear statement of its intentions in this connection. Unless it, does so, the confidence of the public will be sapped. The ex-servicemen's organizations are, in the main, doing an excellent -job in assisting people who are in temporary difficulties. The Minister should make it clear that funds which these organizations are administering for the purpose of assisting disabled comrades and their dependants who do not receive sufficient from the Repatriation authorities will not be interfered with, but, will remain under the administration of the persons best able to administer them. I believe that the powers conferred under this bill are far too wide to justify honourable members supporting it in its present form. Last night, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) endeavoured to assure the House that there need be no fear as to the effect of the operation of this bill on the various funds to which it applies, and that the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Barnard) could be relied upon to give sympathetic consideration to the problems which would arise. He also pointed out that this legislation provided for the winding up of certain funds which are in such a condition at present as to require this action. As experience has proved, there comes a time when it is advisable that some of these funds should be wound up. If the bill merely provided for that, I should have no objection to it. But I believe that wider action can be taken under this measure which conveys such wide powers upon the Minister. to contribute This morning, the Minister, by interjection, stated that there was no intention of dealing with some of the funds which had been mentioned, but I contend, with respect, that that is a vague general statement which we hesitate to accept. I make that assertion without any desire to convey anything offensive to the Minister himself. The issue is not whether the administration of the Minister for Repatriation, whoever he may be, under this bill, will be ""sympathetic or otherwise. If an act depends for its efficiency and successful operation upon sympathetic administration, it is a bad act. The provisions of any act should be such as to ensure that its administration, in conformity with its provisions, shall be successful and efficient, no matter who may be administering it. Because of the wide generalized powers in this bill, it is a justifiable criticism to level at it that its effectiveness will depend upon sympathetic administration. In addition to the funds to which the honourable member for Parkes referred as requiring winding up, there are many others which have been functioning for many years, and which, it is expected, will continue to function. A few minutes ago, the honourable member for Parkes asked whether these funds would come under the heading of patriotic funds. I recognized from his tone that he was actually seeking information for his own guidance. Several funds in my own electorate, two of which I recall at this moment, namely, one at Rockhampton and one at Mackay, are actually named after their respective districts. From that viewpoint, they must definitely he classed as patriotic funds. In common with the funds in many other districts, they are established by local enterprise, and are being administered by local committees. Men and women are giving a considerable amount of their time, without any remuneration but simply with a desire to serve, to the administration of these funds in a way which will benefit ex-service men and vvoraer. and their dependants. Another point that should be made, is that that fine organization the Legacy Club uses many of these",23,Australia N Soldiers Repatriation Bill No 2 1947 Second Reading
75,Mr Davidson (Capricornia) [11.45].,"local district funds in carrying out the wonderful work which it has performed for a considerable Because of that tie-up, how far would the Legacy Club be involved in any action which might be justified under this bill? Because of the local knowledge which is applied by local committees to the administration of these funds at present, a most effective service is being rendered, but every person with a practical knowledge of the position w ill agree that immediately some kind of supervision, no matter what it might be, is superimposed on the work of the local administrators, something of the personal touch is lost. It is the personal touch in the handling of these many problems which constitutes such great value To lose any part of that, will be a bad thing. The operation of the organizations which administer the various funds fills in a gap which now exists in the administration of repatriation work. The Eepatriation Department, I believe, is doing a fine job, but 'there are many cases which, because of some peculiarity, do not I want to get the attention of the Miniscome within the scope of the regulations ter for Repatriation ( Mr Barnard) at governing repatriation officers. Many of the beginning of my brief remarks, and to rhese local funds have been developed point out that I am most dissatisfied because of that fact, and they are catering with this bill.

This is information which the House and the country are entitled to have before the bill is passed. Unless some satisfactory information along the linos which I have described is given, I shall not support the bill. The honourable member for Swan( Mr. Hamilton), who was unable to take part in this debate before he left for his electorate this morning, asked me to inform the House, after discussing with me my attitude towards this proposal, that he associates himself with the fears expressed by other honourable members regarding the operation of the bill in its present form.

I have received the recall that, at our meeting of September last, a letter from Brisfrom the Australian Military Forces Special Benefits Fund to that club before making any 'payment, this being brought about by the restriction of funds due to the change-over in administration of the fund. At that meeting I submitted the following motion:That this club protests against the delay occasioned in assisting needy cases due to the change over in administration of the Austhe reorganization be expedited.

78,Mr Francis,"Well, it is a ""washfollowing letter from the Ipswich Legacymoney is frozen. When the administration of the canteen funds was on a voluntary 'basis things went along splendidly without complaint. In a fit of crankiness the Government decided to take over control of the funds and to reorganize them. The consequence of the reorganization is a denial of aid to people who need it. That is indefensible. It is equally indefensible for the Government to ask us to adopt this proposal without giving the information we want as to its intentions. I have never before seen the like of this bill. I want the Parliament to govern the country and I resent the drift towards Hitlerism that we witness in every piece of legislation introduced by the Labour Government. Abuse of the regulationmaking power was never so great as it is in this bill, because we are given no indication at all of what sort of regulations will be made. The powers asked for are greater than any government ought to he given. Patriotic funds are best administered by those who raise them. I need only instance the way in which the trust administering the Services Trust Funds has fallen down on the job to prove that. Brigadier Blackburn, V.O., is chairman of the trust. The honourable member is condemning him. toria Cross or not, if he is not making money available from the fund to help people in need, he is not doing his job. A man can be a gallant soldier, sufficiently gallant to so endanger his life in the cause for which he is fighting as to be awarded the Victoria Cross, and yet not not say that about Brigadier Blackburn, and I resent the innuendoes of the Minister. Probably his effective administration of the fund is hampered by the Government. It probably does not want him to succeed. Whatever happens it is important that the local authorities administering these funds to-day should continue to administer them. Funds raised in specific districts should be expended iri them. intended. name of heaven, has the Minister not said so before? -does not give me a chance. Why, the Minister made a speech in moving the second reading of the bill. He had all the opportunity he needed then to say everything that had to be said from the Government's point of view about the bill. The measure ought to be withdrawn and ; redrafted so as to state the intentions of the Government in regard to these funds. The concluding paragraph authorizes the making of regulations, but they should be able to do no more than to implement something to which Parliament has already agreed. Actually, the Government has not sought any power in the bill except power to make regulations, and we have not been informed what those regulations will be. _ Not long ago, the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia held a conference in Canberra, at which fears were expressed that the Government was trying to grab its funds which had been raised to assist ex-servicemen in distress. I know that there were discussions with members of the Government on the subject, and I should like to know whether the league was satisfied with the outcome of the discussions. So far as I know, this is the only bill that has ever been introduced into this Parliament which makes no specific provision for anything except the making of regulations. This is an example of executive government run mad. The Government is merely toying with the Parliament. I demand that the bill be withdrawn and redrafted in such a way as to state clearly the proposals of a goodi administrator. I do the Government. believe that there is much in the contention of the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) when ho says that the bill, as it stands, merely provides for the making of regulations about a number of things. In that regard, I have perfect confidence in the Minister for Repatriation _ ( Mr Barnard), so long as he is administering the bill; but, unfortunately, Ministers change from time to time. It may be that another Minister will be found administering this bill at some time in the future. time.",26,Australia N Soldiers Repatriation Bill No 2 1947 Second Reading

86,Mr Harrison,"In another two years'that, the change will occur in two years' time. I think that the present Minister will be administering this legislation for a long time-a t least, I hope so. Nevertheless, it seems to me that the power to make regulations is the only substantial power provided in the hill-powe r to make regulations relating to a number of things, including the establishment of patriotic funds. Well, I should like to have some definition of what is a patriotic fund, but none is contained in the bill. Finally, the bill provides for the imposition of penalties, and although some limit is prescribed to those penalties, intention for which the funds were estabit is, in fact, provided that six months imlished shall be preserved. The Governprisonment may be imposed for a breach of the regulations, and that is a serious penalty. The contention of the honourable member for Moreton is, on the whole, not bereft of reason. It is not sufficient that the bill should provide for the making of regulations, and that only. Moreover, the provision for the making of regulations is in very wide terms, and includes power to make regulations for the application of penalties of a serious kind. Well, I do not want, in a provision of this kind, to include power to impose a serious penalty These penalties, involving up to six months' imprisonment, are too drastic. AlthoughI am satisfied that the Minister for Repatriation will sympathetically administer this legislation, we cannot overlook the fact that at some later stage, as the result of a re-allotment of Cabinet duties, his place may be taken by another Minister who would not be so sympathetic. AlthoughI do not suggest that the bill should be revised as drastically as was suggested by the honourable member for Moreton, I believe that it is unwise to retain in it penalties of such a serious character. I do not suggest that the bill be withdrawn, but I ask that it be reconsidered in the light of observations made by honourable members opposite and -some honourable members on this side of the House. The granting of power to make regulations without defining what those regulations shall contain is to be deprecated. I do not believe that the Minister has given sufficient consideration to this proposal and I suggest that he reconsider it. -Most aspects of the bill have been fully discussed. I agree with what has been said by honourable members generally in regard to it. It is interesting to note that the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) agrees that the provisions of tbe bill are far too wide and that they should be reconsidered. Under this bill the Governor General may make regulations covering everything pertaining to patriotic funds and the assets that may be created as the result of the expenditure of such funds. A provision should be inserted in the bill to ensure that the ment should not allow patriotic funds to be established and then, at some later time, determine the methods of their disposal. If the powers proposed to be taken by tbe Government in this bill be exercised, as we fear they may be exercised, all incentive to subscribe to patriotic funds that may be established in the future will be destroyed. Many of these funds were originated during World WarI . and were revived during World War II . In the State with the conditions with which I am most familiar, the Justices Department ensures that the patriotic funds shall be devoted to the purposes for wbich they are raised, namely, for the assistance of ex-servicemen and their dependants. Operating within that charter those controlling the patriotic funds have been able to do very much good in the past. The necessity for building up patriotic funds was not so great during World War II . as it was during World WarI . , largely because it was possible for the Australian Comforts Fund to provide a higher standard of service for the troops than was possible, during World WarI . Arising out of the experience of World WarI . , the various comforts funds were able to do an extremely efficient job for the troops. The dependants of ex-service men and women are also being assisted from many patriotic funds. Since the end of World War II . local committees have done excellent work in helping cases of neurosis pending determination by the repatriation authorities of whether such cases properly came within the scope of the commission. Our local committee",27,Australia N Soldiers Repatriation Bill No 2 1947 Second Reading

She received £5 per week and was able by this means to carry on in a normal way. If patriotic funds such as these are brought within the control of the Repatriation Commission, local committees may be discouraged and undoubtedly in some instances the funds will languish. ceased in connection with these funds, but the administrators of the funds still operate in many localities and still distribute much needed assistance. In Queensland, in some instances, trustees have been appointed to act under the supervision of the Justices Department, and the funds are. subject to regular audit by the Queensland Audit Department. If * the persons administering the funds are not giving true effect to the. charters under which they are registered, steps can be taken to apply a remedy. It is well known that the effects of war service are only now becoming apparent in many ex-service men and women. Tropical disorders of various kinds are becoming manifest and until help can be obtained through official channels for , persons suffering from such disorders, recourse is had to local funds. We desire that state of affairs to continue. he prejudiced. Minister is sympathetic, but his conversation with me since his second-reading speech was delivered does not seem to me tn be in accord with his speech. In the , course of his speech the honourable gentleman saidFunds arc of tlie chanietor of one or ntlier tion Commission in various parts of Ausof the following classes:A.

Some of the funds are effect that where n State had satisfactory designed to serve a special purpose. legislation to cover the requirements, the know of some funds from wbich grants Governor General may exempt funds of class C from the provisions of the Commonwealth may be made to ex-service men and legislation other than those directed to winding women who desire to engage in certain up. and may exempt the operations "" of any industrial activities. An ex-serviceman, hrajich in the State of a fund of class A. i.e.. for example, may have an opportunity operation!) as distinct from establishment of tlie fund and winding up. In live States such exemptions were approved. Tasmania was the one exception. I asked the Minister whether exemption had been given to those funds and he replied in the negative. I should like him to clarify the position. I can understand the need for the winding up of dormant funds, but a good many of the funds that I have in mind may be subject to heavy calls during the next few years, for many disabilities that, Collections have now ex-service men and women are labouring under are only now becoming apparent. There, are many borderline cases that, will need assistance. I do not blame the Government because borderline cases exist. They are probably inevitable; but they also involve some delay on the part of government authorities. Delays must occur when the lines of demarkation are not clear. It is necessary, therefore, that funds shall be available to provide assistance for borderline cases pending decisions by the official authorities. In these circumstances, we should not do anything that will discourage people from making voluntary contributions to local funds. I hope that the Minister will give careful consideration to the points which I have raised. [12.30] I support the remarks that have been made on this bill by honourable gentlemen on this side of the chamber. .1. regard the provisions in clause 3, in I know that the particular, as dangerous. If they are put into full effect it is inevitable that the administration of many patriotic funds will be seriously interfered with, and that injustices will be inflicted upon deserving people. If patriotic funds are placed under the control of the Repatriatralia there will undoubtedly be considerThe people who have provided these funds through voluntary contributions should be allowed to continue the administration of them if they I to acquire a business of a kind in which he desires to engage, but may not have",28,Australia N Soldiers Repatriation Bill No 2 1947 Second Reading

91,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"the necessary cash to pay the deposit required. It is true that he may make application for assistance in this regard under the re-establishment programme which is being administered by the Department of Postwar Reconstruction; hut such applications are frequently subject to long delays before determinations are made. In the meantime, an ex-serviceman could very easily miss the opportunity to acquire the desired business. Various local committees, however, have funds available from which advances may be made to meet these circumstances. If the control of such funds be taken over by a government authority, delays in the granting of applications for assistance will undoubtedly occur, and for this reason the funds will not be so readily accessible to ex-servicemen as they are at present. The ex-servicemen, of course, reimburse certain of these funds when applications which they have made for advances under the re-establishment programme have been granted. Similarly, when ex-service men and women apply for repatriation benefits, delays almost invariably occur, and the individuals concerned are able to obtain temporary relief from local sources. If , however, these local funds come under government control, delays in the granting of relief from them will also occur. A certain amount of red tape is used in every government department and the existence of local funds of the kind to which I have referred is a mitigating factor in this connection. I greatly fear that if the Government takes charge of all patriotic funds, as it could do under the terms of this bill, individual incentive will be killed, and ex-service men and women will be denied the assistance which voluntary contributors to such funds intended should be readily available to them. We all know that private citizens have worked hard to establish their local patriotic funds, and they should not be denied the right to administer the funds. Auxiliary organizations for the relief of individuals who served in the Navy, the Army and the Air Force, have done splendid work, and the patriotic instincts of the private citizens, organizers of these funds and subscribers, who organized these activities, should not be ignored. I quite admit that at times Mr Bernard Gorser. a regulation may be broken here and there by persons who are anxious to give help without delay in deserving cases; but this is not a sufficient reason why the Government should assume control of all these funds. I have in mind one fund to which local residents contributed more than £2,000. It is being used to assist ex-service men and women to obtain equipment to engage in various primary producing activities. The ex-servicemen can obtain advances for the purchase of implements to cultivate and sow their ground, and for other essential requirements. Many of these local funds are almost a necessary adjunct to schemes established by the Government for the assistance of ex-service men and women, and people will resent any attempt by the Government to assume control of them. The bill provides that heavy penalties may be imposed on individuals who commit breaches of the regulations, but care must be taken that over-zealous officials shall not act in a way contrary to the best interests of ex-service men and women for whose benefit these patriotic funds have been established. Proposed new section H'8A which will be in? serted in the principal act if clause '3 is passed provides(1.) The Governor General may make regulations in relation to(a) the establishment of patriotic funds; (6) the raising of moneys and acquiring of assets for patriotic funds; (c) the control and distribution of moneys and assets raised or acquired by -patriotic funds; Id) the winding-up of patriotic funds and disposal of the assets and moneys of the funds; and (e) the provision of .penalties, not exceeda fine of Fifty pounds or imprisonment for six months, for any breach of the regulations. It would be most unfortunate if government action resulted in discouraging the civilian population from, doing everything possible to assist ex-service men and women to re-establish themselves in private life. This bill will produce unwarranted interference with certain funds. I am anxious that ex-servicemen shall continue to receive the advantages which the many of whom are women, have provided. I object to a proposal that the control of these funds shall he assumed by the Government and, perhaps, their assets be sold. For these reasons, I oppose the bill. [12.38] -I s the Ministerf or Repatriation ( Mr Barnard) prepared to grant me the adjournment of the debate? is one of those extraordinary things which emanates from this most amazing Government from time to timea government which has already indicated in the Ministers of StateB ill , which was introduced this week, that it considers that the services of Ministers to the country are not nearly sufficiently well rewarded. About that subject we shall have something to say next week. The interesting point about the short bill now under consideration appears on the reverse side of the single sheet. The measure contains only three clauses, and, of them, the third is the most interesting. I admit that I did not glance at it until only a few moments ago, but it has certain definitions. For example, "" the war "" is defined as. . . any war in which His Majesty became engaged on or after the third day of September, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine. Then, there is the definition of "" the Defence Force"". Honourable members will notice that I am starting at the end of this proposed new section and working up to the beginning of it . "" The Defence Force"" includes. . . any force raised or maintained under the Defence Act 1903-1041, the Naval Defence Act 1901-1934 or the Air Force Act 1923-1941, whether in Australia or overseas, and the Australian Army Nursing Service. I come now to the beginning of the proposed new section. It readsThe Governor General may make regulations in relation to I know that you, Mr Speaker, w ill not allow me to make any reference to the Governor General. undesirable to do so. knew that you, sir, would not allow me to do so. I understand that; so that anything which I have to say on the subject will be 3aid outside the Housei n Melbourne next Saturday week. Paragraph a of sub-section 1 of proposed new section 118A provides that the Governor General may make regulations in relation to the establishment of patriotic funds. According to the definitions which I have just read, the establishment of these patriotic funds must be in relation to the war in which His Majesty became engaged on and after the 3rd September, 1939. It seems to me rather peculiar that the Government should consider that new patriotic funds w i ll be established in relation to a war which has ended. That is working in reverse. It reminds me of some of the expressions which are attributed to Einstein, about whom I do not know a great deal, but about whom I have read a little. He said that if we know how to do certain things in relation to time, space and other matters, it is possible for us to leave the world to-morrow, stay away from it for 100 years and come back yesterday. That reminds me of what the Minister has in mind regarding the establishment of patriotic funds relating to a war which has ended and for the use of forces 99 per cent, of whose members have been demobilized. The only Australian forces now in existence are now in Japan, and some of those troops did not take part in active operations. Apart from them, we have a few troops scattered in the islands to the north of Australia. The Governor General may also make regulations in relation to(6) the raising of moneys and acquiring of assets for patriotic funds. I submit that proposed new paragraph b is closely related to proposed new paragraph a. I can conceive of the Government being concerned, perhaps, about the raising of money for the purpose of augmenting a fund, or improving the assets of patriotic funds already in existence and established in relation to World War II . But it is most unlikely that there w ill be any attempt to raise money or acquire assets for patriotic funds which have not been established. Therefore, I am rather in the dark as to why proposed new paraI said I graph a has been included in the hill. Next we have paragraph cthe control and distribution of moneys and assets raised or acquired by patriotic funds; Why the Governor General, which means the Ministry of the day, should want to control these funds, which are usually",29,Australia N Soldiers Repatriation Bill No 2 1947 Second Reading

Minister heard of the old saying that you do not cross a. creek until you come to it? and we want to do something about it. What' does the honourable gentleman suggest when funds cannot be wound up? Minister state one fund that cannot be wound up? Minister is conforming strictly to the rule applied by the Ministry for some time. It is a rule that only a ministry intoxicated with its own power and its belief that it is in permanent occupancy of the treasury bench would formulate. I have a strong suspicion that even the records of the famous the Sth November have not eradicated from the minds of my friends opposite that awkward delusion. the atomic bomb to explode. They have been well party asking for atomic energy for answering the right honourable member for North Sydney. Paragraph e readsthe assets and moneys of the the provision of penalties, not exceeding a fine of fifty pounds or imprisonment for six months, for any breach of the regulations. We have not, seen these regulations, but since regulations made by the Governor General must conform to the statute, they must deal with four different things. They must be regulations for the establishment of patriotic funds. Is it, proposed that there is to be a fine not exceeding £50 or a term of imprisonment, not, exceeding six months imposed on any one who establishes patriotic funds? That is what this clause provides for. The Minister claims the right to fine a man £50 or imprison him for six months if he establishes a patriotic fund in contravention of the regulations. We have not seen the regulations but penalties are provided for the raising of money and the acquisition of assets. The House is entitled to see these regulations.
