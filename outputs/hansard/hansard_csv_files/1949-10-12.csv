""Will the Treasurer state whether consideration has been given to this matter, and if so, whether it is possible for further consideration to be given to the desirability of allowing concessional rebates to taxpayers in such circumstances 3 by the honourable member has been considered by a number of Treasurers and governments. I do not think that the position of a de facto wife is analogous to that of a sister who is looking after a single man. A de facto wife occupies a somowhat different position in the home from that of a sister. The conditions governing thc allowance of concessional rates in respeot of de facto wives are fairly strict, and have regard to the character of the union and to children that might result from it. This subject has been considered on a number of occasions because of the continual requests that have heen made that the concessional rebate should be extended to cover taxpayers such as those mentioned by the honourable member. Up to the present the Government has not been able to see its way clear to allow a rebate in respect of sisters who occupy such a position hi the home because such a practice would be open to very great ""aBuses, askod the Attorney-General a question in relation to the impounding of some gramophono records which had been brought to Australia by Mr Dixon, the well-known Communist.

However, I am obliged to the honourable member for reminding me of the matter. HIGH COURT. General seen a statement attributed to the honourable member for Warringah, in which the honourable member is reported to have stated that, if Labour is returned to office, the people might expect the High Court to be stacked with Labour supporters? Does the Attorney-General not consider that statement to be inaccurate, misleading and utterly false? Will the right honourable gentleman outline to the House the appointments that have been made to the High Court since Labour assumed office in 1941, and state whether or not the Government has already had ample opportunitysubmit, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the honourable member is not asking a question but is inviting the Attorney-General to make a statement on a matter of general policy. In so doing, I contend that the honourable member is out of order. Chair's impression is that the honourable member for Martin is asking the Attorney-General what appointments have been made to the High Court during a certain period. He is entitled to ask that question. Attorney-General whether it is true that the Government has already had an opportunity to stack the High Court had it wished to do so, but so far from doing so, it has actually appointed only one justice since 1941. Dr. . EVATT -My attention was directed last night toa statement made by the honourable member for Warringah, and, I think, repeated at the week-end by another Opposition member, the Leader of the Australian Country party. I take this opportunity to say' that the statement is completely inaccurate. It is a complete untruth from beginning to end. The matter has never been considered by the Government, and such a thought has never occurred to members of the Government. There has been only one vacancy on the High Court bench during the regime of the Curtin and Chifley Administrations. The Government's appointee to that vacancy was the then Chief Justice of Queensland, Sir William Webb, and not the slightest objection to his appointment was raised by any member of this House, or any political party, or any representative of the legal profession of Australia. The same may be said without exception of other judicial appointments made by this Government. There has not been one -breath of criticism of such appointments. Therefore, I say that it is wrong and wicked that statements such as that referred to by the honourable member foT Martin should be made, without authority, in an attempt to mislead the people. Clearly, there is no justification for the statement. referendum on banking? for Richmond now talks about a referendum. I pointed out yesterday in answer to another honourable member that, during the whole period of the war, a vast percentage of the High Court's decisions favoured the Government. The question of additions to the High Court Bench is not being considered, and, to use the words of the honourable member for Martin, the statement to which he has referred is inaccurate, misleading and utterly false, but I prefer to call it a simple, downright untruth. the Interior whether he has read the report on civic administration made by MrH .

The Russian delegate stated that no steps have been taken by the Australian Government to place natives in charge of any aspect of the administration of its trusteeship territories. Is the Minister in a position to inform me whether that statement i9 true? If appointed to any significant posts in the administration, are any steps being taken to so appoint them? Are any natives being trained for such purposes? If they are, what is the nature of the posts to which they may be appointed and where is the training taking place? the honourable gentleman has referred. They were made not only by Russia but also by other countries. The Australian delegates at Lake Success replied to them. I cannot say offhand the present stage of the plans of the Minister for External Territories to provide for natives hearing some degree of administrative responsibility in the territories. I shall obtain the information for the benefit of the honourable gentleman and inform him accordingly. recent transaction in which the Government purchased for £145,000 a property known as Somers Camp and which they sold two years ago for £20,000. Is the Minister for the Interior aware that the shareholders of the company that bought the property two years ago have made a profit of 100 per cent, in the transaction ?

22,Mr George Lawson,"Will thehe has received advices from the Acting High Commissioner for Australia in the United Kingdom, Mr Norman Mighell, to the effect that the Polish Government has refused to supply petrol to Australia? If that is a fact, has the Tight honourable gentleman any comment to make upon the matter, particularly in view of the many statements that have been made by leaders of the Opposition parties in the tory press that petrol was available from Poland for the asking? earlier about the matter, and I have no -desire to add to it now. The position is .that an Australian company submitted .a request to the Commonwealth for a licence to import petrol from Poland. -Speaking from memory, I believe that the petrol was to be loaded at Stettin. We were not quite sure about the currency position, and, naturally, we consulted the Bank of England and the United King<d©in Treasury, which are the British authorities responsible for exchange control in regard to dollars, in order to satisfy be necessary, are being undertaken by ourselves about the situation. We intimated to the applicant company that if it could buy petrol for sterling, and pay the freight and insurance charges in sterling, the import licence would be granted. Later, I received from the Acting High Commissioner for Australia in the United Kingdom a cable in which he said that the representatives of the applicant company had approached him on the subject. They had found that a difficulty had arisen in obtaining an export licence from the Polish Government, and they asked whether the Australian Government would make representations to the Polish Government about the matter. I sent to Mr Mighell a icable in which I asked him to inquire of the Polish representative the reasons, if there were any reasons, for his Government's decision not to grant the export licence for the petrol which, the company had said, could be bought in Poland. The Polish Government has briefly informed us that it was not able to grant the export licence. We already knew that it had to bring crudes from the Persian Gulf to Stettin, and then take them inland for refining. The petrol would be extremely expensive in such circumstances. I understand that Poland has not sufficient petrol to meet its own requirements. The Polish Government has made it clear that the only reason for its refusal to grant the export licence is the unavailability of petrol. Minister whether it is true that the petrol consumption of Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities amounted to 800,000 gallons in June and 942,000 gallons in July, compared with an average monthly consumption of 680,000 gallons. I made a comment As the coal strike did not affect consumption in June, what was the reason for the big increase in that month? Will th» Government instruct departments that they must keep their consumption within the quota of 800,000 gallons a month, which the Prime Minister told the premiers was the Commonwealth's petrol allocation, just as all other fuel users are compelled to limit their consumption of petrol to quotas? Is it a fact that numerous new inspectorial activities, which were not previously considered to departmental officers with the use of motor cars, thereby increasing the Commonwealth's use of fuel? consumption in June was higher than in previous months. I have taken the trouble to make a personal examination of returns which show the use of petrol by Commonwealth departments and by Ministers which have been supplied to me by the Minister for the Interior. I have also asked the Public Service Board to direct its inspectorial staffs in the various States to ensure that petrol is not used for other than what can be reasonably regarded as essential or reasonably essential purposes. I made an inquiry into the reason for the increased petrol consumption in June and learned that practically all of the fuel was used for absolutely essential services, mainly in connection with the carriage of materials. The honourable gentleman mentioned the coal strike. Before the strike actually commenced coal was being rationed, and the New South Wales Railways Department had reduced the number of goods trains engaged in the carrying of building materials, &e.

That being so, there was no justification for taking anj action against departments or departmental officers. I told the Premiers what quantity of petrol was being used by Oommonwealth departments, but I cannot remember telling them that that quantity -would not be exceeded. It is obvious that if there were a complete cessation of railway traffic to Canberra, where much building is in progress, it would be necessary to use motor lorries to bring cement here from the factories. Indeed, it is even now very difficult to get cement carried by the railways because of the shortage of trucks. I assure the honourable member that I have examined particulars of mileages covered by Commonwealth vehicles, and the quantity of petrol consumed. Upon occasions, I have had to take up cases with the Ministers in charge of departments, when I thought that there had been excessive travelling by administrative officers, and I have asked Ministers to make persona] inquiries. There will be no unavoidable use of petrol by Commonwealth departments. Prime Minister has stated that people who hoard petrol will be dealt with. Since the Commonwealth has no power to ration petrol, can the Prime Minister say whence it will derive power to prevent people from hoarding petrol, or to punish them for doing so? honourable meniber has put is that if some persons-and the practice has been particularly pronounced among certain wealthy primary producers-hav e hoarded excessive quantities of petrol, the Government has no power to take action against them. the Government would obtain power to deal with persons who hoard petrol. been closely examined. Certain legal difficulties are associated with the matter, but we believe that they can be overcome not, perhaps, in the way that the honourable member thinks, but in an indirect way, in the distribution of future supplies of petrol. I shall arrange to have that aspect of the matter explained to the honourable member when there is a law on the subject. Civil Aviation seen reports to the effect that Melbourne is likely to be bypassed in the international air race, which has been organized by New Zealand to taka place in 1953, because there is no international airport in that city? As Essendon is the busiest airport in Australia, and as there is accumulating evidence of disability caused by the lack of international aircraft landing facilities in Melbourne, will the Minister review thedecision not to make Melbourne an international airport? the reports to which the honourable member has referred, but I can quite under-* stand the reasons for the decision not fd make Melbourne a point on the route of the international air race to New Zealand. So far as I am aware, that city would not be on the direct track to that dominion, and competing aircraft would need .to make a diversion in order to pass has also suggested that Melbourne should also be made an international airport. The explanation why that has not been done already has been made before, but I repeat it now for the honourable gentleman's information. The agreement between the United States of America and Australia provides for an international airport at each terminal. Airports have been established in accordance with that agreement, and any proposal for a variation of the agreement would have to be made by either the Government of the United States or the Australian Government. Personally, I see no necessity for such a variation. The net result of making Melbourne an international airport, and of permitting any international service to terminate at Melbourne, would be that the designated airline of the United States of America, Pan-American Airways, which might be more heavily subsidized than Australian airlines, would be able to send their aircraft to Melbourne, and compete with Australian National Airways Proprietary",15,Petrol

WIRE. sentations from the Tasmanian Farmers Federation and from individual farmers who have made overtures to Titan Nail and Wire Proprietary Limited, of Hobart, in respect of their urgent requirements of feed wire, which is used in the production of barbed wire and staples. The company also manufactures nails, and is a great asset to Tasmania's expanding economy. Will the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Development take action to ascertain whether there is any possibility of increasing Tasmania's quota of wire feed, which is manufactured at Ryland's works at Newcastle? distribution of supplies of wire for the manufacture of nails was under .the jurisdiction of the Division of Industrial Development of the Department of Postwar Reconstruction. However, because the Government was advised that it no longer had any constitutional authority to decide what allocations should be made to the respective States, it informed the State governments that, as from the lst July, it could no longer undertake the task of allocating materials to the States. Although the Commonwealth has no power in this matter, the Department of Post-war Reconstruction has referred to the manufacturers various representations that have been made to it from time to time, and the manufacturers have been able to accede to many of those requests. I shall be happy to make representations to the company with a view to securing greater supplies of wire for Tasmania. year, I addressed a question to the Minister for Immigration about Tunicay Casas and his wife. Tunicay Casas was formerly secretary of the Communist party in New Caledonia, and a contact man for the Communist party in South blast Asia. The Minister stated that they had been given until the end of May to leave Australia. He added that if they had not left by then they would be deported. Have they yet left Australia ? If not, has any order been served on them? Were representations made on their behalf and if so, by whom ? Has the Minister stayed his hand in this case because Tunicay I have received repreCasas and his wife are an embarrassment to their landlords, or is he trying to help their landlords? Have reports been received about visits paid to these people by native crews of ships that come from New Caledonia and Indo-China? Did the Australian Security Intelligence Organization recommend the deportation? the honourable member asked me a series of questions about these people, and I remember the answers I gave. On that occasion, I stated that these people occupied a building in Ash-street, Sydney. This particular partnership of sandwich suppliers occupied the cellar and the Liberal party occupied the garret. If members of native crews have been visiting the place, they may have been coming to join the Liberal party. I shall make inquiries, and answer at a later date the various questions asked by the honorahle member. of the Minister for Immigration been drawn to a report that John Brownlee, the well-known tenor, and his wife were barred by French authorities when they attempted to enter France on a new Australian passport, and that they were escorted back to their boat and returned to England the following day? It is a fact that every person who desires to enter Italy on a new Australian passport is obliged to pay 50s.

The report to which the honourable member has referred is the sort of stupid report upon which the honourable gentleman would base a question. I heard from somebody a few days ago that there had been some complaint of the sort that the honourable member has voiced. The truth of the matter is that Australians experience no difficulty in entering any country provided they make arrangements to obtain vises. However, Great Britain and a number of European countries have entered into an agreement whereby they mutually agree to discard the use of vis6s. Australia was asked .to become a party to that agreement. Switzerland was one country that asked us to do so. Certainly, Italy was not a party to any agreement, because at that particular time the peace treaty in respect of Italy had not been concluded. Thus, I do not know what Italy's position would be. I explained this matter when it was raised by the honourable member for Parramatta after he returned from a trip abroad. I then pointed out that for security reasons, it is not desirable that Australia, which is of human freedom? If no action is situated 13,000 miles from Europe, should permit persons to enter this country without a proper vise. As we are not prepared to allow other nationals to enter this country without vises, we cannot expectother countries to allow entry to our nationals without vises. However, persons who wish to travel would not have the slightest difficulty in obtaining vises if they make proper application to the authorities of the countries they desire to enter before tliey leave Australia or at the diplomatic and consular office of such nations in British countries. marked "" British passport"" ? "" Australian citizen "". "" Britisli passport"". under the new nationality law we describe ourselves as "" Australian citizens "", and Great Britain has altered its passports similarly so ithat residents of Great Britain are not described now as "" British subjects "" but are primarily described as "" United Kingdom citizens "". The whole of the alterations are consequent upon the passage of new legislation. The whole of thc issues raised were answered when they were first mentioned by the honourable member for Parramatta and they were more fully discussed when the Nationality and Citizenship Bill was under discussion.

If not, will Australia protest against this infringement taken by the United Nations, for how long are we expected to perpetuate the farce of Russia using the United Nations for its own ends and yet refusing to accept any decision that makes for the betterment of conditions affecting humanity? ber for Maranoa wishes to criticize the United Nations, he should not found his criticism upon one incident of this kind, to wliicli there is, I think, a complete answer from the point of view of the United Nations.

Dame ENID LYONS -Has the Minister for the Army seen the report in the press of .the 5th August that in the previous six months 5,000 members of the Citizen Military Forees had resigned ? Can the Minister say whether that is true? If so, to what does he ascribe those resignations? Can the Minister also say whether the number of troops on strength at that time was only 15,798, although the establishment provided for a strength of 50,000 troops ? press statement to which the honourable member has referred. It is totally inaccurate. The figures were probably computed by someone who was trying to write down the Citizen Military Forces training scheme, which has been in operation for only twelve months. The strength of 50,000 troops is envisaged over a period of five years. I consider that the achievement of a strength of almost 16,000 troops within a period of little more than twelve months is a very fine effort.

The broadeasting of parliamentary proceedings from all stations on that day was from 12.49 to 12.51^ p.m. The breakdown was due to a fault that developed in a rectifier at Goulburn.

57,Mr Dedman (Corio,"Minister foiare the adjustment of ranks of members of the military forces after war service, which is covered by clause 4, and the unauthorized use, possession, or supply of uniforms and emblems. Clause 15 will strengthen the existing provisions of section S3 of the Defence Act in relation to the latter. In addition, it is proposed to amend section 124 of the Defence Act to enable regulations to be made under that act to deal with the following matters which are now covered by National Security Eegulations:-The suspension, variation, or cancellation of allotments of pay of members of the military forces; the extension of existing powers in the Defence Act to regulate and control buildings, &c, in defence areas; certification of death and the post-mortem examination and disposal of the bodies of members of the defence forces who die while on service; prisoners of war; command and discipline of bodies of the Naval, Military or Air Force or any two of those forces acting together; aud provisions relating to the administration of oaths and the execution of powers of attorney by members of the defence forces. Apart from the provisions of the bill which arise out of National Security Eegulations, the most important amendment proposed _ is that which relates to the composition of the Permanent Military Forces. to the Parliament on the 4th June. J947, on the Government's post-war defence policy, I said that the army programme provided for the raising of permanent forces, including a field force, certain fixed estahlishtaents, and cadres for instructional, administrative and other duties. These forces, which are known as the Australian Eegular Army, have been raised under war-time powers in the Defence Act which will cease as soon as a proclamation is issued terminating the "" Time of War "". Section 31 of the act provides that, except in time of war, no permanent military forces shall be raised or organized except for administrative and instructional staffs, including certain specified corps. It is therefore proposed to repeal the existing section an ' to replace it with a section which will give the necessary statutory authority for the Australian Eegular Army. Other provisions to which I invite the attention of honourable members are to be found in clause 14, which gives statutory recognition to the Australian Cadet Corps, and in clause 19 which regulates the appointment of officers to the Australian Eegular Army. With the establishment for the first time of an Australian Eegular Army, it is considered that the restrictions imposed by the existing section 148 of the act are too rigid, and the bill therefore provides such relaxation thereof as is considered necessary. It is intended that the amending act should commence on the lst January, 1950, that being the date up to which the continuance of National Security Eegulations is authorized by the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act 1948. Provision is made in clause 20 of the bill for the continuance in force, under the Defence Act, of the National Security Eegulations specified in that clause. These will be amended or repealed as soon as it is practicable to prepare and gazette new regulations under the Defence Act as now proposed to be amended. I commend the bill to honourable members. adjourned. NAVA L DEFENCE BILL 1949. In my statement That leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Naval Defence Act 1910-1948.

60,Mr Eioedan (Kennedy,"Ministe rEates) Eegulations, which will cease to be effective after the end of 1949, will not be further extended. It is desired to have the necessary provision to enable the services of certain senior commissioned officers and commissioned officers who received their appointments by virtue of the National Security (Naval Forces) Eegulations to be continued. Normally, those officers would not be eligible for employment, being over the prescribed age, or lacking some other qualification. HoAvever, owing to the acute shortage of officers in the Royal Australian Navy, if is essential that the services of the temporary officers be retained whilst new appointees are entered and trained. The efficiency of the Navy would be seriously affected should it become necessary to dispense with the services of temporary officers before it became possible to replace them. tbey are all volunteers for further service, and that none is being retained against his will. Under the approved naval programme, many more permanent officers will be required than was the case in pre-war days. Every effort to obtain those officers is being explored, but it is not expected that the existing shortage wili be overtaken for a number of years. The bill also gives power to the Governor General to make regulations for the fixing of eharter rates and establishment charges in respect of ships requisitioned for naval purposes. This will allow the making of regulations under the Naval Defence Act to replace the National Security (Naval Charter Eates) Eegulations. most vessels requisitioned during the war have since been returned to their owner3 or have been otherwise disposed of, there are a few still under charter, and it is necessary to continue a charter rates board. The board is the authority for fixing charter rates and establishment charges in respect of requisitioned vessels. Owing to changing conditions, charter rates are altered from time to time, and it is therefore necessary for the Charter Eates Board to be in a position to function while vessels are still under requisition. It is unlikely that the last of the vessels will be derequisitioned before the end of 1950 at the earliest. I commend the bill to the House. Sfr. Riordan. adjourned.

As usual, of course, he has not hidden his light under a bushel. From time to time, he has told us exactly what progress he has been making; but let us consider the figures. The Minister would have us Whilst believe that he is responsible for a flow of immigrants to this country at a rate which is without parallel in our history. For everything that he has done, and is doing to bring to this country immigrants who can be absorbed into the body politic, he is deserving of commendation, but I point out to him and to the country, that the results achieved so far are not satisfactory. Immigration to Australia throughout our history has ebbed and flowed. At times the stream of migrants has swelled to a rushing torrent, and at other times it has shrunk to a mere trickle. On occasions, the stream has dried up. During the period 1910-14, long before Australia had the advantage of the efforts",22,Second Eeading

The average rate of entry was 129,702 migrants a year. During the period 1946-48, when the honourable gentleman's scheme was in operation, 218,381 migrants entered this country. The average was 72,000 migrants a year. When we consider that the population of Australia during the years 1910 to 1914 averaged 4,940,000 and that to-day it is, according to the latest figures that are availahle, 7,794,000, we see very clearly that the results of the honourable gentleman's scheme, notwithstanding the advantages that it has derived from his association with it, have proved to be distinctly disappointing. tralia gained 648,512 persons, or slightly over one-eighth of the population at that time. One-eighth of the present population is 974,360 persons, but the actual gain that has heen made under the Minister's scheme is approximately 218,000 persons. After the first World War, between 1919 and 1921 there was a net gain of 211,333 persons. Between 1946 and 1948 the net gain was 65,000 persons. If the excess of departures over arrivals in 1946 is deducted, the figure is 50,570. to make is that the situation in which AusThat is an average of 16,000 a year as against an average of 70,000 a year between 1919 and 1921. As I have said, I commend the Minister for his efforts to bring the right kind of people to this country, but I say to him that he ought not to grow weary with well doing. I have read with great interest a brochure entitled Policy and Progress that the Minister has made available to me. It is chiefly remarkable for the admirable photograph of himself that appears on the first page. I admit that he has enormous advantages over me in that respect. Candidly, I hand him the bun in tiiat connection. When I read th<» brochure, which I did as part of my duty as a member of the Parliament, I found that the photograph was much the best part of it. But although migration is a most important factor, it has always played a subsidiary part thc growth of population of this country. For over a century of our history it has borne the same relation to been equalled since. During the growth of our population by natural increase as one bears to three. I am sure that the Minister has noticed, because few things escape his notice, that in days gone by the birth-rate in Australia which was, with the possible exception of New Zealand, the highest of any country in the English-speaking world had fallen to a dangerously low level. Lately it has taken an upward trend. Eor that, many thanks. I am not endeavouring now to deal with the birth-rate in detail. I am merely pointing out to the Minister that migration cannot, of itself, solve the problem. I am thoroughly alive to the point that although the birth-rate may swell our numbers, for a generation it will be unable to provide us with more people who are Between 1910 and 1914 Auscapable of co-operating in the development of our resources and, if need be, in the defence of this country. I remind the Minister that included in the 218,000 people who were brought to this country between 1946 and 1948, were a great many children. That remark applies, of course, to the migrants who were brought to this country before World War II . It is inevitable that the kind of people that we want will he people who bring children with them. The point I am endeavouring tralia finds itself to-day is one that ought to cause every one of us great concern. Aft-ithe first World War, the world had no experience of the effects of great conflicts. The victory had been won although at a great price. The fighting forces, of course, suffered enormously more casualties than they did during the war of 1939-45, although civilian casualties wero much less. I was a delegate to the International Peace Conference, and the members of that conference believed that the world had before it then an unbroken vista of peace, and that it might confidently look to the League of Nations to iron out the differences and settle disputes between the nations that had formerly led to war. Our subsequent bitter experence taught us, however, that although the League of Nations was theoretically capable of preventing war, practically it proved a broken reed. Now we are confronted with a situation that is incomparably more menacing than that presented to us after World War I. Because no one can predict the future, I speak with some hesitation in this matter, but it cannot be denied that our present position must give us great concern. I point out to the Minister that ""UNO"", Nations orgiiiiization, is simply another name for the "" League of and that where the League of Nations failed the United Nations hope to succeed. been impressed by the contributions made by the Attorney-General Evatt) to entertain mankind with his injunctions to "" Leave everything to United Nations organization.

Its members make speeches, but action is outside their This morning we have hepn fc""!' 1 more of what it is doing. The fact remains that Russia takes no notice whatever of the United Nations. Russia knows perfectly well that the United Nations is impotent. I am not, of course, accusing the Minister for Immigration of worshipping at that shrine. I am merely pointing out that Australia is at once the most inviting and the most vulnerable country in the world. War may he averted because Russia is not yet ready to assault the world by armed force. One thing, however, cannot be averted, and to that I direct the attention of the Parliament and of the country: the world's population is increasing unevenly, and at c great pace. Australians are the heirs to and trustees of this vast island continent, vvhich, although it contains a great area of barren waste, can absorb tens of millions of people, as the Minister has himself very properly pointed out. With others, I believe that the potentialities of this country have not yet been even envisaged. In the fullness of time, Australia must hold tens of millions of people. represented in that body, but only Time works great changes. vvhich was our ally during World War I., was our enemy during the recent war, and came within an ace of overwhelming us. Indeed, but for the United States of America, the Japanese would have overwhelmed us. Previously we were Mr Hughes. shrouded in remote distance, and lay securely sheltered under the broad wing of the Royal Navy until the outbreak of World War II . The British Navy is no longer mistress of the seas, and sea-power itself has declined to a secondary place the United in defence.

The present popuWe have all lation of Japan is the greatest on record and is increasing at the rate of over (Dr. 1,000,000 people a year. I remind honourable members that Japan occupies an area only one-twenty-fifth of Australia whose population of 8,000,000 is increasing all too slowly-and here I come lo the point from which I set out. Whilst war may be averted, the danger that arises from the uneven distribution of population, and particularly from the ambit. tremendous increase of population ih the densely congested nations of the east, must inevitably create a situation full of menace to this country. The present population of Japan is 80,000,000, and is, as I have said, increasing at the rate of over 1,000,000 annually. It has now reached saturation point. Japan can hold no more because she can feed no more, but still the increase of population continues. Where are those surplus millions to go? Where can they find a country at once so inviting and so vulnerable as Australia? What armed forces have we that can stop them? It may 'be that the Japanese will not come with arms in their hands, 'but will knock at the door of the United Nations, demanding a place in the sun and an opportunity to build homes in our country. Since the Japanese are human beings, what can the United Nations say? They have the right to live. That body will deal out even-handed justice. It can afford to regard this matter from a detached point of view. Fifty-four nations are Japan, four or five of them are able to strike an effective blow for anything, including their own defence. But they may decide our fate. However, if the Japanese come with arms in their hands, we cannot stop them. The days of isolation are gone. We have to play our part in the full spotlight of the world, which is looking on. The world will say: "" Here is a people who will neither populate their country nor allow others to do so "". 1 have not the time nor the opportunity now to discuss our White Australia policy; it is enough for me to say, "" I am for a White Australia policy "".

Indeed, we have never been in a position to defend this country from aggression by a major power. Had it not been for the efforts of the United States of America in World War II . , we should have been undone; and had Japan been permitted to settle its nationals in New Guinea, we should have been undone anyhow. War may be averted, but there is danger in the congested populations of the eastern countries in particular. For those surplus millions, there is no escape from death by starvation save by migration. They must find a way out, and I ask again where can they go but to Australia? What do we intend to do to prevent them? Without powerful friends we cannot hope to defend the country against them. We must populate and develop this country, and so order ourselves that the world will say, "" The Australians are a people worthy of their freedom and of the right to the unfettered control of this made the hest use of his time, and, if as he great country, because they are carrying on as civilized people"".

We are now to play our part under the spotlight on the world stage before the refer back to the period from 1910 to nations of the world. Therefore, we must ensure that we shall be able, first to defend this country to the best of our ability, and, secondly, to develop its resources and absorb assimilable people. The Minister is trying to do that, and I commend him for it. I now desire to make another point. If we are to hold this country we must populate and defend it. We must look to our defence forces. I ' believe in the principle of a free people governing themselves. We in this country have attained the widest measure of freedom of any people in the world. We enjoy our democratic parliamentary, institutions, although mark you, they are threatened by the Labour party. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Order! The right honourable gentleman's time has expired. right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) is worth listening to on the subject of migration. In fact, I listened to him with bated breath, because I suppose that he is the most spectacular British migrant that we have ever had in this country; but his incursions into the field of migration during the debate were extremely limited. He yielded to his well-known political cunning to traverse such subjects as the birth-rate, the defence of Australia, the United Nations, the White Australia policy and population trends, the development of the inland, the future of New Guinea, the possibility of another invasion, and communism. ciated subjects. ciated subjects.

92,Mr Haylen,"They all are assofigures unrelated to any other period, that that was the era of the high tide in the golden age of immigration and that, comparatively speaking, there is only a trickle of immigrants to-day, is of no avail. If we accept the period from 1910 to 1914 for the purposes of comparison with the present, we must also take into consideration factors that were not mentioned hy the right honourable member for North Sydney. Immigrants in those days were put on ships at the expense of either the Australian Government or the Tjnited Kingdom Government and were tumbled out on the wharfs of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Fremantle and other ports and left to fend for themselves. The result of that policy was that, as the swelling tide had poured on to the wharfs and landing stages, so eventually many of the immigrants flooded the social welfare camps during the depression. Any man who did any social work during the depression will realize that the poor little immigrant, who had been badly selected in the first place without any aptitude tests or anything of that sort, was the first one to go into our "" Happy Valleys"" and other such centres, where he was given the dole, some clothing and the lowest level of comfort. There can be no proper comparison 'between the two schemes in terms of numbers alone. Humanitarian treatment must be taken into account as well. Otherwise, the comparison is too remote even to be considered. In 1914, immigration was looked upon by the idealists as a means of increasing our population and developing the country for its eventual preservation and progress. It was also looked upon by others calmly and coldly, with the business-like eye of the man looking for cheap labour in order to break down workers' standards and destroy unionism. That made an ugly story. To-day we accept immigration as a subject above politics. I have always considered that repatriation, immigration, and two or three other subjects should be lifted above the level of politics, though not, of course, exempted from political discussion. Unfortunately, the tributes that are paid to the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) by honourable members opposite are of a ""yes hut"" character. body admits that the honourable gentlen-an has done a splendid job in the face of competition from other countries, notably South Africa, New Zealand, and various .South American States. Yet honourable members opposite say, "" Yes, he has done a good job, but he has failed to do this or that"". They link the arrival of immigrants with the White Australia policy and declare that the Minister has not handled that policy effectively. I consider that his outlook upon both immigration and the White Australia policy has been exceptionally broad and statesmanlike. Despite criticism from various sources, he has proved himself to be a great Australian in these matters. When, our present immigration scheme was commenced in 1945, our chances of obtaining new citizens from a bruised and broken Europe and from an England engrossed in the problems of reconstruction appeared to be almost hopeless. There is no royal road to success with immigration. We cannot wait until we have empty houses and everything else in readiness for immigrants. Nevertheless, the only thing that has been lacking has been adequate accommodation. Courage and statesmanship have enabled us to go ahead and to use the services of new arrivals in providing the things that we lack. Prospective immigrants are frankly told the truth about conditions in Australia. The story of this immigration scheme is one of the post-war epics. The project has been carried out efficiently and magnificently in spite of failures that have occurred elsewhere and in spite of the reluctance of people in Europe to undertake the long trek to Australia. We have overcome indecisions and the doubts of trade unions in Great Britain about mass immigration. Immigrant ships are leaving for Australia in increasing numbers, and the estimated net immigration figure for this year is 148,000. In view of the shortages that were caused by six years of war, that figure represents a magnificent achievement. The difficulties involved in the immigration scheme are not confined to those of Everytransporting people to Australia, but most of them have been satisfactorily overcome. As the right honourable member for Worth Sydney has said, we must anticipate certain new .problems. For instance, the migration of people under the auspices of the International Eelief ally cease. From what other source will we be able to obtain migrants? Some people suggest Germany, Scandinavia, and Norway. There are many reasons why it will be difficult to persuade people to come to Australia from those countries. Therefore, we shall be obliged to turn to the surplus population of Great Britain. One of the really difficult decisions that must be made relates to the number of British migrants that will come to Australia. I predict that the numbers will grow and that the proportion of British immigrants to other European immigrants will become considerably higher during the next ten years than it is now. That will be all to our advantage. The Australian attitude towards the nomination of British immigrants poses an administrative problem of which the Minister is well aware. The nomination of an immigrant, imposes a sacred duty. The nominator takes upon himself and his family the responsibility of providing for the accommodation of an immigrant or a number of immigrants without affecting the housing of native-born Australians. system break down, as the result of insincerity on the part of nominators or nominees, bad feeling would be created and the scheme would be seriously prejudiced. At present, the nomination system is at the top of the news and is being treated idealistically. men's organizations are sponsoring shiploads of British immigrants. The first sponsored ship to reach our shores was Somersetshire, which I met in Sydney on behalf of the Minister for Immigration. I was particularly impressed by the good type of ex-serviceman that the Returned Sailors Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia is bringing to Australia. At the back of my mind is the fear that Australians will not stand up rigidly to their responsibilities as nominators. It will not be sufficient for a nominator merely to bring an English immigrant into his home, bed him down for a few weeks until he becomes Mr Haylen. accustomed to his new surroundings and then tell him to try to find accommodation for himself. If we want to make Australia a greater, economically stronger and more progressive part of the Organization will eventuEmpire than it is now, Great Britain will supply the people that we need. It will be up to us to provide those people with an assurance of security of tenure, and we can do that only if we adhere strictly to the nomination system. It is only fair to insist that the native Australian shall have preference in obtaining housing accommodation, and the Government has done so. If new arrivals seek to break away from the nomination system and obtain houses which should be occupied by Australians, the system will break down. Then the Minister will face further problems. If the nomination system fails, he will have to decide what kind of immigrants hc will bring to Australia from Europe and what proportion of new arrivals will be admitted from Great Britain. Those are the only potential flaws in the present scheme. The right honourable member for North Sydney related the subject of immigration to the population tension in the East, to the United Nations policy in relation to the open door for coloured peoples, and to other subjects that have .Should the nomination been discussed in Australia for more than 50 years. Neither the Minister for Immigration nor the Government as a whole has suggested that the immigration scheme provides the answer to our low birth-rate. Immigration is only a supplementary measure. However, it will Ex-servicebring many useful citizens to our shores. Up to date, the department has touched only the fringe of the potential field of recruitment. When the difficulties of transport are lessened, when Europe haa settled down, and when we can find ont exactly how many men and women are willing to come to Australia, great things can be done. Without being mealymouthed, we can pay a glowing tribute to the Minister for having done great work for our country. At the same time, he has done a great deal to ease the tensions of population and reconstruction difficulties that have caused a great deal of disturbance in Great Britain. Comparisons with the past or speculations about tbe future are futile. The Governbeliefs the opposite of my own, they have ment's migration scheme is based, not on been completely loyal and tireless in their numbers, but on humanity. Immigrants, efforts to make the immigration policy upon their arrival in Australia, are not work.

It is beside the point for people, who adopt a hypocritical, supersensitive attitude to the White Australia policy to charge the Minister with committing an administrative faux pas. Such attacks may do very well for a press story or to adorn a sermon but deep in the hearts of all Australians is a feeling that we should make no concession on the White Australia policy. The right honourable member for North Sydney reminded us of his 50 years' experience in this Parliament, and he repeated what had been said at various times during that period. I claim that we have much to show for our immigration policy, and we have a plan for the future. That policy is our answer to the call of the empty spaces of this continent. The Government, in its application of the White Australia policy, is applying the law, and adhering to tradition. Erom the first days of federation, the settled policy of Australia has been to keep Australia free and white. -Immigratio n ought to be a non-party matter in this Parliament, and it has been treated substantially in that way. In general, the policy of the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell), in taking advantage of the unique opportunity to obtain a large flow of immigrants from Europe, has met with the approval of honourable members of all parties. I am sure that if the forthcoming general election should result in a change of government, tbe same policy will be continued, because we all recognize the need to populate and develop the country. Having regard to the changed attitude towards population among the white races, it is necessary for us to increase our numbers by bringing here surplus population from Europe. It is a great pity, however, that the Minister should have thought it necessary, request was refused. Consequently, when in administering his department, to be the J apanese struck, many of the civilians have as he has towards the very few were killed whilst the remainder wereAsiatics, or persons of Asiatic extraction, captured. In the fullness of time their who were resident in Australia. This handful of persons has been the cause of much dissension and international ill feeling. The Minister's treatment of them has appeared to put us in the wrong, and has earned for us a reputation for being harsh and intransigent on the subject of colour, and has done nothing to strengthen the White Australia policy or obtain acceptance for it. It has highliehted the objection to colour that is inherent in the White Australia policy, and publicized that objection to our disadvantage throughout the world, particularly in Asiatic countries. On more than one occasion the Minister himself has said that the term "" White Australia "" should not be used, yet he has made use of it more than any one else. I regret that his fine record in developing migration from Europe should be marred by these incidents which, in themselves,, are of a minor nature. In one instance a few persons may be involved, or in another instance 27 Chinese, or individual persons as in the case of Mrs. Ang and that of Mrs. O'Keefe. Those incidents do not really amount to anythingin our immigration policy, and the Government should exercise a little discretion in matters of that kind. Dealing with the proposed vote for the Department of External Territories I wish to discuss what I consider to be the very harsh and unsympathetic treatment that the Government has meted out to widows of civilians who lost thei*lives when the Japanese captured Rabaul. It is well-known that the lives of practically all civilians who were at Rabaul at the time the Japanese attacked were wilfully thrown away by the Australian Government. I say "" w i l f u l l y "" becausethose civilians had no hope pf defendingRabaul. I am not now talking about the armed forces. At that time there was sufficient shipping in the harbour toevacuate the civilian population, but the Curtin Government ordered that those civilians should remain at Rabaul. TheActing Administrator of New Guinea radioed to Australia to obtain permission to evacuate those civilians, but that",27,Department Of Immigration
93,Mr Anthony (Richmond) [12.27].,"fate was revealed. Ultimately, after a considerable period, it was discovered that a great many of those who survived the Japanese attack lost their lives when Montevideo Maru was sunk. During the period that their fate remained unknown, the Government made liberal payments to widows of male civilians on the basis -of tlie salary that the latter had been receiving. However, when hostilities -ended an accounting was made to those widows and in each instance where it was possible, to get back money paid to them in excess of the ordinary pension rate of from £2 10s. a week the Government took action to recover such moneys. In some instances it did so by making deductions from payments that the widows were entitled to draw as superannuation benefits for which their late husbands had contributed. I am in possession of several statements issued by the Department of External Territories that show that some of these widows, instead of receiving a very substantial amount, in some cases hundreds of pounds, in the form of superannuation benefit, received practically nothing at all after these -deductions had been made by the Government. I trust that the Government will see that justice is done to these widows, and I propose to show how it can do so. First, however, I draw attention particularly to the case of CaptainH . Edwards, M.C, D.O.M., M.M., whose widow now lives in Sydney. Captain Edwards had a distinguished military record in World WarI . I read the following quotation from a letter that he received from General Birdwood:I must congratulate you on your excellent record of which you may well be proud in having gained the M i l it a r y Cross, Distinguished Conduct Medal, and Military Medal. It is indeed a fine achievement .and I trust that you w ill meet with still further success in the future. -Captain Edwards's brigade commander wrote to him as follows:I trust that you w ill be long spared to wear those ribbons. They betoken a spendid record of great hardships and dangers and adherence to duty under all circumstances. I should like to tell honourable members how the Government treated the widow of that gallant officer. He was at Rabaul at the time that the Japanese struck. He had been residing there for many years previously and was second in command of the New Guinea Volunteer Regiment a few months before the Japanese invasion. He was president of the Rabaul branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. However, because at the time of invasion he was not in military uniform as the result of some dispute that had occurred between himself and others in the military forces at Rabaul, he was not considered to have been a soldier at the time of his death. Consequently, despite the fact that the estate of anybody who died as a soldier was exempt from estate duty, Mrs. Edwards was charged duty amounting to £67 on her husband's estate which was valued at £700. She had to pay that duty because her husband was not considered to have been a soldier at the time of his death. I am in possession of the documents in the case and I shall be pleased to pass them on to the Minister. I suggest that the following provision, which is set out in a letter which Mrs. Edwards has received from Mr Clive Evatt, a Minister in the New South Wales Government, should apply in this instanceNo death duty shall be payable in respect of the estate of a member of the naval, military or air forces of the Commonwealth of Australia . . . who during the present war between His Majesty the K i ng and Germany and her allies or within one year after its termination dies on active service or as the result of injury received or disease contracted on active service. Captain Edwards was at Rabaul when the Japanese struck. He was the most highly decorated soldier at Rabaul and he lost his life because the Government refused permission for civilians to be evacuated. Because he was not considered to have been a soldier at the time of his death, his widow has had to pay the penalty. She has also been denied the rate of pension payable to the widow of an officer, which is considerably more than that payable to widows of civilians. The Government can do justice in this case. Evidence given in the New Guinea timber leases case revealed that the Minister can apply the provisions of an ordinance retrospectively. The particular ordinance cited in that case was Ordinance No. 5 of 1947, being "" an ordinance to amend the Workers' Compensation Ordinances 1941 of the Territory of New Guinea "". That ordinance increased the amount of maximum compensation from £750 to £1,000. It was dated the 14th May, 1947, under the signature of the Governor General and issued by "" E. J. Ward, Minister of State for External Territories "". In evidence given during r.he New Guinea timber leases case it was stated that one person who was favorNow that I have ventilated it, I hope ably affected by the back-dating of that ordinance was a friend, or relative, of the about it. Minister for External Territories. A notable feature of the amendment effected by that ordinance was that its commencement was made retrospective to the lst January, 1947; that is, it was backdated five months in order, so it was alleged in evidence given in the New Guinea timber leases case, to cover the circumstances of a friend, or relative, of the Minister for External Territories. I have no evidence to offer in support of that statement except the evidence that was given in the course of the trial that I have mentioned. However, in view of the facts I have given I shall not believe that it is not possible for the Government to do justice to the widows of civilians who lost their lives when the Japanese captured Rabaul. civilians were at Rabaul as the representatives of Australia. I shall not agree that the Government cannot recognize Mrs. Edwards's, claim and refund the death duty that has been charged to her on account of the estate of her husband, or that she cannot be given the rate of pension payable to the widow of an officer, because her case has been settled. I shall not accept these excuses when I find that remedial action can be taken to benefit somebody who happens to enjoy a favoured position with the Minister. Those are facts. pension entitlement. pensions. introduce to the Minister for Repatriacivilians killed in New Guinea during the tion ( Mr Barnard) a deputation of the war. widows of New Guinea civilians.

The time allotted for the consideration of the proposed votes for the Department of External Terri tories and the Department of Immigration has expired. Proposed Sitting Proposed vote, £1,396,000. Proposed vote, £149,000. Proposed vote, £339,000. Proposed vote, £848,000. Proposed vote, £1,942,000. (Ordered to be considered together.) -Before attempting to approve of the proposed vote for the Commonwealth Scientific Organization, which includes the provision of £33,000 for investigation of nuclear energy, the committee should pay with this organization. Although the Government has placed the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization under administrative control of the Public Service Board, quite obviously it is still clouded with a certain amount of suspicion. A t the recent conThey do not have ference in Canadai n relation to atomic energy research, although representatives of the United States of America, Canada Those are just two instances and the United Kingdom were present, it is significant that Australia was not of those widows and war represented. That highlights certain matters that were revealed in this chamber not long ago when it was shown that there still exists in the minds of people associated with atomic energy research a grave suspicion that if secret developments in the field of nuclear energy were made available to Australia, that information might leak out to Soviet Russia. That was the basis of a lengthy debate during .which certain, documents were produced that caused an immense amount of public interest. It seems to me that that suspicion still exists in the minds of people overseas. Australia votes agreed to. is still excluded from the inner councils suspended from 12.4.5 to 2.15 p.m. of the world powers in relation to atomic research for purposes of defence. That is not to be wondered at. Although., under pressure, the Government removed the aeronautical section of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Researchf r o m its matrix and placed it under the administration of the Public Service Board, suspicion has not been allayed in the minds of our allies overseas who are closely associated w i th us in preserving the peace of the world. The reason is not hard to discover. From time to time honourable members have learned of the appointment of Communists to what was the Councilf o r Scientific and Industrial Research. Although the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) did not select the appointees, he approved of their appointment. He approved of a studentship being granted to Mr. Kaiser, who was sent overseas to further his studies in the field of nuclear physics. and Industrial ResearchA fte r he had attended at OxfordU n i versity for about eighteen months, it was revealed that he was a Communist. He",33,Department Of Immigration
101,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [2.15].,"distinguished himself by taking part in a demonstration of Communists at Australia Housei n London while still a student and under the control of the Oommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research. Organization. That was a demonstration by Communists against the action that had been taken by this Government in connection with the coal strike. By taking part in that demonstration he revealed himself as a militant Communist. Erom time to time honourable members on the Government side of the chamber have declared that every care is taken to screen persons before they are appointed to positions in connection with defence work investigation, about which secrecy must be maintained. It is apparent that either this man was not screened before appointment, or that he was appointed by the Government in the ful l knowledge that he was a Communist, and was then deliberately sent overseas to take part in nuclear investigation. He was reported to have been a research officer with the Council for Scientific and man was an avowed Communist he was Industrial Research for six years in Sydney. Indeed the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction told honourable mem' bers on another occasion that during the war period Mr Kaiser had been engaged on very close investigations of these matters, and that there was no reason to believe that he had divulged any secrets about them. no information had ever been divulged. MT.

However, I accept his trial, potential, would Kaiser still have assurance. Possibly he has some knowrefused to undertake secret research into ledge of matters that have been made atomic energy? I believe that if this availahle to Soviet Russia and can make young man had been given an opportunity that assertion with some degree of to pursue his investigations of the most accuracy. A person with no knowledge secret matters he would not have refrained of what matters had been disclosed to from doing so because he has no loyalty to the Soviet espionage service would not be this country. He also saidin a position to be so emphatic in that regard. I accept the Minister's assurance Sydnej doing research in the most highly secret that nothing was made available to Soviet division of radar-rada r counter measuresRussia. Apparently tbe Minister forgets and my work was considered satisfactory. that during the war Soviet Russia was I believe that this statement by Kaiser an ally of ours and that at that time there should be placed on record in support was no talk of atomic warfare involving of the Minister's statement that this Russia. A t that time, also, secret information was held jointly by the Soviet, \ the United States of America, and the United Kingdom. However, Soviet Russia is now conducting a cold war against its former allies, and, as the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has said, is seeking by sinister disruptive methods to undermine the democracies, including remote Australia. Following the demonstration to which I have referred Mr Kaiser is reported to have said in EnglandThe C.S.I.E. knew my views before I was sent here. This, in spite of the fact that he had been sent overseas by the organization to learn about nuclear physics! According to Mr Kaiseri t knew that he was a Communist. Apparently it sent him overseas to investigate nuclear energy so ihat he would gain inside knowledge of this su'bject. That he has no great love of this country is evidenced by the fact that he took part in the Communist raid to which I have referred. Although this appointed to the studentship overseas, with resultant waste of public money, and in effect established a fifth column overseas. Mr Kaiser was also reported to have saidI would refuse to undertake any secret research on the atom on account of ray convictions, but I have not been asked to. This young Communist forsook his loyalty to this country when he made a protest in London about the manner in which Australia was conducting its affairs. If he Before taking up this research I was in ;",34,Commonwealth Scientifi C And Industrial Eesearch Organization
102,Mr Dedman,"I said distinctly thatyoung man had been engaged in secret work during the war period, when many secrets were jointly held hy Soviet Russia, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom. When Russia determined to wage a cold war against the democracies, the position became quite different. Notwithstanding tliat the Government knew of this young man's convictions, it sent him overseas to undertake most secret research in the field of nuclear energy. By taking part in the demonstration h'e proved that he has no love for his country and that he is prepared to take any action to discredit it in the eyes of the world so as to further for known Communists. Kaiser was the objectives of communism. It is regrettable that the taxpayers' money sbould be wasted on studentship benefits to a young man, who, while enjoying their advantages, sought to bring his country into disrepute. It is true that after he had publicly revealed himself as a Communist and a man opposed to the interests of his country, his studentship was determined. If he had not taken part in the demonstration, this avowed Communist, whose convictions were well known to the Government, would still be employed in an overseas laboratory conducting investigations regarding nuclear energy, and would be in a position to obtain secret information which would be of value to a potential enemy. That information might well have been sent to Soviet Russia. Is it <iny wonder that Australia is denied admittance to discussions held by the great democratic countries of the world, including a country which cannot boast as we do, that its peoples are of 90 per cent. British stock ? Australia is exr-luded from participation in such discussions because the Australian Government is still suspect. Notwithstanding what may be said to the contrary by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, those whom the Government appoints to given access to secret and vital information are not effectively screened. I have no doubt that the Minister will claim that all those who are associated with secret defence work now have to take the oath of allegiance. That may be true; but does the honourable gentleman claim that the mere taking of an oath of allegiance will make a man trustworthy? He knows very well that Communists do not regard themselves as being bound by an oath of allegiance. Only recently honourable members opposite have questioned the value of administering an oath of allegiance to a Communist. I draw attention to this matter in order to emphasize the need for the closest scrutiny of the credentials of all those who are employed on work of a secret character. There is something wrong with the administration of a government which permits the taxpayers' money to be expended on the provision of studentships appointed as a research student in the field of nuclear energy at a time when, as far as we know, Russia did not possess the secret of the atomic bomb. Russia now claims to have probed the secret of the bomb. I wonder how much of the knowledge which the Soviet now claims to possess came from representatives of the democratic countries who were working as a part of Soviet Russia's fifth column. Honourable members will recall the disclosures that were made at the investigation held recently in the United States of America in regard to Communist activities. They will also remember that quantities of uranium of certain grades were flown from America to Russia. Leakages of vital strategic materials from the democratic countries have taken place with too much frequency. The Government cannot be too exacting in its screening of the persons selected to go overseas to carry out secret research work. We have heen told about the Pomeroys, the Rudkins, and other Communists that were employed in the organization formerly known as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. We all recall the revelations that were made by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Eadden) concerning positions in which they are statements that. were made at a meeting of Empire Prime Ministers at Downing-street, and we remember also the statements that were made in relation to this subject by the Minister for Defence at a meeting of the executive of the former Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. These revelations lend colour to the remarks that I have just made. Until such time as Australia is again brought into the discussions of the democratic nations in relation to matters of the highest defence significance, the Australian Government will remain suspect. The Minister for Postwar Eeoonstruction and the Government have done nothing whatever to dispel the distrust of Australia which is manifest in high defence circles overseas. Defence and Minister for Post-war Eeoonstruction) [2.34] -The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) haa repeated a number of allegations that have been made on several occasions in this chamber notwithstanding that they were refuted whenever they were made. His allegations against the Government are completely without foundation. He has referred to the activitrial resources to the manufacture of the ties of an individual named Kaiser and to the attitude which, he suggests, has been taken by the United States of America in relation to certain meetings between representatives of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The latter subject was raised by way of question in this chamber some time ago and the position was then fully explained. In spite of that, however, the honourable member persists in repeating assertions which are quite untrue. For the benefit of honourable members, I shall again explain the position in relation to the association of the United States of America with the United Kingdom and Canada in atomic energy research. During the war period, there was an agreeAmerica has apparently decided that once ment between the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America to share information on the development of the atomic -bomb, and to co-operate in that work. No other country in the world was invited to take part in the joint deliberations, or to assist in the project. atomic bomb, because, a3 I have said, we The undertaking was completely secret, and all information about it was withheld from every other country. The work was confined to the three countries that I have named because it was so important that no risk of the secrets of the atomic bomb being revealed to the outside world could be taken. The United Kingdom was able to contribute something to the development of the atomic bomb. Canada too was able to make a contribution. Australia could not contribute anything, and therefore was not invited to participate in the work in any way. At the end of the war, the United States of America made it clear that the agreement undor which work on the atomic bomb had been carried out co-operatively during the war had ended, and ceased to make available any information on atomic energy to the United Kingdom and Canada. From that time onwards, the United States of America worked on the atomic bomb in isolation. Since then, however, certain developments have occurred both in the United Kingdom and Canada, and the knowledge of how to manufacture the atomic bomb has become more widespread. There is no longer any secret about it. As I have said in this chamber on many occasions, any nation that is prepared to devote the necessary scientific and indusatomic bomb could achieve some measure of success in a reasonable period of time. Australia itself, with the knowledge that can be read in pamphlets and books could, if it had the necessary scientific and industrial resources-a t present it has notmanufacture the atomic bomb without the assistance of the United States of America or any other country. That is the plain truth as physicists and others who have studied atomic energy know. As I have said, for some time after the war, the United States of America worked on the bomb in isolation, but now that so much is known in other countries about the atomic bomb and atomic energy for industrial purposes, the United States of again it will endeavour to work in cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada on certain projects. That is why, I imagine, those two countries have been invited to attend a conference. Australia is not interested in the development of the have neither the scientific nor the industrial resources to set aside for that purpose, consequently we have no wish to be represented at the conference, even if we were invited to do so. The absence of an invitation does not mean that Australia is mistrusted.

Last night, when the Estimates for other departments were being considered, there was a similar occurrence. I keenly desired to speak on the proposed vote for the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, and to discuss butter production and cotton growing, but I was prevented from doing so. I notice that the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward) is not in the chamber. He is probably hobnobbing with some Liberal Premier Mr TurnbuU interjecting, cerely regret the unfortunate circumstances that are responsible for the Minister's absence, but I repeat my view that if the circumstances were normal, he would probably be hobnobbing with some Liberal Premier discussing the standardization of railway gauges. The Minister is determined to pursue that policy. With the devaluation of the Australian pound, the original estimate of the cost of that project has been increased from £200,000,000 to £325,000,000, and higher costs of labour may further increase the ultimate figure to £400,000,000. The advantages of the standardization of railway gauges are questionable, and I consider that the money would be expended more wisely in providing so many of the facilities that are urgently required for tbe development of many parts of Australia. The project that is envisaged by the Minister will replace State railway assets that have already cost £600,000,000. He plans to replace many of the existing railway lines, locomotives and rolling stock, and he is eager to begin the wo'rk at a time when we cannot get sufficient iron and steel for wire netting to prevent vermin and stock from dratroying our crops. At present, the States are importing scores of new locomol ives, and quantities of spare parts and rolling stock. They are unable to manufacture those requirements in their own workshops because constant strikes in the basic industries have reduced the production of iron and steel. Last week, the Minister was negotiating to make available to the State Premiers of South Australia and Western Australia tens of millions of pounds in connection with the project for the standardization of railway gauges. I hope that the Government will not proceed with that work but will expend at least some of the money on more advantageous projects. The limited time does not permit me to deal at greater length with the subject of the standardization of railway gauges, and I now direct my remarks to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. I have a high opinion of that body. Having been wellfounded, it is one of the most valuable institutions in the Commonwealth. The staff includes many prominent scientists, and probably a few Communists have worked themselves into its organization. I urge the Government to increase the proposed vote for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization so that it may investigate methods for destroying the pests and vermin that are doing almost incalculable damage in the agricultural and stock-raising industries. The primary producers of Europe, and, in particular, of Canada., receive wonderful assistance from thc application of scientific methods to combating pests, diseases and vermin. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization should be encouraged to devote more attention to those matters of practical value instead of to the theoretical side, which compiles reports for universities and students about what happens behind tbe moon, and in the moon. We should keep our feet on the earth in these matters. Whilst the Commonwealth .Scientific and Industrial Research Organization may be justified in investigating the effects of gases around Mars, or some other planet, il would render inestimable service to our primary industries if it were to solve the problems of the man ou the land. If science could destroy the pests and vermin, many of the troubles that beset primary producers would dinappear, and young men would have a greater incentive to remain in the agricultural and pastoral industries.

It is claimed in the booklet that there is a feeling of security and general prosperity in Australia. The research organization comments on this claim as follows:. . . Just how secure the worker is in his employment was graphically illustrated during the recent general coal strike when the number of unemployed in New Soutli Wales and Queensland exceeded that at the height of the depression. Even before the strike commenced, unemployment in New South Wales exceeded 250,000 because of the rains which occurred in tlie mining areas and the necessity to introduce some form of rationing of coal supplies so that essential services could be maintained for a short period. There were no reserves of coal. There are still no reserves of coal, and the Government refuses to do anything to establish a reserve by importing coal lest it might interfere with the miners' federation. The Government does not admit that as a reason, of course. The comment continues as follows:Prosperity, from the viewpoint of the Minister, is apparently synonymous with inflation, as the only prosperity which Australia possesses is a high national income unaccompanied by production of those things whicli incoine can purchase. National income in nionotarv terms has increased from £814,000,000 in 1938-39 to £1,915,000,000 in 1948-49, an increase of 135 per cent. Tn the same period production has increased overall only from 5 per eent. to 10 per cent. But taxation has increased by 550 per but this Government is, cent. In his booklet, the Minister discusses the Postmaster-General's Department. He points out that the department made a profit of £3,500,000 in 193S, and of £5,103,000 in 1947, but be does not say that in 1949, for the first time since federation, it w ill operate at a loss.

That publication makes it perfectly clear that housin i is the joint responsibility of the Austmlian Government and the State governments. The reference in it to housing in Western Australia makes it clear that housing in that State is under the direct administration of tbe State Government. No claim is made about the part played by the Australian Government in that State, other than that it makes a financial contribution, which is a perfectly tr-aid ful statement. material could be regarded as propaganda for the State Government. It is factual information and has no regard for political complexions. The honourable member said that the booklet on social services was Labour party propaganda. Let us look at this alleged propaganda. On page 7 of the booklet it statesIn that year the Scullin Government reduced the allowance to £4, and introduced a means test as to iiiconre. Is it "" good propaganda"" for the Labour party to talk about reducing social services ? The booklet gives a truly objective picture of the age pension. Then it saysChild endowment was introduced by the Menzies Government. Payments commenced in July, 1941, at the rate of 5s. a week. It traces the whole history of child endowment in a factual manner. That is also true of unemployment benefit, sickness benefit, widows' pensions and so on. There are certain sections in the booklet that show that widows' pensions and certain other social services came into being under the Labour Government. That is fact. As honourable members opposite know, a great many social services have been introduced in the eight years of the existence of the Labour Government. To say that is simply to speak the truth. The booklet cannot be regarded as propaganda in favour of any political party. It gives the historical background of social services. It explains the means tost. No one could regard an explanation of the means test as good propaganda for the Labour party. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) was again happy in his role of cloak-and-dagger expert for the Mr Beazley. Opposition when he found out that a gentleman named Kaiser had been systematically betraying secrets. He implied that the secrets' of the Australian Government had been betrayed by Kaiser to a foreign country. I have to agree with the honourable gentleman that one must infer from Kaiser's demonstration in front of Australia House over the coal strike that he is a Communist. There is no sense in quibbling about that. Whether or not it can be proved that he is a Communist, I do not know. AllI know is that Actually, that no section of the community other than the Communists disapproved of the Government's actions in connection with the coal strike. My point, however, is that while in the Tjnited Kingdom, Kaiser worked in British institutions. No evidence has been produced by tbe honourable member for Wentworth that those institutions were dealing with anything secret. But, if they were, and he was betraying the secret details, he should have come under the surveillance of the British Intelligence Service. We know certain people who, ih Australia during the war, were not prosecuted but who, immediately they reached the United Kingdom, were arrested. One of them was a gentleman on whose behalf honourable members opposite were vocal recently. He would be well advised to keep away from the United Kingdom. The fact is that if tliere were any real evidence concerning subversive activities by Kaiser he would be arrested in Britain and charged in that country with the offences alleged, because such activities would have taken place in British scientific institutions. It is fantastic to suggest that while Kaiser is resident in Britain he is under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman). I do not wish to deal with that subject at any great length. I desire to ask the Minister for some information concerning several aspects of the proposed vote for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Bernard Corser) criticized the proposed expenditure for scientific and industrial research. greater expenditure.",44,Commonwealth Scientifi C And Industrial Eesearch Organization
142,Mr Bernard Corser,"I ' wanted aber criticized the allocation of the expenconcerns radio research. I should like diture. He complained that not enough was to be expended on scientific research connected with primary industries. The present Minister for Defence has so far eclipsed the record of governments that thc honourable member for Wide Bay supported, and supported apparently uncritically, that the honourable member made no reference to his achievements. Under the present Minister, expenditure on scientific research has risen from £339,000 a year to more than £2,000,000 a year. The honourable member for Wide Bay made absurd claims about expenditure on astronomy and made fantastic statements about other research work which is not actually carried out. He will find that the heaviest items of expenditure under this division concern plant industry, soils and irrigation, foTest annually are regarded by doctors as products and other activities connected with agriculture. Plant industry, animal health and production account for proposed expenditures of more than £200,000 each. Proposed expenditure under item 6 of Division 113, relating to forest products, is given as £142,600. In presenting these Estimates the Minister has not explained at any great length the expenditure proposed under item 16, section C, of Division 113, "" Biochemistry and general nutrition "". That item apparently refers to an activity distinct from animal nutrition. I ask the Ministeri f his department is taking over research into human nutrition and biochemistry. There have been references in scientific journals for some time to a new line of research in connection with the growth of food crops in tbeir relation to human nutrition. Tn the past, emphasis has been placed on wheat and plant breeding and upon prolificity and milling qualities of grain. In the United States of America, which leads the world in such research, the emphasis is now upon vitamins and the nutritional content of plants. Some rather remarkable results have been announced by various universities in the United States. I should like to know to what, degree, if any, these lines of research are being pursued by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. Item8 of section C of Division 113 the Minister to explain whether the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is engaging in any research in relation to television, or whether the radio research mentioned refers only to research in connection with Australian present radio facilities. The Estimates indicate some analysis of research into food preservation and transport. Can the Minister say whether any research is taking place into the claims made on behalf of patent medicines, also into the claims that are advanced by the sellers of certain foodstuffs and certain tonics ? We very badly need an objective analysis to be made of many such claims. Many of the industries upon the products of which the public spends many hundreds of thousands of pounds being engaged in lines of manufacture that amount to absolute quackery. It seems to me that some research should be made regarding such claims, and also that consideration should be given to the advisability of requesting the States, under whose jurisdiction this matter comes, to enact legislation to prohibit advertisements based on falsehoods, in cases where it has been established by research that the claims made in such advertisements are bogus. Item 24 concerns fuel research. No doubt, during the recent coal strike, many honorahle members received a brochure from a gentleman who claimed to have a process whereby coal could be burned with much greater efficiency and with much greater utilization of its heating qualities than is the case at present. He called it the ""Anderson Process for Smokeless Fuel"". I should like to know whether that claim was investigated. The gentleman concerned asked for an analysis of his claims. There are many countries of the world where such a claim would, I am sure, receive some kind of public attention. I should like to know whether the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, which carries out tests for the manufacturers of tractors and other machinery, would also carry out tests into this man's claims which are either outrageous, or, if true, mean that he has discovered a process",45,Commonwealth Scientifi C And Industrial Eesearch Organization
143,Mr Beazley,"The honourable memthe value of which is important enough to be investigated. Items1 and 2 of section D of Division 113 refer to the provision of a total of £31,120 for research associations and research studentships. I should like to know how much of this amount is to be directed towards the tenure of scholarships in Britain. ""We have a British fixation regarding many of our overseas scholarships, regardless of the fact that the initiative in many lines of scientific research has gone from Britain, which undoubtedly led in that respect during the nineteenth century, to the United States. I sliould like the Minister to give the committee some information on how much is to be made available notwithstanding dollar differences for the tenure of scholarships in the United States. An extremely open attitude is displayed by the United States in respect of all lines of scientific research, despite the fact that member for Henty( Mr Gullett) say we are always hearing from honourable members opposite about how that country is keeping scientific developments secret as far as Australia is concerned. Item 20, section C, shows that it is proposed to spend £33,000 on research into nuclear energy, the very field in which, according to the Opposition, the United States is most concerned with secrecy. The Commonwealth could well send students to the United States. It is suggested by honourable members opposite that such students would be denied access to information concerning American research on nuclear energy. I draw the attention of honourable members opposite to the activities of General Eisenhower, the former Commander-in-Chief of the United States Army during the last war, who is now president of Columbia University in the United States of America. The United States Government offered that university a grant of millions of dollars for research in atomic energy. Because of the urging of ite president, Columbia University refused to accept any money from the United States Government for that purpose. General Eisenhower urged that tbe offer be rejected on the ground that if the university accepted money from the United States Government for atomic energy research it would be obliged to impose secrecy upon the men engaged at Ur. Beazley. that university in such research. Columbia University has the use of many millions of dollars from private funds and also has an unrivalled laboratory which, in fact, carried out much of the research that resulted in the production of the atomic bomb. So1 stress that atomic research at the Columbia University, the president of which was Commander-in-Chief of the United States Army during the last war, is carried out under conditions of a complete absence of secrecy. General Eisenhower urged Columbia University to refuse to accept the offer of that money from the United States Government because he was determined that there should be no secrecy regarding atomic research conducted at the university. I am glad to hear the honourable "" nonsense"". I shall be very pleased to present him with a copy of a speech by General Eisenhower in which he refused to accept government money so that there should be no ties imposed on research in the university of which he is president.

The regulation to which I have referred was disallowed by the Parliament after it had operated for only a short period, and the Commonwealth did nothing further about the matter. If representations were made by the State governments that they were interested in this subject and that they believed that in the public interests investigations sbould be made into the contents of patent medicines, with a view to ascertaining whether they were really efficacious for the purposes for which they are advertised, the Commonwealth would gladly co-operate through the instrumentality of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. However, until sucb time as the governments that have constitutional power over this matter show some interest in it, I do not think that the Oommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization should be asked to undertake such investigations. The honourable member for Fremantle has also asked whether any allocations of nioney have been made for scholarships in the United States of America, and, if so, what amounts had been made available for that purpose. No specific funds have been allocated for that purpose. From time to time the executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization makes recommendations to me that particular individuals should be sent to the United States of America to investigate certain problems. The executive also makes recommendations that individuals in the United States of America who have particular knowledge of specified subjects should be asked to visit Australia to assist us in the solution of our problems. Each of these recommendations is investigated on its merits. If it ie thought that a scholarship in a particular subject would benefit this country only if the student went to the United States, the recommendation is approved subject to a very thorough examination being made to ascertain whether the student concerned could not obtain the desired knowledge and training in some soft currency country. The same principle applies to recommendations made to me by the executive of the if r . Dedman. organization in relation to proposals to invite American specialists to this country. Not long ago a recommendation was made to me that an American expert in the science of genetics, Professor Lush, should be invited to visit this country. I asked whether it would not be possible to obtain the services of an expert from the United Kingdom who would be equally as reliable as Professor Lush. I was informed that the only individual in the United Kingdom who had the specialized knowledge which the organization wanted to impart to our own people who are interested in this matter was not available to pay a visit to Australia. In those circumstances, I approved of the recommendation that Professor Lush should be brought from America. Professor Lush subsequently visited Australia and I understand that the information which he imparted to our people who were engaged in the study of both animal and plant genetics has been of very great value to the organization. I believe that I have dealt with all the matters that were raised by the honourable member for Fremantle. If I have overlooked any matter I shall be glad to furnish what information I have about it at a later stage. I was very interested in the speech made by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley). When the honourable gentleman first came into this Parliament we gave him credit for inexperience, but we also gave him credit for intellectual honesty. However, during the brief period of his membership of the Parliament he has shown The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Lazzarini) -Order!

We felt that the misery and hardship of past years were things which Australia should never have to endure again. that? Labour propaganda. Notwithstanding that fact, the honourable member for Fremantle endeavoured to persuade himself nnd those who may have been listening to his speech that this booklet is a straightforward document and that thousands of copies of it should be printed at the expense, not of the Australian Labour party, but of the public. I understand that 1,000,000 copies of tbe booklet are on order with the printers. Apart from that, I want to show how the Australian Labour party has debased this booklet. A copy of the booklet which has been handed to me by the honourable member for Swan( MrI t required Mr Kaiser himself, at a Hamilton) who, like the honourable member for Fremantle, comes from. Western Australia, has plastered all over it the words, "" Vote Labour. Webb for Swan "". We have been told that this booklet is not a propaganda document, that its printing involves a reasonable expenditure of government money, and that its contents would be endorsed by every right-thinking and fair individual in the community. Apparently the honourable member for Fremantle has slipped very greatly in the three short years of his membership of this Parliament. The honourable member invoked the name of General Eisenhower, saying that, as president of the Columbia University, that distinguished gentleman had refused to accept funds from the United States Government for use by the university if such acceptance involved a. promise of secrecy in relation to any research work undertaken by the university. Those are not the facts. The honourable member for Fremantle deliberately clouded the issue. Melbourne Herald of the 6th June, 1949. the following paragraph appeared:educationists, including General Eisenhower, President of tlie Columbia University, and Mr James B. Conant, President of Harvard, said to-day that Communists should be barred froi.i the teaching profession . . . It is because members of the Communist party are required to surrender the right to think for themselves as a consequence of becoming part of a movement characterized by conspiracy and calculated deceit that they should be excluded from employment as teachers. is w r o n g w it h Although the honourable member for Fremantle invoked the name of General Eisenhower., he omitted to mention those facts, of which I presume he was aware. The honourable gentleman spoke of young Kaiser. The Minister for Postwar Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) has frequently assured the Parliament and the country that there is no need for us to worry about Communists in Australia having access to information about secret projects, and in his speech to-day he has given the committee assurance after assurance to that effect. He has said that we need not worry, because the screening authorities in Australia are so perfect and efficient that a Communist could not possibly get through the net. demonstration in London, to indicate that he had Communist sympathies. The assurances that the Minister gave us months ago, long before that demonstration occurred, have proved to be of no more value than other assurances that he has given us from time to time. The Minister's reputation in the Parliament is such that we on this side of the chamber cannot accept any assurance that he gives unless it is accompanied by documents that place the matter beyond any doubt. Although we have been told from time to time that there are no Communists in the employment of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, or the Council for Scientific and In dustrial Research as it was known at one time, they have come to light. I shall name one Communist, of whom the Minister has some knowledge, who was employed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.

Although the Minister told us that he has not approved of the appointment of Communists, we have found Communists popping up in the departments for which he is responsible.

167,Mr Anthony,"We do not wantAccording to a document that was presented to the Canadian Parliament with the Canadian budget papers, in 1948-49 the Canadian Government expended 4S,000,000 dollars upon national scientific research. That sum is probably the equivalent of approximately £20,000,000 Australian. Although the Canadian Government has expended £20,000,000 in a year upon scientific and industrial research, the Australian Government is prepared to make only £2,000,000 available this year for that purpose. There are many jobs that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization could do that it is not doing. by the Government of which the honourable member Anthony) was a supporter? Council for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch. The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr George Lawson) apparently of thought that expects to where it should begin. There would be no development if theories of that kind were adopted throughout the world. The Governnient of which I. was a membei' established the Council for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch and laid the foundations of most of the work for which this Government is now claiming the credit. On the north coast of New South Wales there are many noxious weeds that the landholders themselves cannot possibly control or eradicate, and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization could do some experimental work in that connection, but, PO far as I know, it has not done so. Nothing has been done in connection with hemp, which is fast invading some of our best land there. Very little has been done by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization in relation to the deficiencies of the soil along the coastal areas of New South Wales. The organization has one man at the experimental f a r m at Wallambah, but he has not yet submitted a report. I believe that in many instances the Government is not paying adequate salaries to its scientific and industrial research workers. The Commonwealth and the States are losing some of their best scientists to other countries because of the low salaries that they offer. The honourable member for Brisbane knows that Dr. Young, who is well known to many members of the committee, is now employed by the Government of Ceylon. State authority. salaries that are paid by Commonwealth and State departments have a certain relationship. If the Commonwealth were to increase the salaries of its scientific workers, the State governments would be forced to follow suit. Mr Lewcock, one of the most noted scientists in Queensland, is now employed in South Africa to advise for Eichmond( Mr upon agricultural problems there. Many of our scientists have been badly treated. Recently, I spoke to a man who has spent It founded the eighteen years of his life in a Government department. He is a Bachelor of Agricultural Science and a Master of Agricultural .Science. A f t e r eighteen years of belongs to the school service his salary is less than £500 a year. finish That man is employed by a State authority, but the salaries that are paid by the Commonwealth Scientific and In dustrial Eesearch Organization are similar to those that are paid by State authorities, although they may be a little higher. I suggest to the Government and to those who are responsible for the administration of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization that the time has come to review the salaries of our scientists, especially those of the top-grade men who are now being attracted elsewhere. We must expend more money upon research and redevelopment of scientific techniques. At the present time almost every brancli of trade and industry in Australia is confronted with problems that can only hesolved w i fh the assistance of scientific investigations. What can we hope to achieve on a budget of £2.000,000 ? The reports that are issued by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization reveal that the work of the organization covers many fields, but there is still much to be done.

171,Mr Anthony,"T h a t is so, but thebodies and try to make sense of them. I consider that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization should publish its findings in such a manner as will enable them to be understood by the ordinary man on the land, who has to give effect to them. to judge, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research adopted the view that once it completed an investigation, its responsibility in the matter ended, and that State Departments of Agriculture should distribute the information among interested sections of primary producers. I did not 'agree with that view. I have always believed that, from beginning to end, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, now the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, should conduct investigations and give the widest possible publicity to its findings and recommendations. The problem of hemp which is most serious in the coastal areas of New South Wales and Queensland, must be solved. This plant pest is rapidly enveloping thousands of acres, and farmers, with their present knowledge and facilities, are unable to control it. Tbey urgently require financial and scientific assistance from the Commonwealth to enable them to maintain production in those areas. If the Government adopts a passive attitude towards that problem, our production of food, especially in the dairying districts, will further decline. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction has defended the screening methods that are employed to exclude Communists from the staff' of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. I wonder whether the honourable gentleman's attention has been drawn to the report of a meeting of tbe Sydney University Labour Club some time ago, at which some 200 students protested against the dismissal from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Mr Kaiser, who had participated in a Communist demonstration in London. The report states that a Dr. Makinson, lecturer in physics, saidAmerica is endeavouring internal policy. Mr Anthony. I. do not assume that Dr. Makinson is a member of the staff of the Commonwealth.

In the early part of his speech, the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) referred to some remarks that I had made and endeavoured to refute my suggestion that the booklet on social services was not partisan. He said that I knew that that booklet contained the words, "" Vote for Labour, Webb for Swan"". I bave examined the 32 pages of the booklet, and I find that that statement does not occur on any of the pages.

The honourable member is getting several matters mixed. His point, as I understand it, relates to a ruling given in cominittee.

He was entitled to go even further for he could have taken steps to disagree with the ruling of the Temporary Chairman.

If no question of privilege may be raised in committee,, although Standing Order 280 expressly, provides that no member shall interrupt another member whilst speaking, unless to call attention to a point of order or privilege suddenly arising, then it mu9t be that a point of order or privilegecannot be raised at all, or it can be raised in the House.

239,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Order!desire to make several observations on the Estimates as they affect the Department of the Army. I do not propose to offer any general criticism of the Government's defence policy, particularly as it affects the Army, because, on a number of previous occasions I have said exactly what I think of the whole basis of defence as it is advanced by this Government. Briefly, I have always considered the Government's defence policy inadequate and an evasion of its responsibility to defend the country adequately. Its policy is lacking in courage, and is indeed a coAvardly policy. That has been said time and time again and on this occasion I do not intend to attack the basis of this country's military Commonwealth. Unit after unit goes into defence which relies on a minute and understaffed permanent army. ""We have a very much smaller volunteer army than we had before the last war. I wish to comment, however, on several aspects of the militia scheme in which the Government has put its faith. The great body of the troops who are supposed to defend this country in time of emergency is what we loosely call the militia. We were bold that we were to Have a part-time army of 50,000 men, but at the end of nearly two years after the scheme was first introduced, only 13,000 men have been enlisted. In effect we have to-day an army that is somewhat smaller than the country's police forces, and is of a contemptible strength. The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) earlier to-day raised the question of how even that very small force is being managed, and she expressed the opinion that even although its strength is so small, numbers of men bave recently resigned. I think that she cited the figure of 4,000 men who have ceased to engage in part-time training. But the Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers), as he always does when such criticisms are levelled, said that there was no truth in her statement and that it was no doubt some sort of newspaper gossip. He dismissed it as nonsense. As a matter of fact, there is a great deal of truth in the soldiers who have undertaken part-time statements that the honourable member for Darwin advanced. The Minister knows very well that recruiting for the militia forces came to a standstill some months ago, and that a large number of men have resigned or have simply ceased to attend parades; and thus have ceased to be effective. In some cases their commanding officers have had to ask such men to resign because it is of no benefit to the country to have men on the books when they are performing absolutely no service. In order, to discover how poor recruiting now is we do not require to look any further than the battalion raised in the Australian Capital Territory, which has an establishment of about 800 men, but the strength of which is actually, I suggest, below 200 men. That is a position which existsright throughout the camp with only a handful of men to be trained. Yet the Minister expresses great satisfaction over that state of affairs. He says, in effect, that it is wonderful that after two years we have 13,000 men ready to do part-time training. The militia scheme is so badly administered at the present time that the military authorities are unable to employ properly the men they have. They cannot attract more men and tbey cannot even hold those that they already have. One of the reasons for that is that the small amount that those soldiers receive in payment as a result of their willingness to undertake voluntary military training, is subject to taxation. A man who volunteers for service in the militia finds at the end of the financial year that he has earned perhaps £50 for his military service. That amount must be shown with his other income for the purposes of tax assessment, which frequently means that his voluntary service in the militia actually costs him money, because the amount that he earns thereby brings him into a higher taxation field. I raised this matter about two years ago when the scheme was first introduced and the Minister said that he would give some consideration to an adjustment of it. I daresay that he did so, but the decision was unfavorable. I cannot see the least reason for taxing the amounts paid to training, and I ask tbe Minister once more if he will reconsider this matter, which constitutes a gross injustice. A",62,Department Of Supply And Development
240,Mr Gtjllett (Henty) [4.59],"Igreat many men who undertake part-time military duties find themselves out of pocket as a result of so doing. Many of them have to travel great distances by car to engage in training and, as tbe Minister knows, the travelling expenses allowed to them are quite inadequate. In addition, as the Minister knows, or ought to know, any officer or non-commissioned officer who takes his duty seriously has to spend far more time on the training of men than he is actually credited with. I again ask the Government to give favorable consideration to the exemption of military pay from income tax. The need for inducing more young men to join our armed forces is great enough to justify sucb a course. Let the Minister take this step to show that the Government has some appreciation of what it is asking these men to do. I wish to refer now to the manner in which the figures relating to the strength of the armed forces have been presented in this chamber. The Minister has said that we have a permanent army of 19,000 men. I point out that at least 5,000 members of the so-called permanent army are really members of the interim army. It is most misleading for the Minister to say that we have a permanent army of record numbers when, in fact, a great number of the men could resign at any moment they desired to do so, and another very large number of them perform duties of a purely administrative character. In order to ascertain the strength of the regular army we have only to consider the strength of the permanent brigade. This much vaunted permanent brigade has not even the strength of a battalion. Under present conditions it is very unlikely that it will attain the strength of a battalion for a considerable time. If that statement is not correct, let the Minister state specifically how far below strength our permanent army units really are. At about this time last year I had occasion to cite the figures relating to one of the battalions of our permanent army. At that time, it was less than one-quarter of the target strength. My statement was not then contradicted, and no facts or figures have since been forthcoming from the Minister to prove that it was inaccurate. I know that the figures which I have cited are correct. This Government is indulging in great deception in painting such a false picture of tbe defence forces of this country. As the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin) said in his speech during the general debate on the budget, never before in such troublous times have we had less with which to defend ourselves. I do not intend to deal at length with the subject of compulsory military training. I merely point out that even New Zealand, which has a socialist Government, has determined that all the citizens of that dominion shallbe in a position to defend their country. I propose now to say a few words about the decision of the Government to use army personnel on the northern coal-fields during the recent coal strike. That was the most cowardly action which this Government has taken. It destroyed whatever confidence in the Army the great Labour movement may have held, and gave rise to a great deal of resentment. It was well known that the requisite labour could bave been obtained from among the members of tbe Australian Workers Union. Indeed, the members of that union volunteered to work the mines. The Government did not use their services because it feared to split its party political affiliations. Its decision to use members of the armed forces on this work destroyed the confidence of the unions in the armed forces of this country. That was one of the worse actions that has ever been taken by any government in this country, and the honourable gentleman who calls himself the Minister for the Army, having permitted that to be done, is unworthy to occupy his present position. for the Army) [5.10] I usually have a great deal of respect for the contributions to our debates by the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett); but to-day it was obvious that he was determined to indulge in party political propaganda on the eve of the general election. He made a personal attack on me and said that the Government had committed an act of deception in misrepresenting the strength of the Permanent Military Forces, and the position in relation to warlike equipment.",63,Department Of Supply And Development
241,Mr Chambers (Adelaide,"Ministe rI emphatically deny the charge that the Government has been guilty of deception in this matter. I have never said that there are 19,000 members of the Permanent Military Forces. WhatI have said is that the strength of the Permanent Military Forces is now 15,500. That figure is authentic. I am able to give details relating to the placement of those forces. question on the notice-paper relating to that very matter more than a month ago, but I have not yet received a reply. honourable member yesterday that I had received a reply which bad been prepared by the department, but that, as it contained some inaccuracies, I had sent it back for further examination. The reply which was furnished by the department did not contain all the figures for which the honourable member had asked. I did not want to answer his question only in part, and for that reason there has been a further delay. The members of the Permanent Military Forces have been distributed over the following arms of the services:Army and Command Head-quarters and Administrative Staffs Schools, Courses and Training, including training overseas Artillery, Armoured Units and Australian Royal Artillery cadres Engineers Survey and Signals Infantry .. Army Service Medical and Dental. . 1,000 Army Ordnance and Mechanical Engineers Becruits undergoing training Other Miscellaneous Units .. Since those figures were prepared, the numbers have been slightly increased. It is rather amazing that honourable members opposite should condemn the defence policy of this Government when the record of the governments which they formed in past years is such a sorry one.

When the strength of the Commonwealth military forces was supposed to he 50,000, it was actually only about 25,000. The present strength of the CitizenM i l it a r y Eorces, which were established only a little more than twelve months ago, is 15,000. Thus the total strength of the CitizenM i l it a r y Forces and the Permanent M i l it a r y Forces is approximately 30,500. The 1914-18 war l e f t virtually untouched the countries which subsequently attacked the British Empire and its Allies in 1939. Their capacity to engage in another great war was unimpaired. of the General Staff recently returned from Japan he said that to a very great extent Russia's industrial capacity had been destroyed during World War II . ancl that Russia had lost 7,000,000 of its most virile population. We cannot overlook the fact that when honourable members opposite formed the Government of this country, and the world was on the verge of another great conflict, tlieir plane for the defence of this country were in no way comparable with the defence plans to which this Government has given effect at a time when the prospects of war are somewhat remote. was described by the Labour Opposition of the day as a government of warmongers. ment's defence plans are far more comprehensive than were those of the anti-Labour Government which was in office at the outbreak of World War II .

Is Eussia quite so innocent as the Minister would have us believe ? the Minister was at great pains to tell us. on the authority of Field Marshal Montgomery, that 7,000,000 Eussians were destroyed during the last war and that, presumably, Eussia is no longer quite the menace that honourable memhers on this side of the chamber may think it is. The fact is that during tbe last three years the world has been almost standing to arms. Why? Isi t because of Italy, Japan or Germany? Or is it because of Eussia? The whole world has been in a state of grievous uncertainty and danger dui'ing the last three years because of the power and aggressive capacity of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, we have lived long enough to hear a Minister for the Army tell us in this Parliament that the dangers are not to be overestimated and that in reality they were much greater in 1938 and 1939 than they are now. That is the honourable gentleman's case. I always like to meet a man on bis own ground. Let us assume that the dangers were much greater in 1938 and 1939 than they are now. Under those circumstances, will the Minister undertake to explain to the people of this country why his respected colleague, who is now the Minister for Labour and National Service, said in this chamber, on the 3rd November, 1938, ten months before war broke outTlie Government is expending much too rupidly on defence. It is making plans for more than the adequate defence of Australia. for what the honourable gentleman said. the Army will wash his hands of all that it both ways. He either shuffles out of the members of his party have said and the responsibility for it or stands up will acquit honourable gentlemen on this to what his own leaders said at that side of the chamber of everything that time. If members of the Labour party any body has ever said, from Sir are to stand up to what their leaders William Angliss downwards, we shall said at that time, I say that those leaders once more meet on common ground. The were anti the possibility of war and anti Minister has taken the responsibility of the preparations for war. To be told, saying that before the last war honourable in this year of grace, by these people gentlemen who are now in Opposition that we failed to understand what the were unaware of the danger and perobligations were then is the most ironical formed inadequately. He has said that they did not do anything like as well as to him that his colleague, who is now his colleague in the present Cabinet, said exactly what I bave just quoted. A little of modern history will do the Minister no harm. If he will look back upon the speeches that were made in 1938 in this chamber, he will discover that a greatly respected leader of the Labour party at that time, the late John Curtina man about whom I always speak with respect -sai d after Munich that the events of Munich did not justify the increase of defence preparations that the Lyons Government was putting in hand, but a reduced preparation, because the danger had been lessened. Mr Chambers interjecting, squirm as much as he likes. Mr Lemmon interjecting, calls to his assistance "" The Man from Snowy River "". call out reinforcements to deal with the honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller). Let the Minister call up all his reinforcements. The fact is that, if the Labour party had been responsible for the affairs of this country in 1938 and 1939, we sbould have made no preparations for war.

When war broke out in 1939, -did the Lahour party support the formation of the second Australian Imperial Eorce? -was opposed to the constitution of the second Australian Imperial Force. .also opposed to the Empire air training --scheme. In the twelve months preceding the outbreak of war, there had been a great ""testing of national recruitment in this -countrya testing upon which the then Prime Minister, Mr Lyons, had decided. He had a feeling, and one can f u l l y ;appreciate it , that we should test out the voluntary system to the f u l l , and so he .said, "" We shall raise a large force of volunteer troops in this country"".

But what are you to do when war occurs ? A f t e r all, that is something whioh speaks -eloquently to the dullest intelligence. War broke out, and a l l sorts of problems -emerged.

It is quite true that, when the system was re-introduced, members of the Labour party discovered that the people of Australia thought well of it , and thereafter they went very quietly on that point. But I say that they were opposed to the C e r t a in l y not! re-introduction of compulsory m i l it a r y The Labour party training. H a d they been in office at the time, it would not have been reintroduced. The next development was the formation of the second Australian The Labour party was Imperial Force.

301,Then War Broke Out. What You Mr Menzies,"On e fine day, I , as the Labour party, there would have been no compulsory military training, no second Australian Imperial Force, and no despatch of the second Australian Imperial Force abroad. ""We have become familiar in these days with the allegation that we dispersed the strength of this country in foreign fields. The next reference that I make is to the introduction of the Empire air training scheme. I have lived long enough to hear Ministers claim great credit for that achievement. It was initiated in Great Britain in 1939, and the first representative of Australia to discuss, on the spot, the details of that great scheme was the late J. V. Fairbairn. The Empire air training scheme was adopted, and Australia set about doing its share. It was the greatest single co-operative movement between the units of the British Empire in the course of a war. Although the scheme began in October, 1939, it was not until July, 1940, that a conference of the Australian Labour party decided that it would permit members of the Labour party in this Parliament to support the scheme. The Minister for the Army has told us that the Government's defence programme is much better than the defence programme before the outbreak of war. Minister for expressing that view, because he has had this story pedalled up to him year after year for a long time. The whole of the socialist story in Australia may be expressed, thus, "" Of course the Opposition parties did nothing to prepare Australia for war, and the Labour party had to save the country "". I do not need to be told by Johjinies-Come-Lately who did this job in Australia. I say categorically that the greatest munitions organization that this country has ever had, was given into the hands of the Labour party at the end of 1941. Tbe incoming Government kept all the plans and all the men. It did not sack them. Labour Ministers had enough wit to say, "" We shall keep the plans, the men and the organization, and allow them to work"". They were given tbe second Australian Imperial Force, to which they did not add one ounce. They were given the system of comL43] pulsory military training, which they developed later. They were given the Empire air training scheme and the whole nucleusa very big nucleus, too-of the most marvellous co-operative effort that involved the most desperate struggles to secure training aircraft and all sorts of jdant from other parts of the world. I I have lived long enough now to assess at its true value all this chatter-thi s boasting chatter-of the last four or five years by people who did not create anything but wbo took what had been created for them. They now have the gall to say, "" We are doing a marvellous job. During the war you members of the present Opposition parties failed. You were not ready for war. You had no army, navy or air force. It is quite true that if we had had' our way, Australia would have had nothing-minus, but that does not prevent us from saying that the Opposition parties have been tried and have failed "". That is the greatest piece of imposture that bas ever been put over the people of Australia. put their case to the people in 1943. always promptly received. convinced by the Opposition parties in 1943. comforts that, in the long run, the truth becomes known, and the truth wins.

He is still living in tbe dark ages when wars were fought with man-power alone. Wars are now fought witb manpower, plus industrial capacity. Every well-informed person knows to-day that the Tjnited States of America is so powerHe was not a member of the Parliament ful industrially that no other nation, nor any combination of nations, could successbeen made took place. It does not lie fully wage war against it. The United States of America would inevitably win any war that might be begun within the next 5, 10 or even 25 years. Russia is so far behind in industrial potential that it will take at least ten years for that country to reach the position which the United States of America occupies to-day. By that time, the United States of America will be still as far ahead' as it is now. The Leader of the Opposition said that his government re-introduced compulsory military service, and organized divisions of the Australian Imperial Force to go 'overseas. It is true that the Labour party opposed) the sending of so many troops overseas, because it was believed that they were needed at home, a fact which was admitted by some of the members of the present Opposition at that time, or very soon afterwards. For example; the bonorable member for Minister for the Army, said in this House that if one Japanese armoured division had landed in Australia it could have overrunthe whole country. Mr BI-AIN -That was said at a secret meeting of members of the Parliament. not disclosing information given at a secret meeting. It is public property that time 250,000 persons, who could have the honourable member for Warringah said that if one Japanese armoured division had landed in Australia it could have overrun the country. I do not think that anything is to be gained by raking over old controversies. The Leader of the Opposition spoke in a derogatory fashion of my colleague, the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon). He accused the Minister of shuffling on a particular issue. The Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) deserted their posts during the most critical period in Australia's history. Their parties had amajority in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, but they both deserted their posts when the country was in danger. The Minister for Works and Housing cannot justly be accused of shuffling on any issue. when the events to wbicb reference has with the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the Australian Country party to make accusations against one of my colleagues when they themselves have been convicted at the bar of public opinion of the crime of desertion. That is a crime which, ordinarily, a man never gets a> second chance to commit. If the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the AustralianCountry party had been members of the armed! forces-whic h they neves were-and had deserted, they would have been immediately sbot. Therefore, it is incomprehensible that they should accuse any one on this side of the committee of shuffling over defence issues. The Leader of the Opposition also said that the Labour Government had inherited' an organization for the manufacture of munitions. That istrue, but it can also be said that the government, which was led by the present Leader of the Opposition, had as its slogan ""Business as usual"". The right honourable gentleman's government organized the manufacture of munitions, and was responsible for Australia's adherence to the Empire air training scheme; but side by side with that somewhat puny achievement, it evolved the slogan "" Business as usual"" during a critical period in the history of the country. At that been doing something for the defence of Australia, were unemployed. That is the record of the Opposition parties as a government when the danger to Australia was much greater than it is to-day. The present Government is expending more money on defence, and expending it to better advantage, than did any previous government in peace-time. The money is not being expended merely upon",71,Camekon I Placed A Honourable Gentleman Was Then Himself

It is being expended c a the development of new weapons, and on research, whilst the strength of the armed services is being maintained at a level higher than that of 1938. This Government has a very good record in regard to defence preparations, and I repeat that the threat of war is much less imminent now than it was at the time during which a previous government did less to prepare for the defence of the country. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. -Afte r the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) had trenchantly criticized Australia's defence training policy this afternoon, the Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers) accused him of having indulged in party political propaganda and of having made a personal attack upon himself. Neither charge can rightly be levelled against the honourable member, because, for the last couple of years, ever since the Government enunciated its defence policy, we have criticized it, not for tbe sake of indulging in party political propaganda, but because we have a deep concern about what we consider to be the inadequacy of the training programme, livery honourable gentleman on this side who, by virtue of his own military service, is, in some way, qualified to speak, has completely condemned the policy. Surely the Minister will realize that the criticism is directed as something far transcending political propaganda, and therefore that it be heeded. But the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues refuse to listen to the criticism. The Minister buries his bead ostrich-like in the sands of complacency, and refuses to face facts that ought to be obvious to any one witb knowledge of the subject of defence. In reply to criticism of Australia's defence policy, we hear, from time to time, from bonorable members opposite, the statement that Australia, has never been better prepared to defend itself than it is at present. Ministers are particularly adept at making that claim. The Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) is very fond of booming it forth, but it will take more than, that to convince the people of Australia, especially those with knowledge of the situation, that the Government's defence policy provides for the adequate defence of Australia. Another justification for its attitude that is advanced by the Government is that Australia, in conjunction with Great Britain, is doing a big job in developing the guided weapons testing range. That is essential and the development cannot be decried, but it cannot take the place of a complete defence policy. It is only a part of the whole picture, many aspects of which are missing. The Government's attitude is based on the belief that the development of the atomic bomb and guided weapons has, in some way, changed the basic character of warfare and Tendered unnecessary trained soldiers, sailors and airmen. We often hear remarks about ""push ""button warfare"" and other similar fatuities. Throughout history, every time a revolutionary weapon has been introduced, the same opinion has been voiced. It was voiced when the blunderbus replaced bows and arrows, when cannons were developed and when aircraft and tanks were developed. Now that science has developed the atomic bomb and guided weapons, we hear the same contention. Time has proved suoh an attitude to be fallacious, and it will continue to be fallacious. Every one with a knowledge cf warfare knows that once ground has been taken highly-trained men are needed to hold it. No nation has been defeated without being overrun by enemy troops. Therefore, regardless of the development of new weapons, we must have men trained to throw out an invader should one attempt to conquer us. The present system is entirely inadequate, not only to defend Australia properly, but also to enable it to meet its obligations as a major nation in the efforts to preserve world peace. I propose to refer only to the Army and to leave references to the Navy and the Air Force, which I believe are similarly placed, to other honourable members, with experience in those arms, who are more competent than I am to talk about tbem. It is not my intention to offer much criticism of the broad defence plan as distinct from tbe defence policy. It is the policy that I regard as erroneous. The broad plan is that there shall be",72,Camekon I Placed A Honourable Gentleman Was Then Himself
331,Mr Davidson (Capricornia) [8.0].,"establislied in Australia a regular army consisting of a small highly trained force, which, in peace-time will carry out all the functions necessarily carried out by a regular army in peace-time, but whicli, iu war-time, will be the nucleus of an army capable of adequately defending Australia. In addition, a citizen force is to be established. It will consist of men who will remain citizens, but will be sufficiently trained to enable them efficiently to take their place in the army at short notice to defend Australia. It must be remembered that, in an emergency, the fate of ' Australia would depend, not on the small regular army, but on the citizen army, of whioh theregular army would be the nucleus. In order to determine the success of our defence policy, we must assess the success that we have had in recruiting and training the citizen army. First, I point out that we are still operating on the voluntary system. I have condemned the system before, and I condemn it again. TJnder it, the cream of our youth, those who love Australia and have a sense of responsibility, are the ones who answer the call. That means that we are training them to take the first blow. M.r. DEDMAN -""Will compulsory military training be advocated by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) in hi= policy speech? Defence will know what is in the policy speech when it has been delivered. I need all the time that I have available to me to deal with the Government's defence policy. That policy has had a fair trial in the last eighteen months or so. Every one with any knowledge must admit tliat it has been found wanting. The Minister for thc Army( Mr Chambers) said to-day, in reply to a question, that of the 50,000 men whom it was hoped to enlist in the Militia, only 15,000 had been enlisted. M!r. DAVIDSON -Yes, the Government hopes to develop a militia force of 50.000 men in five years. On that basis, the Minister for the Army contended that the enlistment of 15,000 in the first year or so was a good effort. I challenge that. We cannot afford to sit back complacently for five years hoping that we shall then have reached the stage at which we might be able to defend ourselves. Every one realizes that a force of 50,000 men is too small for the defence of the country. We must have a reasonable force trained as quickly as possible. We cannot sit back and wait for four or five years. The Minister for Defence said that he was satisfied that there would be no war witbin five years. I hope that he is right, but we must face the fact that the Russian bear may attack at any time. Moreover, the Government cannot expect the enlistment rate of 15,000 a year to continue. It is obvious that no progress is being made with enlistments and that the force has reached its maximum under present conditions. My inquiries have revealed that infantry battalions, which have an establishment of 700 or 800 men, have a maximum strength of about 200. In other words, the battalions are at about 25 per cent. strength. Amazingly, the support units, such as the artillery, are not attracting the enlistment that infantry battalions are attracting. Incoming troops barely balance the outgoing. Troops cannot be trained on imagination. It is practically impossible to train a skeleton force. We must have reasonable numbers of men to enable training to be carried on, particularly in the higher branches. In an under-manned unit, elementary training, such as rifle drill, can proceed, but there is a definite line, not much higher than that, beyond wbich instructors cannot go. As a result of a question that was asked this morning the fact was elicited that about 5,000 men had left the Militia Forces. I have found that that decrease is going on steadily all the time, and that the first flush of enthusiasm that existed when the recruiting programme started has gone. Men are beginning to drop out and unit commanders can do nothing about it. Apparently the only source left from wbich to make up the gap between 15,000 men and 50,000 men will be the young men who are now reaching military age. But I fear very much that the majority of those young men are not likely to offer themselves for voluntary military service because of the fact that, as the present system is staggering to a stop, the comment made to any one proposing to join up will be, ""Don't be a",73,Camekon I Placed A Honourable Gentleman Was Then Himself
332,"Mr Davidson""",The Minister for,74,Camekon I Placed A Honourable Gentleman Was Then Himself
333,Mr Chambers,"It is a five-year plan.fool! Why offer? It is not necessary"". Another reason that will operate against further enlistments is, as the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) rightly said earlier to-day, the fact that the Government used troops as strike breakers in the recent coal strike. I join with the honourable member for Henty in saying that no other action could have been taken that would have had such calamitous effects on our defence policy as the use of those troops had. That action should never have been taken except as a last resort to prevent the country from being thrown into chaos, and I cannot accept any assertion that that was tbe position. The serious effects of that action on tbe recruiting programme are obvious to probably all honourable members. When a young man informs his mother that he intends to join the Militia she will say, ""What for? To be used as a strike breaker?"" The Government's action in using soldiers as strike breakers must, I repeat, have a serious effect on an already unsuccessful scheme. In his reply to the honourable member for Henty the Minister, in an attempt to justify as far as possible the present defence policy claimed that there was plenty of equipment available. He had started out to say how splendidly the present position compared with the position before the last war, but I noticed that he stopped at the subject of equipment. I am quite prepared to concede that the equipment now available for the training of both the Regular Army and the Militia Forces has never been better. But it is not tbe slightest use having a lot of splendid equipment if it is only to lie in drill halls Minister for the Army this afternoon and ordnance stores. If we have not the men to train in the use of that equipment we might as well not have it. I consider therefore that although it is a matter of congratulation that we at last have some decent equipment, it cannot be claimed that it is something for which the Government should receive credit. ment is surplus war material. have seen a great deal of valuable equipment, and if men were trained in its use a great step forward would have been taken. In addition to equipment, we have plenty of fine instructors available at the present time to train the Militia. They are men wbo served in tbe last war and whose outlook is such that they are prepared to offer themselves as instructors for the Citizen Forces, and many of them are indeed at present acting as instructors. They command the great respect of the young men whom they are training. The experience of tbese men sbould be used to the utmost while it is available, but their enthusiasm is waning. There is a spirit of frustration growing among them because they are becoming' weary of the round of night parades and week-end bivouacs without sumcient men to train. We sball find that unless we do something about getting men for those instructors to train we shall lose their services. If the Government's present policy continues I consider that we shall be lucky if we have even the present 15,000 militiamen at the end of the five-year period. I cannot accept the Minister's complacent assurance that because of the fact that in the first year we got 15,000 recruits we sball obtain the required 50,000 by the end of another four years. All the evidence points to the fact that the momentum that was developed at the start of the scheme has now been lost, and recruiting is actually now working in reverse because so many men are leaving the Citizen Forces. I said at the beginning of my remarks that my criticism does not arise from any desire to make political propaganda. This is far too serious a matter to be used as a basis for political propaganda, because I believe that Australia is facing a steadily increasing menace. We were told by the that there was no particular menace facing us. He told us that Italy was "" out"" as a nation and that J apan was completely destroyed as a fighting force. He made various other statements of a like nature which suggested that there was no particular threat facing Australia. I need not deal with that matter at great length because tbe Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has dealt with it very successfully and conclusively, but I draw the attention of the committee to the fact that a red tide is steadily surging down through China at this very moment and there is no knowing when it will stop moving. Already Great Britain has",74,Camekon I Placed A Honourable Gentleman Was Then Himself

335,Mr Davidson,"Some of it is. Ibeen forced to reinforce the defences of Hong Kong because of tnat threat. The position in the Netherlands East Indies is, at the moment, indeterminate, and we do not know what will develop there. The statement that Japan has been completely destroyed as a military power is a most dangerous one to be made by a man who holds the position of Minister for the Army. theless. any one who knows how Japan emerged 50 years ago from the dark ages and was able to develop itself to a position where it could do what it did in the last war can say that that nation has been completely destroyed as a fighting force. From what I have seen, Japan, if given a free leg, could become in ten years a serious menace to Australia. It is obvious that it will not he long before a peace treaty with Japan will be signed. The feelers are out already and it is obviously the desire of the United States to finalize such a peace treaty so that it may develop Japan into something in the nature of an ally. There have already been suggestions that Japan may be permitted a certain degree of rearmament. That is the thin end of the wedge. Let us remember that greedy eyes in Japan are turned towards New Guinea. Those honourable members who have been to Japan will bear me out in that statement. Japan who consider that one of the outlets for surplus Japanese population lies in the direction of Australia. In view of these facts-and they are facts-the statement that Japan has heen completely destroyed as a possible threat to Australia cannot be sustained. In addition to the menace facing Ausnot only one small aspect of it because tralia which I have briefly outlined it after all we speak here as the represenmust also be remembered that Australia tatives of a member of the British Comhas certain obligations under the North monwealth of Nations. Honourable memAtlantic Pact, and lately there have been bers opposite have displayed recently a suggestions that a Pacific pact should be really anti-British attitude on every brought into being. According to recent occasion on which we, on this side statements that have been published it of the chamber, have mentioned the appears as if the United .States, which British Empire. We must study this previously was not very favorable to the matter in a large sense. The British suggestion for a Pacific pact, is now turnEmpire is founded on a strong fighting ing its thoughts to the development of navy and a strong merchant navy. It such a pact somewhat along tbe lines of would be futile to say that defence of such the North Atlantic Pact. Australia would have to play a major part in such a pact. Having regard to Australia's present capacity for defence I ask whether we could expect America to place any great reliance upon this country as a partner in the Pacific. We should certainly not be in a position to do anything of a major nature in respect of taking any great share of the obligations which we might incur under such a pact. Yet the development of such a pact is vastly important. If we could show that we were moving towards a realization of our obligations, as New Zealand has done, the likelihood of such a pact coming into existence would be increased. I conclude by placing a plea before the Minister for the Army to pay some attention to tbe opinions expressed by honourable members on this side of the committee. I assure him that those opinions are not voiced for purely political purposes. They are based on sound knowledge. If the Minister would care to appoint a select committee of the House of Eepresentatives to investigate charges that the training of the militia forces is not proceeding as it should be doing, and call in service chiefs who would not otherwise be in a position to speak their minds, he would discover that there is a substantial basis for our charges. I m provements in the scheme which would result from sucb an inquiry would lead There are Americans in to a development of Australia's defence policy so that this country could claim eventually that it was in a position to defend itself.

338,Mr Sheehy (Boothby) [8.25],"I ta scattered Empire as ours could be maintained without tbe existence of a strong British Navy. The Government has been criticized because of its attitude towards would be of inestimable value should our defence. An examination of the relevant figures will show that there is no basis for such criticism. Tbe Royal Australian Navy now has a strength of 10,000 effective personnel compared with a strength of 5,000 effective personnel in 1939. are non-combatants. ber for Balaclava ( Mr White) has been at sea all his life, and so I can put a true value on his remarks. If any one who has never been in the Navy can be said to be always at sea, it is the honourable member for Balaclava. The figure of 10,000 members in the Royal Australian Navy is exactly double the number of men in the Navy when the defence magnates on the opposite side of the committee controlled the government prior to and for the first two years of the last war, when they told us that the Pacific area was safe. Now those gentlemen say that this Government is not applying itself to the defence problem. honourable gentleman's remarks that he did not intend to adopt a party political attitude to this matter. party political attitude. I am merely stating facts. The point is that as soon as we on this side advance concrete facts honourable members opposite start to squeal or laugh like hyenas. Let us consider what has been done by the present Government in respect of naval defence. The Menzies Government spent £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 on naval construction, but since 1947 the present Gomeet the requirements of service in cervernment has expended £60,000,000 on naval defence. Honourable members opposite would have the people believe that this Government has not played its part in taking measures for the defence of this country. In the ANZAC Pact we have agreed with our sister dominion, New Zealand, to take joint measures for our protection and security. I underis that Australia is to play an important stand that the fleets of the two dominions part in the construction and development are now engaged on joint manceuvres. off the Australian coast, in which they will gain experience in joint operations which countries again be plunged into war. That is merely another step that has been taken by the Labour Government in discharging its responsibilities for the defence of Australia. We have also reached an understanding with our great ally, the Tjnited States of America, with regard to the defence of the Pacific area. Honourable members opposite have indulged in a good deal of criticism regarding the aircraft carrier HMAS. Sydney, which is the latest addition to the Eoyai Australian Navy. They have said that the vessel is already obsolete. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is well known to most honourable members that after the laying of the keel of a vessel alterations are' frequently made in design and construction before the vessel is completed. I had an opportunity to inspect a number of large aircraft carriers in Great Britain the construction of which had been deferred because of alterations in the original design. That is occurring continually in the Mother Country, which is the home of the British Navy and which has taught the peoples of other nations howto man and use ships to the best advantage. It ill becomes honourable members opposite to criticize the efforts that have been made by this Government to honour its obligations to safeguard the defence of the Commonwealth. During World War II . , when our fighting forces returned from the Middle East, they had to be re-trained in order that they would be able to acquit themselves adequately in jungle warfare, for which they had not previously been trained. Similarly, in the building of warships, frequent changes of design are made, either to tain waters or to provide for variations in the design of armaments. Honourable members opposite would have the people believe that because a Labour government is in oflice in this country it can not be trusted with the secrets of scientific warfare. I have never before listened to such claptrap as that. The simple fact",76,Camekon I Placed A Honourable Gentleman Was Then Himself

341,Mr Harbison,I thought from the,77,Camekon I Placed A Honourable Gentleman Was Then Himself
342,Mr Sheehy,"I am not adopting aof secret war weapons. I had the privilege of listening to the British Defence Minister outline his views on the future of secret weapons in the defence of the British Commonwealth. No suggestion was made by him that Australia was mistrusted in this matter. On the contrary, he said that we must all work with those with whom we knew we can work amicably. The truth of that statement is borne out by the fact that Australia was subsequently selected as the proving ground for long-range weapons which are on the secret list. Honourable members opposite cloud and misconstrue the facts to suit their own purposes. They would have the Government reveal all its defence plans. If that were done our potential enemies would be jubilant. If tbe British Commonwealth is to survive every member of it must develop a virile naval force. The British Navy has always played an important part, not only in the winning of wars, but also in the maintenance of peace. No one can say that the British Navy did not play a very important part in maintaining peace in tbe world in tbe period between the two world wars. It is useless for honourable members opposite to indulge in destructive criticism of the kind that has marked their contribution to the debate on these Estimates. For the preservation of our scattered Empire, it is essential that all its component parts shall play their part in developing naval strength to the utmost of tbeir ability. At least the Australian Labour Government can claim that it has played its part in that direction. propose to reply briefly to some of the remarks that were made by the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Sheehy). Nobody can be satisfied that any branch of our armed services is satisfactory to-day. Everybody realizes that the future is fraught with great difficulties and that the possession of one aircraft carrier and a limited number of naval craft does not give us any cause for satisfaction. If the honourable member for Boothby is satisfied with that state of affairs he bas no cognizance of the problems that beset us. The Government is much too complacent in this matter. In the very limited time at my disposal I propose to deal briefly with the failure of the Government to adopt an adequate and sound defence policy. The mere fact that a guided weapons range has been established at Woomera, in South Australia, does not satisfy me that the Government is doing everything possible to take advantage of the latest developments in scientific warfare. The Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers) has said that the permanent forces now number 15,500 personnel. In answer to a question which I asked on the subject the honourable gentleman admitted that more than one-third of that . number are non-combatants. That means that we have only approximately 10,500 combatant personnel. The honourable gentleman also admitted that 5,000 men had recently left the forces. That is a very sad story which does not justify the complacency that has been exhibited by the Government in relation to defence matters. On every occasion on which the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) bas answered questions relating to defence or has dealt with matters relating to defence, he has boasted that Australia now has a larger defence force than it has ever had in its history during a time of peace. Such statements can be characterized as irresponsible and dangerous nonsense. In 1938, just prior to the outbreak of World War II . , the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was requested by the Lyons Government to increase our militia forces from a total strength of 30,000 to 75,000. At the right honourable gentleman's request I was given the task of assisting him in Queensland. As the result of his efforts the militia forces of this country were increased beyond the target strength to a total of 85,000. After three months' training those 85,000 young men became the nucleus of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force which played such a prominent part in World War II . I invite honourable members to compare the strength of the militia forces in those days with the pitifully small permanent army that we have to-day. Surely the Minister for Defence cannot be satisfied with his efforts. How can he claim that he is perfectly satisfied with the manner in which the Government's five-year defence programme is being implemented? During the eighteen months in which that",77,Camekon I Placed A Honourable Gentleman Was Then Himself
343,Mr Francis (Moreton) [8.38],"Iprogramme has been in operation he has succeeded in enlisting a permanent army of a total strength of only 15,000 of whom one-third are non-combatants. Honourable members on this side of the chamber and the people of Australia generally are dissatisfied with the Government's defence policy. A great deal of time has been wasted by honourable members opposite in trying to convince the people that they should derive a great deal-of satisfaction from the fact that, in conjunction with the British Government, the Commonwealth has established a guided weapons range in South Australia. That project will make little or no contribution to the defence of Australia for some time to -come. It is merely experimental, and if it is successful a long time will elapse before practical advantage can be taken of it. What this country wants more tban anything else at the moment is an army of skilled specialists to use the mechanized equipment with which modern wars are fought. Large numbers of trained personnel wbo served in World War II . are willing and anxious to help to train young men in the use of modern equipment. The Minister should do everything possible to secure their services by making tbe conditions of service in the armed forces attractive. I have a gr'eat regard for Lieutenant-General Savige, who is well known to every member of this Parliament. Lieutenant-General Savige has been most forthright in his condemnation of the state of our military forces, He does not bandy words. According to the press, this great soldier, who served witb distinction in the two world wars, is unequivocally dissatisfied with our militia forces as they exist to-day. He is reported to bave said recentlyThe Federal Government's failure to train an adequate number of men to use modern weapons of war was a menace to the safety of by 19 per cent, since last year, that tbe Australia. How can Ministers remain complacent in the face of such a statement by a distinguished Australian soldier? tenant-General Savige has spent a lifetime in the service of his country. He was a member of the militia forces prior to World War I. and in the period between the two world wars. He rendered brilliant service to his country in both Mr Francis. world wars. The report to which I bave referred continuesSince tlie second world war there had been some big changes in the science of war. Only by universal training would it be possible to keep enough men abreast of these developments. Lieutenant-General Savige was commenting on a statement by the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) that the Government had considered universal training and was of opinion that the present defence policy provided the maximum of security within the resources available. He said the present voluntary system of training was most obviously a failure-no t enough men were being trained. Those who were in charge of Australia's forces early in the last war knew how dangerous it was to t r y to properly t r a in men for battle after the enemy was on the march. In the future it would be more dangerous. There would be less time for men to learn how to use weapons of more intricate and scientific design. In the last war the infantryman had dropped his old role as a foot-slogger, and had become a highly-trained specialist, using a great variety of scientific weapons. It took a. long time to train these specialists. Australia was desperately short of them. Universal military training was the only answer. I ask the Minister, in the interests of the defence of Australia, to take note of the observations that have been made from time to time by a number of senior Australian officers who served in World War II . I appeal to tbe bonorable gentleman to ensure that we have forces that are adequate for the defence of this country. On the 17th September, tbe American combined Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees stated that Russia had more than 5,000,000 men in its armed forces. In a joint report on President Truman's arms programme, the committees said that Soviet ground forces were in a better condition now than at any time since tbe war. Other points in the committees' report were that Russia had increased its military budget number of Soviet troops in Germany had increased from 70,000 to 100,000, and that the Soviet had intensified security Lieumeasures along its borders and those of its satellites. The Minister must be aware of the Russian advance in Asia. Russia was thwarted in Europe and has now turned to the east. Communist forces are advancing in China, and are present in considerable numbers in the Netherlands East Indies and South-East Asia generally. This country cannot remain complacent while Eussia is expanding its military forces and bringing the Iron Curtain closer to our coasts. Eussia is trying to ensure that nobody shall learn of what is being done behind the Iron Curtain. ""We must strengthen our defence forces. We owe a duty to our young men to ensure that they are given an opportunity to receive military training.

I appeal to the Minister to accept the advice of senior military officers, especially Lieutenant General Savige, who has stated that the lack of men in Australia who bave been trained in the use of modern weapons is a menace to the safety of this country. If the speeches that have been made by honourable gentlemen opposite upon the proposed votes for the defence services mean anything at all, they mean that it is the intention of the Opposition, if it is successful at the forthcoming general the honourable election, to reintroduce compulsory military training in Australia. However, honourable gentlemen opposite have not. stated specifically that that is tbeir intention.

352,Mr Thompson,"There has beenin both houses of the Parliament for the failure of the Government prior to the outbreak of war to establish adequate and efficient defence forces in this country. The right honourable gentleman referred to the late John Curtin and his opposition to certain proposed defence measures. In 1936 I served with Mr Curtin on a committee that drew up the defence policy of the Labour party for presentation to the people at the 1937 general election. What Mr Curtin desired was an efficient air force. I ask honourable gentlemen opposite how efficient our air force was in 1939. ways. war in 1939 the air defences of this country were practically non-existent. I remember the night when it was announced that Prince of Wales and Repv,lse had been sunk. Tbose ships were lost because we had no aircraft available to protect them from the attacks of Japanese aircraft. Honourable gentleman opposite are now claiming that there are not enough men in the defence forces. On other occasions, as we know, they have said that there are not sufficient men employed in industry and that we are not constructing enough houses and ships. They blame the Government because there are not sufficient men to do the work that' is needed for the development of this country. I believe in an efficient defence force member does not. gentleman may make statements of thai kind if he desires to do so. I repeat that I believe in an efficient defence force for the bonorable meinber for Henty to attack the Minister for the Army( Mr war. Every man in the country must Chambers) in the way in which he did, and for the Leader of the Opposition .to claim that the government of which he was a member was not responsible for the condition of our defence forces in 1939,and to attempt to lay the blame for it on the Labour party, wbich was then in Opposition. In the debate on these Estimates honourable gentlemen opposite have been indulging in the tactics in which they have indulged for the last three years. On every occasion wben a member of the Opposition makes a speech in this chamber he endeavours to sow in the minds of the people the seeds of distrust and suspicion of the Government. He suggests that the Government will not protect the country by doing what is necessary for our defence and that it will ruin us. Honourable gentlemen opposite must have a very poor opinion of the intelligence of the people if they think that they will be misled by statements of that kind. Why was there a change of minis \ry in 1941? Honourable gentlemen opposite talk of unity, but when the present Leader of the Opposition was Prime Minister, the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fedden) also wanted to occupy the post and the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) said that he was the man for it. The people of Australia were wondering who would be the man who would lead them in the war. Eventually two of the supporters of that Government said, in effect, "" If you are going to make such a poor showing by arguing amongst yourselves, and if you are going to jeopardize the defence of Australia, we shall turn you out of office "". They did so, and a minority party, the Labour party, formed the Government. That minority party did such a wonderful job that it was returned to office witb a record majority at the 1943 general election. A t that tim« [ remember talking to men in trains and in the streets. They said to me, ""We want John Curtin"". They gave the party that was led by John Curtin a majority in this House that it had never had before. There were no fights in the ranks of the Labour party. Our fight was with the enemy. The members of the Menzies Government did not have the guts to say to the people of Australia, "" We are going to make this an all-in play his part"". We did that in spite of the opposition of some members of our own party. We were prepared to do what was necessary for the defence of Australia, and to take risks.

It seems that the Government are completely consistent with the Minisprefers that war pensions should be ter's failure to administer the Department of Repatriation in a proper manner. The Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, in my opinion and in the opinion of quite a number of those who have some knowledge of this matter, should be completely overhauled. The original act has been amended piece-meal since its introduction in 1920 by the right The people of Australia are quite honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). However, the act and the regulations promulgated thereunder have not been completely overhauled, and as the result of two world wars, a considerable number of anomalies have arisen, the general effect of which has been to penalize ex-service men and women. It appears to me that ex-service men and women constitute one class which should receive sympathetic consideration fro m the Government. Unfortunately, they receive scant consideration from this Government, and possibly less consideration than otlier sections of the community receive. That impression is held so widely among ex-servicemen that the joint organization of ex-servicemen's associations has prepared what it describes as a 33-point plan for submission to the Government. rection, because it shows that the exserviceinen's organizations are dissatisfied about three other points in addition to the 33 that are known to me.

That impression seems to be .borne out by the fact that the Government is keeping the rate of the war pensions static. While the Government succeeds in doing so, it will be diverting to the National Welfare Fund money that should rightly be .allocated to increasing war pensions. I shall cite some examples. The percentage of the national income which was expended in 1939 on pensions for those who had fought in the Boer War and World WarI . is almost equal to tbe percentage of the national income that is now being expended on tbe payment of pensions to those who served in tbe Boer War, World WarI . and World War II . It is a misnomer to refer to "" war pensions "". A war pension should be regarded as compensation to men who lost limbs or were broken in health as the result of serving their country in wars. per cent, of the basic wage. Those of us Tbe payment is an obligation that the Government and the people should assume. Of course, the Government does not reeognize that fact aiid, in my opinion, thc general election on tbe 10th December it regards war pensions merely as an obligation to be met by the payment, in many instances, of the minimum rate. Since the end of World War II . , the increase of war pensions has lagged far behind tbe soaring cost of living, and the steady decline of the purchasing power of the war pension is quite evident. However, the basic wage and tbe age and invalid pension have frequently been adjusted to meet the increasing cost of living. I mention tbose points, because later I shall compare the increase of age and invalid pensions in relation to the basic wage, with the increase of war pensions in relation to the basic wage. One of the anomalies which inflicts the greatest degree of hardship is that war pension rates are not suflicient to enable the recipients to maintain a reasonable standard of living. Obviously, if wages and costs rise, but war pensions remain static, the recipients are penalized. Let us the Minister, calling upon his imaginaconsider how the purchasing power of the 100 per cent, war pension has been allowed to fall, notwithstanding the fact that the national income per capita has increased since 1939 by approximately 86 per cent. Mr Harrison. Age and invalid .pensions have increased by approximately the same percentage, but the 100 per cent, war pension and the special war pension bave been increased by only 30 per cent, in 10 years. The 10.0 per cent, war pension in 1939 was £2 2s. a week, and at present it is £2 15s. a week, an increase of 31 per cent. The rate of the special war pension in 1939 was £4 a week and to-day it is £5 6s. a week, an increase of 32.5 per cent. Honourable members will see that my statements about the decline of the purchasing power of wav pensions are borne out by those figures. I shall now examine war pensions in relation to the basic wage in 1939 and in August of this year. The 100 per cent, war pension was £2 2s. a week, and the basic wage was £3 19s. a week in 1939. In other words, tbe 100 per cent war pension was 53 per cent, of the basic wage at that time. In August, 1949, the basic wage was £6 7s. a week and tbe 100 per cent, war pension was £2 15s., or only 43 who watch economic trends know that the basic wage will continue to be further increased. I have no doubt that, before next, the basic wage will be increased to £6 10s. a week. The 100 per cent, war pension will have to be increased to 70s. a week if it is to bear tbe same relation to the basic wage now as it bore to the basic wage in 1939. Tbe case for tbe increase is unanswerable. All civilian pensions and the basic wage have been adjusted in accordance with the increased cost of living, but ex-servicemen, who have lost a limb or who have been broken in health through helping to preserve our democratic way of life and our standard of living, are not being treated so sympathetically as civilian pensioners are. I do not desire to suggest that war pensions should rise or fall according to fluctuations in the cost of living. I do not suggest that the 100 per cent, pension rate should be adjusted automatically in accordance with variations in cost of living figures. Perhaps tion, could evolve some other method of dealing with the problem. At any rate, it is clearly our duty to honour our obligations to the ex-servicemen wbo answered the call to defend their country. They should not be placed in a worse position than other sections of the community. In 1939, the full war pension represented 53 per cent, of the basic wage; now it .represents only 43 per cent., and if an adjustment is not made soon the disparity will be still greater. If the Treasurer, whose coffers are overflowing, can grant concessions to other sections of the community, he can well afford to do justice to ex-servicemen. Before the war, the Australian Soldiers'' Repatriation Act was amended to provide that wives of ex-servicemen, who married ' after the 30th June, 1938, should be excluded from benefits under the act. The Minister, no doubt, will remind me that the amendment was made while a government which I supported was in power. That is so, but the amendment has led to some anomalies, and I have here particulars of a case in point. An ex-serviceman has written to me in these terms1 w ill t r y to point out the injustice by stating my own case. I married in December 1941 and refrained from doing so earlier because I felt, in justice to any woman I should not add further responsibilities, either from a health or financial point of view, unti l the doctors told me it was safe to marry. The writer was suffering from tuberculosis. The letter continuesFor taking the common sense point of view I am now ineligible for any assistance for my wife. My action thus prevented the spreading of infection, and also saved the Government financial liability for a wife for all those years from 1919 to my marriage in 1941. It seems hard that privileges should be granted to those men who, often very unwisely married quite early in their T.B. life, and that penalties be imposed on those who, in the wisdom of their doctors, felt their health prevented them from taking on the responsibilities of a married life earlier than they did. Returned men feel that this section of the Act sliould be amended by deleting that section, after which date, 30th June, 1938, a man may not receive help for his wife if he marries. I shall give this letter to the Minister, but I do not know whether he has power to do anything about it, The writer was suffering from tuberculosis, which was at an infectious stage. He was a. man of some standing, and his doctor advised him that if he married he would be doing a disservice to the community. He would be likely to infect his wife, and if there were children they might be infected too. His doctor advised him not to marry until he was given a clean bill of health. He could have refused to accept his doctor's advice. He could have married, and possibly spread the infection, thereby imposing, upon tbe Government additional liabilities. However, he refrained from marrying until he was given a clean bill of health. He is now married, and complains that, because he faced his responsibilities as a citizen, he has been penalized. That is an anomaly which ought to be corrected. The Minister should be given discretionary power to, deal with cases of the kind. There cannot be many of them, and no great demand would be made on the Treasury by giving favorable consideration to applications of ex-servicemen in such a position. I appreciate the fact that the aet was amended to cover cases in which women married ex-servicemen for the sole purpose of deriving benefits under the act. I am not quarreling with the general provision. The principle of the amendment was sound, but the anomalies created by it have become apparent only since the provision has been in operation, and something should be done to correct those anomalies. I make no apology for my general remarks on war pensions. I believe that, compared with other persons in the community, the position of ex-servicemen is worse than it used to be. The Minister should have pressed for increased rates in order to maintain the same relation between war pensions and the basic wage as obtained in 1939. Because he failed to do so, he has fallen down on bis job. Repatriation) [9.25] I congratulate the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) on the temperate way in which he stated his case. Such behaviour is most unusual for him. On this occasion, he tiptoed through the tulips because he knew very well that there would be little justification for his remarks if he were carrying the responsibility that now rests upon me as Minister. He kept very carefully away from one aspect of repatriation that has been Qf special interest to him in recent years. He",82,Advance To The Treasurer

I refer to the question of the onus of proof in cases that come up for hearing before the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal.

The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin) was one of tbose who voted for the proposal, 'but the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Actually, the plan presented to the Anthony) voted with the honourable member for Wentworth against it. I can read the division list to the honourable member if he wants me to. The Labour Government has put tbe amending provision into operation with great pleasure, so that hundreds of men, who had been denied pensions when the honourable member for Wentworth was Minister for Repatriation, have received tbem since I have been Minister. However, I do not propose to pursue that point further, nor to place on record once more the relevant division list. That was done as recently as June last. The honourable meinber for Wentworth put his case very temperately, but some of his statements need to be appropriately replied to. he said that the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act should be completely overhauled, and that it had not been overhauled since its introduction by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). The honourable member knows that that is untrue, because an almost completely new act was introduced by my predecessor, Mr Frost, who then represented Franklin. tions were made. completely new act. member reads it, be will find it almost a completely new act. Between-1920 and the honourable member for 1943, so many anomalies came to light that it was decided to redraft the legislation in order to remove them. All the amendments of the principal act were consolidated as recently as 1943. So the honourable member draws a very long bow when he talks about the need for a complete overhaul of the act. I remind him that the amendments that were made in the 1943 act were based on the report and recommendations of a committee composed of returned soldiers from all sections of the Parliament. The committee was presided over by my honourable friend, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard). The new legislation provided for an increase of pensions by 20 per cent. The honourable member went on to talk about a 33-point plan. Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) and myself is a 36-point plan. A good deal of time has been spent on examining the document. I presume that the honourable gentleman wanted to reduce it to a 33-point plan, because several of the requests made in it were adopted and passed into law about 12 months ago. I do not propose to take up the time of the committee in enumerating them, but half a dozen sections of the plan have already been given legislative force in compliance with a request made by ex-service organizations at least a year ago. So much for the plan. We are still examining other proposals which it Eirst. contains. We hope to be able to reach a decision on some of the other requests contained in it as soon as the Cabinet, is able to have a look at it. The honourable gentleman went on to say that returned soldiers' pensions had been kept static. For the benefit of honourable members, I am getting out a document that gives a complete picture of pensions.

369,Mr Barnard,"No, I am not soThere may be photographs of some repatriation institutions that we are proud of. Between 1914 and 1916, when soldiers were paid 6s. a day, the rate of pension was £2 a week. It was not until the 6th May, 1943, that the rate was increased to £2 10s. The honourable member criticizes the Government for not having done anything for ex-servicemen. In effect, he has said that since 1939 we have not done this or ought to have done that. But he ignores the fact that, between 1914 and 1943, the pension of returned soldiers was not increased. I could quote the ngures to show the increase granted by this Government. A good deal has been said about the 100 per cent, pension, that is the pension paid to an ex-serviceman whose disability is assessed at 100 per cent, incapacity. Whereas he formerly received a pension of £2, he now receives £2 15s. a week, and he can earn whatever pay he is able to earn. In other words, there is no means test. receipt of a 100 per cent, pension could not earn anything. man should not be confused with the ex-serviceman who receives a special pension. ' "" T.T.I."". The totally and permanently incapacitated and totally temporarily incapacitated men are in an entirely different category from the 100 per cent, men. The man on the 100 per cent, pension may earn whatever he is physically or mentally capable of earning without interference to his pension. He is not subjected to the means test. The honourable member for Wentworth makes the astounding claim that ex-servicemen who work in industry, and have had the benent of increases of the basic wage, should have their pensions fixed at a higher rate to accord with the increase of the cost of living. The pension has no relation whatever to the basic wage. Ex-service organizations-a t least, the Returned Sailors. Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, wbich is the parent organization and which has looked after the welfare of ex-servicemen ever since World WarI -hav e always argued against the adjustment of pensions on a sliding scale in accordance with rises or falls of the basic wage. they do not desire the basic wage and the pension to be related as far as increases or decreases of the cost of living are concerned. They are prepared to rely on the generosity or lack of generosity of the Government in determining tbe rate of the pension. We have never applied falls or rises of the cost of living to any ex-service pensioner, from the "" 100 per cent-er"" to the ""10 per cent-er"". The increase of the pension was decided on by the Government, that is the Labour Government, because no other government gave an increase at all. NonLabour governments applied the means test to war widows. Until 1943, a widow who had a little property and let a couple of rooms to supplement her pension by a small amount, received the handsome pension of £1 3s. 6d. a week. The means test was always applied to widows until Labour came to the treasury bench in 1941. ing about the widows of soldiers? widows did not receive a pension at all until we took office. We entirely removed the means test from war widows. No means test is applied to tbe 100 per cent, pensioner who, without suffering a reduction of his pension, may earn whatever his physical or mental condition allows him to earn. In earning that money, he reaps the benefit of increases of the basic wage in accordance with the increase of the cost of living. applied to the parents of deceased soldiers. in a moment. It seems fallacious that the pension should be increased because tbe basic wage has been increased. ment not maintain the pension that operated in 1939? gentleman should ask himself that question.

Some of these special rate pensioners earn some proportion of the basic wage, but what about the man who gets £3 or £4 a week from a superannuation fund? That amount is not taken into account because it is not produced by personal exertion. Wliat about the man who is a director of a firm and who has an income that is not produced by personal exertion? We cannot measure all cases by the same yardstick. If a concession is given to one person it must be given all down the line. upon calling it a pension. It is really a. compensation.

402,Right. Mr Harrison,"The Minister insiststhe Government had done in the readjustment of pension rates for tuberculous ex-servicemen. gentleman mentioned a case of a man who married after a certain date, but he anticipated my answer because that was a matter that was decided long before a Labour government came into office. When returned servicemen's organizations made a recommendation to this Government regarding what they considered should be provided in tbe new act of 1943 they did not recommend the abolition of that particular section. They recommended that the maximum period in respect of soldiers from World WarI . should be twenty years and that for soldiers of World War II . it should be fifteen years. Tbat recommendation was made by returned soldiers, some of whom are still members of this Parliament. The Government accepted the recommendation and that provision remains in the act. Let us return for a moment to the question of totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen. It is true that a totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman with no children must be finding it hard to live on his rate of pension. But that is not all we do for him. We have a very excellent system of education for the children of such people. As soon as a child living at home starts to go to school he is enabled to get tram fares, books and so on until he reaches the age of thirteen years. The rate of educational allowance paid in respect of a child was formerly 6s. a week, but it has been increased by this Government to 9s. a week for children between the ages of thirteen and fourteen. We also provide school hooks and sporting requisites for such children. educational allowance in respect of children between the ages of fourteen and sixteen is 12s. a week and at sixteen years of age, when the pension ceases to bc payable, educational assistance goes up to 33s. a week if tbe child is living at home, and 50s. a week if living away from home. While children are at school we pay for books and provide sporting requisites. We even make an allowance to them if tbey go to a university. The allowance for a boy learning a trade is 45s. a week in bis first year of apprenticeship, and for a girl it is 40s. a week. If the young people are living, away from The honourable home the rates are 60s. and 55s. respectively. The pension rate is not a maximum rate but it is a minimum rate, in effect, because of additional benefits available. Tbe Government regards itself as not being ungenerous .to ex-servicemen. I agree that some sections of exHservicemen have some d&fficuPty in making ends meet, but I hope that a little later on we shall be able to review the matter and make spme provision for those who find themselves in great difficulty because of rising prices. As far as the 36-poi.nt plan of the Returned Servicemen's League is concerned I hope that we shall be able to do something more about that matter in the very near future. The Government has a record of achievement ef service to ex-servicemen since it has been in office of which it can be justly proud. ment would be the only ones who would be proud of it. gentleman may say that, but returned servicemen, especially those who have had some responsibility as officials of ex-servicemen's organizations, would tell the bonorable member that they approve of what the Government has done for them in removing anomalies in the act and in providing more generous pensions, allowances, educational benefits and medical attention. I think that in many cases ex-servicemen recognize that while they may desire to have more, the Government has not been ungenerous to them. Last week we heard some criticism of repatriation hospitals and of the Heidelberg Military Hospital in particular. The Some general reference was made to repatriation hospitals by the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett). The honourable gentleman is usually fairly generous in his comments on those matters. If he desires to level criticisms at repatriation hospitals I consider that be should cite specific instances. Almost daily I receive letters of commendation, not only from people high up in the social world who visit repatriation hospitals, but also from people lower down in the social scale. They commend tbe Government for the services rendered by the",87,Advance To The Treasurer

I confess that in a big institution where there are perhaps 1,600 patients and a very big staff, there may be from time to time some matters that require tightening up. If such cases were brought to the notice of the department it would have an opportunity to deal with them. I say in conclusion that as far as repatriation hospitals are concerned the Government has real grounds for pride, and so have the returned soldiers. Defence and Minister for Post-war Eeoonstruction) [9.56] -The group of Estimates that we are debating covers the expenditure that is to be incurred by this Government for benefits of ex-servicemen. I wish to examine what this Government is doing, and to compare it with what a previous non-Labour Government did after World WarI . I shall also compare the measure of prosperity now being enjoyed by ex-servicemen -with tbeir plight four years after World War 1. ended. The total expenditure incurred by the Commonwealth on all forms of benefits to ex-servicemen of World War II . , up to the present time, amounts to £88,000,000. That amount is accounted for under various headings. Eirst of all the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme provides university-type training covering many thousands of ex-servicemen wbo take professional courses to become doctors, dentists, scientists, engineers and so on, and has involved an expenditure, up to the 31st July last, of approximately £11,000,000. That amount includes almost £7,000,000 for living allowances and £1,600,000 for tuition fees. [Quorum, formed.""] The amount also includes more than £1,000,000 for additional courses and more than £1,000,000 for accommodation and equipment. An amount has been provided for technical and vocational-type training under the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme wbich includes training for all types of trades. A sum total of £24,000,000 has been expended on that activity up to the 31st July last. That sum included £8,000,000 for living allowances, £5,000,000 for tuition fees, and more than £9,000,000 for subsidies to employers. As honourable members know bow this scheme is operated, I shall not go into details with regard to it. It is a magnificent scheme for the rehabilitation and re-establishment of ex-servicemen, and it far excels any scheme that was put into operation by anti-Labour governments after World War I. In connection with rural type training an amount of approximately £1,000,000 has already been expended. There are certain liabilities in relation to pensions but as that matter has been dealt with by the Minister for Eepatriation ( Mr Barnard), I shall not deal with it now. On the supplementation of apprentices' wages an amount of £3,500,000 has been expended. Grants bave also been made of furniture loans. Small business loans and agricultural loans of less than £250 have accounted for approximately £5,000,000. There are many other items such as medical treatment for war-caused disabilities, free passages to and from the Commonwealth, re-employment allowances and removal expenses, on which heavy expenditure has been incurred. A total of £88,000,000 has been expended on the rehabilitation and re-establishment of ex-servicemen. The Labour Government realized, in drawing up all these plans for re-establishment and rehabilitation of ex-servicemen, that they could be implemented only if the community as a whole was prosperous. Consequently, the whole plan was envisaged in an economy enjoying full employment. It can be truthfully said that there are no ex-servicemen in the community who have not already been re-established or rehabilitated or who are not now in the course of being successfully re-established or rehabilitated. I ask honourable members to contrast that position with the position that existed four years after the termination of World War I. I have taken the trouble to examine the Estimates for 1921-22 in order to make such a comparison.

On the 27th June, 1922, the following statement appeared in the Sydney Morning HeraldThe serious aspect of the industrial situation in Newcastle has been increased by the closing down of the works of Bylands Bro6. The works have been devoted mainly to the manufacture of wire netting. We have heard a number of complaints from honourable gentlemen opposite that soldier settlers cannot get sumcient wire netting to meet their requirements. Tbe reason is that, because of tbe prosperity of primary producers generally, there is sucb a great demand for wire netting now that supplies are insufficient. That is in marked contrast with tbe situation in 1922 wben farmers had not suflicient money to buy enough wire netting to keep the wire situation is entirely different from that which existed in 1922.

The only matters that he had to raise in relation to the welfare of returned servicemen were matters that were taken up with the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Barnard). It can be said that this Government has looked after the interests of the returned servicemen of this country on this occasion very much better than governments after World WarI . complained about their living allowances,, -but the vast majority of them know that they are being very generously treated. I repeat for tbe information of the honorable member for Swan( Mr Hamilton) that the amount that has been expended upon living allowances for university trainees is £7,000,000.

I propose to make one or two remarks about land settlement. War I. land settlement was undertaken by the State governments. It was so badly managed that it cost the Commonwealth approximately £30,000,000 to write off debts that were incurred. The main reason for that situation was that land was bought at prices that were far too high. Returned servicemen who were settled on the land after World War I. were left with a millstone of debt hanging round their necks. [Quorum formed?] there any special reason why the honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller) should rush from the chamber immediately a quorum is called? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! Tbere is no point of order involved. many returned servicemen spent many years of their lives in trying to make a success of the properties that ha'd been allotted to them under the war service land settlement schemes of that time. They incurred huge debts. Eventually they found that it was quite impossible to make a living, and they had to leave their blocks and start life afresh. After a period of years, debts to the value of over £30,000,000 were written off by the Commonwealth. On this occasion we have taken steps to ensure that returned servicemen who go on the land will get a fair deal. We bave also taken steps to ensure that tbe valuations of tbeir properties will be sucb as to enable tbem to earn a reasonable personal income, to pay all their expenses and eventually to make a great success of the blocks on which they have been established. what they bave to pay? discussion between the State governments and the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth bas arrived at an agreement with Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania in relation to valuations. The same remark applies to Queensland. The New South Wales Government has indicated that it does not wish to fix the valuations for another five years. Victoria is the only State with which I have had After World any difficulty in relation to land valuations. I shall give to the committee some details of the war service land settlement scheme. Up to the 30th June this year, the proposals submitted by State governments related to an area of 9,235,000 acres. The area approved by the Commonwealtb as suitable for war service land settlement was over 7,000,000 acres. Tbe number of properties approved for acquisition was over 1,000, involving an area of almost 7,000,000 acres. Tbe number of properties acquired by State governments for war service land settlement was S37, covering an area of 6,000,000 acres. The number of properties approved for subdivision was 551, covering 3,000,000 acres. The number of single farm units approved by the Commonwealth, tbe great majority of which are in New South Wales, was 468, covering an area of 3,000,000 acres. opposed to single farm units. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) does not know what he is talking about. I have always been prepared to accept single farm propositions provided they are submitted to me within the terms of the War Service Land Settlement Agreements. If the honourable gentleman knew anything about tbe agreements he would know that I bave no power to refuse to consider single farm unit propositions provided they are within tbe terms of the agreements. I did object to considering propositions that were not put forward within the terms of the agreements. I refused to have anything to do with propositions bf that kind. None of them has been accepted by me. That is not because of my objection to them, but because they did not come within the terms of tbe relevant legislation. Some single farm propositions have been dealt with",91,Advance To The Treasurer

The fact that they are being dealt with by the Victorian Government does not mean that if that Government bad put them up to me within the terms of its agreement, I should not have accepted them. State governments are bound to comply with the terms of the agreements in the same way as I am bound to comply with them. The total sum of money that bas been expended upon war service land settlement to date is approximately £16,000,000. Approximately one-half of that sum of money has been expended upon the acquisition and development of estates generally and upon rural training for the settlers who will occupy the blocks. The remainder of the money has been expended unon re-establishment loans for returned servicemen who are ou the land. That is' tbe £1,000 loan proposition. That is entirely a Commonwealth scheme and the State governments are not called upon to bear any of that expenditure. I express my gratitude to the State governments for making available to me facilities such as the Rural Bank of New Soutb Wales and the Soldier Settlement Commission in Victoria for the purpose of organizing in connection witb the scheme, doing the necessary inspections of the properties and generally assisting the Commonwealth in allocating the money. of that kind are borne by the Commonwealth, but I express my thanks to the State governments for having made those facilities available to us. Soldier settlers is older than all the naval regulations and in fact all ex-servicemen of World War II . have heen given very generous treatment by this Government and there it not any section of the community which does not recognize that to be so. Tbe TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Sheehy) -Order!

Proposed votes agreed to. Progress reported. Mr Dedman. the report of the Tariff Board on the following subject:Cotton-growing industry. Bill returned from the Stenate without amendment. That the House do now adjourn. direct attention to a matter affecting a former naval officer in the hope that the Minister for the Navy( Mr Riordan) will ensure that justice shall be done to him. I did not consider that this matter should be raised when the Estimate* for the Department of the Navy were under consideration, even if I had been given an opportunity to speak on that occasion. I propose to relate the experience of a former Lieutenant-Commander in the Royal Australian Navy who was court martialled on five charges, found not guilty on the two most serious ones and reprimanded on the other three. As the result of that reprimand he has forfeited the whole of his deferred pay amounting Administrative expenses to some hundreds of pounds. Although the naval regulations provide for forfeiture in such circumstances, the punishment in this instance does not fit the crime. That is an unwritten law which and the regulations that have been promulgated under the defence Act. I shall cite the details of the case. This man is the son of a retired bank manager and is himself a senior bank officer. Every member of his family, including himself, had an excellent war record. He volunteered and served in the Royal Australian Navy on the lower deck, was promoted to sub-lieutenant in fourteen months, to lieutenant three months later, and to acting lieutenant-commander after a further four years. Whilst serving as an officer he carried out naval secretarial duties ashore and afloat in Arunta, Shropshire",92,Advance To The Treasurer

428,Mr White (Balaclava) [10.32],"1and Bataan. He joined Bataan in April, 1946, as secretary to the commanding officer, who was in charge in the Tenth Destroyer Flotilla. His duties were of a secretarial nature and were concerned with the flotilla of six destroyers. He was officer in charge of public moneys on Bataan, but he had nothing whatever to do with victualling. I shall describe what happened. In December, 1946, Bataan paid an official visit to Shanghai for four days. Upon arrival he drew local currency from the Australian legation. Prior to sailing twelve days later, he returned the balance of unexpended Chinese currency. At this eleventh-hour visit tb the legation on the day of sailing, he was confronted with three accounts for victualling stores presumed to have been purchased from Chinese providors during the stay of the vessel in Shanghai. He was requested to sign them, because of the short time that would elapse before Bataan sailed. The supply petty officer in charge of victualling claimed that it would not be possible for him to return on board in order to obtain the signature of the requisite authority. He has written to me as follows:These facts are hazy to me now and it is possible I signed the three documents in the ship immediately before being asked to bring the documents ashore to the legation office, such Kong. I was charged on two alternate charges fact of my visit being known to the supply petty officer. The difference in times of signing would be only half or one hour. The supply petty officer was a recommended and trusted rating and my banking experience would make me believe the woTd of a senior rating. Eventually the legation copies of the victualling accounts were received in the Department of the Navy, and they disagreed with the amount of provisions that were actually taken on charge in the ship's account. Earlier, the ship's account was "" missing"" and when the supply petty officer was asked to make out a duplicate copy, the account which he handed in was the "" missing"" original. I understand that the supply petty officer was prosecuted on otber charges at a court of inquiry, and it became evident to tbe former commander whose case I am voicing that a circumstantial case had been woven around bim. The senior rating was later discharged from the service and deprived of his good conduct badges. The officer claims that he was the unfortunate victim of circumstances. I do not know the facts of the matter other than as they have been given to me, but I am informed that the cost of the trial of the officer amounted to approximately £10,000. I think that this officer, having spent many years of his life in the service, should have received more sympathetic consideration from the Department of the Navy. I am not one of those who believe in breaking down discipline, and I agree that a man who commits a crime must take his punishment. However, the punishment should always fit the crime. The officer has written as follows:After the Sydney Board of Inquiryi n July, my previously approved demobilization was deferred. I was kept inactive in Sydney until the end of August and then allowed to proceed home to Melbourne. In mid September I was flown to Japan to rejoin Bataan. One uf the two officers referred to above was trained to Melbourne from Cairns and accompanied me to Japan. From here Bataan sailed to Shanghai where a second Board of Inquiry was held in a British cruiser which had come up from Hong Kong. The Chinese providors were witnesses. From Shanghai, Bataan spent fourteen days in Hong Kong before returning to Japan. In mid NovemberI was informed I was to be court-martialled and so Bataan returned to Shanghai and Australia arrived from Hong of defrauding the Commonwealth Government and three charges of signing documents when I had no authority to do so. I was found not guilty of the two serious charges and as my signature was on the accounts my solicitor instructed me to admit the other three charges. The other three charges were l a i d under the a l l e m b r a c i ng p r o v is i o n of "" conduct to the p r e j u d i c e of n a v a l d is c i p l in e "" , w h i c h is a k in d of drag-net section t h a t is employed w h e n charges under otber sections f a i l . I do not question the fairness of the t r i a l , but I k n o w t h a t tlie officer in c u r r e d considerable expense in d e f e n d i ng h i m s e l f . The letter continuesFor several months at the end of 1!)47 Bataan was almost entirely engaged in this case, going or coming from Shanghai. She was sent thence, ostensibly on a courtesy visit, a request being sent to the Australian Minister in Nanking on both occasions for the visits to be approved by the Chipese Government. The following further expenses were incurred to bring nie to trial:-(1 ) An officer travelled by train from Cairns to Melbourne and thence was flown to Japan. (2) I was flown to Japan. (3) A shorthand writer aud another officer were flown from Sydney to Japan to assist at the court-martial. (4) An officer was flown from Hong Kong to Japan to assist the prosecutor at the trial. (5) tlie prosecutor (the captain of Bataan) took himself from Southern Japan to Yokohama to receive advice in conducting his case. (6) Fuel for consumption iu taking Bataan to Shanghai twice for inquiries. The foregoing expenses amount to almost £10,000 yet a request by me to have a retired naval officer flown ironi Sydney to Japan to assist me wns turned down unless I held myself responsible for his fare. Arriving in Shanghai 3(1 hours before ray trial I had to go ashore in a eity of almost 7,000,000 people and find a solicitor. There were four British solicitors in the city and I eventually obtained an UN.B.B.A. man. After my trial he charged me £150. To comply with naval procedure I was offered one of tlie junior officers in Bataan. It should not be necessary for me to place any additional facts before tbe Minister for the Navy. not know this man personally, other than through service in tbe Royal Australian he attained the rank of acting commander. signed certain documents and he realizes that bility for the sins of another. documents that had been placed before him without being able to check them. As the result of the findings of the court martial, he bas forfeited between £500 and £600 in deferred pay. Tbat is too harsh. the Army or in the Air Force. deferred pay of a soldier or an airman would not be touched. I know, that deferred naval pay is good conduct pay, but I am sure that no member of this Parliament would agree that a man who suffers a reprimand in any of the armed services should lose payments that have accumulated during many years of service. As I have said, I havo already taken this matter up with the Minister. I know that he is merely a cipher. Board. He sends matters such as this to the Naval Board, and the board provides tbe answers. But this is a special case. The serious charges were not proved. am diffident about mentioning the matter at all because I rather lean the other way, and believe that a man must take what is coming to him. I have sat on many ilfr. White. courts-martial in the A r m y and in the A i r Force, but I believe that human considerations must be taken into account. I repeat that the punishment must fit the crime. That principle is older than any military, air force, or naval law. I remind the Minister that there was a celebrated case in Englandi n which a midshipman, Archer Shee, was accused of a dishonest act while attending a naval college. He was expelled from the Navy. Sir Edward Carson, later Lord Carson, took up his case years afterwards. The incident was dramatized in a recent very fine British film called The Winslow Boy. The film showed how that boy was disgraced, but, through the persistency of his father and other relatives and with tbe. able advocacy of Sir Edward Carson, he was finally cleared, although he never returned to the Navy. The demand As I bave stated, I do made by Sir Edward Carsoni n that case was "" Let rigbt be done"". It took a this case. After five years' hide-bound Admiralty a long time to Navy recognize the claim, but finally right lieutenantwas done. I ask the Vice-President of As an accountant he the Executive Council( Mr Scully) to take this matter up w it h the Minister for be must accept the responsithe Navy, who is absent from tbe chamber He signed at present. I am not pleading for the man. ProbablyI do not know him anv better than any other honourable members do, but he bas come to me with his case, and I feel that the punishment imposed penalty upon h i m was harsh. The matter sbould This could not happen in be reviewed to ensure that right is done. The Question resolved in the affirmative. It is contended, PAPER.

H . J. RIVEBS : Loss OF BOAT. 2. Mr Bivers did not convey the informations to me concerning the refusal of the magistrateto issue a warrant but I have learned that such, was the case. The ruling was made (after theCrown Law authorities had proceeded against, the two men concerned on a charge, to the effect that on or about the ls t May, 1949, they had stolen the vessel), for the reason that thevessel had originally been delivered to theaccused by Mr Bivers under an agreement dated the 4th August, 1948, in which thelatter leased his vessel to those men for a period expiring on the 30th April, 1949. Themagistrate ruled that there was insufficient evidence before him to establish larceny and adjourned the case sine die. The vessel was not returned to the lessor on the date agreed', upon and it was later located at Soumalaki in the Tanimbar Islands from whence it wastowed to Ambon. To enable a prima faciecase to hc made out it was necessary to put before the court evidence of-intent to steal by the accused. 3. No, but that, nevertheless, was the position. 4. Yes. 5 and G. After the date of my letter of the3rd June, 1949, to Mr Rivers, a report of thehearing before the magistrate was received by the Crown Law authorities, Canberra, from the Crown Law Officer, Darwin, from which it appeared that the purpose of the proposed visit to land at of the police was to interrogate the accused with the object of obtaining admissions from them of their guilt. As one of the accused had constantly maintained to the Netherlands authorities that he had bought the vessel from Mr Bivers in August, 1948, it was considered by the Crown Law authorities that no useful purpose would be served by making the visit. The Dutch autliorities have been informed that the Australian Government no longer desires to send police representatives to Batavia (where it is understood the accused now are).

Full information concerning the reasons why it is necessary to continue to limit imports of petrol was given in the Prime Minister's statement made by leave in the House on the 25th May, 1949, and in the documents furnished to the Premiers for their conference on the 17th June, 1949, which were tabled in the House on the 21st June. statement and these documents it was explained that the operations of British-controlled companies are largely carried on in countries outside the sterling area, where some 85 per cent, of their total output is produced. The honourable member The quantity of petrol sold by oil companies in the United Kingdom for export to other countries is negligible. According to tlie United Kingdom trade and navigation accounts this amounted to only 5,692,000 gallons during 1948. In fact the United Kingdom is a substantial importer of petrol and other petroleum products and, like Australia, draws her supplies of these products from both British and American controlled companies. The nature and extent of the dollar cost of oil to the sterling area was also explained in thc foregoing documents. A t present the total net dollar cost is running at an annual rate well (a) the countries of origin, quantities over 400,000,000 dollars. As well as purchases from American companies this figure includes the cost of dollar freight and tankerage, and dollar expenses of British controlled companies operating outside the sterling area.

According to press reports the South African Government has announced that petrol rationing w ill be introduced shortly.

445,Mr Pollard,"The answers to the2. My department nas given the utmost assistance to manufacturers and exporters in the marketing of some of the commodities mentioned and was largely instrumental in initially ^establishing-the trade in lobster tails ahd f r u it juices. Difficulty has been, and is still being encountered in the marketing of leather and leather goods in dollar areas. Every opportunity is being taken to encourage the marketing of Australian products in hard currency countries however unimportant such trade may appear in the first instance.

Has his attention heen drawn to allegations by a correspondent in a 'Sydney -weekly 'newspaper that Maltese brought to Australia for urgent Commonwealtli projects "" have been insulted and pushed around"" at the rocket Tange? 2. W ill Ihe investigate these 'allegations .and also 'inquire into -the complaints of these -men, who claim .to be experienced carpenters, that they were rejected by a board on the range and advised to get work in a city f . 3. In 'fairness to Australia and because of the -splendid record of the Maltese during the war, -will he'take steps to-ensure that-these men aie not subjected to further hardships and .that there is a -proper examination of the qualifications of such tradesmen'before they are sent to Australiaf honourable member's questions are as follows:1, 2 and 3. The press statement to which thc honourable member refers is based on a misunderstanding of the conditions under which .Maltese settlers were brought to Australia. The standards of skill -within the trades associated with .building in Australia have always beon jealously guarded, not only in the interests of the workers themselves, but also in the interests of the public generally. Since other countries 'use different ^techniques in building and work largely in different materials, it follows that a skilled tradesman from another country does not necessarily immediately measure up to Australian standards of skill, iit ui realized, therefore, that it is -unlikely to be possible to carry out trade teste abroad which will bc acceptable to a l l unions and employers in Australia. Nevertheless, it is still necessary 'to guard against -men w it h no -skill or experience posing as tradesmen in order to be granted passages to this country, and -the Maltese Government, in consultation with the Commonwealth Government, instituted a system of trade testing of men who have applied for emigration from Malta as tradesmen. The 'trade tests are conducted by the Maltese trade -training authority and, while they do not .permit absolute deGnition of skill by Australian standards, they do -serve as. a guide to the skill of applicants. AU the Maltese settlers employed at Woomera who were formerly employed us tradesmen in .Malta were warned ..prior to embarkation for Australia, that irrespective of tlieir previous experience, their recognition as tradesmen here would depend upon their ability to establish the requisite degree of skill under Australian conditions. After their arrival at Woomera the men were given several months to settle down and were then trade tested by a board -consisting of a senior works supervisor of the Department of Works and Housing, a union representative, and a leading hand carpenter. Only a proportion of the men so tested were successful "" WEAPO NS TESTING RANGE. in satisfying the board that their skill was up to Australian standards. Those who did not pass thc test .are-employed as unskilled workers on tlie job, and were not advised to seek employment elsewhere. In view of these circumstances, I do not feel that any further investigation is necessary, for the situation in regard to employment of the Maltese settlers at Woomera is similar to that in Canberra and elsewhere, and is well known not only to me and my officers but also to the Maltese Government. I may say that while the difficulties of -this situation have been known for some 'time, I have not been complacent concerning them, and as a result of a suggestion made by me, through my representative in Maltai n May of this year, a technical expert from Malta asttt pnesent-on his way to -Australia to survey standards of Australian trade training in each State w i th a view to ensuring that future arrivals from Malta do measure up to OUT -standards of skill.

In reply I desire to inform him that importers would not -be required to pay for the goods at the higher rate if the relative dollar funds -were purchased in full (spot or forward) prior to the 19th September; otherwise payment at the higher rate would have to be made. Any importer in doubt on this -question should consult his 'banker. Where holders of import licences issued before the 19th September had not completed purchase of dollars against their licences and now have to purchase them at the new rate of exchange, an adjustment of the Australian currency values shown on their licences will be necessary. As announced by the Minister for Trade and Customs on the 23rd September, this -adjustment will be made.by issuing supplementary licences, where required, to .allow the importation of the same quantity of goods as would have been imported prior to devaluation.
