8,Mr Chambers,"I remind .theeach occasion, the reply was given that no action would be taken until the cost of production survey had been completed. In January or February last, a question on this matter was directed in another place to the Minister who represents the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. able member cannot refer to the proceedings of the Senate. answer was given that the Government could not give any assistance to the poultry industry until the survey was completed, and it was indicated that the survey would be completed in February or March this year. As an approach has been made since then, will the Minister say .when it is now expected that the survey will be completed, and what is holding up the provision of assistance to the industry? industry asked the Government for assistance a couple of years ago, the Government gave the industry a very substantia] measure of assistance by subsidizing the cost of feed. At the same time, the Government undertook to have conducted an objective but authoritative survey of the Australian poultry industry to disclose to the Government and to the industry itself the circumstances of that industry. That survey was conducted on an Australia wide, but State by State, basis, and the report in its complete form has been made available during the last few days. If the honourable member has not received a copy of it, I shall be glad to see that he does. I think the report will be generally accepted as a very valuable one, as it discloses certain circumstances that must be regarded as of great value to the poultry industry. For instance, it shows that, Australia wide, tliere is a much higher production of eggs from all pullet flocks than from flocks of older or mixed ages. It discloses, quite clearly, that where a larger quantity of feed is given to poultry than is in fact recommended by some authorities, production is much higher, and that an important factor in the cost of production is lay-out. Proper lay-out may enable one man to look after 2,000 hens whereas, in other circumstances his limit may be only 1,000 birds. All of this is very pertinent to the main question of whether or not assistance is necessary to the industry. The industry itself, and the State authorities, are now studying the result of that investigation. Air and the Minister for Civil Aviation inform the House whether any conclusions have been reached by the court of inquiry which was established in the United Kingdom to inquire into the structure and the performance of Comet aircraft, following a number of serious accidents? If the inquiry has been completed, has a clearance been given for the previous designs of Comet aircraft, provided some modifications are carried out? Is it also a fact that a new aircraft of the Comet series, known as the Comet IV., has now been designed and is under construction, and. will shortly be available for defence and commercial operations? Have any arrangements been made for the Royal Australian Air Force and Qantas to purchase a number of these aircraft as soon as they are available, and, if so, are the major airports in the capital cities of Australia at present capable of handling this type of jet aircraft ? member has asked a series of questions. I think I can remember them in sequence. The inquiry that was held into the loss of Comet aircraft in England was completed, I think, about last October. The findings of the court were that the aircraft were lost through explosive decompression following fatigue of the metal, and no blame was attachable to the operators, British Overseas Airways Corporation, or the manufacturers of the aircraft. The alloy used in the Comet was, I think, S.T.75, which is a normal aircraft alloy, but, of course, the truth is that the power that can now be obtained from the thrust of jet engines, and the knowledge of that power, outstrips the knowledge that we have of aero-dynamics, metallurgy, fatigue, and all that type of thing. There were, I think, 21 Comet aircraft finished, and ten of those were destroyed in various fatigue tests. The Comet II . and the Comet III . have been",10,Poultry

13,Mr Townley,"The honorabledeveloped, and, as a result of the investiview to relieving distress amongst gations that were carried out on the CometI . , certain modifications were made, but neither of those aircraft has been passed for civil work, to the best of niy knowledge. Although the Royal Air Force in England, I understand, has bought six of them, the Royal Australian Air Force has not. I do not know if the Royal Air Force intends to use them with the full pressurization, or will use them for service purposes at high altitudes with oxygen. The Comet IV . is still in the prototype stage, and has not yet become available. Qantas did have an order in for some CometI . aircraft. I think that was an order that came about because of our partnership in British Commonwealtli Pncific Airlines who had Comet I.'s on order. Tbat order, of course was cancelled when the aircraft was found to be unreliable. No jet aircraft of tbe commercial variety, that is, the Comet IV . , if it comes along, or the tific and Industrial Research OrganizaD.C.8 and that type of machine, will find that the airstrips in the major airports of Australia are too short for them. I think that one of the considerations is that in the future, but not tbe immediate future, we shall have vertical take-offs, and we shall not need thc long runways which' arc used to-day. It may be a long time, but perhaps we shall be able to use them for car parks. to the Prime Minister concerning uniof reserpine. I really have nothing to versity students. In view of the fact amend in, or to subtract from, the statethat a mature-age scholarship of £4 10s. ment that I made on this subject a few a week is awarded to university students days ago. who have reached the age of 25 years and are still studying, will the Prime Minister make inquiries into the deplorPARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION able living conditions of married students of this class, whose wives go out to work? Because of this the students Minister and his Government yet conare deprived even of the £4 10s. a week. sidered a question which I asked more It is necessary to add that the maturethan three weeks ago on the most imporage scholarship relieves a parent of tant matter of whether the Government financial responsibility on this scale would consider the sending to South-East even when in receipt of considerable Asian countries, including Malaya, income, but if the wife of a student earns Indonesia, Singapore and other countries more than £250 a year the meagre allowin that area, of a delegation composed of ance is withdrawn. Will the Prime members from both sides of the ParliaMinister examine the position with a ment, that delegation to report back to advanced university students? inquire into the matter raised by the honourable member. the Minister for External Affairs comment on the queries that have been raised about the scarcity of the drug reserpine, and suggestions that the cost of it is apparently less than he has stated? suggesting that the drug is not in short supply, and that the price of it is very much less than I had occasion to say in the House lately. I think I need hardly say that, before I made the statement that I made, I had had many discussions with tbe executive of the Commonwealth Sciention. AllI can say is that the price of the reserpine contents in capsules of the drug in Australia at present varies between about £25 a gram and as high as over £60 a gram. I think, from memory, that the figures I gave were "" between £30 and £40 a gram "". Perhaps, I should.add that that price refers to the reserpine content of the drug in the form in which it is usable by a patient. As to its not being in short supply, all I can say is that some of the greatest drug-manufacturing houses in the country, with world-wide connexions, are toothTO SOUTH-EAST ASIA.",11,Comet Aircraft

28,Mr Galvin,"Is the: Minister forou a request that' I made' to him concerning' the problem of certain ex-servicemen in South Australia, who, wishing to purchase higher priced homes from the South : Australian Housing Trust, found the loan of £2,750 insufficient, and were refused permission by the War Service Homes Division to obtain a second 1 mortgage from the trust? Can he say whether that policy has been changed'? transactions are undertaken by the. War Services Homes Division. I h two cases the advance was for only £2,000, raised in one case to £2,750, and it was thought that if the South Australian authorities took a second mortgage in one case it would give the applicant an advantage over other applicants in the other class. When the amount of the advance was increased to £2,750, after the last budget had been brought down, the Commonwealth's objection was removed. I am vnry glad to be able to advise the litonorable member that henceforth second mortgages may be taken, by tbe South Australian Housing. Trust, and rhat exrsei'vicemen. will, benefit as a result. I . should like to thank thc honourable member for -bringing the matter to my notice. The new policy will be of great advantage to ex-servicemen, who r-an obtain homes at a higher price than normal in South Australia. Minister for External. Affairs whether he can inform the Houseof the progress that has been made in the occupation of rhe Australian base of Mawson in the Antarctic Territory. Is this base proving satisfactory, and are any results of scientific value emerging from its operations? geographic location of Mawson has been very fortunate. It is in a very good weather area in. which a great deal of rock is exposed to geological examination. Both Mawson and MacquarieIsland are 1 in a. particular area of ionospheric disturbance, about 23 degrees from the Pole-, through which all radio' waves moving between Australia and distant parts of the world must pass. It isparticularly advantageous to fia<ve stations'in that area making aconstant check They have a very practical purpose so far as radio communications are. concerned. In the last, few months,, there has. been worked out a five-year, programme of scientific work in each, of the ten main branches of science. The peak will. be. reached in the' international, polar year. 1957-58. The station is in charge of. Mr Bechervaise this. year,, which is; the second continuous year of occupation. At present the staff consists of fifteen , or sixteen men. We are gradually proceeding towards the culmination of the work by about 30 nations, which will take place in 1957-58. I think the station has already achieved a considerable success and that the outlook, for the scientific and other work at Mawson, particularly in regard to weather prognostication, is very promising. Mr J. R. FRASER -Will the Minister for the Navy say whether inquiries have shown that the initial capital, cost of transferring the Royal Australian Naval College from Flinders, where it is now situated,, to Jervis Bay would be approximately £3,000,000, and that the cost of maintaining, the college at Jervis: Bay would be much, greater than is the cost of maintaining, it at Flinders? Do not all the reasons which were accepted for the transfer of the college from Jervis Bay to Flinders in 1930 hold good with equalor stronger force to-day? Will the Minister make a firm, announcement of the abandonment of the proposal to transfer the college, in. order to allow the proper civilian development of. the Jervis Bay area? first question asked by the honourable gentleman is that, hisfigures,are entirely wrong. The answer to the second question is that the conditions, which existed at the time of theremoval of the coUege to Flinders do not exist to-day. The answer to the third question is that the matter is being examined now and an announcement will be made when? a decision has been reached'.",13,Housing Oe Ex Servicemen

Will the Minister examine this anomaly with the object of abolishing this provision? what the honourable member has said is perfectly correct, but, frankly, I do not fully understand the import of the question. I sball be the happiest person in the world to discuss it vith him outside the chamber and give him an answer. to the Minister for Labour and National Serviee Hostels Limited and the accommodation provided by it for British immigrants. I should explain that at tbe Williams Creek Migrant Hostel in my electorate the three-room units which formerly were made available to couples with children have been subdivided, the two bedrooms alone being now made available to couples with children and the living room being reserved for childless couples. Was the right honourable gentleman consulted about this grave restriction? Has he been told of the congestion and dissatisfaction which have been caused by the new policy? Will he have the company's policy reconsidered? changes which are being made. The faet of tlie matter is that, owing to there not right honourable the Prime Minister. being the demands on accommodation in past years which have developed recently, the honourable member for East Sydney. we were able to make available to British immigrants and their families at matter hao to be brought to a head. I the hostels more accommodation than was lay it down as a rule of the House that originally planned. But now, owing to whenever ah honourable member refers to the considerable number of British immianother honourable member, he must use grants coming to this country, we have the title right honourable, or honourable had to revert to the arrangements which according to the designation. were originally made for them. Notification is being given to prospective immigrants in Great Britain about the conditions which will obtain when they get here. I am advised that no trouble has been experienced so far in relation to those who have been so warned. I think that what is happening now is that some people who have been enjoying these extra facilities fear that they will lose them, and they are making their protests known. I am not familiar with the circumstances of the particular hostel to which the lionorable member refers, but I have stated what I believe to be the general position. I shall examine the particular situation mentioned by him and see whether I can supplement the information I have given to the honourable member. MALAY A.

I ask the House to conform to that rule. under compulsion lionorable member ask his question. Mr Ward thereupon ashed a question for which notice was sought. MEAT. directed to tbe right honourable the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. Under the fifteen years' meat agreement with the United Kingdom, are Australian meat exporters permitted to sell a quota of their meat on markets other than the United Kingdom market? Was this allowance increased recently to 6,000 tons? Was a meat export permit refused to Swift Australia Company Proprietary Limited, of Townsville, after a sale of 180 tons of their share of the quota had been made to Ceylon, and the sale had to be cancelled because of thc cancellation of the meat export permit? Why was this meat export permit refused? Has the Minister any information he can give the House on this matter? within the terms of what is described as the long-term meat agreement, there is a specified tonnage of meat which may be sold by Australian exporters anywhere in the world outside thc United Kingdom. petent for the Australian Meat Board, or the meat board invoking the good offices of fhe Government, to negotiate with the United Kingdom Governmeut for tonnages even beyond that provided bination of our entitlement to export to other markets including colonies and quantity, will total approximately 25 per cent, of the total export of carcass meat. Full advantage has been taken of this by exporting companies. My advice i9 that not a large quantity of lamb was sent to other markets this year, because the prices of the United Kingdom market, broadly, were higher than those ruling in any other market in the world. Substantial quantities of mutton and beef have been sent to markets other than the United Kingdom market. In addition, no restriction is imposed upon the export of carcass meats from Australia to any of the British colonies.

Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization recently commented, on experiments on the modification of weather by artificially inducing ruin. Can the Minister in charge of tbe Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization inform the House of the details of the success that has so farbeen achieved with these experiments andsupply details of the methods which have been adopted ? Have experiments also been conducted by the Division of Industrial Chemistry into the problem of de-salting water? Is contact being maintained with overseas developments in this regard? eight years, a great part of the work of the Radio Physics Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization has been devoted to artificial rainfall experiments under the supervision of Dr. E. G. Bowen, the chief of the division. It is not normally my habit to refer to officers of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization by name, but this man is the head of the division and it is as the result of his genius that the work has been developed to a stage which has put Australia in the forefront of research into weather modification. The work was commenced, as it commenced in many parts of the world, with the use of dry ice, which is quite successful for the purpose, but is very expensive and economically impossible to use. Then, under the direction of Dr. Bowen, silver iodid'e was used. The distribution of silver iodide from burners in high-flying aircraft has been very successful when suitable types of cloud have existed. Silver iodide has also been successfully distributed from burners on. the tops of high mountains such as Mount Kosciusko. The experimental work is not by any means complete, but all the prospects are that within a certain timeJ cannot say hnw long'-it will probably be possible to amend the weather pattern in Australia during periods when suitable clouds exist. Dr. Bowen has been borrowed from the Australian. Government' by the Administration of the United States of America, for' consultation during about six. weeks in each year. During these periods, Dr. Bowen advises the American authorities and has conferences with their officers on weather modification. He is at present overseas on this work. Work on the de-salting problem is being done by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization with a solar still. This still is relatively small and its use would not be economically attracr tive, although it is possible to de-salt water by this means. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is following carefully the work on this ion exchange which is being prosecuted in the United States, Holland, and other parts of Europe. I do not believe that the process is yet economically practicable, although it is technically practicable. The promise of ability to produce fresh water from salt water is of considerable significance in Australia, particularly in the south-west corner of Western Australia, in relation to which my friend, the honourable member for Forrest, is constantly in touch with m& the Postmaster-General. Some time ago, I asked the Minister a question in relation to broadcasting services in the Northern Territory. The honourable gentleman, in his reply, informed me that those services were then being investigated. I now ask him whether any decisions have been made. moment. ter for Civil Aviation whether it is a fact, as alleged by the Albury City Council, that the City of Tamworth was given, different terms and conditions under which the Department of Civil Aviation would take over the Tamworth aerodrome from, those that were offered",17,Cameron Th E To Which They Are Attached Whether The

Postmaster-General whether it will be possible to consider, at an early date, an increase of the power of radio station 2CN Canberra. The establishment of this second Australian Broadcasting Commission station in Canberra has been a great boon to tliose discriminating people in the Australian Capital Territory who enjoy classical music and who appreciate the feast of reason and the flow of wit that come from this chamber, but, owing to its low power, people with similar discriminating tastes in the adjoining areas of Eden-Monaro and Hume are debarred from those pleasures through station 2CN. I notice that my colleague, the honourable member for Hume, joins with me very heartily in requesting the Minister to consider an increase of the power of radio station 2CN Canberra. Canberra, was specially designed as a low-powered, inexpensive station, mainly lor tbe City of Canberra. Other more powerful stations that have been designed to broadcast to the more distant areas of Eden-Monaro are in existence. As the honourable member knows,' a few nights ago, I opened a radio station of 10,000 watts at Bega, which covers a very wide area. As I have stated, the specific purpose of the establisbmeut of station 2CN Canberra, was to serve the City of .Canberra. It is a station of. I think, only 200 watts.

The true facts of the matter are as follows:The nuclear foundation, affiliated with the University of Sydney, is a body of businessmen founded to stimulate interest in the industrial use of nuclear power. It has provided .a good deal of money. Some time ,ago, the foundation publicly announced an .ambitious 'plan of research and training involving the building of two low-power low -neutron flux reactors. These were to 'cost in the 'neighbourhood of £2,000,000 and the foundation requested that their construction should be financed 'by government grant. foundation did not consult the Australian 'Government, the Australian Atomic Energy 'Commission -or its scientific advisers before making its decision. stood that the Minister wished to make a personal explanation because he claimed that he .had been .misrepresented in connection with an aspect of his administration. I submit that, under the Standing Orders, the Minister must confine his remarks to the alleged misrepresentation, and not address himself to whether .he was right or wrong. Minister wished to make a personal explanation, it was not necessary for him to 'obtain the leave of the House. However, he must confine himself to the points on which he claims to have been misrepresented. remarks are relevant to the misrepresentation of which I complain.

118,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Primevhich I made in this House on Thursday last. The misrepresentation that 1 allege is contained in a statenient attributed to the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) and published in the Canberra Times of Saturday, the 28th May, 1955. The heading on the item reads, ""Minister says rent review equitable"". I propose to quote exactly the £rst four paragraphs of that report in the words of the newspaper. They read as follows:Through its rent equalization proposals for Canberra, the Government had, for the first time in the city's history, achieved something approaching complete equality of treatment for its tenants. He was commenting on statements made by Mr J. Fraser (Labour, A.C.T.) during the Supply Debate in the House of Representatives. Thc Minister said that Mr Fraser had claimed that increases of up to 75 per cent. in the rents of Government-owned houses would place a heavy rent burden on people starting their careers. "" This is a misrepresentation of the facts "", said Mr Kent Hughes. "" The complaint has been-and Mr Fraser has been a leading complainant-tlia t those starting their careers are given the now houses carrying the higher rents. Under the proposed adjustment, these people will derive substantial benefits. I spoke in the House for 29 minutes, and at no stage of my speech did I make the statement attributed to me in that report. The only reference I made to young married people, or to people starting theii careers, was in that section of my speech which was devoted entirely to the present high rentals of newly constructed homes. I have an exact record of what I bad to say in that respect. My speech read as follows:In recent years, and more particularly over the last five and a half years under the administration of this Government, the cost of construction has risen alarmingly. In 194G, a brick home cost £148 a square; in 1947, £lfiO; in 1048, £195; and in 1949, £233. In 1950, which was thc first complete year the present Government was in oflice, the cost of building a brick home in Canberra rose from £233 to £285 a square.

Some are paying in excess of £4 a week. Indeed, on some homes, the rental has been assessed at more than £6 a week, but in those cases some reduction has been effected by disregarding certain on-cost charges, and by declaring the homes to be of an experimental type.

Cameron) I have received from the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr has been done, and it does not appear Joshua) an intimation that he desires to submit a definite matter for urgent public importance to the House for discussion, namelyThe failure of the Government to take appropriate action to resist the proposed freight increases of the overseas shipping combine in view of the recently announced exorbitant distribution, ot profits and bonusshares announced by the leading overseas shipping company. Eight honourable members having risen in support of the proposal, Anti-Communist Labour party) [3.45] I want toemphasize that this' matter of urgency is in regard to the Government's failure to take appropriate action to resist the proposed freight increase by the overseas shipping combine. Although this party a fortnight ago took the initiative in. drawing attention to the serious result to the Australian public from the: proposed increase of 10 per cent, in shipping freights,, the Government has done virtually nothing whatever to resist that proposal. The only action that the Goverar ment has taken is to propose another inr q.uiry. ""What, are those inquiries ? Are they just a blind to enable the subject to be put safely away for a time? That is all of previous inquiries. Every year we receive the annual report of the Australian. Stevedoring. Industry Board, and some years ago we had the Basten report on the Australian waterfront position. These reports are put on the shelf, and everybody proceeds to forget about the shipping position. I do not regard the further report which has been called for by the Government as being anything in the way of real action. It certainly does not constitute a move to resist the proposal of the overseas ship-owners. The Government did have some legislation passed, but it has not taken any action as a result of .it. So,, even the Government's legislation has not, up to the present, been effective, and the Government should consider actually doing something of a concrete nature. The fact to which we wish to direct attention during this debate is that the Government does not appear to be prepared to take (Hon. Archie any real action. It is simply evading the issue. TJp to the present nothing effective that anything effective is going to be done; I therefore make no excuse for proposing this matter for discussion. In addition to other aspects, of this matter we have the extraordinary fact that, while the great overseas shipping companies are, on the one hand, increasing their freight rates to and from Australia, they are, on the other hand, disclosing enormous profits of a magnitude probably never dreamt of by the community. We have, for instance, the report of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, which shows that the company will pay a dividend of 16 per cent, this year,, and will give a share-for-share bonus to its. shareholders .1 That is an enormous distributionof its profits, because the distribution of a share-for-share bonusis really a distribution of profits. The magnitude, of that distribution, of profits is. all the greater when we remember that the company",24,Newspapee Aeticle

Therefore, what it is doing from which I have already quoted^ as : now, in effect, is to give to every sharefollows: holder three shares for every one share liel'd in 1953. The position is stated very big shipping companies liave now sighted a clearly in the London Economist, at landmarka point wherethey have replaced page 492 of its issue of the 7th May. much of their war lorees with good modem Thc Economist states:.P. and O. sliowa that, allowing for free scrip issues and expressing this year's 10 per cent, in terms of the 1949 capital, there has heen air effective increase since 1949 from 1.2 per cent, tn 48 per cent. That must, be faced. That effective dividend of 48 per cent, means that Australian shippers of export goods, and Ausr tralian consumers of imported' goods, are paying about twice as much in freights as they should be paying. It is obvious that the overseas shipping companies have been making huge profits and sinking a great part of them into reserves. Sir William Currie, the chairman of the Poninsular and Oriental line, made it clear, in his address to the annual meeting of the shareholders, that this was not a temporary position, but was one of a substantially permanent nature. He said that the presentation of future accounts' would disclose more hidden millions arising from the conservative valuing of assets. He said that assets shown af £107,000,000 might in future, be valued at £137,000,000. There is no doubt that those companies have been putting away a good deal of money. The actual profits, disclosed up to the present time show that this company alone is making profits greatly in excess of those it should make. This year's 16 per cent, dividend absorbs only £1,200,000 of a profit of about £5,250,000. It is quite clear that, with, the one-for-one share issue this year, and supposing the company maintains its 16 per cent, dividend as I have no doubt, it will, only half the profit next year will be. distributed, and the remainders, will go into reserves. It is evident, therefore, that the shipping lines intend to continue to make this huge rate of: profit. It is further pointed out in the Economist that the position we have reached now is one that is likely to be stabilized for a considerable: time. The Economistalso 1 . .. . investors may feel that some, of the 1 tannage, husbanded tlieir resources in the face of high taxation, mapped out their stakein a -i'r transport and feel themselves strong enough, to absorb the probableshocks of their constantly changing business. 1 That sounds very creditable-, but we must remember that Australia, as a big country which is dependent to a large degree on overseas shipping, has paid very heavily to help shipping companies to achieve their present position and to put away enormous profits. What the action of the shipping companies means to Australia is very clear when we consider exactly what the Australian primary producer is actually facing. The level oi shipping freight rates is of tremendous importance to our primary producers. In 1953, our overseas shipping freight bill was about £150,000,000. Australia's annual shipping freight bill rises and falls in accordance with import restrictions policy,, the volume of our harvests, and' so on. An increase of 10 per cent, in those rates will mean that the Australian primary producer and the Australian consumer will have to pay approximately another £15,000,000 to meet the increased freight bill on good's to and from Australia. If we take into account the enormous amount of profit being made by the shipping companies, however, we find that the actual payment by the Australian primary producer and the Australian consumer is of the order of £80,000,000 assuming that our freight bill each year is about £150,000,000. I think that such a huge sum leaves plenty of room for reduction. We need to do a great deal to reduce it, because not only primary production, but also secondary industry, in Australia is facing a very serious position.

Of course we do not want to see that industry in a serious position. doubt that the Government recognizes the [Quorum formed.'] But we feel that the Government is actually not taking any active interest in a most important matter which affects the whole of Australia. A reduction of freight on goods sold overseas would be a move in the right direction and highly practical. The same is true of the sugar industry, which markets its product overseas and must pay expensive freights without making any profit. The Australian consumer must subsidize these enormous and exorbitant freights. The dairy-farmers are now complaining that they are getting inadequate returns for their butter, and they wish to increase the Australian price. If the Government took action to reduce freights on overseas consignments of butter it could give the farmers a better return for their labour without making the Australian consumer pay more and, thereby, reducing the standard of living. The wine industry also is meeting difficulty. A reduction in the freight on wheat would clear the silos of huge wheat surpluses. That industry also is in a difficult position. The flour-milling industry is quite profitless at present and government action to reduce freights would help the wheat industry enormously. The same argument is applicable to the flax and egg industries: indeed, every primary product is affected. We require some action by the GoCommonwealth shipping line, and that vernment in these matters. It is not Labour is a great believer in it. Hownecessary to set up an inquiry. The ever, though it has been successful on published statements of this compauy the coastal runs, that should not be its and other huge shipping companies reveal only role.

Mr Joshua. What action do we propose that the Government should take? There is no usefulness of socializing an industry, or part of it, to break monopolies. That is the great purpose of socialism. The Government cannot deny that it uses socialism for that purpose. I shall read a statement made in the last few days by the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator McLeay). He said, in effect, that the Commonwealth shipping line's present fleet of 41 ships is doing a great job for Australia. I am glad that this Government has increased the number of ships in the fleet that the Labour party established. The Minister saidThe present fleet of 41 ships with a tonnage of 210,020 tons, and five chartered ships of 46,000 tons comprised 32 per cent, of a ll Australian coastal shipping. Commonwealth vessels are now shipping 39 per cent, of a total annual ironstone and limestone l if t of about 3,750,000 tons and 60 per cent, of all interstate coal shipments. The Minister added. The Governinent policy has been to use Commonwealth ships in alleviating shortage of tonnage in particular trades and the relafively good present coastal shipping position is in no small measure due to the manner in which the vessels have been used. That shows clearly that the Government regards socialism as a useful method of breaking down monopolies. The Minister himself has stated that it is very useful.

The case that the honourable member attempted to make was founded upon the longpractised principle of hitting the big fellow. It is no part of my purpose, nor will it be found to be any part of this Government's activity, to defend the big fellow. On the other hand, it is our policy to deal with things in a business like and just manner. The production of a story about big capital assets and profits is not of itself a case. The raising of the big business bogy might be useful diversionary Labour tactics, but it is of little use otherwise. It is, of course, characteristic of both the Labour party and dictatorships to identify what will favour self-interest and then decide a course of action that has no regard for facts and justice. That is characteristic of dictatorships all over the world and is inherent in the approach and policy of Labour's Communist and anti-Communist wings. This Government stands for justice. It is following the course that I outlined to the House and to the people a week or two ago, and is allowing to"" operate the .machinery which the Scullin Labour Government established in 1930 to deal with exactly such a situation. I refer to the establishment of the Australian Overseas Transport Association, which comprises representatives of the overseas shipowners and the exporters. This issue, though tremendously important, will not have immediate consequences. The contracts that would be affected by the freight increase which has been sought would not come into operation until next September. The only exception is in the case of wool, the contract in respect of which will expire in July. We know that wool shipments will not commence in substantial quantities until some weeks after the first wool sales, which are usually late in August or early in September. Indeed, present shipping freights would stand for about another twelve months. I hope that in giving this date I shall not be regarded as not considering the issue to be important. I start discussing have made it clear both here and in the press that the issue is of the highest importance both to the Government in to to. and to me personally as a representative of primary producers. The Government will not accept a situation that cannot be justified. On the other hand, the Government will not set out to judge the issue until its own officers have carefully studied all the relevant facts, and until the parties most vitally concerned have had an opportunity to meet and discuss the situation. At the present time, the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, through its officers in this country and through its representatives overseas, is assembling all the relevant facts upon which a judgment can be made. Certain shipper interests, or exporting interests, have asked the department to assist them in assembling the facts which are pertinent to the case they wish to present. They have asked the department to procure for them some facts about the structure of the shipping companies themselves, to enable them to complete the preparation of their case. The whole basis of the argument of the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua), if a basis is discoverable, is the reported' profits of one company. I do not want to say a word in defence of what may finally be shown to be unjustifiable profits. But the profits of this company are not made in Australia alone. They are not made out of the Australian trade alone. There are some aspects of the company's operations which not only occur outside Australia, but also are completely outside tbe control of this Government. They may be a result of the policies of other governments. A great company may be permitted to accumulate its profits, and avoid disbursing them to its shareholders, without attracting punitive taxes, for policy reasons considered to be good by another government.

The accumulated profits will take another form, but they are profits nonetheless. I come to the Minister's point again and I quite admit that it is of no use to say what the freights should be. VVhat does he say? He claims that this .iniendment of the law in respect of the Australian Industries Preservation Act in 1.930 meets the position, but I say, with respect, that it does nothing of the kind. If there is an agreement between the shippers and the shipowners to ship exclusively on their vessels in return for regular sailings, that, in itself, is not to Government that that should be done, be deemed an agreement. A combination is punishable. It does not say that that is the method of fixing the just freights. Therefore, I repeat my suggestions to che Government. I think the Government should arm itself with the power to assess and determine what the just freight is; it should set up a tribunal to assess what the just freight is, bearing in mind all the matters mentioned by the Minister. It should look at all the facts, just as a price-fixing tribunal would do in regard to internal matters or the Arbitration Court would do in the matters mentioned by the Minister. The rate should not be fixed arbitrarily. Take that power, and it is not arbitrary for the Parliament to fix the rate on the facts before it. What is the answer? That was the just decision. of the Opposition enforce that? these shipowners become subject to our jurisdiction as their sbips come and go. That was decided in the early days of customs legislation-the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company v. Kingston. Overseas trade is a matter within our constitutional power, and freights can be fixed under those conditions with one limitation. Overseas shipowners can say that they are not going to trade with Australia. That is theoretically possible, but it is unlikely, because their trade with Australia is their main source of profit. We must have the first weapon, as a law, and be able to establish the machinery whereby we can get out of the arguments that eternally arise with this overseas shipping combine when they trade to Australia. I believe that the Minister is right in claiming that there should be justice, but it is not justice for the shipping companies to say to the Australian people, the producers, the importers, or the purchasers who have to pay, "" We finally and irrevocably determine that this is the rate, and we will not listen to your representations "". Let us publish it. Even if there is difficulty over any particular enforcement, it will have great weight, and that should be done. I again suggest to the and simultaneously the Government should equip the Commonwealth line of steamers so as to enable the ships to carry our exports overseas and bring our requirements bank to Australia. Those are the remedies. All this talk about a committee will not do any good. The Parliament and the Government must be armed with authority to deal with these people. The history of the shipping combine shows that exploitation is their rule in relation to Australia. They are not interested in the development of this country. They are interested in Australia only as a source of profit. They have exploited the people of Australia in all these cases. That is admitted. Those profits are not conclusive evidence, but they are pretty strong evidence that these profits are derived, to a large extent, from Australia. It is of no use for the Minister to state, as he has stated in this debate, "" I can say no more than I said three weeks ago"". He did say more; he spoke for fifteen minutes. But he has not done anything in the meantime, and the primary producers, whom the Australian Country party is supposed to represent, the importers, and the ordinary people who buy the goods, want action. I have suggested the form of action-the amendment of the law to set up a tribunal to determine a fair and just freight. At the same time the Commonwealth shipping line should be better equipped to carry on trade.",30,Oveeseas Shippin G Peoeits

136,Dr. Evatt,"Quite simply, becauseI notice in the press that Mr Harold Cox, who seems to know all the Cabinet secrets, has written that the Government is now bargaining secretly with the shipowners to sell the Commonwealth shipping line. That has taken place since the last debate on this matter. Whether or not the story is true, it seems as if there is some substantial basis for it. We should retain the Commonwealth shipping line because we want it to compete with other shipping lines. The Minister, in reference to the assessment of a just freight, claims that justice must be given to the people of Australia. Let us establish a judicial tribunal, with an Arbitration Court judge or some one experienced in this matter to preside, because if the workers of Australia have to accept decisions of an arbitration court, so should the overseas shipping combine.

The first point, I repeat, is that the Government has not welcomed this notification of increases in freight rates. The Minister for Commerce and other spokesmen from the Government, made it evident that we viewed with very groat concern a decision which would make our trading position overseas just that much more difficult. On the last occasion on which this matter was discussed, my colleague the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr McEwen) indicated the efforts that the Government was making, through the instrumentality created for the purpose of negotiation on these matters, to ensure that a reasonable rate was struck. 1 have no wish to hold any brief for the overseas shipping companies, which are well able to speak and act for themselves; but it is desirable that we maintain a sense of proportion in these matters. If the trade with Australia is so highly profitable as honourable members opposite seem to believe, I am surprised that the cargo ships of many other countries do not come here to get a share of that traffic. I recall that when we operated the Commonwealth owned shipping line, its operating costs were such as to make it necessary to keep freights at a level even higher than the charges which the overseas shipping companies found it necessary to make, in order that the earnings of the Commonwealth-owned line might break even with its expenses. As a consequence, the government of the day decided not to continue to conduct a shipping service on such an expensive basis. The overseas shipping companies, apparently, are making handsome profits. We certainly hoped that we in Australia might be spared increased freight charges, which the overall profits of the overseas shipping companies appear to make unnecessary. However, we should be in a very much better position to argue about the matter if our record in our own local shipping were better. Although freight cliarges on cargoes from overseas have increased considerably, freight rates on cargoes transported around the Australian coast have risen very much more steeply. It is all very well for the Leader of the Opposition to speak vehemently about the matter in this House at this time and to tell us what we, as a Government, should be able to do. The right honorahle gentleman, when he was a Minister in a Labour Government, demonstrated himself to be singularly incapable of doing what he now suggests should be done, even though at that time freight rates were increasing very much more rapidly that they have increased in the last few years.",31,Oveeseas Shippin G Peoeits
137,Mr Holt (Higgins,Minister for,32,Oveeseas Shippin G Peoeits
138,"Agriculture ( Mr Mcewen) And I , And","1 shall give the House some figures to illustratethe increase of freight rates that the freight charges imposed upon people occurred in thedecade from 1939 to 1949'. The Government parties werein office for less tha*n two years of that period, from 1939 until 1941, when almost no upward movement in freight charges occurred. However, in the remaining eight years of the decade, when Labour had the responsibility of government, freight rates increased with a rapidity that is unprecedented in Australia. I could cite to the House a great mass of figures and could give many examples if time permitted, but I shall not weary bonorable members by doing so. I shall merely mention the fact that the freight on cargo carried between Sydney and Melbourne increased from 20s. a ton in 1939 to 82s. a ton in June, 1949, during a period in which Labour governed for eight years, and before this Government was returned to office. If the right honourable gentleman can now give us all the answers and tell us how, within the constitutional limitations of the Australian Government, we can force the overseas shipping companies to abide by freight rates fixed below a specified maximum, why is it that, when Labour was in government, he permitted charges for the transport of goods round the Australian coast, which at least come more directly within the constitutional competence of the Commonwealth, to increase by 300 per cent? permitted at a. time when wages were frozen. were, fixed, and the wages of the workers, who had to bear the burden of the increased freight rates, were frozen. This right honourable gentleman, who now tells us how easy it is to limit freight charges, was singularly incapable of doing anything of the sort when Labour was in office. Although, in some respects; we cannot control the operations of powerful overseas shipping companies, and although, up to the present time, we have shown ourselves to be: incapableof competing with shipping concerns on a basis that would force freight rates down notably, in other directions we can play a useful part. We are told that 55 per cent, of who ship their goods around the Aus* tralian coast and overseas represents the stevedoringcost, in other words, the charge levied by the waterfront employers for stevedoring services. For years1 have waited in vain to hear one helpful word from honourable members opposite in support of the Australian Government's efforts to improve the position on the Australian waterfront. But, so far from helping a government that is trying to do something useful and to achieve that objective, honourable members opposite resist every move that this Government makes in that direction. attacks the workers. public places, I have stated that, properly led and with proper equipment, the Australian working man can more than hold his own with the best workers anywhere in the world. If the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) considers that, on the Australian waterfront, we are getting the level of. efficiency and the working effort that other workers regard as reasonable, he is very much out of step with the trade union movement generally. I . remind him that recently the interstate executive of the Australian Council of Trades Unions found it necessary to rebuke the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, first, for failing increase was to fill the port quotas as it had undertaken to do; and. secondly, for indulging in capricious and arbitrary delaying, disputes that, could have been settled more satisfactorily by the normal processes of arbitration. That is one illustration of the failure of honourable members opposite to help the Government in its efforts. We have also the revelation made the other day by Mr Justice Foster about the seamen. I suggest that, in this instance, not only are the members of the union culpable, but certainly the shipping, companies have shown themselves to be weak-kneed in their handling of the matter. We have learned, from Mr Justice Foster that shipping costs around the Australian coast have been increased because, apparently, the. shippingcompanies are",32,Oveeseas Shippin G Peoeits

By helping to solve these problems, and in other ways, a constructive Opposition could assist the Government to get the job done, but, instead, honourable members .opposite frustrate the Government's efforts at every turn. I have already pointed out in this House that the committee of inquiry appointed by this Government to inquire into the stevedoring industry has been empowered to investigate freight charges and the profits of the shipping companies. It is not true to state that nothing is being done to inquire into the profits of the companies. From the moment at which the committee began its task, officers have been engaged on an investigation of freight charges, and a firm of accountants has been authorized to investigate the accounts of the companies concerned. ter's time has expired.

It will not be backdated to the 1st January of this year. Let us see who are the gentlemen in a chronic state of impecuniosity who are receiving the benefits of these rises. The Auditor-General of the Commonwealth, who has been receiving £3,500 a year, is to receive an extra £1,000 a year. Probablyi f he had not been as critical of the paid more than the Auditor-General. I Government as he has been, he might have received more; but auditors-general are never popular with governments, and the present Auditor-General, who refuses to sign quite a number of balance-sheets prepared by departments under the control of the Government, has been as independent an Auditor-General as we have ever had. The Commonwealth Eailways Commissioner is to have his salary increased from £3,500 to £4,500 a year, another £1,000. I think I remember that when conciliation commissioners were appointed, members of the present Government were not too keen on the system, and I think they opposed the salaries at that time, yet the Government now proposes to give the Chief Conciliation Commissioner a rise of £1,000, which will take his salary to £3,250 a year. The conciliation commissioners who were appointed by the Chifley Government at the same salary as members of Parliament then received, £1,500 a year, and who are now receiving £1,800 a year, are to have an increase oif £950 a year, which will bring their salaries to £2.750 a year. Under the Chifley Government, members of Parliament, who have much more responsibility than conciliation commisioners, were paid £1,500 a year. They now receive £1,750 a year, plus allowances which vary from £400 to £900. So in the opinion of this Government a conciliation commissioner is more important than is a rank-and-file' member of the Parliament. I do not think that the Government will get any rank-and-file member of the Parliament to agree with it in that conclusion. As a matter of fact, most of those conciliation commissioners failed in pre-selection ballots, and therefore failed to become members of Parliament. That is why they are now to receive £2,750 a year until they reach the age of 65 years. which the honourable member was a Minister appointed them. appointed them, and we are not too happy, about some we appointed, if that is any consolation to the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton), and neither is the trade union movement. The Chairman of the Public Service Board is to be suppose it is possible to make out a case for paying that official more than the Auditor-General; but the Chairman of the Public Service Board is, to some extent, under the direction of the Government. He is not so independent of the Government as the Auditor-General is. The excuse that previous governments have not properly recognized the position of the Auditor-General is not a valid excuse for not paying him the same salary as is to be paid to the Chairman of the Public Service Board. In another measure it is proposed to give a judge an increase of salary amounting to £3,000. I think that the Auditor-General, who occupies a semi-judicial position, in which he is as independent of the Government as is a judge, should not be paid just £4,500 in comparison with the salary of £5,500 to be paid to the Chairman of the Public Service Board. But not only that, the Chairman of the Public Service Board is not to receive an increase of only £1,000 a year, as the Auditor-General, the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner and the Chief Conciliation Commissioner are to receive",39,Menzies

172,Mr Calwell,"Of course weunder this legislation-i e is Ito Teceive an 'increase -of £1,500 a year.. The .salaries of the members of the Public Service -Board are to be increased from £3,250 to £4,500 a year, an increase of £1,250. How -does 'the Government apply the yardstick^ To some it gives increases of £1,000 a year, to another it gives an increase of £950, and to others it gives increases of £1,250 and £1,500 a year. The Public Service Arbitrator, who has not been viewed favourably by the Government, I believe, because of his decisions on margins; is to receive an increase of £1,250, which will raise his salary from £3,250 to £4,500 a year. The Commissioner of Taxation is to receive an increase of £1,500 a year, and the Second Commissioner of Taxation is also to receive an increase of £1,5.00 a year. The Commissioner of Taxation, Mr other day, although it was a little superMcGovern, is a very estimable gentleman. All those other permanent public servants whose offices I have mentionedI am referring to the .occupants of offices under the Public Service Act, .and .not referringfor .some improvement in .their conditions, -to conciliation commissioners or the like now-ar e very estimable people who have served the Australian Government extremely well. But -why should the -Commissioner of Taxation and the Second Commission of Taxation Teceive increases of salary of £1,500 a year ? Why should -the Commissioner of Taxation -be paid the same salary as is paid to the chairman of the Public Service Board, and the Second Commissioner of Taxation be paid the same salary as is paid to the Auditor-General'? No explanation has been given as to how the Government arrived at those 'various decisions. It looks as if it put the amounts in a hat and pulled them out one by one along with the names of the persons who were to Teceive them. I repeat that, whilst it may be right to pay the increases, fhe Opposition is not prepared to say that the amounts provided for in the bill are exactly the amounts that should have been paid. We do not know enough of just what is happening in government at the -people to be covered by this particular moment to say whether this amount or that amount of increase is too much. Certainly, none of those increases is too little. Mr Cahnell. When one contrasts .the attitude of this Government -towards the :occnpants of high offices who have permanence and security of tenure, 'and who .do not need to leave the Public .Service until they are -65 years of age, with its attitude towards all those other people, including .age and invalid pensioners, war -widows and war pensioners, recipients of child endowment, civilian widow pensioners, and the like, whom I have mentioned, the contrast is .too -great to pass notice; and the effect on the people will not, I think, be favorable as far as the Government is concerned nor will the Government's action help 'the morale of the people. The Prime Minister can always make out a very good case for increases of this kind. He made out a very good case to us, from his own point of view, the ficial. There is no doubt that the recipients of the benefits given under this measure will be happy about the position, but there are quite a lot of other people outside this Parliament, who are looking who will not be so happy about it . There are .320,000 age pensioners in this country who have nothing on which to live except their pensions. I think that the Government might very well, at the same time as it brought down this, legislation, have hrought down other legislation-cal l it complementary legislation if you like-to do something for people under its care who are asking for something more than they are now getting. I see by the newspapers that war widows are asking for a pension of £10 a week. That may seem to some people to be .a large sum to pay as a pension, but it is not large when it is contrasted with -.the amounts now being handed out -to a few high public officials. Whatever government may be in office, all such questions as the increases of salary -provided under this measure, and increases of social services benefits, are .decided, to some extent, on what they will cost and on the extent to which the benefits will cover citizens in thc community. There -are not many measure; but that is no reason why there should be such marked differentiation at the present time as is represented by the measure. One other important point in this measure is the fact that the reclassifica*ion .of salaries is to date hack to the :23rd December, 1354. That is .probably .all right, but those whose positions have been reclassified are not .only to obtain fche benefit of increased salaries, but are also to obtain the benefit of the retrospectivity that is to be applied to the reclassifications. I suppose the provision in relation to superannuation is also quite all right. The public servants concerned will be able to subscribe for increased superannuation benefits as from the 19th January, 1955. The Opposition does not oppose the bill, but it thinks that the -Government might also have done something for a lot of other people, in addition to giving benefits to the very -estimable officers who hold the high positions mentioned in the bill. AlthoughI have offered some criticism of c< nciliation commissioners, I have offere'l it merely to underline tbe comparison between the treatment that the Government is meting out to those particular people and the disregard it has shown to the position of members of the Parliament, who are at least as competent as are conciliation commissioners and who will be paid very much lower sums than the conciliation commissioners will be paid, are being paid and have been paid since the lst January, 1955. -The provisions of this measure are what one would expect from a government of the character of the present Government. Of course, "" To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be taken away"". Very little can be taken away from the pensioners and such people, who are not to receive any more than they are now getting. I am particularly concerned to think that the Government would rush forward, as it has done in an' unseemly way, to make payments of increases of salary to public officials without prior reference to the Parliament. 1 spoke on this very subject in a recent debate. I am particularly concernedthat the Parliament is being disregarded on occasions, and that members of this chamber are given very little scope to R -(44 ] apply themselves to the various matters that come -before the House. I am concerned that the -executive Government is usurping the functions of the members who represent the people. This is a .sledge -hammer blow to democracy. It is -disturbing to any one who is really concerned about the working of our parliamentary .system. I am also concerned about the increases of salary given to the various heads of departments and public servants generally. I do not wish to embark on a tirade of abuse to the effect that certain heads of -departments are not entitled to substantial sums of money, because there are many fine people doing an excellent job who include heads of various departments, such as the Auditor-General, the Commissioner of Railways and others. These people are entitled to a salary appropriate to the service that they render this country, but I rise to express the strongest disapproval of the Government's conduct in this matter. ""Whether or not the salaries are adequate is beside the point. I protest most vigorously that at this late stage, after the money haB been paid, the bill is brought before 'as. I join the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in protesting that other people in the community were not also considered when these great salary increases were made. I wish to say something specific on a matter about which I asked a question this afternoon. I refer to the persons mentioned in the third schedule to the bill. Quite recently a gentleman, who was, no doubt, possessed of excellent character and high qualities, was appointed to the position of secretary of the Joint House Department. I do not know who made the appointment, but the world was left to find out that it had been made, for it was not reported to the Parliament. I understand that the gentleman concerned was associated with the workings of the Senate. Why he was taken from the Senate is beyond me, for that has not been reported to us either. Whether it was desired that he should be transferred to another place was not stated, but he was appointed to a position that comes under your jurisdiction, Mr",40,Menzies
173,Mr Luchetti (Macquarie) [5.23].,"Speaker, and that of the President of the Senate. He was given a salary of £3,200 a year. Honourable members, who must serve a long apprenticeship in local government, hospital bodies, voluntary organizations, the trade union movement, and political organizations in order to qualify themselves for membership of this Parliament, receive £1,750 per annum. They must, in a thousand and one ways, prepare themselves for service in this Parliament, yet the secretary of the Joint House Department, for seeing to the needs of this House and' of the Senate, and to the immediate surroundings of Parliament House, including the gardens and parks, is to receive £3,200 a year. The officer who was doing that work previously-apparentl y with some satisfaction, for no complaints had been made against him-wa s receiving a sum of only £80 additional to his annual salary. That gentleman must have been remarkably good to be able to carry out his duties in another place and, in addibe rather a change of form on the part tion, perform all of these services, for which he was paid only £80 extra. Because of some extraordinary internal country, approves of substantial increases organization, we find that the gentleman to high-ranking public servants. He now who now has the job is to receive £3,200 brings down proposals that, so far as a year. I must voice the strongest proI know, have not been submitted to any test against the manner in which these form of arbitration, giving substantial things are done. I am not going to cavil increases to people who are already at the qualifications or politics of this receiving big salaries. The increases officer, or about how the appointment was range from £950 a year to £1,500 a year. made; but I protest vigorously against It might not have been so bad if the the payment of such a substantial sum Prime Minister had been prepared to of money for a job of this kind. I ask say, "" All other salaries and incomes over honourable members to think over what which the Government can exercise some is involved in the duties of the secretary control will also be substantially or proof the Joint House Department, and then, portionately increased "". think of the management of a worthwhile hotel in a reasonably sized town.

There is a manager and an assistant manager of the bar and the refreshment-rooms. All of this calls out to high heaven for a review. I mention it this afternoon because it indicates the inherent weakness of the bill that is before us. I join my colleagues in protesting against what, obviously, is class legislation. I would like the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) or some one else to explain why these particular peopleagainst whom I have nothing individually-hav e been sorted out for special treatment. It is not so long ago since the Prime Minister was making statements approving the pegging of workers' wages. He thought it was a good idea, and argued that it would arrest inflation in this country. This proposal seems to of the Prime Minister who, whilst speaking of the necessity to peg workers' wages, the real producers of wealth in this The Prime Minister has said nothing",42,Menzies

175,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [5.31],"been made in social service payments, the Government has told us that they could not be made retrospective; that such payments could only be operative from the time when the Royal assent to the legislation wa3 given. That is another reason why I regard this as class legislation. Othor honourable members have referred to the fact that the Government did not have prior consultation with the Parliament on this matter. I consider that the Clerk of the House, Mr Green, adopted the correct attitude. Recognizing the authority of Parliament, he refused to accept an increase of salary until the Parliament had approved it. That was the proper attitude to adopt. What right has this Government to anticipate the approval of the Parliament? It also shows that these decisions are made at an executive level and are not submitted for discussion even within the Government parties. This is making a farce of parliamentary government. The decisions have been made and the increases have, in some cases, already been paid. The Government, even if it has a majority, has no right to ignore the function of Parliament and anticipate the approval of this House in such matters. That is exactly what the Government has done. I should like to hear what the Prime Minister has to say in reply to the point raised by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) and what you, Mr Speaker, have to say as well. It is all very well to tell us that a new position has been created. I understand it is classified as secretary of the Joint House Department. The position of secretary of the Joint House Department previously was regarded as a somewhat minor position. The officer who acted as the secretary of the department performed the duties associated with the office in addition to his normal work, and was compensated for the extra work by the payment of a small allowance. But suddenly we find that a separate and new office bas been created, and that t in remuneration of tbe occupant is to be £3,200 a year. Nobody has told ns what duties in addition to those that were performed by the officer who received an annual allowance of £80 are performed by the officer who now gets that substantial salary. Nobody bas told us what are the functions of the secretary of the Joint House Department. I want to refer again to the substantial salary increases, and to the fact that they have been made retrospective to the . beginning of the year. What justification was there for making them retrospective to the beginning of the year? When workers' wages are being adjusted, it is only very rarely that increases are made retrospective, and they are never made retrospective to the degree provided for in this legislation. Whenever we ask the Prime Minister about the pegging of workers' wages, he says that that is a matter for the Commonwealth Arbitra; tion Court, and that it has nothing whatever to do with this Parliament. But the Prime Minister knows full well that the government of the day can influence the attitude of the court to the pegging of wages. Action has already been taken by a number of trade unions to have th* 1 quarterly cost-of-living adjustments restored to tbeir awards, but when we ask the Priine Minister and the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) about the attitude that the Government proposes to adopt to those applications, they say that they are prepared to leave the matter to the court and that the Government will not intervene in any way. To be consistent, why do not they say that, in their opinion, the pegging of wages should be discontinued for the workers in tbe same way as, apparently, it has been discontinued for the higher ranks of the Public Service? I have always been of the opinion that, to make wage-pegging an effective instrument in arresting inflation, prices and profits also must be pegged. That is the only way in which we can achieve any stability in the economic structure of the nation. If the Prime Minister intend? to indicate by this gesture that wagepegging is to be abandoned and that the workers, who have been suffering from wage injustice, are now to be treated fairly, I consider he should go further and announce immediately what the Government proposes to do about increasing Commonwealth social services payments. I suggest also that he announce whether ihe Government intends to make retrospective to the commencement of the year any increase of social services payments of which tbe Parliament finally approves, and that the Government proposes to indicate to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court that, in its opinion, wage-pegging ought to end. To be consistent, that is what the Government should do. I should be very pleased to bear from the Prime Minister, or from some other Minister, what attitude the Government intends to adopt to the suggestions which I and some of my colleagues have made. Minister) [5.40] -in reply-On an occasion like this, it is not uncommon to witness some crocodile tears. We have just witnessed some from the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). He has now discovered that it is a very terrible thing to increase salaries, and make the increases retrospective. I do not remember him taking that objection when parliamentary salaries were raised retrospectively two or three years ago. Therefore, we can forget about that issue. But, apart from that, the discussion, if I may say so, has revealed great confusion of thought and considerable misunderstanding of what has happened. The bill does not deal with the ways and tingency, may come before the Common moans of appointing some parliamentary wealth Arbitration Court itself. officer. It deals with two groups of people. One of them is a very large group, consisting of many thousands of the 23rd December, 1954, and the 20tb people in the Public Service. In respect January, 1955. There was an enormous of those many thousands of people, the amount of work to be done, as honourable bill validates what was done by the Public members realize, in making adjustService Board at the beginning of the ments in a highly classified structure such year. It validates certain reclassifications as the Public Service of the Commonand payments, for a very good reason. wealth of Australia.

I wish that honourable members would understand that the decision in the metal trades case was given in December, 1954, and that it produced at once in the Fourth Division of the Public Service, which contains many people whose work corresponds to the work of the tradesmen dealt with by the court, an immediate necessity to make adjustments of wages in order to give effect to the judgment of the court. We should have been open to very proper attack if we had not made those adjustments, and if we had said to all those thousands of people, ""You will gei nothing out of us unless you conduct a long battle for it "" . The result was that adjustments were made. At tbe same time, the salaries of th* officers of the higher divisions of the Public Service came under review. Their case was before the Public Service Arbitrator. It was indicated, very sensibly,, that an earlier conclusion might be reached if the Public Service Board made an offer, or made a series of reclassifications and adjustments which would giv* effect to what the board believed to be the principles of the court's decision. It was pointed out that that would not prejudice the position of the Public Service organizations, wbich could still go on to say that the increases were not enough.

I understand that they have security of tenure, but I want to say-and I can say this as a result of a great deal of ministerial experience-that this country is tremendously fortunate in the quality of the men who occupy these positions in the civil service, and. quite frankly, I want to keep them. We do not get very far by saying, "" Well, somebody's salary has been raised by £1,500, somebody else's salary has been raised by £1,000"". Dear me. [ have had experience of men who have felt such a sense of vocation in their tasks in the civil service that do not know; that is just my suspicion they have refused, to my knowledge, increases of far more than £1,500 to take some post outside. I admire men of that kind, and I want to keep them. That is all that needs to be said about this matter. The bill deals with two subjects, and, on each of those two subjects, I find it impossible to believe that, on proper reflection, anybody in the House will think proper to vote against the measure. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second, time. In committee: The bill. I am not referring to anything that happened in the House, but I should like to place on record that the Opposition has never had any objection to the granting of marginal increases. Our criticism of the Government was that it acted a little too late, and that not enough was then granted to the rank and file, although something has been done in respect of the occupants of the highest posts. The tribute of the Prime Minister( Mr have been offered by the board increases Menzies) to the holders of these offices is just, and we do not disagree with a word he said. They are very good men, and they serve the country very well. Many of them could obtain greater salaries outside than they are earning inside the Public Service. However, it is not everybody who wants to leave a public service post. There is a sense of mission which keeps a number of these officers at their posts, and they have security of tenure of which the Prime Minister has spoken when the bill was in the House. I should just like to know whether the contents of the first schedule were determined by the Prime Minister's "" first eleven "" or his "" second eleven "". Could it have been true that the Ministers who are handling the departments mentioned in the first schedule are all members of the "" first eleven"" and, therefore, they obtained the £1,500 and £1,000 increase!) for those for whom they have some ministerial responsibility, whereas the people on the outside received lower sums? I mind operating; I could be entirely wrong. We intend to support the bill. We have never intended to oppose it. We do not want to oppose it, but we do make a plea to the Prime Minister, now that marginal increases for public servants are to be altered, and now that certain highranking public servants are to get salaries paid to them from a date anterior to the passage of this legislation, that the Government hold a special Cabinet meeting to-night, and do something for age and invalid pensioners. like to refer to some of the principles that are involved in this measure. The salary increases have been prompted by the action of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration in increasing the margins of metal trades workers to two and a half times the former level. My quarrel with the Public Service Board and, incidentally, with the Government, which I think has encouraged the board, is that public servants who might have fought their claims that will give them margins less than two and a half times their former margins. The increases offered by the board represent about £3,000,000 a year less than is represented by an increase of margins to two and a half times their former level.",46,Menzies

182,Mr Costa (Banks) [5.55],"I shouldThe rank and file of the Public Service should receive, in the proper time, as much justice as is being given to the higher oflieers of the service. The retrospectivity to be applied to salary increases from time to time comes before the Parliament for consideration. If the rich are to receive the benefit of retrospectivity, the poor also should receive it. l f judges and other high public officers are to receive retrospectivity, it should be offered all round. Workers who are not already in receipt of margins will receive no benefit from the margins increases. They are the very people who should be looked after. The Government has power, by regulations under the Public Service Act, to give to such officers increases proportionate to those that are being given to others, and it is wrong for the Government to peg the incomes of those people. They should receive consideration, and I hope that they will get it. I support the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) in a plea for consideration for pensioners. I hope that their claims will be considered soon and that they will receive the benefit of retrospectivity. I do not oppose the bill, because I realize that many public servants will receive a measure of justice from it. I believe that such justice should be extended to many more public servants than will be the case under this measure. Bill agreed to. . Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.

I was rather interested in some of the remarks that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) made when speaking on the second reading of this bill which proposes to increase the salary of the Chief Judge of the High Court of Australia by £3,000, raising his salary from £5,000 to £8,000. It is proposed that other High Court judge* shall receive an increase of £2.000, bringing their salaries to £G,500. Under the measure, the Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court will have his salary increased by £2,000, bringing it to £6,500. Otber judges of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court will have their salaries increased by £1,500, bringing them to £5,500. The salary of the judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory is to be increased by £1,250, bringing it to £4,750. I know that the gentlemen who preside over these courts occupy high and important positions in the land. As I have said on other occasions, they should be properly remunerated for their services. But it is necessary to have regard to the relationship of their salaries to the income of other members of the community and the general attitude, of the Government towards other people. The Government claims to represent all sections of the community including the workers, and undoubtedly it must have obtained a measure of support from the workers or it would not be in oflice. Consequently, it is outrageous that the Government should select people for salary increases who, whatever may be the justice of their claims in other respects, could in no way be regarded as so urgently in need as are other sections of the community for whom the Government has done nothing whatsoever. The Prime judges' salaries had been "" absurdly low "" for too long. I should like to know in what way the Prime Minister would use his mastery of the English language in order to describe the paltry payments to age and invalid pensioners and those in receipt of other social service payments if he considers that the judges' salaries --»-",47,Menzies

When, on a previous occasion, I mentioned by interjection that the 'proposed increase in salary for the Chief Judge of the High Court of Australia would be £60 a week, tbe Prime Minister referred to that 'amount, by interjection, as a ""minor increase "". Yet that amount, which the Prime Minister has described as a "" minor increase "" is much more tban .a member of this Parliament receives as his full salary.

Mr ""WABD -The Prime Minister able gentleman will please refer to the Prime Minister as the right honourable the Prime Minister. often right, but I suppose I must refer to him as such. I? rime Minister, on a previous occasion, reflected on a member of the judiciary, and I want to remind him of that before he has the opportunity of starting to criticize what I have had to say. He might recall that, when the Australian Labour party was in office, it formed, a Women's Employment Board, and appointed Judge Foster to the chairmanship of that board. I happened to be the Minister for Labour when that body was established, and when Judge Foster was appointed to act as chairman of it. Let me point this out: Whatever the opinion of the Government might be at this moment, at that time it did not like Judge Foster. Judge Foster was regarded as being too radical in his outlook, and he made a few statements of which the Government disapproved not disapprove of them. Opposition disapproved. This is what the present Prime Minister said on that occasionThe chairman of the Board is Judge Foster1 of the. County Court, ol Victoria. The then, member forMelbourne Ports, M.r. Holloway, by interjection, said; And a good man; too:! This, was fche Prime Minister's retortX believe that, he will dc his best' to be im pai;Cial.. Ih my opinion, that was a greater reflect tion upon the impartiality of a judge than any statement that I have ever made. I am not selecting the judges for criticism individually; I . am dealing with them in respect to .the position that they occupy,, and in relation to the special consideration that' they are getting from this Government. What does the Government propose to> do? Question after question has been raised in this House by members of the Opposition, urgingthe Government to do something in relation to social service payments.. Is there a. member of the Parliament, including those honourable members who sit on the Government 1 benches, who will deny that the pensioners are in a desperate position? Accordingto the Government, they can wait until the next budget session, but we are not even told what will happen to them when the next budget is introduced! I venture the opinion that, if the Government proposesto do anything at all for them, they will probably receive an increase of only a few shillings, and that the payments will not be made retrospective. Surely it cannot be argued that there is not distinct discrimination by this Government in its treatment of theordinary citizen, the worker in industry, and the person who is now retired from industry -the age pensioner-and of those persons who occupy these very high and privileged positions. I . have no doubt that the right honourable the Prime Minister is looking forward with longing eyes to finishing his. time, after he retires from the position that he at present occupies, in a comfortable position, probably on the bench of the High Court of Australia. Doubtless,, on this occasion, he islooking a little ahead in relation to the. salaries that will operate in respect of that position..

He is in wonderful form. six times, that might keep me going for the next quarter of an hour. The fact is, Mr Speaker, that the right honourable the Prime Minister is seriously avoiding any direct reply to these particular matters to which the people want an answer.

I know that the right honourable the Prime Minister declared, when replying to an interjector at one of his public meetings during his recent hurried visit to Victoria, who asked what he proposed to do for the pensioners, that if he lived long enough he would be on tbe pension himself.

Speaker, the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has wandered very far from the purpose of this bill. I think most honourable members will agree that the honourable member, who has just resumed his seat, usually shows himself at his very worse whenever the subject of the judges arises; but I must say. withHigh Court, as the honourable member out wishing to be unduly unkind to the honourable gentleman, that, of all people in this chamber, he has more for which to be thankful to the judiciary than any of the remainder of us. mysterious why, whenever judges' salaries are discussed, we can depend upon the honourable member for East Sydney for a fiery rodomontade against what should he a part of the highest institution of this nation. Most of the remarks of the honourable member were about an entirely false analogy between the part played by tbe judges in the community and the contribution made throughout their fairly long and, in many eases no doubt, meritorious lives by people who are now in receipt of the various grades of pension. 1 am sure there is not a single member of this House who, if he is honest, will be taken in by cheap observations of that kind, and I very much hope that.none of the people outside who may be listening to this broadcast will fall for loose and superficial talk of this sort. How can there possibly be any comparison between the relative work that has been perjudiciary. In the United Kingdom, the formed in tbe economic or social function by people wbo now can be described as being in the pension group, and what the judges of the Supreme Court and thc Arbitration Court have done, and are now doing for Australia? able member serious? ous. It is an argument of tbe most meretricious and cheapest sort to try to put retired people in the pension groups on the same plane as the judges. Of course, there is not a person in this country who would give such a loose argument more than a moment's consideration. honourable member for Hindmarsh, who is so fond of interjecting in any debate, asks "" W h y ? "". Let me remind himbecause he ought to know these thingsthat in this country, a federation, the importance of the High Court surely cannot be overestimated. The justices of the knows only too well, are in the last resort arbiters of the Constitution. They constitute the highest court of appeal in this land. If this country is to develop in the way that all of us, irrespective of our political views, hope that it will develop, and if it is to expand rapidly in the coming few years, the part played by the learned justices of the High Court will be even more distinguished than the part they have played in the 50 years of the existence of that tribunal. It followsand I hope it will follow, also, to the honourable member for Hindmarsh-that only men of the finest calibre and of the acutest acumen are suitable for appointment to sucb a distinguished body. It is quite useful in discussing these matters, especially as the honourable member for East Sydney has made the debate so controversial, to take a look at what various other countries of the world are doing, and what they think on such a question. Let us take a glance, for example, at the way that the Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America and of our sister dominion of Canada evalue their supreme law officer who, I suppose, would be the Lord Chancellor, enjoys a salary I have taken out the 1954 figures-of £12,000 a year. the Cabinet.",51,Menzies

If the right honourable gentleman wishes me to dissect the Lord Chancellor's salary, I shall do so. The Lord Chancellor receives £12,000 a year as a member of the Cabinet, and £8,000 a year in his capacity as a judge. The nine Lords of Appeal -in Ordinary .receivethese figures are all in sterling-£9,00 0 each, which, in Australian currency, is -equivalent to approximately £11,250 a year, compared with the £6,500 that we propose to give by this legislation to the justices of ;the High Court of Australia -States of America and Canada feel that Coming now:to the next tribunal in Great .Britain, we find that in the Court of Appeal, the President;-the Master of the Rolls-iireceive s £9,000 sterling, and the Lords Justices £10,000 a year each.

So the conclusion of this -matter is that, although, under this bill, the justices of the High 'Court of Australia -wili receive quite considerable increases in their .emoluments, compared with their brethren in :-the United States, the United Kingdom 'and Canada, they wil] still be very grossly underpaid. 1 would think that it would -be fairly safe reasoning to 'say that if the aggregate ol people of Great Britain, the United their judges perform that amount of social .service-that grand economic and constitutional function in the community -entitlin g them to receive those emoluments, the very least we can do is to offer -our justices the amounts set -out in this measure. In conclusion, let me remind honourable members that a judge, whether a judge of a court of appeal or a superior jurisdic tion, is an individual in any community who is subject to many disadvantages. He suffers from a degree of remoteness from his fellows which'the great majority of other people are not subjected to. He is, inevitably, the victim of a restriction of ""interests.

The Constitution establishes the federal judiciary and gives the judges their rights. The fathers of our Constitution, in their wisdom, saw the imperative necessity to have, in addition to a legislature and an executive, an independent judiciary which would preserve the rights of the individual and of the people.

223,Mr Clyde Cameron,"What is thefight in order to maintain it for the sake of ourselves and our children. In the early days, when the form of government here was in the nature of a military autocracy, when the people were mainly convicts or freed convicts, the common law of England became the basis of our legal institutions. coo much loud conversation in the House. private member of the Parliament, I object strongly to the fact that when I am listening to an interesting dissertation I should bo disturbed by the grunting of a former justice of the High Court. man never objects to what happens on the orher side. seriously. It is disgusting. called honourable gentlemen to order. Mr W. M . BOURKE I was referring to the fact that in the early days of Australia, when our institutions were in a dreadfully undeveloped state, we adopted the common law of England, and among the traditions of the common law which were incorporated in our legal system is this great and vital principle of the independence of the judiciary. Associated with these traditions dating back over the centuries were the names of very distinguished members of the judiciary who fought and established the rigbts of the individual. Those great principles were incorporated in our legal systems. As our community developed in the last century, we adopted a number of legal principles, in addition to those which were brought from the British legal system, in order to deal with our own individual conditions. It is rather interesting to recall that on such matters as land settlement, mining, liens on wool and crops, we were pioneers and developed a form of legislation to meet those peculiar conditions, which had no precedent in other parts of the world. The position is similar with respect to the secret ballot in elections, the Torrens systo the people of that State. tem of registration of land titles, our industrial legislation, shops and factories acts, and so on. At the time of federation we had been building up an interesting legal system. Then we adopted a federal system of government, under which we had our Eederal and State parliaments, with a division of responsibility between them, and the functions of the judiciary, important functions in the way of life of our people, became immensely more important, because the judiciary had the onerous and heavy responsibility of deciding whether Gommonwealth laws and certain State laws were legal and fell within established constitutional heads. The courts therefore filled a most essential role. In carrying out those functions, which were of great significance because of the federal nature of our Constitution, I think every fair-minded and responsible person must admit-and I would like the honourable members who have been interjecting to refer this matter to their consciences-that the judges of our courts displayed great ability. They carried out their functions with great independence and great integrity. The only occasions when any real criticism could have been levelled against judges in this community occurred in the very early days, when we were living in a primitive state and had not built up any legal traditions. At that time this was largely a convict settlement and some of the judges did things that rightly incurred public criticism. In those days men of real standing in tbe profession were not prepared to take on the job. But that was a long while ago, and those conditions do not prevail to-day. I believe that since those very early days our courts generally, and particularly our superior courts, have gained the confidence and respect of the people, and that in almost every respect our judges have been men of the highest character and calibre. I recall that, in Victoria, we had a learned Chief Justice Mr Justice Higinbotham, a statue to whose memory stands near the publio offices in Spring-street, Melbourne. That statue was erected by the people of Victoria in recognition of the very fine public services rendered by a very great judge Mackinnon family.",54,Menzies

We have not much history behind us in this country, and have not built up traditions for ourselves to any very great degree; but when we look back on our limited history, we find that among the names of the really great men in our past are those of a considerable number of justices of the High Oourt, men who, because of their learning, impartiality and independence, and because they carried out their high judicial functions fearlessly and effectively, have won a place for themselves in our history. We read such names as those of the members of the original High Court Bench-Si r Samuel Griffith, Sir Edmund Barton and Mr Justice O'Connor. We have also the name of Mr Justice Higgins, whose original and enterprising work in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration has won for him a place in Australian history. I can recall, in my own time, Sir Frank Gavan Duffy on the High Court Bench. He .was a fine lawyer and a fine gentleman. I can also recall Sir Isaac Isaacs, a very eminent statesman and lawyer who rose to the highest position in this country when he was appointed to be His Majesty's representative in Australia, the Governor General. He was appointed to that distinguished and eminent position from the High Court Bench, and it was a position that he filled with great dignity. Then we have Sir John Latham, another very distinguished occupied the position of Chief Justice of Australia. We bave also the present occupant of that office, Sir Owen Dixon, who has been worthily described as one of the greatest jurists in the world to-day. the honourable member for Hindmarsh I believe that it is imperative that we should continue to attract to the highest judicial posts in this country outstanding men of the calibre of those whom I have mentioned, who will continue to do their, job fearlessly and impartially, men who will be prepared to stand up to governments, if necessary, and be prepared to carry out tbeir functions, to administer the law fearlessly, and to protect the rights of the individual in this country. It is essential that we have the very best type of men occupying our judicial posts. BecauseI believe that, and because I believe that every responsible member of the community should also believe it if he is prepared to be honest and will not descend to tricks of demagoguery such as the honourable member for East Sydney descended to when he was comparing the amount paid to recipients of social service benefits with amounts paid under legislation to increase the salaries of judges, and calling it class legislation. The only comment I have to make on that is that the honourable member for East Sydney bas by no means a monopoly of regard for the welfare of tbe people who draw social services benefits. I should like to ask the honourable member whether he thinks his salary, which I understand he draws regularly each month as a member of this Parliament, should be the same as the amount paid to age pensioners. He may be prepared to answer that question. Or does the honourable member for East Sydney consider that he is entitled to draw a salary that is greater than the amount of pension that is paid to pensioners? If that is so, how can he legitimately and justly object to the members of the High Court Bench, and members of other judicial bodies, receiving salaries that are commensurate with the great responsibilities that are inherent in the jobs that they have to carry out on behalf of the people of this country ? gentleman, who last member reckoned that the justices of the High Court were "" fellow travellers"" because of their finding in relation to the Government's anti-Communist legislation. Mr W. M . BOUEKE -In answer to ( Mr Clyde Cameron), I remind the House that when the Chifley Government's banking legislation was declared by the High Court to be invalid, people like the honourable member for Hindmarsh and the honourable member for East Sydney bitterly attacked the High Court justices. They said that the justices were being political, that they were doing something political, that they were not carrying out their judicial functions with integrity and independence, but were doing something to spite a Labour government. I noticed, however,",55,Menzies
230,Mr Clyde Cameeon,"The honorabletliat when a. bill. tO; dissolve the Communist, party as. a political' organization, Court justices in the; manner that iswas also declared by thei High Court to be invalid, no such criesarose from those, of thing that we would expect to hear bonorable gentlemen.. from you. Mr W. M . BOTJRKE -That is completely untrue. Those two instances were brought to my mind by the interjections of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, and they illustrate, most forcefully that l the High Court has carried out its task with great distinction, real fearlessness and impartiality. The justices of theHigh Court are not concerned with the political complexion of a government. Tf legislation is,, in their opinion, invalid, they declare it to be so. The fact that the justices of the High Court. He attacked justices of the High Court upset the Chifley Government's banking legislation, and the Menzies Government's legislation to dissolve the Communist party, providestwo good examples of the fact that they do, in the proper manner, the job tha+ they are appointed to do. It is, I think, alarming that honourable members should criticize the justices of the High Court in the irresponsible way that we have heard them criticized. It is interesting that those criticisms eome from only a small section of the party led by the right honourable Leader of the Opposition. The honourable member for East Sydney continually attacks; the judiciary. ""Well, that is one of his stocks-in-trade, and perments quoted really do not represent his haps wedo not expect better from him. But there is one man in this chamber from whom weexpect better, and from whom we would not expect such irresponsible and untrue attacks. I refer to the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr honourable gentleman whom I have menWhitlam), who is a barrister of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, who practises in that court, and who has strong family ties in the legal world. He is a man who, one would expect, would offer a vigorous defence against any unwarranted and unjustified attacks on the judiciary. I was astonished when I read a. press report some monthsago which stated that, at a meeting of the Institute of Public Affairs inCanberra, the honourable member for Werriwa, who, I repeat, is a barrister of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, made an attack upon the; judiciary. He attackedthe High typical of a demagogue. It was. the sorti1 om the Yarra bank, or in the Sydney1 Domain, but. certainly it was not. the language we would expect from a responsible member of this Parliament. I quote from a report of the honourable member's speech which appeared in the SydneyMorning Herald of the lst February, 1955, which states that the honourable ; member for Werriwaclaimed the High Court had shown itself not 1 always above poUtical considerations. That is a completely untrue and uns warrantedstatement. He then went on to make a personal attack on some of thethem personally,, and I shall not repeat what he said' about these gentlemen, because I should not like to give further publicity to his remarks. They were disgraceful remarks', which were completely untrue. Then he said, according to thereportA Government proposing radical legislationdoes not study thePederal Constitutionso closely as it studies the constitution of the High Court, whicli might declare the legislation invalid. Another completely untrue statement! That statement of the honorable member for' Werriwa was not correct, and he knows it was not correct. I hope that he was misreported, and that the stateremarks, because a man in his position should know better than to> make such statements, and I am sure that he does know better. There are two members of the party sitting behind the right tioned-the honourable member fbr East Sydney and the honourable member fbr Werriwa, and in addition, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who enters the list by interjection-wh o show a contemptuous attitude towar'ds this nation's judges. It isan attitude which could well be fatal to the continuance of our democratic institutions, because if we attack the judges and undermine the confidence of the people in the judiciary, then we are undermining the confidence of the people in one of the essential bastions of our democracy. That could",56,Menzies
231,Mr Clyde Camebon,"But they camewell be one of tbe first steps towards; tbe overthrow of our democratic institutions and the establishment of dictatorship in this country. That being so, it is even more surprising to find that the right honourable gentleman who leads the Opposition, who himself occupies the unique-position in this country of having been a member of OUT highest judicial tribunal, the High Court, and of having come from that position into thia Parliament as a member-despit e that background, and despite the fact that if thei'e procedure which had been put up to him is any man in this community who should respect the importance of the position of the judiciary, it is he-ha s been indulging in this dangerous practice of attacking members of the judiciary. I must say that I was shocked and horrified recently to read a reportI put it as I know the facts-in the Sydney press that the Leader of the Opposition, during the 1 course of the Petrov royal commission, communicated with the Attorney-General of New South Wales, Mr Sheehan, and put a proposition to him, asking him if ho would have questions asked in the New South Wales Parliament. They were to be "" DorothyD i x "" questionsabout the three judges who were sitting ou the Petrov-royal, commission so that then he, the Attorney-General of New South"" Wales, could come in and attack them as afurther step towards undermining the confidence of the people in one of the highest institutions in OUT democratic community.

He refused to join in this plot or conspiracy which the honourable honourable member for Barton, will cease gentleman had put up to him and have interjecting. these questions asked in. the State house. He was not going to use his. position to cant that when the public first learned of attackmen of undoubted integrity, the disgraceful proposition that had been ability and impartiality, one of whom pat up to the Attorney-General of New Mr Justice Owen, had been appointed South Wales by the Leader of the Opposiby his own' Government.

He did not deny that the right honourable gentleman had made the approach to him, because, I take it, he is a truthful and honest man. He said, "" I am not prepared to make a public comment on it at this stage, but I am prepared to appear before any Australian Labour party inquiry that might investigate the matter and give the true story there "". It is a well-known fact that the stooges of the Leader of the Opposition who are preparing to overthrow the properly elected executive of the New South Wales Labour party able member is getting right outside the scope of the bill. Mr W. M. BOUEKE -Thos e people will be called upon to defend themselves. [ understand that they are not saying anything about this matter, but that at a certain stage they will be prepared to do .something about it. I invite the right honourable gentleman now, in this chamber, to tell the people of the Australia the truth about this matter. Did he make that disgraceful proposition to the Attorney General of New South Wales, and is that typical of tbe approach which he, .is an ex-member of the High Court, adopts towards the judiciary in this country? I might say, before tbe right honourable gentleman makes his -comment on it, that I heard him, with my own ears, attack the three judges .of the Petrov royal commission. I heard him in caucus deliver a most bitter and most disgraceful personal attack on each of those three judges, going through them name by name and saying things about them that were completely untrue. You told that story to the press. Mr W. M . BOUEKE I believe that this is an important debate because it indicates the irresponsible and dangerous attitude that is being adopted by some members of the Opposition, including the Leader of the Opposition himself, of undermining the confidence of the people in our judiciary. We must have an independent and impartial judiciary if democracy is to continue in this country. I am very pleased to be able to support this bill because I think that it carries out part of the obligation laid upon this Parliament by the Constitution to see that the judges should have not merely tenure for life but adequate remuneration so that they will not be subject to any form of influence, persuasian or suggestion, and will be able to stand up and be independent of governments or any one else in carrying out their vital functions on behalf of the people of this country. The House has heard three honourable members address themselves to this bill. First, there was the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), who is always exclusive, if I may use that term. He was followed by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Downer), wbo is a lawyer. What that gentleman had to say was most convincing, I am sure, so far as every honourable member of this House was concerned. The honourable member for Angas was followed by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W. M. Bourke) who also is a lawyer. He, too, was most convincing, so it is with some diffidence that I , as an ordinary layman, address myself to the bill. WhatI have to say is not very palatable to-me. Nor do I imagine that it will be very palatable to honourable members generally. However, certain aspects of this bill ought to be discussed. I have undergone the sufferings of the damned in trying to decide whether to remain silent or say what is in my heart and mind. Within the last fortnight we have heard two notable speeches. One was made by tbe Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the other by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden). Both were in conflict. One, in my opinion, was a contradiction of the other. I refer, of course, to the speech of the Prime Minister in introducing this bill, and another bill of tbe same kind, and to the speech of the Treasurer to the federal council of the Australian Country party, when he uttered grave warnings about the economic consequences of rising costs and falling prices in the export industries. The other industries, of course, are not material so far as our",58,Menzies

238,Dr. Evatt,"You told the press, too!",59,Menzies
239,Mr Roberton (Eiverina) [8.58],"national income is concerned. In view of those two speeches from those two eminent men, is it any wonder that ordinary people like myself are caught between Scylla and Charybdis, although I must confessthat the analogy is not particularly apt, since neither of the right honourable gentlemen can be described as a monster? One of the right honourable gentlemen was saying that we had nothing to fear from substantial increases in costs generally, and the other was saying that we had cause to fear rising costs. In my humble opinion, if the Prime Minister is right when he says that we have nothing to fear from this bill and from other bills of the same kind, then, quite obviously, to. that degree the Treasurer must be wrong. It is to that aspect that [ want to direct the attention of the House for a few minutes. I interpreted the speech of the Prime Minister in moving the second reading of the bill as a sort of recitative, to use a musical term. I felt that there would be lyrics and melodies to follow the recitative. I felt also, with very great respect, that if the recitative were out of harmony, quite obviously the lyrics and the melodies affecting lesser people would also be out of harmony. I believe that to be true. It has been constantly in my mind ever since, and I still believe it to be true. Prudence dictates that I should restrain my criticism-o r my observations, if less exalted occasion, perhaps for a less important bill. But reason demands that I should say here and now, at this critical period in our economic history, what 1 think about all bills of this description. We have adequate machinery to increase costs and wages. That will be conceded by every honourable member in the House. I use the words "" costs and wages"" to cover payments for services of every possible description. There are other words iri common usage, but "" costs and wages"" are adequate for me. In theory, precisely the same machinery ought to be adequate to reduce costs and wages, whenever it is necessary in the interests of the nation, and the interests of the people of the nation, that costs and wages should be reduced. But this alternntivp mnMiinorv is rtpver used ovfnpt as a last resort, until we have been driven to it by some force of desperation and until all other shabby tricks and subterfuges have been exhausted. I refer to the depreciation of our currency. We allow costs to increase and increase and to multiply and multiply until inevitably we have to face up to.the shame of depreciating our currency, or of resorting to discrimination among taxpayers. We have to resort to confiscation in respect of some of our taxation measures. Then, and perhaps worse of all, we bave to introduce punitive taxation. If men and women devote their energies to earning incomes in excess of those required to meet their immediate physical needs, they can be punished for earning incomes above a certain figure. able gentleman should come to the subject of salaries. respect, I am trying to show that if our costs move up-and this measure must have some effect on our cost structureand if the national income falls, we shall be in very serious difficulties. It is the manifest duty of every honourable member of this House to take that into cognizance when reaching a decision on this bill. All these features to which I refer-and this bill is a part of themstem from the fact that a great many of our peoplo h,nvf> boon brought up in the tradition that man's chief end is to get the maximum number of pounds a week, a month or a year, and damn the economic consequences. It does, not matter what happens, it does not matter who has to pay, and it does not matter where the money comes from. If we are in any difficulty, we will manufacture ways and means to meet the circumstances. All that I am saying-wit h very great respect-applie s to judges and judged alike. Quite obviously, if it takes £20 a week to keep body and.soul together in one country and £2 to keep body and soul together in another country, the wages levels in both countries are prcniselv the same. It may be that the higher"" cost country, the £20 a week country, takes some sort of spurious credit for a high cost structure, but the fact remains that the wages levels are precisely the same.",59,Menzies

That is elementary. But what is much more difficult to understand is the .effect of rises and falls in the -cost structures of both countries. If there is a rise of 50 per oent. in the cost of -living in hoth -countries, wages rates would have to move up £10 'a week in one 'country and £1 a week in the other -country to maintain parity. That is comparatively simple when national income is rising, but it is entirely different when national income and price levels are falling. If the fall is 50 per cent, in both countries and the wages rates remain the same, it is the monetary equivalent ;of a 50 per cent, increase of the wages rates in both countries, or of increases of £10 a week and Cl .a week respectively. It is then that we have to reverse the machinery, a step which ds always resisted, or resort to the tricks and .subterfuges that I have mentioned. That is what happened-and I have a very grim knowledge .of it-in T930. It happened to the whole world. It ""will happen again in countries where stern measures are not taken to prpvent"" such calamities from occurring. This is not a stern measure to prevent it. On ""the contrary, it is a measure that must in evitably accelerate 'the 'coming of a very dangerous situation. I want to make a very important quotation from a very important book. It is a thrice remarka'b'le quotation, and it reads as follows:The United enjoying a .period of unprecedented and from a-n examination is led' to the belief that this .condition 'must continue for a least the next few years. certain niinor 'booms are .undoubtedly place (sudh as, for instance, the present hign level of land values in Florida and one jor two other districts),, the industrial of America is undoubtedly based on a solid foundation. being 'is 'not of a temporary character is shown hy ' the isteady increase deposits. amount of these deposits has risen at the steady rate of J00,000,000 dollars a year to fhe present large total of 1,400,000.000 dollars. if r .

He -has been speaking for twelve minutes and I ""have heard practically no .reference to anything remotely concerning the judiciary. respect, sir, I am trying to demonstrate in a practical form that if the national income continues to ""fall, and if costs eontinue to 'rise, it will not be physically or -financially possible 'to put this bill in to effective 'operation. To that end, I have lead a quotation which, as I said, is remarkable for three reasons, each'of them dealing with this bill. The ""first ""remark-able feature about this quotation is that it was written about the United States of America exactly 30 yeaTS ago to this year, ! -and it could have been written about our trwn countiy at this very moment. All those circumstances are precisely the same, yet it was written 30 years ago, less than five years before the .entire world was plunged 'into fhe most bitter depths of economic crisis and human misery. I suggest, with very great respect, .that bills of this .description were the major contributing factors at fhat time, and they States of .America are now will be the major contributing factors prosperity again if fhey are introduced and carried of ite causes one at a time when the national income of our .country is Jailing.

243,Mr Speaker,Order! I must ask,61,Menzies
244,Mr Roberton,"With very greaiPetrie :says that I am speaking about primary industries. Of course, I .am! Primary industry provides 92.9 per cent, of the national income of our country, and if the primary producer is not entitled to talk 'about the matter, then in God's name who is ? I am sometimes in despair when I have to plough through the senseless prejudice. The cold fact remains that this bill will involve 'this House in substantial increases in costs, -and these costs will have to be met. If they are met effectively, they can be met only by the primary industries, assisted by .7.2 .per cent, of our national income emanating from our secondary and tertiary industries. Those .are the cold facts of the case, and that is what I am trying to demonstrate to this House. To increase costs and wages-an y .cost, any wages, the wages of the judges or the judged .alike-whe n the national income is rising, is not only very desirable but very necessary, as it has always been done -neglect it the fault cannot lie with me. Similarly, to fix costs and wages :at the increased level when the national income is static, or constant at a high level or at any level at all, is both desirable and necessary, and that too, Mr Spea'ker, has been done for a time. Some attempt has .been made to peg .costs and wages .in our own country in order to stop the inflationary spiral, but as against that, I want to make an accurate deduction .of the consequences of this bill. .All that is simple to -understand, hut to peg ""wages and costs at the increased level when national income is falling, is a form, in my humble --pinion, of economic lunacy that can only serve to increase .both .costs and wages by an amount equal to .the general fall in national 'income and price levels senerally. .Let me make this deduction. If it takes 4,000 lb -of raw wool at 20s. per lb. r.o pay some judge, or to pay some judges, or anyone at all, .then 'quite ©bviously. if rihe price '©f wool falls to 6s. 8d. per lb., it wall take exactly :24,000 lb. of raw wool to meet that .essential cost. I draw 'the attention of the House to the fact that wool to-day is not worth 6s. 8d. per lb., and because of that, 'we must follow the argument to its logical conclusion. Supnose it takes 8,0.00 lb. of Taw wool at 20s. per lb. to meet ithe icost. Then, if wool continues to fall-and it has fallen in the last few years-the n there must be a .multiplication of that 8,000 lb. to 16,'00.0 lb. and up to .24,000 lb., and ultimately to 36,000 lb., until the cost canno: be met. That is the aspect that I consider to be of vital importance to this House, and to every honourable member -of it MT. . MrEirziES -Did you raise thei; salaries when wool was £1 per lb. ? MT. ROBERTON -The right honorable gentleman has as""ked me a very pertinent question. Did ""we raise their salaries when wool was 20s. per lb. 1 To my recollection, their wages have been increased at some time during the last three years, if my memory serves me aright, and twice during the last six years, if my memory serves me aright. That, of course, is subject to correction It is not my duty to increase those wages'; ?it is the duty of other people, and if thej To increase -costs and wages, any cost and any wages-perhap s apart from the -wages 'of .sin-whe n the national .dncomf is falling is to multiply the entire cost structure in .a sway that must strike terror .into the heart of every person who ha? any knowledge of the inexorable laws of economics. That is quite manifest. Thai sort of thing went on in 1930. If the fall in the national income continues, then it will 'be practically impossible for m to meet these costs without a furthe? depreciation in OUT currency. It is my -duty to warn the House of that. What :Bhis bill proposes to do is to increase these salaries .at <& time when .the national income is falling, and by so doing, we .are manoeuvring ourselves into the same position into which we manoeuvred ourselves in 1929 and the years that immediately preceded it. Everything .that I Jiave said now I 'had the privilege, together with a great many other people, of saying to the late Jamos 'Scullin in this very building in 1930.

Lyons. I remember vividly the time when exactly the same thing happened and similar bills were introduced. In vain we pointed out that wool was worth Sd. per lb., and that if the measures were to be of any value co the country it was necessary that the prices of wool and other staple products should be stabilized at remunerative levels.

It consists of only one sheet of paper, but it is of profound importance to the people of Australia. It is designed to increase the salary of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia from £5,000 per annum to £8,000 per annum. The new salary will be approximately £160 a week. The bill will also increase the salaries of the other judges or the High Court from £4,500 per annum to £6,500 per annum, which will give them an income of about £130 a week. The measure is designed also to increase the salaries of other judges similarly. I suggest that, in the present circumstances, incomes of £160 and £130 a week are out of all proportion to the incomes on which this Government forces pensioners to live. ber get on with the debate.",62,Menzies

The day when even the judiciary is preserved from free and fair criticism in the Parliament will be a sorry day for Australia.

Judges receive substantial emoluments apart from their salaries. All their travelling expenses are paid and they enjoy all the necessary amenities. They are provided with staffs. I understand that each has the services of a tipstaff. I suppose that the term "" tipstaff"" has been banded down from the past. I do not know exactly what the function of such a gentleman is. In addition, judges receive substantial clerical assistance, any other assistance that they require. They are appointed for life-wh o would not like to be appointed to a position for life-and they retire on substantial pensions. I have no quarrel with those circumstances, and I consider that they should receive substantial and adequate salaries. However, I have a great quarrel with a government that introduces this measure, not only to provide these handsome increases of salary but also to make the increases retrospective to the 1st January, 1955, thereby giving judges six months' retrospective pay. I am sure that members of the judiciary are not down to their last shilling. One cannot blame them for accepting the increased salaries. Under the existing system, almost from the time we enter school, it is drilled into our minds that the higher the income we can earn and the more money we can accumulate the more distinguished we sball become and the better citizens we shall be considered. That is an unfortunate state of affairs, and I do not blame judges for it. It is a feature of the economic system that the greater the power one can wield over the people and the greater the income one can earn, the more distinguished one appears in the eyes of the community. I recognize that judges are distinguished in their own right by virtue of their citizenship, their learning, knowledge of the law and their capacity to child endowment. understand and study legal problems and people. They are chosen by the Australian and the State governments, for the States also are concerned, to administer the laws of this country fairly and impartially. It is striking that judicial salaries should be increased so substantially at a time when age and invalid pensioners receive pensions that are the equivalent of only about 26 per cent, of the basic wage. This is a disgraceful state of affairs, and it indicates that the Government observes a totally unjustifiable class distinction. I have always considered that men who hold highly skilled positions should receive good salaries and adequate remuneration, but I have never been unconscious of the fact that the essentia] needs of men and women are limited and that once their incomes become more than adequate they invest the excess and extract still greater incomes from the community generally. able member for Barton. occasion when I stooped as low as the level of the honourable member for Fawkner and I shall leave the honourable member for Gellibrand to be dealt with by the electors who will show their contempt for him. I believe in the payment of adequate salaries. I have said that I join issue with the contention of the honourable member for Fawkner that the judiciary should be a sacred preserve.

I . presume that. long, before this Parliament came into existence some L hody im the United Kingdom, the. homeof democracy,, exercised the right; to apply that appellation to him... Perhaps it is welli that: that: name: was applied to bim, because it probably resulted im his successors' being less bloody than the infamous'judge: himself . ThePriine Minister( Mr Menzies) has always been very sensitive to criticism of the judiciary. Before Christmas, a statement was made by the Prime Minister in this Parliament regarding certain' judges who had been appointed to a: commission established to deal with a: recent problem in this country. The Prime Minister, in defending the appointment of those judges-, said that he had appointed what he called' a "" balanced commission by a ""balanced commission""? Did he not consciously imply that it was necessary to pick from, the judiciary judges who would have certain outlooks? Had he not sought judges who had supported a particular political party prior to their appointment to the judiciary? Did he not indicate that he wanted judgesof a particular creed or faith?' If not, what did he mean by the statement, "" balanced commission""? When I asked the Prime Ministerthat question by way of interjection, he did not reply. Let us go a little further back into history in order toexamine, the tender feelings, of the Prime Minister towards the. judiciary; anddisclose his overwhelming bias: in connection with this subject. I was a member of the, Victorian Parliament in 1932, during the: depression years, when a decision was made to reduce thewages? and salaries of. public servants in Victoria by 22£. per cent. the Government introduced the relevant measure it. was discovered that Jfr. Pollard. the. judiciary had beens included' in The present Prime Minister, whowas: then a member of. the Victorian Paisliiamenf, objected, as he can, moat eloquently, and said that the inclusion;, of the judiciary in the proposals, then' before the. Parliament mighr In effect, the Prime Minister said that 1 his opinion of the judiciary was solow that; he believed that, if the judiciary suffered a 22£ per cent, reduction in salary, it' might tend to pollute' the fountain of justice. In reply,. I asked' the Prime Minister how he considered that awage reduction would affect the poor devil who was throwing earthout of a 6-ft. drain. I asked if the reductions would not tend to reduce the rate at which he threw shovelfuls of earth up onto the bank. So much for the impartial feelings of the Prime Minister towards the judiciary. I agree with the Prime Minister on the importance of the judiciary, but it is essential that, from time to time, without hope or fear of f avour, the members of this Parliament should express their opinions on. these matters, whether those opinions reflect on: the members of the What did he mean judiciary or not. The. members of the judiciary are exceedingly human and if ever the day dawns-, which, apparently the honourable member for Eawkner would like to see dawn, when these men are freed from criticism, it will be a bad day for this country. From time to time; some members of the judiciary may have erred. Such anoccasion was that, on which two judges of the High Court of Australia continued to heara casei which related to the banking legislation, notwithstanding the fact that it had been pointed out by counsel that they had interests' in some of the private banking institutions of this country. I suppose that the Prime Minister and the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) will' object to that statement. If the time comes when such statements cannot be madej it will be a sorry day for this country:. Mr W. M. Bourke interjecting. ber for Fawkner will be peddling his home' secrets, next.",64,Menzies
270,When Mr Pollaed,"The honourable memMr 'SPEAKER -Order! that the honourable member for Fawkner would stoop so low as to peddle statements t'hathe'heard in caucus and remain a member of it. Why did he not get out? Mr W. M . Bor/RKE -The honourable member J orialo r has not denied.my statements. that .the honourable placed on .the statements that he .repeated -was untrue. The Chief Justice of Victoria is a .man whom I respect. .He is a good lawyer and a former member of the Liberal party, .and I suppose that he has his unconscious prejudices. Recently, he considered that the increase that the Victorian Government proposed to% make in his salary was inadequate. Everybody has the right to kick a bit about their pay, Mr Speaker. Perhaps you have done that, although I do not think that you are a hungry man. However, the Ohief Judge of Victoria used the people's nourt in order to make a public statement concerning his economic position as compared with that of other people in the community. As the judiciary is superior to the Parliament in some respects, he -may have a legal right to do that. He -may nave been feeling the pinch, as the war widows and other pensioners are feeling it. But it is regrettable that the honourable member for Eawkner should be so tender in his /regard for the judiciary that he has contended that it should not be criticized. Mr W. M. BOURKB -I s that fair ? able member for Fawkner has spoken in this debate. occasion a member of Parliament had :i brother who was a .member of the judiciary of Victoria, and the -member said in no uncertain manner that the judiciary should suffer the same salary reductions as anybody else. I ""have no objection to people in every walk of life receiving adequate remuneration, but I do not think 'that the members of the judiciary are very 'badly off. I suppose that they have to 'live in expensive homes. 'They are isolated from the people and suffer 'a lot of dis-abilities, but 'they need 'not take fhe job if they -do not want it. I understand that there is great rivalry -in the legal pro: fession for appointment to the judiciary. j In view of the -attitude of the honourable member for Fawkner, I 'should not be 'surprised if he was a candidate for judicial honours. He -might hope to end up in that position some day, but bloody Judge Jeffreys would not be in it with him. I -member for Fawkner hope the Parliament is impressed by the fact that a large section of our community including, perhaps, for all I know, fhe mothers or fathers of members of the judiciary,, is in a dire plight because of its meagre income. If , simultaneously with t'he increasing'of the judges' salaries, some relief had been given to those persons, the position would not be so bad. I hope that if , or -when, adequate relief is given, it will be made retrospective to the lst January, 1955, and tliat this Government will extend to the people generally that degree of impartiality that it says it expects from the judiciary. 1 leave the matter at that.

275,Mr Pollard,"On one historicUpon what logical basis has the thinkability, which is an obvious absurdity, ing of the honourable member for East Sydney and the honourable member foi Riverina been conceived? The honourable member for East Sydney seized upon tlie opportunity to make the House a forum for the purpose of dragging in a discussion about the amounts that should be paid to age pensioners. I claim to have even more sympathy with the age pensioners than have honourable members opposite who, before the Government assumed office, refused to increase the pensions of those persons, whom they describe as being unfortunate. The honorwas the basis of their thinking, and that able member for Riverina has used the bill as a basis for an attack"" upon tbe whole financial and economic policy of the Government. If tbe honourable member had made his speech when the budget papers or other financial measures were before the House, I should have found myself in agreement with much of what he said; but to take this measure, which ought to commend itself to every reasonable person in the community, and to use it as something upon which to base an attack upon the financial and economic system is, in my opinion, quite beside the that, if a measure is introduced which point. As Opposition members know, it is not pleasant at any time for an honoring responsibility and outstanding integable member to find himself in profound disagreement with another honourable member who sits on the same side of the House; but on this occasion I feel that, as a member of the Australian Country party, I should express a contrary opinion. I know perfectly well that the prosperity of the primary industries forms the financial basis of this country. subject of this kind is a consideration Nobody knows that better than I do. To take this measure, which I assume will require no more than £30,000 per annum of a national income that runs into approximately £4,000,000,000, and to make it the basis of an attack upon our nnancial system, is to display a lack of perspective. Such an attack might well have been kept for another occasion. What is the real basis upon which this of the British Commonwealth of Nations, measure should be considered? I suggest that our thinking should be based upon the whole subject of the relationship of each person in the community to the others. If we were to accept the old theory that all men are born with equal Hr. Drummond -and that therefore they are entitled to equal remunerationa position that has not been achieved at any stage of the world's historyI could understand the honourable gentleman rising and saying that this money should not be paid for the purpose of increasing the remuneration of the judges. Is that the philosophical basis of the thinking of honourable members opposite? One would think, after listening to the arguments of the honourable member for East Sydney and the honourable member for Lalor, that thai everybody should be on equal terms and should get the same amount of money. Obviously, then, those honourable gentlemen should be paying back into some fund the money that they are receiving in excess of that amount to which their achievements in this House entitle them. I have heard no suggestion to that effect. Honourable members opposite do not accept the implications of their own arguments. Surely they should have the intellectual honesty and fairness to say recognizes outstanding ability, outstandrity, the persons in question should be paid according to their responsibility, and the ability, intelligence and training that they bring to the service of the country. I entirely agree with the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W. M. Bourke) and other honourable members who say that the right approach to a of the importance of the position in question, and the quality of the service that is rendered. Adopting that approach, the right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), the honourable member for Angas( Mr Downer), and other honourable members, have shown that, when compared with other people of equal ability, in this country and in other parts the judges of the High Court of Australia are underpaid. The most gracious and reasonable thing for honourable members to have done would have been to accept the bill as a normal and reasonable measure. By adopting that attitude, they would have shown that they really respected the judiciary. We have listened to the diatribe of the Lonorable member for Lalor, who has gone out of his way to do a little more to throw doubt upon the fairness of the judiciary. referred in bitter terms to tbe judgment in the Banking case, but he did not refer, as the honourable member for Fawkner bad pointed out, to what he might think to be the outstanding fairness of the judges in their judgment on the anti-Communist legislation introduced by this Qovernment. Surely we can maintain some sense of proportion in these things. Ef honourable members, in these discussions, take the basis of the lowest common denominator they will find, if they have their way, that this country will reach the lowest common denominator. It has been well said that the policy uf socialism running into communism is not to level up, but to level down, and the policy that we on this side of the House believe in is that there should be at all times a levelling up, a recognition of outstanding ability and the responsibilities that it carries, without whicli neither this country nor any other country can prosper. We do not believe in having outstanding people as dictators, but we do believe in giving recognition to ability and talent which will enable the people who possess tliose qualities, fairly and honorably discharging their obligations, to help l if t the community, and guide it and strengthen it. Without a recognition of those qualities, neither this country nor any other country can do other than wander in the mist and shadows and that kind of semi-world in which any parliament of nit-wits can put back the clock of civilization. I do not intend, nor did I intend, to speak at any great length on this measure, on which so much has already been said, but I want to say this: Tbe honourable member for Riverina has raised a very important question, quite rightly, in relation to certain trends in the possible income of this country. Nobody can make a prediction with certainty about that subject. For one thing, Australia is an amazing country. It has shown by its remarkable powers of recuperation how it can confound its critics. I want to say, in the light of my experience of administration through a most critical period of the economic life of Australia, and more particularly, of New South Wales, that .one lesson that I learnt, and shall never The honourable member forget, was that when the economic blizzard struck that State, there were a great many persons, and groups of persons, who were suffering from social injustices. There were many sections of the community, both important and relatively unimportant-becaus e all persons are important in the community-wh o were in a position of disadvantage compared with others. One case that come* to my mind was that of the University of Sydney, which had been starved of funds for years. Yet it, like many other sections of the community whicli were far less important from the poiut of view of responsibility to the community, suffered the effect of the impact of the 22-£ per cent, salary and endowment cut. I am perfectly certain that if ever a set of circumstances like that has to be faced again, there is only one principle that should be applied. This was very amply illustrated by one of tbe greatest industrial leaders the world has ever known, but of whom relatively few people have heard. I refer to Ernest Abbey who pioneered a magnificent experiment in social service in Germany which enabled it to withstand the impact of World WarI . That principle was that if a cut has to be imposed, it must apply with equal intensity to all sections of the community. If we have a measure of justice on the highest possible level and encounter some of the unpleasant consequences of a recession, the application of that principle would have such an effect, and would not give rise to a justifiablesense of grievance and injustice. Therefore, I find myself entirely in accord with this measure because I believe it is something that has been too long delayed in the interests of this country, where the whole level of remuneration has altered the respective values to the disadvantage of the judiciary. I am in accord with it, also, because I believe that whatever may be the trend of our finances, they can never be too poor to enable the remuneration of the judges to bear a [REPRESENTATIVES.] propernelation to that of the rest of. the community,, haying regard to their responsibilities, to maintain! the constitutional aaid social fabric. AndI am in favour of it because it appeals to-me in the nature of the fitness, of things. I believe that this country cannot afford to take, a narrow, poor and: miserable view of this measure. The honourable member for Riverina referred to the statement of the Prime Minister that this country could stand the increased expenditure. Of course it can!' He referred then to the statement of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) that Australiawould have to reduce its costs and increase its production. That', : was a perfectly normal' statement for a Treasurer to make; I would not expect the Treasurer, in the circumstances, to make any other statement. In this eountry to-day there are shortagesalthough not excessive-of material, and practically everything that w.e need to send us forward, at thespeed at which we would like to progress.. That is not the fault of the Government; it isone of the prices that wepay for the speed at which we. are trying to develop, and the speed with which we are attempting to increase, our population by immigration. We have over-full employment. It would, bea poor Treasurer whodid not tell, the country that unless productionwere speeded up to overcome the shortages and strengthen our internal fabric by keeping prices within a reasonable: oo.mpa.ss, we might expect serious reper oussions.. Personally; I"" lookmore to the danger' ofan increaseof' cost from that cause than from a drop of income. Both are things' that must be watched'. In any case, the Treasurer's business is to be a bit on the pessimistic side; because every Minister wants him to put money into something or. other. In Cabinet, relations with-the-Treasurer, it is: well known that Ministers put forward pleasbn behalf of. private members for' more money for various itemsi Therefore, the Treasurer, cannot be-too-exuberant in-his statements about the finances of, the country.

I think, too, that the other increases which it is proposed to grant should not be granted, at least until other sections of the community, very good people all, and very deserving too, also have received thejustice to which they are entitled from the funds at the disposal of the Government. It is all very well to give increases red herring across the trail. to judges and people in high positions, but it must not be forgotten that there are many other good Australians who are entitled to something as well. The pensioners, for example, have received nothing from this Government. If and when they do get something, I suggest that the Government will not date it from the lst January, 1955. honourable member for East Sydney( Mr judges. A great many generalities have Ward) summed up this debate when he said that judges should be properly paid. That is fundamental. Unless judges are properly paid, we are not likely to be able to get the best quality on the Bench. Men are not going to give up legal practices, from which they are earning great sums, in order to take positions on the judiciary for emoluments which are comparatively small, particularly in these days of high living costs. Having said that judges sbould be properly paid, one would have thought that the honourable member for East Sydney would have sat down. Unfortunately, he embarked on a tirade with regard to pensioners. He did not tell the House, or the country, that when he was a Minister of the Crown in 1949, which was a year of rapidly rising prices, the Government of which he was a member refused to give the pensioners an increase of pension. The honourable member did not then speak about Christian generosity or helping the retired pioneer, phrases that he adopted to-night. He conveniently forgot about those considerations at that time. One might have expected him, if he was so enthusiastic about the plight of pensioners, to have resigned from a government that failed, in a year of steeply rising prices, to give increased pensions, to pensioners. Did he resign from the goverament? Of course he did not. He waited until the people, including the pensioners, got rid of him and the government of which he was a member. What followed that event? The present Government, for the next four years, granted record increases of pensions. That, too, was a matter which the honourable member for East Sydney forgot to mention. His tirade was quite beside tbe point and was made with the object of drawing a The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) stated to-night that fair criticism of judges was permitted. He then went on to say that scathing criticism of judges also was permitted. Undoubtedly, scathing criticism of judges is not permissible. Whilst it is true that fair criticism of judges is permissible, the essence of such criticism is in the word "" fair "". We are dealing to-night with a bill which relates to the salaries of Commonwealth been spoken by way of criticism of judges, but at no stage of the debate has any concrete criticism been made against our Commonwealth judges, the reason being that the conduct of those learned gentlemen cannot be genuinely attacked or criticized. Many words have been uttered to-night, but there has been nothing behind them. They have been grains of chaff, rather than grains of wheat. Why should the House have to stand this sort of talk? Why should we have to put up with it, when even the honourable member for East Sydney is of the opinion that the judges should be properly paid? Presumably, that is also the view of the Australian Labour party. Is it right that base remarks, made by way of innuendo, should be used in this House about judges, against whom nothine derogatory can, in fact, be said at all?' The honourable member for East Sydney rightly said that, in considering the salaries that should be paid to judges, recrard should also be had to tbe emoluments of ^ther members of the community. The proper way in which to assess the salaries of judges is to have",71,Menzies
286,Mr Joske (Balaclava) [10.13],"Th eregard to the incomes that are earned by 'barristers. A leading barrister to-day makes far more money than the salaries which it is proposed to pay to judges under this bill. If we want tbe services of the leading men-and we do want them, because it is only through their knowledge, integrity and character that they become leading barristers-w e must be prepared to pay salaries which are, in some degree, adequate, even though it may mean, as it generally does, that they will have to make a sacrifice to accept appointments to the Bench. The salaries which are contemplated in this bill will still mean that leading barristers who accept judicial offices will have to make sacrifices to 'do so. In those circumstances, it cannot be said that any of tbe remarks that have been made against the salaries proposed by the bill are correct. This measure should have been passed very muoh earlier in the evening, and without the kind of debate which we have heard here to-night. adjourned.

'honourable member for East Sydney( Mr honourable member's questions are as Ward) asked for the preparation of a list giving details of ministerial visits abroad since 1949. I informed the honorable member 'that I would furnish him with this information as from October, T941. Since 'then, however, I have had an opportunity to appreciate the very considerable 'amount of work that would be involved in extracting from records information for which I can see no useful purpose. It is the policy of this Qovernment, as it was the policy of thc previous 'Labour Government, ithat Ministers should keep abreast of international ideas and developments that concern the departments they administer.. Unless they do this they cannot serve tlte people as they should. The -pursuit :of this policy had occasioned visits (overseas by various Mr Joske. Ministers and senior departmental offioers who a.ne their advisers, but, as the honourable member well knows, there is nothing new in this. Indeed, ministerial responsibilities cannot be carried out without a considerable measure of direct negotiation with other governments. I do not propose, unless otherwise directed by this House, to make available the detailed information requested by the honourable member. He may be assured, however, that whatever expense has been incurred in ministerial visits overseas, it has not been exorbitant or wrongly incurred when one considers the ultimate .benefit to Australia. upon notice1.

Development has furnished the following replies:1. An Australian company, Moore Road Machinery (Australia) Proprietary Limited, Melbourne, proposes to manufacture crawler tractors with the exception of the engines, under a licence agreement with John Fowler and Company Limited, of England. The company has divided its production programme into three stages. A t the end of the third stage it hopes to be producing a heavy crawler tractor witli an Australian content of 80 per cent. The company is now engaged in tooling up for the first production stage, which comprises the construction of the complete tractor less the engine, transmission and track chain, but including the track plates. This will give an Australian -content of about 30 per cent. It is hoped to commence this production about June, 1950, but it is not expected to tion before the end of 15157. 2. In March, 1955, Caterpillar Tractor Company of United States of America announced the formation of an Australian subsidiaryCaterpillar of Australia Proprietary Limited.
