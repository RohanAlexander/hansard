Either the Mr MacKELLAR (Warringah-Minister for policy is not being implemented as the Government Immigration and Ethnic Affairs) (2.57)-Mr intended or the advice on its effect is misleading. Deputy Speaker, what we have just heard from When is the Minister for Employment and the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Youth Affairs ever going to tell the Parliament Young) is one of the most damaging indictments the truth about the labour market situation in of Australian Labor Party policy on immigration this country? He compounds his answers in the that I have ever heard. What he is saying is that Parliament by his deliberate misrepresentation at present in Australia there is unacceptably high unemployment and that the semi-skilled labour about that? It says that it is going to increase the market is completely saturated. Yet the policies numbers coming in under the family reunion that the Labor Party adopted at its conference in category. It does not say exactly how. It has not Adelaide just recently do nothing more than indelineated that matter, but it has made the broad crease the entry to Australia of semi-skilled and statement that it is going to increase the entry unskilled people-not decrease, but increase. under the family reunion category.

This is one of the largest intakes of just exactly what goes on. The intake of migrants migrants into Australia, yet it does not come to AustraUa is made up of four broad categories, under NUMAS. It is one of the reasons why we namely, refugees, family reunion cases, the free have an unemployment rate-in new arrivalsflow from New Zealand and the admission of above the total market area.
