In numerous press releases and interviews over the past six years, we have seen this phrase bandied about by government ministers, expressing that in their opinion they are delivering good government to the Australian people. Just what is good government? Since the budget was handed down, many constituents in my electorate of Hasluck have been wondering the same thing.

234,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley) Took The Chair At 4.00 P.m.,"3524 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 disadvantaged while at the same time giving tax breaks to those who are better off? I think not. According to the Prime Minister in a speech he made at a Liberal Party function in 1999: ... the quality of good government is always to know what to reform, what to discard and what to preserve and what to refurbish. I would like to consider this year’s federal budget in light of those criteria. Let us look at what to reform. The measures that this government calls reform in the budget start with ordinary families and health care. Remember that this government has already presided over a five per cent reduction in the number of GPs who bulk-bill, not to mention an average $12 increase in the cost of visiting a GP. Families have also seen a $150 average increase in the cost of their private health insurance cover. But to compound this problem even further, this government has decided that it is going to reform-and I use the word advisedly-the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and increase the cost of essential medication for many vulnerable Australians. It is interesting that the government has decided to bring in changes by imposing harsher measures on those at the bottom of the food chain, the patients or constituents, simply shifting the cost from government to patients. At the same time it is doing very little to reform the cost of pharmaceuticals at the top end through targeting the pharmaceutical companies, the terms of the subsidies paid under the PBS and the pharmacists themselves. Indeed, the budget proposes that pharmaceutical companies get funding assistance to market their product more effectively. The additional cost of $1 per script may not seem a significant amount to the Prime Minister or to the Treasurer, but to people who are already struggling under the pressure of increased costs it is extremely significant. I want to place on record the situation for one couple from my electorate. Ken and Merle Longbottom of Gosnells wrote to me within days of the budget announcement. Mr Longbottom has suffered from severe heart attacks since 1985 and as such now has to endure taking six tablets a day, one of which is Ramipril, which attracts the $4 surcharge. Mrs Longbottom is also forced to take up to six tablets a day, as she is suffering from a severe gastric condition. The cost of the PBS budget measures in real terms for this couple in Gosnells will be an additional $6 a fortnight, a very significant amount for two people struggling on a pension. This comes on top of the recent 32 per cent increase in the cost of their private medical cover, which both have struggled to maintain, as they did not wish to be a burden on society. IfI can use the words in their letter, Mr and Mrs Longbottom say: We ... feel the added cost to prescriptions may not seem much, but as everything else goes up as well [this is] the straw that’s about to break the camel’s back. The Longbottoms are just two of the many people who have contacted my office on this issue. The government has underestimated the strength of feeling in our community about the PBS changes and the desire of ordinary folk to protect the sick and the disadvantaged. Australians want a fair go and will not stand by and see people kicked when they are already down. I am confident that the majority of my constituents are opposed to these PBS changes and support Labor’s stand on this issue. Clearly, the government’s so-called reform of the PBS by targeting those most ill equipped to absorb the increase is not an act of good government. What else has this government sought to reform in the name of good government? There is the disability services pension. Perhaps the real test as to the legitimacy of this budget measMonday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3525 ure was the fact that, within days of its release, we saw the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Prime Minister backtracking on some of its core details, due to the public outrage at such an ill-conceived policy. We are all aware that the minister was forced to admit that approximately 13,000 disability pensioners currently receiving the benefit and working a few hours a week would be adversely affected by the new measures. I have been told by disability pensioners in my electorate who are currently able to work a few hours a week that they are terrified at the prospect of either having to work a full week or losing their disability pension. They are clearly in no physical condition to cope with either scenario. But what of the other 187,000 pensioners that have been left to deal with the prospect of a $52.80 cut in their base benefit when they are pushed onto Newstart-not to mention the loss of other vital concessions such as the $5.80 pharmaceutical allowance, the $68 pension education supplement, the pensioner concession card and the telephone allowance? Again, as one example of the many, I want to place on record the situation of one of my constituents who lives in a caravan park in Caversham and who wrote to me asking me to oppose the federal government’s change to the disability support pension. He has a permanent disability and lives each day with acute pain. He is obliged to take daily the maximum dose of pain-killers to enable him to function. He has had part-time employment for over 10 years, working 24 hours per week, and is well respected by his employer and his peers. It is painful for him to work, but he forces himself to do so for his own self-esteem, as a form of physiotherapy and to reduce the so-called burden on the welfare system. He receives very little pension but relies heavily on the medical and other benefits that the disability support pension entitles him to. He will not be able to reduce his working hours to 15. If the federal government changes are made law, he will have the rug pulled out from under his feet. He stands to lose his park home and will not be able to afford the medication that he requires to continue to work and function on a daily basis. Whilst disability pensioners and disability services stay in the firing line of this government’s attempt to justify its so-called welfare reform process, the Labor Party will do all it can to protect these people by opposing these unfair measures in the Senate. The Minister for Family and Community Services’s crude response to this was to threaten to withhold the funding from the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. You only have to speak to the many individuals, families and community support groups in my electorate who have to deal with the frustration and suffering resulting from insufficient disability funding and support to realise what an effect such a course of action by the minister would have. I have previously spoken in this place about two of my constituents, Carol and Norm Franklin of Huntingdale, and their adult disabled son, Stephen. In that context, I spoke about their inability to access funding for accommodation support for him. I had the opportunity to be in contact with Carol following the announcement of the federal budget. I left messages for her, and she emailed me back. I asked her if I could read some of her emails into the Hansard, as her son, Stephen, has recently been diagnosed with lymphoma-a form of cancer. She wrote: Life is hectic. Stephen was diagnosed with a lymphoma, and I seem to spend most of my life at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. Another family that also lives in Huntingdale have a 19 year old son with Angelman’s Syndrome. This family are one of the families in critical need, Rick only sleeps for 2-3hrs a night, they lock him in his bedroom, so they can try to get some sleep. Rick now bangs constantly on his door for the rest of the 3526 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 night. So sleep for that family is rare, the other two children in the family are falling behind with school work because they are so tired. Did you read about Peggy Pratt a mother who had cancer and her dying wish was to see her son (31) be accommodated before she died, but she never had her wish. If Amanda Vanstone goes through with her threats the crises will only get worse, families will break down and a tragedy will happen. Someone will take their Child’s life as that is the only way that they can secure their future. Families are just surviving and being put in the middle while governments play their control game, only will lead to a Tragedy. The Disability Pension in the Budget doesn’t really affect our Kids because none of them would be able to work 15hrs at award wages, but in saying that they will never get a job, because they would never be productive. The prescription will be another added burden to families, most of our kids are on multiple medications, and the rest of the family would have to pay the extra because they don’t have a pension card. Regards Carol That is just how one family is feeling in light of the threats by the minister to cut the funding under the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. It led me to ask: why is it that the government are so insistent on targeting the disabled and the vulnerable in our society through shifting the cost burden of the federal budget onto them? Does this perhaps have something to do with another of the indicators that the Prime Minister used to measure good government-by what they discard or, should I say, by who they discard? In addition to discarding the concerns of those people, what else have they discarded in the preparation of this federal budget? The first thing I think that you could identify is responsible spending. The one thing the government decided to discard-more particularly in the lead-up to the federal election-was the whole concept of responsible spending. A multimillion dollar advertising spree before the last election, the HIH royal commission, the family tax benefit debt waiver and the ‘Pacific solution’, not to mention the Treasurer’s money market gambling problem, were clear demonstrations of this government’s lack of vision. This federal budget reflects their decision to make Australians pay for their continued mistakes. With the recent announcement of an additional ¼ per cent increase in interest rates the squeeze on already struggling families has continued. Disregarding responsible spending measures has produced a $1.2 billion deficit which the Australian people now have to pick up the tab for. But that is not the only thing that the government has sought to discard. Let us take the environment. Over the last three years, $484 million that had been pledged to help the environment has simply not been spent. That means that the funds the Treasurer claimed were needed for green issues were simply never delivered. World Environment Day was a stark reminder to catchment groups, such as the Canning Catchment Group and the Blackadder Catchment Group in my electorate, that the Commonwealth government has let them down. Their projects have been driven by grassroots community organisations which have invested a huge amount of their own time and resources in trying to save Perth’s rivers and the surrounding environment. The fact that the Commonwealth government’s second stage of the promised Natural Heritage Trust funding is still up in the air is putting at risk the good work of these catchment groups. Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3527 I want to look at another group of people affected by the budget, and that is women, generally, in the community. There is an old proverb that states: ‘Women hold up half the sky’. This proverb originated in China in recognition of the global contribution of women, a point that seems to have been discarded by the government in this budget. When commenting on the outcomes for women in the budget, Eva Cox of the Women’s Electoral Lobby, stated: When the government starts its women’s budget statement by announcing women’s suffrage a century ago, it is obvious that our present concerns are not high on their agenda. It appears that this government has no comprehension about the challenges that face women in our society today, many of whom are struggling to juggle the financial need to work as well as trying to raise a family. The juggling act is a very real issue for women in Hasluck, most of whom can literally not afford to take five years out of the work force, due to the growing financial pressures that record household debt and rising interest rates are placing on their families. The only new real measure for women in the budget, the much touted baby bonus, actually provides nothing for women who must return to work after their first child is born or indeed for women having their second child. To add insult to injury, the government has again ensured that it will be looking after the better off in society by ensuring that only families with incomes over $50,000 will receive the maximum benefits for stay-at-home mothers. For those women who do return to work, the level of assistance provided for child care remains a patchwork that especially does not meet the needs of mothers working irregular hours or shiftwork. What else has it discarded? As the implementation of the baby bonus scheme demonstrates, along with the government’s constant attacks on the sick and disabled, this is a government that is happy to discard the concepts of equity and fairness in Australian society. Nowhere is this more clearly demonstrated than if we look at what the government has sought to preserve in the federal budget. One thing it has preserved, it seems to me, is the coalition parties’ ethos of looking after the better off in this society at the expense of the average Australian. You have to look no further than the proposal to give the richest three per cent of the population a tax break by giving them a 30 per cent reduction in the superannuation surcharge rate whilst at the same time giving no such reduction to low-income and middle-income earners. During the last parliamentary sitting, Labor’s proposal for a fairer system which would see all Australians receiving a cut in their superannuation surcharge rate was deemed financially sound by the Liberal Party’s superannuation expert Senator John Watson. One wonders: will the government now move to grant this tax reduction to all Australians and not just the rich? The answer is no. Also, why has the government decided to make it easier for employers to get away with not paying superannuation contributions to casual employees? By extending the minimum income level calculations from a monthly basis to a three-monthly basis, it will now be much easier for employers to manipulate the hours of casual workers so that they do not reach the minimum pay level required for a superannuation contribution to be made. It is just another way that it has opened the door to exploit those who are in the most vulnerable positions in our community. Again much touted in the budget was how the government was going to address the pay parity issue for registered nurses in the aged care industry. As we all know, nationally the 3528 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 wage gap between aged care nurses and their public sector counterparts is at least $84.48 per week. The additional $51.2 million in the 2002-03 budget translates into less than an extra dollar per resident per day, a one per cent increase. For an average 48-bed nursing home or hostel, this means an extra $48 per day to increase wages across all shifts. You do not need to be Einstein to know that this additional funding will not be enough to address the wage disparities and stem the flow of experienced nurses out of the aged care industry. I now move to the fourth criterion of the Prime Minister’s policy of reform, discard, preserve and refurbish. What have they chosen to refurbish? Nothing at all. They have touted their Intergenerational Report as the blueprint for our future. Their flawed report concludes that we must cut expenditure now to pay for a future ageing population. One wonders where members of the government have been if they were not aware of this increasing problem of an ageing community. You have to examine the report itself and look at some of the ridiculous assumptions that underpin it-the accuracy of fiscal projections made 40 years in advance and the assumption that health issues for 70-year-olds in 2002 are going to be the same health issues for 70-year-olds in 2042. You only have to look back over the last 40 years to see the changes that have occurred. There is little, if any, clear detail about the effectiveness of costcutting now in areas such as health and education and training in reducing expenditure in the long term. I also want to talk about the lack of refurbishment in my own electorate. There will be no refurbishment on the number of GPs who bulk-bill in the Hasluck electorate, no initiatives to better combine federal and state health funding more efficiently, no funding for tertiary places for potential students in Perth’s outer eastern suburbs and no funding for the Midland historic railway workshop precinct. Given the Prime Minister’s own criteria for judging good government, what has this budget delivered? It will reform the PBS and disability support at the expense of the most vulnerable in our community, discard those who are sick and disadvantaged, preserve the standing of the well-off at the cost of the average Australian, and refurbish absolutely nothing. On their own criteria this has been a miserable failure for good government and certainly for the electors of Hasluck. stration) (4.20 p.m.)-At the outset I want to make it clear that I am speaking on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03. Although this is a cognate debate, as I introduced the other two bills on behalf of the government it would not be appropriate for me to speak on those bills and I certainly intend to desist from that. Having said that, there is a very wide-ranging debate permitted on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03, and I am pleased to have the opportunity of making a contribution. I cannot help mentioning the remarks made by the honourable member for Hasluck. The only failure with respect to the electorate of Hasluck is the honourable member herself. It is certainly inappropriate for her to suggest that the bills currently before the chamber have in some way failed the people of her electorate. The government is particularly proud of its budget which continues the sound and strong economic management of the government since it was first elected to office in 1996. It was re-elected in 1998 and the election in November last year saw the Howard government returned for a third term with an increased majority.

235,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and AdminiMonday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3529 from the electorate of Fisher my return to this parliament, I announced the Fisher 10-point plan: a number of key priorities which I have committed myself to work for during this term of government to ensure even better outcomes for people of the Sunshine Coast and, in particular, people of the electorate of Fisher, which comprises the central and Sunshine coast regions. It is important when we are elected to represent local communities that we seek to cooperate with those people elected at all levels of government. I enjoy a very fruitful relationship with the members for Maroochydore and Caloundra but, regrettably, the state member for Kawana seems all too often intent on playing politics, even when the result means our mutual constituents are substantially disadvantaged. I also enjoy a very sound working relationship with the councillors of both the Caloundra City Council and the Shire of Maroochy. The 10-point plan that I mentioned prior to the poll has a number of elements, some of which are matters of federal responsibility and others are matters of local and state responsibility. I am not going to apologise for the fact that I was prepared to stand up before the electorate of Fisher and say that I was prepared to fight for improved outcomes even if some of these matters were not, under our Constitution, matters of federal political responsibility. One of the complaints I regularly get in my electorate office is from ordinary, decent people resident in communities from Maroochydore south to Caloundra and west to Montville who are concerned about the state ALP government’s serial inability to deal with the ongoing problem of car hoons. Mr Laurie Ferguson interjectingWales Labor government has a policy which has seen car hoons have their vehicles confiscated in certain circumstances. The Queensland state government is looking at introducing some new laws which may prove useful, but the police service would have a much greater opportunity to clamp down on car hoons if the Sunshine Coast received its adequate quota of police service members right through our rapidly growing area. Regrettably, because of the ineffectiveness of the state Labor members in the area, the Premier of Queensland seems reluctant to give us police numbers which we desperately need if we are to ensure that the safety and security of coast residents is maintained and safeguarded. I get lots of complaints from residents who have their peaceful enjoyment of life interrupted by car hoons who have no respect for the civil rights of others. I hear about motor vehicles tearing up lawns and people being unable to sleep. I have called on the state government to bring in very strong legislation to deprive car hoons of their motor vehicles as the price of these people being uncivic-minded. In July, I am calling a public meeting for residents of the electorate of Fisher who want to express their concerns and share their experiences about the ongoing problems caused by car hoons. This is probably the No. 1 issue of people ringing my electorate office. They are concerned over the failure of the state government to act decisively in the way that Premier Carr has in New South Wales in relation to this ongoing endemic problem of car hoons. I am not going to apologise for standing up today in the federal parliament to highlight the plight of ordinary, decent residents of the Sunshine Coast who are having their lifestyle destroyed by car hoons, who are simply thugs. They are people who break the law and they should have the full force of the law thrown at them. The price of that force of the law ought to be that, when a car hoon",124,Representatives Main Committee
236,Mr Slipper,"I am pleased to see the member for Reid in the chamber. The New South3530 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 commits such an offence, the vehicle is subject to confiscation. It is simply not adequate for the state government to attack this problem with a wet lettuce; it is important that the state government listens to the community. I am calling on Premier Beattie, the state Labor government and state members to listen to the results of the community meeting which will be convened to talk about, and demand action from the state government in relation to, the problem of car hoons. Another issue which has concerned me is the fact that sewage is pumped into the ocean by coast based councils. The Howard government is the greenest government in Australia’s history-it has set up the Natural Heritage Trust and it is the first government which has been prepared to address the impact of 200 years of European settlement in Australia-yet we find that local councils are still pumping sewage into the ocean. I am particularly keen to work with the councils to ensure that this no longer happens. It is unacceptable that people who travel right around the country to enjoy our wonderful Sunshine Coast beaches should have to share the waters off the Sunshine Coast with sewage pumped into the ocean by councils on the Sunshine Coast. There has been some activity by councils with respect to this matter but, as we have now entered the 21st century, it is simply not adequate for this to continue. Another issue I highlighted, as I have done over the years, is the problem of unexploded ordnance, particularly in the Kawana Waters-Currimundi area, and I was fortunate to be able to attract the outgoing Minister for Defence, Peter Reith, to the Sunshine Coast prior to the election over this. It is a tragedy that unexploded ordnance, ordnance that has been around for the last 50 years since the Second World War, is regularly found, often by children. The state government has permitted the land to be cut up for residential development, Caloundra City Council has permitted subdivision to occur and the developer has made substantial profits from the sale of the blocks but we do have unexploded ordnance still present. It would be a tragedy if a child had to lose their life or a limb before this endemic problem was attended to. I am particularly keen to work with Caloundra City Council, the state government and the developer to make sure that this problem, which has been around for half a century, is resolved once and for all. It is not primarily a federal problem but we do have a circumstance where our community’s children are endangered by the fact that unexploded ordnance could be lurking in bushland or on beaches. We have had very large numbers of near escapes where young people have discovered these things, and then, of course, the ordnance has had to be removed or exploded. This morning I was very pleased to talk to the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, about this matter. One of the difficulties we have as a fast-growing area is that our infrastructure never seems to catch up with the growth in our population. People are moving from what I like to refer to as the rust belt areas of southern Australia to the sun belt, and it is important that the state government continues to pump additional funds into providing much needed infrastructure on the Sunshine Coast. The city of Caloundra is a rapidly growing area and regrettably the road from the highway is simply two lanes in places. I am calling on the state Labor government to improve access to the city of Caloundra from the Bruce Highway and to widen Caloundra Road to four lanes. I have had discussions with my state colleague Mrs Joan Sheldon, the member for Caloundra, and Caloundra City Council concerning this matter, and we are all determined to push the state government into this much needed action. Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3531 It is tragic when a state government plays politics. What happened was that the state government-the Beattie government-were elected and immediately upon election to office they dropped down the list of priorities the upgrading of Caloundra Road to four lanes. So in effect they said to the people of Caloundra, ‘Look, we’re going to penalise you because you had the temerity to return Mrs Joan Sheldon as the state member for Caloundra.’ Joan is an excellent member, and I just think it is appalling that Premier Beattie and the state Labor government show this level of vindictiveness in that they are prepared to penalise people because they have exercised their democratic right to choose to return a Liberal representative. The federal government has made funds available to upgrade the access road to the Sunshine Coast from Brisbane, and I am certainly working to seek additional Commonwealth and state government funds to widen the Bruce Highway to six lanes along its entire length from Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast. A very large proportion of tourists visiting what is undoubtedly the premier tourist destination in Australia travel to the Sunshine Coast by road. If you look at how clogged the roads are, you will see that those circumstances could well be a disincentive to people travelling to the Sunshine Coast. If people are not able to gain access to the Sunshine Coast easily, that, of course, has a negative impact on our local economy. I am lobbying the Deputy Prime Minister and the state government to start work on this very necessary continued expansion of the Bruce Highway, to build on the outstanding contribution that the government has already made to date. In Maroochydore, which is a growth centre, I am pushing for financial assistance to construct the southern access link road, and I want to support the efforts by the Shire of Maroochy to make this a reality and to improve traffic flow into the central business district of Maroochydore. On the Sunshine Coast there is particularly strong support for the proposal to build a Sunshine Coast arts and exhibition centre. The Sunshine Coast is, as I mentioned earlier, one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. We have a large retired population, a large population of young families and a very interested and active arts community. It is important that the Sunshine Coast receives such a centre, which will enable a very large number of shows, conferences and conventions to travel to the Sunshine Coast and take place in our local community, boosting the economy and consequently increasing jobs. I am working with the Maroochy Shire Council and the local community to do what can be done to bring this wonderful dream of a Sunshine Coast arts and exhibition centre to reality. Another matter we are looking at very strongly is a feasibility study into the development of a multimodal transport and communications corridor on the Sunshine Coast. As we continue to grow rapidly, it really is important that we have better methods of access to the Sunshine Coast, including rail. It is something which the entire community needs and it is something which we are working for. It is a particularly important element in the growth of the Sunshine Coast and the infrastructure and facilities needed to support our rapidly growing population. The present government is the greenest government in Australia’s history, and I want to support very strongly more Work for the Dole projects, more Green Corps projects and more Jobs Pathway programs allocated to the electorate of Fisher to help young people into work and to benefit our local environment. We have done pretty well in preceding years, but we have to build on that success and make sure that we get more Work for the Dole and Green Corps projects and more Jobs Pathway programs. 3532 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 The wonderful thing about these programs is that we have projects of enduring environmental and general benefit to the Sunshine Coast community. Just for a moment I will refer to Green Corps projects: the young people who participate in Green Corps learn something about the environment, become work ready and also know that they have the satisfaction of repairing the impact of a couple of hundred years of European settlement in Australia. I am pleased that we have delivered Work for the Dole, Green Corps and Jobs Pathway, but more still needs to be done. As a rapidly growing area, the Sunshine Coast central business district town of Maroochydore deserves a Medicare office, and I am lobbying the federal government for a Medicare office in Maroochydore. We have offices at the moment at Caloundra and Kawana Waters, and I fought very hard to make sure that those offices remained. I am pleased that we have been able to deliver to the people of Kawana Waters and Caloundra the continued services of those local Medicare offices. But it is also appropriate that Maroochydore, in the central part of the Sunshine Coast, also receives a Medicare office. The HMAS Brisbane has to be sunk, and the federal government has allocated the ship to the Sunshine Coast on the basis that it be sunk off Kawana-Mooloolaba. The federal government has also allocated up to $3 million both for the preparation of the ship for sinking and for its actual sinking; but, regrettably, at the present time we are being met with a total lack of cooperation from the state Labor government, and the Premier of Queensland has refused to sign the deed of gift to accept this ship, which will cost the state government very little. The local community will be placing very great pressure on the Premier of Queensland, and I would like to call on the state member for Kawana, Mr Cummins, to show that he is not as ineffective as everyone believes he is. He ought to get in there and back this very important job creation project, which will provide growth not only for our tourist industry in general and the accommodation industry in particular but also for other, additional jobs, which I think is a very important aim. I have been disgusted by the way that Mr Cummins has to date shown a complete lack of interest in this very important project. Premier Beattie will look very silly if the federal government moves the ship to another location off the Australian coast and if he, as a result, loses this moneymaking venture to another state or to overseas. I am calling on the Premier to look at the needs of the Sunshine Coast and to support the very important stand taken by the federal government, which says that the HMAS Brisbane should be sunk off the Sunshine Coast as a dive wreck. The budget currently before the chamber aims to keep Australia safe, our borders secure and our economy strong. The budget has been well accepted by people of the Sunshine Coast who value the fundamental objectives of sound economic management. The government will contribute $1.2 million over four years to a productive ageing centre to be established at the University of the Sunshine Coast. This was proposed by the government during the last election campaign and fulfils yet another government commitment to the Sunshine Coast and older Australians. The centre will provide services to the seniors community, and it will operate as a corporate entity in its own right and have a formal and financial relationship with the National Seniors Association. This is an outstanding budget, and I am proud to support it. Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3533 June, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Allan Hawke, put another hole in the government’s defence of its budget that it was based essentially on the needs of national security. He indicated that before the election, despite government claims, his department told this government that there was no way that costs could be held with regard to these areas, despite the funding of its election promises at a later stage. Quite clearly, this budget deficit has very little to do with defence requirements. It has far more to do with the $5 billion that the country has lost in currency swaps. It is far more relevant to note that $1 billion has been devoted by this government to advertising and consultancies. It is far more relevant to look at the outsourcing of banking from the Reserve Bank of Australia by various government departments, which also lost millions. A larger part of this budget problem is to do with the government’s total failure with regard to IT outsourcing. The taxpayer is up for a huge cost because of the incompetence of the previous, now retired, minister. It has a lot more to do with the home loan scheme, which saw 220 people buying homes worth $1 million receive assistance. They are the reasons why this budget is in deficit. It has very little to do with defence. I noted today in question time the desperate attempts by the Prime Minister to sound important with regard to his visit to the United States. Trying to make his visit relevant, every person that said hello to him in the corridor and every person that he met in the street was quoted. Despite how obsequious he is and despite his attempt to race with Guam, Puerto Rico or wherever to be the most obsequious, obedient supporter of the United States, the reality is, as a colleague pointed out to me, that he did not rate too highly in last week’s Washington Post. He was competing against sex scandals in the US Catholic Church, the burial of a Vietnam veteran, Karzai’s vote in Afghanistan, EPA plans with regard to coal burning, whether a few Democrats were using their association with Bush for re-election and a Chinese seizure of one asylum seeker. The competition was not really that outstanding, but he still did not merit a mention. Quite frankly, it really starts to show a few people where Australia does stand with regard to US perceptions. I am reminded of his performance at the time of September 11. There he was on national television, on the spot, seeming to be important. Then one of the three national broadcasters of US television said, ‘We are now going to take you to the only world leader in the United States at the moment.’ They certainly did not turn to John Howard; they turned to the President of Lithuania, which has a population of 3.6 million. That is the kind of payback that he has received, and it has been the same thing in regard to trade policy. Quite frankly, the attempt by this government to say that people have to suffer with regard to the disability pension and that they have to cop increases in pharmaceutical costs because of defence, terrorism, security et cetera is extremely shallow. Many of the reported defence expenditures that the government tries to use as a facade for these antisocial changes are actually to be met through funding changes in the portfolio and subsequent savings. I want to say that in my electorate, in contrast to that of the previous speaker, the government’s budget has not been warmly received. I did promise to read the words of one constituent into the record. The constituent says: I would like to let you know how the proposed budget measures will affect me! Please; Sir! pass this on to Mr Costello!!!!!",125,Representatives Main Committee
237,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (4.40 P.m.),"During hearings before a committee on 33534 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 I work as a security guard, &, earn just under $30,000 a year ... This is in addition to periodical, medication price increases!!! I work hard, &, long hours, I don’t ask for “FREE” medications! I pay my taxes, &, understand we all must contribute to the running of this beautiful country. I am not a “bludger”, I have a mortgage! But; I have to say! These proposals are very much UNAUSTRALIAN, and, NOT a FAIR-GO!!!!!!!!!! That typifies the reaction in my electorate. The budget has not been warmly greeted by people in the field of disability as the government seeks to deprive people of their current entitlement to the disability pension. ACROD, a group interested in this field, has asked me: ... to ensure that disability employment organisations in your constituency are able to continue to provide services for people with disability. The Down Syndrome Association of New South Wales says: ... the proposal to move people with disabilities, including those with intellectual disabilities, currently receiving DSP, who are assessed as able to work more than 15 hours a week at award wages, to the Newstart Allowanceis an attack that is to be resisted. It goes on to say: People with Down syndrome need and require support in all aspects of their lives. Today, people with Down syndrome are developing their independence. An important component of which is seeking employment opportunities. Similarly, there were statements by the Physical Disability Council of New South Wales asking me: ... to do everything in your power to oppose and stop the Government’s proposed reduction in eligibility for Disability Support Pension. So we have the main players in this field-the people representing people who find it very difficult to articulate their thoughts, people who are suppressed, people who have disabilities-saying that the government’s changes are totally wrong. No less a person than Kerryn Phelps of the AMA commented that the government’s medication changes ‘will hit the sickest and the poorest-people with chronic illness will be particularly affected, as will people with young children who are often at the doctor’s’. This of course comes at the same time as the government’s broad threat to basically get rid of Medicare in this country. It wants to take us down the road of the US system where, unless you are in the most desperate, dire circumstances-in the bottom 10 per cent of the economy-you will have to pay for it. If we are to have that system, the vast majority of people who feel some identity with the Medicare system in this country will no longer feel an identity because they will not have self-interest. Essentially, the government is trying to bring in a system in this country which plays to private corporate interests. This is the same government which now says that we should be alarmed at the cost of pharmaceuticals in this country; that we have to increase prices because they are getting too expensive. This is the same government which last year for the first time tried to appoint representatives of the pharmaceutical industry to the bodies that basically decide which-and for what price-pharmaceuticals will come into play in our system. Last year the government was trying to give the corporations more Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3535 power in the system. Obviously the only interest the pharmaceuticals would have is to get more bucks in return for their research. But the government is now saying we should be worried about the cost. This is a significant attempt by this government, now that it is in power, to increase these costs. This is not the first time: it is just a continuation of what it has been doing over the years. With regard to the disability pension, the government is saying that all new applicants and those being reviewed after 1 July 2003 will be subject to this change. The reality is that for once this government has not been totally doctrinally driven; it has looked at a few realities in the workplace. These days, people over 40 offering themselves to employers are basically regarded as pests. Half the time they are not going to get jobs. Perhaps some people went onto the disability pension because of this reality. Quite frankly, a policy which is designed to deprive them of $52 a fortnight, to force them to tramp around to employers who are not really interested in them, really makes you doubt the practical outcome of it all. Up to 200,000 people receiving disability support pensions will be forced onto Newstart if the government proposals are implemented. This will mean very real suffering for very real Australians. Quite frankly, I am unimpressed with the retinue of government speakers who have come into the House and into the Main Committee saying that the government have made the hard decisions. They are not making the hard decisions for themselves, for federal members of parliament; they are making hard decisions for people in our electorates. They are making hard decisions for people for whom $52 a fortnight is big dollars. They are making hard decisions because of their own mismanagement in a variety of portfolios that have virtually nothing to do with defence requirements. In one of the portfolios that I have been interested in, we have seen $1 million provided for Australian citizenship campaigns. These were undertaken to regain some momentum after last year’s promotional campaign which was conducted for only a few months and which has foundered. The government have also guaranteed in this budget that the Living in Harmony initiative will continue for a further three years. There has been no increase in funding and I note that more than half the allocation for this aspect of multiculturalism goes to departmental overheads rather than to grants to the community organisations that are really doing something practical out in the electorate. A variety of interest groups have approached me with their criticisms of the government’s accent in this policy area: that the government’s only concern is to slap themselves on the back and say how great the country is, that we are multicultural and have very few problems. I know the new Northern Territory government, amongst others, has said that we should show a bit of interest in the problems we still face. That government reflects a broad number of people in Australia who say that on the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination we still have racial vilification, racial discrimination et cetera in this country. We should not spend this money on allowing the minister of the day to run around the place getting a few television shots and assuring everyone that everything is well. That is not to say that there are not a significant number of groups funded by this money who do good work. The government has reached a stage where there has been an initial evaluation of the first stage of the Living in Harmony initiative but still today the outcomes of that have not been publicly released. The full evaluation of that program has not been given to the public and perhaps having that out in the marketplace for discussion is overdue. The budget also an3536 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 nounced that from July 2003 there will be funding for the AMEP, the migrant English Special Preparatory Program and the Home Tutor Scheme Enhancement Program. Once again it is a continuation of current funding levels. There are no initiatives, no changes and no improvements. The future delivery of migrant English services remains rather uncertain due to the fact that the tender process has not been completed and could be another six to 12 months away. I noted, in discussing this issue with various groups around Australia, concern that we have situations-in Perth, for instance-where husbands and wives are doing courses at two different colleges across town. Obviously the management of that in the family situation is not easy. In some of these tenders there has to be a search to see how, in delivering these services, we can help people with their real family problems. There is no ongoing increase in funding under the two main settlement programs: the migrant resource centres and the Community Settlement Services Scheme. That is despite the fact that there have been increased award costs for the staff after 10 years, there are problems in securing adequate premises for these organisations and there are arising in this country new communities which have needs. With regard to the award rise, the New South Wales government-these wages are, in a sense, proportionately funded by state and federal governments-has come to the party to make sure that when people get the increase, after 10 years without an increase, they do not have to work extra hours and reduce services: that the increase is funded. The response of the ministers in this government has been, ‘Go and do harder work or make sure your services are reduced so that we don’t have to pay any more money.’ There is a one-off increase of $1 million from savings elsewhere which, for some unknown reason, is devoted to rural and regional areas. One of the lamentable realities in this country is the continued concentration of new arrivals in Sydney and Melbourne. We know those figures. We know the trend is worsening. We know that not only is there a continued movement of new arrivals to Sydney but they are specifically going to a smaller and smaller part of Sydney. When this government does find some money through savings for some pork-barrelling exercise to help some National Party or Liberal Party rural member, it proposes that these resources go into an unspecified, undescribed rural or regional area. The real need in Sydney, where people are unemployed because they lack English and where the numbers are increasing all the time, is being ignored. When asked last week in Senate estimates, the department said that the minister had not yet decided how the funding was to be allocated. He has decided to do a bit of pork-barrelling, but he has not decided yet to find an excuse or a facade to defend the prospect. There is no shift by DIMIA on the issue of services for temporary protection visa holders, but it is worth noting that the Minister for Education, Science and Training, in a slight distinction of policy in the government, announced extra funding to the states for intensive language tuition for the school-age children of TPV families. The final area of expenditure in multicultural and citizenship affairs by the department is $3.7 million over three years to former child migrants from the UK and Malta. That is to help them travel overseas to be reunited with their natural families. Whilst the opposition welcomes those measures, they are essentially a response to a Senate committee of inquiry Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3537 chaired by Senator Crowley. The coalition response to that was that there was no need for that inquiry. The coalition was somewhat uninterested in the process. Now that that inquiry has come down and shown the level of suffering, despite the fact that the government refuses to apologise for its failure to properly exercise its clear duty of care to these children, it is providing some dollars. The details of the travel fund have not yet been determined. It is about time that these guidelines are looked at to ensure that people can travel and can have an overdue reunion with their families. The expenditure in this area of multiculturalism and citizenship pales into insignificance when we see the heavy expenditure devoted to the so-called ‘Pacific solution’, which we have been told in the past few days is no longer a solution. The nightmare the electorate faced late last year was going to be rectified by excising a few islands, but that is no longer a solution. We have to go further. The amount of money the government is devoting to settling people, helping them gain employment and helping them live in this country, work for it and assist it is nothing like the $430 million over four years for offshore processing in Nauru. The other amount of $455 million is for the Christmas and Cocos islands. There is $195 million for construction costs and associated roadworks. We all know that these so-called solutions, paying off the Nauruan regime, letting people have their health care et cetera, are going to do nothing to solve the fundamental problem of the large number of rejectees that the government is now faced with having to detain, in all probability for a number of years, and the cost to the Australian taxpayer. We were told back then that these people were never going to step on Australian shores, but you can bet your bottom dollar that they will. They will have to be detained for a number of years because we do not have diplomatic relations with Iraq. Syria and Iran now refuse to take back failed applicants. The overall solution is no longer good enough. The government now wants to basically excise other parts of Australia. In conclusion, this government has made a lamentable attempt to justify a tax on people’s disability entitlements and in areas such as pharmaceuticals, which will make it very difficult for people who live in electorates like those in Western Sydney, on the basis that the government is beefing up defence and is in the forefront of the fight against international terrorism. The real cost is from the government’s bungling with regard to transactions on the exchanges and making commitments at the last election that it knew it did not have the funding for. It was told by Defence that there would be some requirements with regard to increased defence expenditure. At the time, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister said that it was all covered and that there were no problems. That has been refuted by the Secretary to the Department of Defence. It is not good enough to expect that the opposition and the minor parties should support these changes, which are going to hurt the people in our electorates, from a government which is a very minor player internationally, despite the pretensions of the Prime Minister in question time. It is taken for granted because he is such an obsequious supporter; whether it is on climate change, trade policy or defence, he is always reliable. Quite frankly, when you are fully taken for granted, you do not get much say. I followed him through the door in 1984 into the state parliament. It is also interesting to see the metamorphosis from his ebullient support of the Wran-Ferguson government to his present negative state. Obviously, the opposition are squirming over this budget. It has been a magnificent performance by the Treasurer, the member for Higgins, and there is no doubt in my mind that historians will treat him kindly because of what he has done for Australia.

There is no doubt that Australia is in a very strong financial position, not because this government is sitting back and letting things happen but because it is making some very hard decisions to ensure that the country has a long-term economic base. This budget, like previous budgets, addresses those particular problems. There is no doubt that there were problems associated with September 11, and that those problems associated with that event shocked the world. I was stunned. I could not believe that anything like that could happen. We are now dealing with a different situation-the world will never be the same-where we are all suspicious. We do not quite know what is likely to happen. We are cautious about different groups in our community, which is very sad. But the fact is that we have to put extra precautions in place to make sure that our free society cannot be attacked. That of course means quite a lot of expenditure. There is no doubt that money is expended in this budget, as it was before this budget was brought down, that the government-and, I dare say, Australia-would have preferred not to expend. Nevertheless, if we are to protect the rights of the citizens of this country, we cannot run away from our responsibilities. We have to spend that money to ensure that this country remains a free country and that the citizens of this country are protected. The money that is expended on Defence is, I believe, expended wisely. I do not apologise for the fact that we have been, and are, strong friends of America. My father and uncles were very proud to fight with the Americans in the Pacific war. Only for the Americans, this country would have been conquered in the Second World War. It was undoubtedly the Americans who saved this country-not that I would blindly support everything they do. I think the Prime Minister has made that very clear. But, on the other hand, if we believe that we need strong friends, then we could have no stronger friends than the Americans at the present time. I am sure that that was highlighted again when the Prime Minister was in America last week. Let it be said that I know the Prime Minister put very plainly to them what Australia thinks about trade. I have no illusions about what the Americans think. The fact is that, unless we keep putting forward those views, we will not be heard. We have to continue talking, not just to the President but also to congressional leaders, and putting the view very strongly about where we stand. I believe that, if we do that, we will get that message through to the Americans. They have told our leaders when they have been in America that they appreciate the support of Australia in the fight that they have at the present time. I am sure that eventuallyI do not believe it will be in the short term-we will get some recognition for that. I note that the Labor Party have given up. Today in question time there was almost glee on the other side when trade was even mentioned. They have given up: they are not prepared to go over there and put a strong voice forward; they are prepared to just roll over and accept the fact that America might agree to some of the trade provisions that we think are very important. I have listened quite closely to some of the speeches of members opposite. I have had the opportunity, sitting in the chair, to do that quite often. I dare say that it is the problem of all oppositions that there is very short memory about some of the issues that were of importance just a few years ago, that have now changed. I was an agricultural leader in Australia when penalty interest rates to farmers hit 23 per cent. That hurt enormously. Now, when there is a quarter of a per cent increase, people get delighted. They say, ‘The government has failed. Interest rates have gone up from 5¾ per cent Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3539 to maybe six per cent.’ All of a sudden, the government has failed! We still have the lowest interest rates in 30 years. It is not a fluke. The reason we have the current interest rates is that our economy has been managed in such a way that they have been kept down. I have been amazed in the last few years that Australia was not affected by the Asian downturn and then the problems in America, which obviously went though a recession. That is the first time in my memory that we have not been affected by those types of global downturns, particularly in America. There was a common saying when I was younger: if America has a cold, we have pneumonia. This time it did not happen, and it was quite remarkable. I was rather stunned that it did not happen and that the Australian economy continued to grow. I will not claim all the credit for this government, because I think some of the decisions were taken by previous governments. We are now managing our economy in such a way that it is able to withstand outside forces. Our economy is quite small-I do not run away from that fact-compared to those of other large countries of the world. We as Australians should be proud of the fact that this country has managed to withstand these outside influences and has continued to grow. I note that as usual the opposition are trying to zero in on some areas of the budget that they think might be detrimental to the community and on fertile areas in which they might be able to get some support. If you look at the provisions in the budget, as usual we do not get the full story. I listened to the member for Hasluck earlier, as well as a number of other opposition members, speak about the PBS. There seems to be a total lack of understanding that this scheme is growing at an exponential rate. You just have to look at the Intergenerational Report which the Treasurer has put in this budget, which people are trying to pooh-pooh. We must look ahead. We all talk about the impending baby boom, the bulge. I am part of that or the start of it. There will be a huge problem for this country if we do not address some of these issues. Fewer and fewer people will be paying more and more to support the elderly in this community who are living longer and longer. I saw figures the other day which showed that the average male in Australia now lives 76 years and the average female lives 82 years. That forecast is much higher now than it was when I was a young person. In those days, I think males lived to about 65 and women a bit over 70. We are living longer and longer. We are now consuming medicine a lot more in our older years than we did in the past, so there is a real challenge as to how to manage and fund it. The PBS is a marvellous scheme. There are very few countries in the world-in fact, I do not think there is another country in the world-with a scheme as good as this. We are very lucky that we can afford it, but we cannot allow it to run out of control. The speakers opposite zero in on the fact that there has been a dollar increase in prescriptions. But there is still a ceiling there. The opposition speakers seem to be saying it is the chronically ill who are going to be affected by this. That is not true. Maybe those who do not use the pharmaceutical system as much, who do not get to the ceiling, will be the ones who will pay. The ceiling is still there for those who are chronically ill and they will be protected by that. There has to be some sort of protection in the system. In the budget we say that doctors should be more aware of what they are prescribing. We talk about pharmaceutical companies as well. I think there is quite a lot to answer for there. We talk about trying to address some of these issues. We must look at this on the broader scale. 3540 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 I have not heard from the opposition in this debate what they would do. How would they contain the PBS? Obviously containing the PBS is going to be a challenge for all governments in the future. We have to do some thinking. We cannot just sit back and be critical. It is about time we sat down and did some thinking. I do not say that all knowledge exists on the government side-I do not accept that at all-but I do think we have to be positive about this and not just run off and say to people, ‘It’s terrible. The government has put up our prescriptions by a dollar.’ How do we address this problem? That is a challenge that the opposition has not addressed at this time. The disability pension is another issue that has been zeroed in on. If you look at how this pension has grown over the last few years, you have to ask: why has this pension grown at such a rate? Maybe it is doubtful whether some of the people who are on this pension should be on the pension. I won’t name names but I am sure you could look at a number of people in my electorate and say to yourself, ‘I don’t know quite why these people are on the disability pension.’ It is not about the people who are totally disabled or people who are desperately disabled. However, I have to say that when this furore about the disability pension erupted in the media one of the most disabled persons in my electorate, a young fellow who had a bad accident in the surf similar to one in the claims we heard of recently in Sydney-he just dived into the surf and finished up a paraplegic-came out and said, ‘I don’t want to work 15 hours a week. I don’t want to work 30 hours a week. I want to work full time.’ And he does. He is a very good contributor to the work force. Instead of being negative about this, we should be looking at these people because most of them want to work. Most of them want to have a skill. Most of them can be trained. In the budget there are 73,000 new training and work opportunities for disabled people. The government is saying it is not just a matter of looking at the disability pension; it is a matter of getting people into some training. We need to look positively at that. If you look closely at the budget papers, the Commonwealth is contributing $2.7 billion to a new Commonwealth and state disability agreement, $743 million more than in the previous agreement. This is an agreement with the state governments that helps disabled people. We look at areas where we can try to help some of these people. If you start projecting into the future and think about what we said earlier about the baby boomers coming through the population, you will see that we need these people as employees in the future because the unemployment rate is already coming down. In my electorate it is already down to 9.6 per cent, which is three per cent above the average. Do you know what it used to be? It used to be 16 per cent. It is down to 9.6 per cent. These people may be disabled, but there is no good reason why they cannot get a good job and good training. We will be needing these people. It is not a matter of kicking them off a pension; it is a matter of training them and getting them some skills so that they can work in the community, and there is no doubt that they can do that these days. With the technology that we have today, there is no good reason why a lot of people cannot work. I keep thinking about that scientist. rone disease. He is disabled but is the greatest brain in the world. He is a professor at Oxford.",133,Representatives Main Committee

240,Mr Causley,"Yes, just have a look at him. He cannot speak. I think he has motor neuMonday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3541 I am saying that that is what we should be looking at. We should be a little more positive about this. This is not about saying: ‘This terrible government.’ This is about asking: ‘How do we help these people? How do we get them trained? How do we get them into the work force?’ Similarly, one should look at the traineeships and the apprenticeships that this government has introduced. I find the Jobs Pathway Program is working extremely well. Some of these problems go back a long way. They go back to the days when we brought in Austudy and where students, instead of going to a college and getting training, stayed back at school. There were problems with Austudy. For example, there were students there who did not want to learn and they caused problems for the ones who did want to learn. The Jobs Pathway Program is a great program. It gives students in the later stages of their education an opportunity to glimpse what a certain job might be like, and then, if it does not suit them, it is not too late for them to change paths and do something else. Often people make up their minds and say, ‘I want to be a neurosurgeon,’ or something like that, and when they get there they say, ‘I really didn’t want to do this.’ Maybe that is an extreme example. But the fact is that, with the Jobs Pathway Program, people can get a glimpse of what the job is likely to be, and then they can say, ‘Yes, I am interested in that,’ or, ‘No, I’m not interested in that.’ But we have gone a step further by saying that those employers who are prepared to take on an apprentice or a trainee will get a payment of $750 and, in fact, if they continue on and employ that person they will get another $750. So there is an incentive for employers to try to do something for these people and to give them a chance to get employment. I will now turn to the veterans area. I think governments of all persuasions in Australia have always been very generous to veterans. In fact, there are very few countries in the world that look after their veterans like we do. It probably goes back to the fact that we have a pretty sad war history. I think the member for Herbert may have mentioned this in debate in the lower house. When you look back to the First World War in particular, you see that we lost 80,000 men. To put that in perspective you have to remember that Australia had four million people in those days, so that was a huge number of people for us to lose. Governments have always been focused on the needs of veterans, and I think this particular budget supports that. It gives extra benefits to veterans so that they can live with security in their old age. Another area that I am very keen about is the area of health care. I will not go into the total funding of health care, because that could probably take up a full debate. I see as very important the fact that we have offered to provide six radiation oncology services across Australia. I am putting up my hand for one of those, and I am sure a lot of other members will be putting up their hands for them. On the North Coast of New South Wales in Lismore, which is the centre of that coastal strip from Port Macquarie through to the Gold Coast, there are two major hospitals-the base hospital and St Vincents-which probably have some of the best specialists available, particularly in those regional areas. That is an area where I believe that an oncology unit would be very helpful. We missed out in the last round of MRI allocations.",136,Representatives Main Committee

St Vincent’s Hospital in Lismore has an MRI; it is just that it has to get accreditation under Medicare, and there is no doubt in my mind we will get that. As I said to start with, I am excited about this budget. Obviously, there are special circumstances surrounding its formulation, and it addresses those particular challenges immediately in front of us. This budget keeps Australia on a very sound financial basis: it will ensure that our interest rates remain low compared to historical levels; it will ensure that inflation is kept under control; it will ensure that our small businesses and our farmers are not ripped off by having to pay high interest rates as they were in the years under the previous Labor government; and it will ensure that young people, in particular, paying off mortgages, will be able to own their own homes because of the low interest rates. I believe that Peter Costello will go down in history as one of the best treasurers in the history of Australia. Gusmao and Jose Ramos Horta as President and Foreign Minister of the newly independent nation of East Timor. They were received with great warmth by all members, and it was a moment of genuine joy on the floor of the House. All of us who have observed what has happened in East Timor over several years would not wish to dwell upon what should or should not have happened, what may or may not have happened, but would wish to rejoice that now the East Timorese have become, through self-determination, an independent nation. We should now dwell on the way in which Australia can continue to be a very friendly neighbour. That is the positive outcome that is most important to remember on a day like today, because those two gentlemen, along with a number of their colleagues, struggled for a long time to get to this point. It is also a time to reflect upon Australia’s capacity to operate within the region with our new neighbours-an area where, as a larger nation, we should be able to play a very big role-and to reflect that, perhaps, in the past, we have not played a very big role. Perhaps in the past we have not concentrated and focused on the issues of our new neighbours and the region. Some of those nations of the region confront some very grave problems. Australia should be turning again to look at the region and to decide on the ways in which we can help solve the region’s problems, such as the ongoing problem of Bougainville and the way which PNG has developed since its independence so many years ago now. We can reflect upon the ways in which we can be a better neighbour: we can look at the current happenings in the Solomon Islands and in Vanuatu. When we think of a neighbour like Nauru, we remember the headlines like ‘Illegals in bogus passport racket’ from last year-negative connotations of the way in which Nauru is allowing itself to be used by global organised crime. Perhaps we can think about how we can help those countries in our region. This leads to one of the environmental problems that will well and truly impact on island nations-if we believe the theorists-which, of course, is the greenhouse effect. The global community is trying to come to grips with the way in which it can come together to address this. At the moment we have the discussions about what Australia is actually going to do in the context of the Kyoto protocol. We have a vast difference developing between two international camps. On the one hand we have the US, especially since the election of George W. Bush as President, moving away",137,Representatives Main Committee

245,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (5.20 P.m.),"Today in question time the House welcomed XananaMonday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3543 from the Kyoto protocol and putting in place its own version. What we see developing now in the Australian context is perhaps a line of thought that places us in that camp rather than in the wider international camp. We really should look at what is happening with Kyoto to see how distinct this difference is and how we are putting ourselves on one side if we go down the United States track. All 15 European Union countries have signed the Kyoto protocol. They were followed earlier this month by Japan. Russia and New Zealand are to sign by the end of the year. That would leave the US and Australia to act. A total of 71 countries have now agreed to ratify the Kyoto protocol. Along the way Australia has been able to get a fairly good deal from the processes that arose out of the protocol. Having gained those concessions makes the government’s position even more bewildering and puzzling. I admit that at the time those concessions were gained I was not totally satisfied. But the point is that in the present debate this government has to acknowledge it gained those concessions. It is now, it would appear, intending to move away from the whole process. The process is important; the protocol will put in place three economic instruments that would be open to countries that have ratified and are moving towards meeting their emission reduction targets. Those economic instruments are: (1) international emissions trading-the exchange of credits between industrialised countries to meet emission targets; (2) joint implementation-the creation of credits from projects in industrialised countries; and (3) the so-called clean development mechanism-the creation of credits from projects in developing countries to meet the industrialised countries’ targets. There has been great discussion about these instruments. First of all one has to go through a learning curve to get one’s head around the notion of using economic instruments for environmental gains. But that is where we are situated in the early years of the 21st century; there is a developing awareness of the potential for such instruments. But if Australia places itself outside a mechanism that would allow it to participate in that system, we would be well and truly out of step. We would find it very difficult, once being shunned by the international community, to meet the targets that are set under the protocol and, more importantly, to take an active role in what is an international effort. At the moment we have state governments acting on reducing carbon emissions-they are showing leadership when at present that leadership is lacking at the federal level. There are specific initiatives. For example, the Victorian government has set a target to reduce Victoria’s greenhouse gas emissions by more than five per cent within a decade. Some of those targets are set within the context of many competing parties saying that those targets are not achievable and the interests of those parties are not being looked after. A number of regions of Australia have a great dependence upon the coal industry, and there are a number of jobs in that industry. Slowly but surely the debate is turning around the feelings of those regions, as they understand that the new technologies that would lead to the clean use of coal have great employment potential as well. These are important developments. This is an ongoing debate; it is not as if everybody understands the phenomenon and the mechanisms that are required to address it. It is my concern that, if the government continues on the course of action it has put in place-as it appears it will; on the basis that yet again it is something we want to be shoulder to shoulder on with the United States of America--we will be outside what is happening internationally. 3544 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 The real point-and this is important-is that it is yet another example of where the environmental outcome that we are trying to achieve marries with potential economic benefits and outcomes. In this case, it is significant that business opportunities are created by the Kyoto protocol and that we would lose that opportunity if we failed to ratify. Companies are thinking about whether they would be better placed to go offshore to countries that are inside rather than outside the Kyoto tent. There are many examples in Australia of companies that are developing alternative energy technologies and, if we continue to move away from the protocol, the further development of those potential technologies might be placed in jeopardy. On another subject, at present there is a debate going on about the regulations that were put in place on the Friday before last, excising 3,000 islands in the northern waters above Australia from the migration zone. In the debate about this, the Labor Party’s position, which would see us opposing that excision, is being portrayed as being in some way soft or weak on border control-I think ‘weak’ was the word used today in question time. I am saddened that that is the way our position is being portrayed, because such a portrayal really reflects what the gesture of the Friday before last-of a further excision of more islands from Australia’s migration zone-is really about. Is the debate really about the appropriate and proper processing of people that are making their way to Australian shores with the intention of seeking asylum? If that is what the debate is about, then the types of proposals that are being put forward are well and truly at the margins. It is a nonsense to use them as a wedge between political forces within Australia. In fact, as has been put forward in the debate on behalf of the opposition, if people are headed for these islands and the islands are in some way put outside the migration zone, it would not require great imagination to see that shifting the goalposts would simply mean that people would make the additional journey to the mainland. And then what happens when any potential boats land on the mainland? Do we see excision of areas on the mainland? I think that people would understand that that is a logical progression from the thinking that is in place in this policy area. But if we are going to talk about border control and weakness or softness we ought to look at the whole picture. Why is it that the government uses people who, in their desperation, would come here by a method which is outside the preferred legal regime, in order to talk about border control and put fear into the minds of Australians that this is about border control full stop? It is not. If we were fair dinkum, we would be talking about the 60,000 people-based on the department’s own figures, at least 60,000-that come here illegally by other methods. These are the people who either have legitimate visas and overstay or rort the system to get a visa to get here with the intention of staying permanently. If we want to put fear into people’s minds, let us start talking about those people. But it is not convenient when, of those 60,000 people, 12,000 are from the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Please, let us get fair dinkum. I, for one, am not in any way dissuaded because a high percentage of those processed off the Tampa by the UN have had their claims dismissed. That means that the procedure for looking at claims is appropriate. That is all it tells me. It tells me that people have legitimate rights when they take the actions that they have taken-being on a leaky vessel, the leaky vessel sinks under whatever circumstances and a courageous captain of a Norwegian merchant vessel rescues them. Then everything goes completely askew because we have a govMonday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3545 ernment that wants to project and change the way in which it is perceived as acting on ‘border control’. So we have, conveniently, a large vessel within camera shot of Christmas Island so that we can have our SAS troops go aboard the vessel in the full glare of the media. Is it just so that we can have the slogan ‘Who is the most hairy-chested? Who is the harshest or the strongest on border control? We are.’ Mr Billson interjectingDunkley wants to interject about the closest port, let us go to the detail about that and ask why the vessel did not go to the closest port, because this is the crux of the matter. We have the source countries and we have the countries that are in the pipeline. Can the honourable member for Dunkley tell me what Minister Ruddock and Minister Downer, to prove that they are hard on border control, are doing about that? The member for Dunkley cannot tell me because he will not get up and ask the question that will get a ministerial statement that is different. wants to get into this debate that it is about which party is the strongestthe policy, he might want to note that it is not about the minister being in the House on the Wednesday and saying that the great success of the present policy is that no boats are on their way, while on the Friday using the excuse that a boat is on the way to increase the excision of the migration zone. Now the boat has disappeared-I do not know whether it is the Bermuda Triangle, but it has disappeared. But that is not the point: boat or no boat, there should be a proper discussion of policy. And on the cigarette paper’s width, the Labor Party 18 months before this was talking about the treatment of people in the detention centres and had called for an inquiry, and that inquiry would have gone forward. That was lost in the artificial way that this was created as an issue. voters told that the migration zone will be excised and excised? Were they? No, they were not. They were not told that it would be cut away and cut away. There has been no answer to the question about how far this measure goes. We can ask those that have got the good voice now: what are we going to do with those who have been denied, whose claims have been dismissed, and how are we going to deal with their return? Was that discussed in the days and weeks up to the election? The people that were there at the time of the election remain; the same people are still there. Isn’t it simply that we should discuss this to see the way in which these people should be properly processed now that their claims have been denied? That is in fact the crux of the matter. No matter what we as legislators believe, the individuals that are involved, except for a few that are perhaps out-and-out parts of some criminal element, are driven to these types of measures, and the outcome must be based on the way that the international community deals with these things. The present government can get excited about the way in which Australia is deciding these matters and people can say that the result of the election decides it for evermore, but that is a",138,Representatives Main Committee

The problem has not gone away simply by the measures that were put in place three days after the government announced that it was going to build more detention centres-policy on the run. The point is that I am quite happy for the Labor Party to be in a position where it is developing its policy on this matter. It has gone out to the public and said that that debate is continuing. (Time expired) cluding certain territories from Australia’s migration zone, that was supported by all sides of the parliament, as I understand it. It was public policy. It went to the last election and in the legislation was provision for regulation so that at a time in the future we would excise further territory if that were seen to be useful. That was very public: that was on the public record. The government is, for very prudent reasons, moving to excise islands above latitude 12 degrees south and the Labor Party are now doing a complete backflip and saying they are not going to support it, but I do not know the downside of excising further islands. I have not heard that argument: I have not heard anybody tell me why they should not be. move freely and openly in any of those territories, as they do now. It does not make one iota of difference to anybody except those people who want to come here unauthorised: they are the only people it affects. The Labor Party are saying, ‘Well, we’re going to signal that we want to go soft on border control.’ That is what they want to do. UntilI hear a logical reason coming from the Labor Party as to why we should not excise I will remain puzzled. I did not get up here to speak about that. tralia, as most of us do in discharging our responsibilities as members of parliament, and for more than a third of the year, as all of us are, I am out of my electorate in other parts of Australia, principally in Canberra but with committee duties you do move around the country.

But do you know what: they cannot name Townsville, Australia’s largest tropical city. That worries me. Townsville is a very important and significant city in this country. We have in Townsville Australia’s largest defence base. Virtually all of Australia’s overseas operations in the last 10 years have been launched from Townsville. In Townsville we have the Australian Institute of Marine Science, which leads the world in marine science. We have the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which controls one of the wonders of the world and manages it. Yet no-one can name Townsville.

I do not understand that. We are a tropical city that has, straight out its back door, the reef, the rainforest and the outback, but nobody knows Townsville. Townsville is the undiscovered gem of Northern Australia. We in Townsville think that North Queensland is the best place in Australia-blue skies, golden sands, deep green rainforest, fascinating outback, charming cities and islands for indulgence. We have it all. It is the ultimate tropical lifestyle. Those of us in Townsville know that the lifestyle is as good as you would get anywhere in the country.

We love our water sports, golf, fishing, abseiling, whitewater rafting and bushwalking. We know of pristine beaches, rainforest habitat and outback oases that will all astound. I say to the member for Franklin, ‘Forget the crowds, the stress, the pressure and the tourist traps; relax with a drink in hand, gazing out to the islands in the Coral Sea.’ We enjoy our life in the tropics and our enthusiasm is contagious. Once you experience it all, you will love the feeling of euphoria and you will be determined to return again. But what happens? People think of Cairns. People think of the Whitsundays. People do not think of Townsville. And what is the reason for that? It is hard to change people’s perceptions of Townsville if they visited the city years ago. People know it as an industrial port-dry, dusty, not a lot to do. We had the problem of losing our international air carriers at the international airport; they have come and gone. It is very hard for us to compete with the hot spots and gateways in Queensland that already have well-established product in international markets and that tend to get the support from the various tourism promotion bodies as being the hot spots in Queensland. What do our potential customers miss out on? They miss out on what Townsville is today-a dynamic, progressive city with a new tourism product and major developments and infrastructure. The redevelopment of the Strand, for example, has been branded as one of the best beachfront promenades in Australia. I do not think there is any doubt about that. Domestic airfares are now more affordable with the introduction of Virgin Blue, which chose Townsville as their first Queensland regional destination, for very good reasons. That has brought prices down. But I just lament that we do not yet have enough airline capacity into Townsville. Only last week, when I had to return to Townsville, I could not get a seat on a plane from Brisbane to Townsville. I had to fly to Cairns to get home. I had to fly to Cairns, get in a car and drive 400 kilometres to get back that day. Mr Billson interjectingstate, I would be out of the state, but we Queenslanders have a much more significant area to look after. I know that last Saturday one of the Qantas flights out of Townsville was 15 seats overbooked. They could not fit 15 people on the aircraft. I think that is a clear case where",142,Representatives Main Committee
258,Mr Lindsay,"I observe to the member for Dunkley that, if I drove 400 kilometres in his3548 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 schedulers at Qantas really need to take note and, by increasing the capacity available in and out of Townsville, look after the market that is most clearly there. I firmly believe that Townsville Enterprises is working very hard on trying to get the name recognition up. I was very pleased to be able to give Townsville Enterprises $25,000 last week as a matching contribution to cash contributions from their members to develop a definitive publication on the attractions available in the north for visiting cruise ships and, particularly, visiting warships, so that we can market the city in a very meaningful and positive way and talk up all of the really great facilities and attractions that are available. I think it behoves everybody in Townsville to play their part to increase the awareness of the attractions that we have in our city. In the time available to me I would like to move on to another couple of matters in relation to the north. I would particularly like to talk about the proposed ocean terminal. Every time a warship comes into Townsville-and, incidentally, the US Navy rate Townsville as the best port to visit in Australia, which is a pretty good feather in our city’s cap-it stays three days or so and it leaves behind $3 million to $5 million in the city. We as a community need to concentrate on-I believe this is probably the next major project that we should all be working on-the gateway project; namely, an ocean terminal development of the potential of the Western Breakwater in Townsville and the area in front of Jupiters casino. I think that it should happen as a partnership between private enterprise and government. While the state government has a lead role in this, the federal government should also be involved, because this has the potential to give our city and our region a major boost by capturing a segment of the tourism market which we are not currently adequately capturing. Recently, in Townsville, the state government announced a new gas-fired power stationbase load power station-for the city. This was a very important announcement because it signalled the arrival of gas into Townsville. That power station will become a reality as part of an upgrade of an existing peak load power station at the Queensland nickel site at Yabulu. This is very important in relation to Yabulu because it will turn into a cogeneration scheme. I note that we have the chairman of the environment and heritage committee with us today, and he will be very pleased to know that this cogeneration scheme will see gas, which is a clean fuel, generating electricity. It will also see the waste heat being used to generate steam, which will be fed into the nickel plant. So it will reduce everybody’s costs and give the benefits of gas. It will also further enhance the likelihood that we will be able to get the Yabulu extension project up, which is a $300 million development in hand with the Ravensthorpe project in Western Australia, where nickel will be mined, part processed and then shipped to Townsville for final processing at Yabulu. I am very pleased to see state development in Townsville working to look at all of the value added industries that can be tacked onto the three mineral processing plants in Townsville and Thuringowa-something that would be a marvellous addition to our city. Fundamentally, in the long term we need to think long and hard about true base load power. True base load power actually means delivering power to industry at a world competitive price. I am told that it is not possible to do that with gas. I am told that the only way you can get a world competitive unit price of electricity delivered to your doorstep is to use a coal fired power station. That has some downsides, and there are some concerns. With Australia Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3549 determined to meet its responsibilities in relation to the Kyoto protocol, whether we ratify it or not, we need to think about how we might balance any additional emissions that would come from such a power station with ways of ameliorating the problem of the additional CO2 in the earth’s atmosphere. One way or another, we have to be world competitive. Providing world competitive power on Townsville’s doorstep with a power station on the Bowen Basin coalfields is certainly a way of making Townsville another Gladstone. It can bring enormous opportunities in relation to the industrial lands adjacent to the Sun Metals zinc refinery, and it can bring very significant developments associated with the Queensland nickel plant at Yabulu. I ask the community and the decision makers, particularly the state government, to think long and hard about that. I know that the Premier will have some difficulties with that concept, but I think there is a solution somewhere. It is important for our region’s progress with jobs and for the economic well-being of our city to see true base load power being developed. In the time left to me, I might spend a moment on higher education, particularly James Cook University. The member for Riverina may disagree, but I think next to the sandstone universities James Cook University comes right up there. The government has to recognise that the costs of running a regional university, particularly James Cook University, are certainly higher than those of running a sandstone university. There needs to be a will within the government to recognise that there are extra costs and to fund universities in the regions accordingly. There is no doubt that a university like James Cook is very much at the centre of our community. It is not like the metropolitan universities. You find that there are much greater demands on regional universities in relation to the services that they provide to their local communities. There is a community expectation that we all do work as a team and that universities should contribute. You do not see that as much in the larger metropolitan cities. You also find that the regional universities do not have access to the benevolent funds that the larger universities have access to, and that holds their development back. When they have very strong, important, innovative ideas and they are determined to do something that is absolutely new in the country, they do not always have the resources to do it. I think it is time that the government looked at the way universities manage themselves, at the way university councils sometimes try to usurp the role of management of universities and at the way that university councils, for political reasons perhaps, try to get in there and tell vice-chancellors around the country how they should operate. Equally, I think it is time that universities looked at allowing managers-meaning vice-chancellors-the opportunity to manage down into the faculties should they need to. At the moment there are some very outof-date management structures which should be looked at. Universities need to operate in the real world in the way private business operates, and currently I believe that that is not the case. I come back to where I started: the fact that people cannot name Townsville as Australia’s largest tropical city. I invite anyone listening to or reading this speech to give Townsville a go. You will not be disappointed. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a fabulous place-an undiscovered gem. Dr LAWRENCE (Fremantle) (6.00 p.m.)-I will begin my comments on the budget tonight in a perhaps slightly unusual way. I want to take the opportunity to pay tribute to Ruth 3550 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 Cracknell. In many ways Ruth represented the best that Australia has to offer. Given that I am responsible in opposition for the status of women, the arts and Indigenous affairs, she was indeed a fine representative of all of those areas. I would like to take this opportunity as a member of the House of Representatives to acknowledge her passing. The Senate has in fact moved a motion of appreciation. I simply say that Ruth was a much loved and superbly talented actor with a deep commitment to social justice, Indigenous affairs and women’s issues. She should be held up as a fine example of someone who used her status for a good purpose: to better the lives of others. The death of Ruth Cracknell is a great loss to Australia’s cultural life. Her stage and screen career, spanning almost 60 years, made her one of Australia’s most respected, best-known and honoured actors. In her 57-year career she acted in a wide range of classical and modern plays and Australian film and television. She raised three children and won Sammy, Penguin and Logie awards, to name but a few. Ruth Cracknell, of course, was a member of the Order of Australia and was named one of Australia’s living national treasures, as indeed she was. She was generous in her support for many young actors and others in the arts community and she was a tireless campaigner to improve the status of women. Ruth Cracknell was also a committed advocate of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, joining forces with many others to form Women for Wik during the native title amendment debate in 1997 in an attempt to influence public opinion. Ruth Cracknell’s passing is a great loss not only for her family and friends but also for the nation. I would like once again to convey my sincere condolences to her family and friends. Before going any further, I particularly want to talk about Indigenous affairs, which I know were dear to Ruth’s heart-and dear to mine, too-and I am very sad to say that the current budget does very little to assist Indigenous people in this country to improve their lot in life. I wish I did not have to say that. I do not say it as a political statement. Frankly, just look at the record. The minister announced when he released the federal budget that spending on Indigenous specific programs and services will increase to a record level of $2.5 billion in 2002-03, up from $2.5 billion the previous year. That sounds like good news on the face of it, and news that I would have been happy to welcome. But I think it is important that we look at that definition of ‘Indigenous specific’ and pull it apart a little because it is absurdly broad. It actually relates to funds that in any way might be seen to be spent on Indigenous people, or on the areas in which they live. To give you an example, that statement includes $2.2 million going to Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for pest and disease monitoring in Northern Queensland. That benefits everybody; it is not Indigenous specific. Also, it covers the $7 million that the Australian Bureau of Statistics requires to collect statistics on Indigenous people. Again that is not done separately; it is done for all Australians. These are worthy programs, but they are not Indigenous specific and they should not be lumped in with spending of that kind if we are to actually look at the government’s performance here. The government is still including a lot of these areas in the total expenditure allocated to overcoming Indigenous disadvantage, and it is time we actually had a much clearer book. Many of these programs are provided to all Australians. I am not just talking about those extreme cases of quarantine and statistics collection but about the things we take for granted: clean water supply, access to reliable electricity at a reasonable price, and education Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3551 and schooling. They are not Indigenous specific; they are the rights of citizens. In my view they should not be included as separate unless they have special elements, additional funds or new programs designed to address the disadvantage we know Indigenous people face. In fact, many of those are just basic citizen services which require funding. Given that the programs are listed for this purpose and the government describes them as Indigenous specific, it is reasonable to ask the minister, particularly as he puts them under the heading of ‘practical reconciliation’, exactly what is going on in those areas of education, employment, health and so on that are available to other citizens. What effect are these programs having on Indigenous people? Are they improving their circumstances? We put a number of questions in the Senate estimates to the department asking about a lot of these programs that are listed as Indigenous specific and as part of so-called practical reconciliation. The sad fact is that the department were unable to answer most of the questions; they simply had no idea, although they were happy to claim them as part of a program to support Indigenous people. We think they should be keeping a close eye on these programs if they are going to claim them as being of benefit and put them under a ‘practical reconciliation’ heading. In response to how they monitor these broader programs-and I mention employment, education and health; they are critical areas-the secretary of the department said: ... I am not able-and frankly I do not think I should be able-to say that the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is monitoring expenditure of that sort down to that level. That is clearly a program matter administered by another portfolio. You cannot have that. The minister has to know. The precise reason for having a separate minister for Indigenous affairs is that we recognise that there are special needs and special difficulties associated with many Indigenous communities in Australia. It is not good enough to say, ‘Someone else is looking after that,’ if at the same time you are claiming it as part of a major program. In other words, they are not linked as part of a program; they are just what happens to be available to Aboriginal people, as they are to other citizens in our country. When I asked the minister a question last week about what was happening to Aboriginal medical services, he said, ‘That is not my responsibility; I am not the minister for health.’ No, he is the minister for Aboriginal affairs and reconciliation, and he should know. In estimates, evidence emerged that the federal government continues to underspend-and that worries me a lot-on areas that really are designed specifically to reduce disadvantage and to improve the life circumstances of Indigenous people. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, for instance, told a Senate estimates committee that in 1999-2000 the government had not been able to spend $20 million of funding allocated for Indigenous employment. What group in the community has the highest level of unemployment? Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. How can you possibly underspend in an area where there is so much unmet need? That was about 35 per cent of their total budget. They were very pleased with themselves this year when they said that they had only underspent it by 13 per cent of the budget, some $6 million to $7 million. It is not something to celebrate, I would have to say. Further figures from this year’s budget show that the government has not been able to spend an allocated $4.3 million on domestic violence. What have we been hearing about Indigenous communities? That they want to work together with the government to stamp out domestic family violence, alcohol abuse and substance abuse. This is an area where there is great need, and everyone recognises it. The government underspent $4.3 million under the 3552 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 status of women program. They said they could not find suitable program managers to spend this domestic violence money. This money was generic, but the need is greatest in Indigenous communities and could have been directed to those communities. It is another example of the government’s apathy, in this case both toward women and Indigenous communities, for a problem that has, frankly, become a national disgrace. Everyone recognises that it needs urgent attention. It has been stated as a high priority for government. Indeed, they say that family violence is a particularly urgent issue for Indigenous women, who comprise 46 per cent of people who require hospitalisation from intentional injuries, and for Indigenous people, who die from interpersonal violence at 10.8 times the rate of nonIndigenous Australians. Only a day later ATSIC told Senate estimates that they had been advocating constantly for increased effort in this area. There is $4.3 million sitting there unspent and ATSIC are saying, ‘We’re in dire need of these funds.’ Although they had already spent $4.9 million annually on programs related to family violence, they said the demand was much greater than that. When the question was put, they said that they could easily have spent that extra $4.3 million to improve community safety and the safety, particularly, of women and children in Indigenous communities. Funding for the minister’s office and the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is also included in the Indigenous-specific funding. This is for the benefit of Aboriginal people but it includes $4.3 million for fighting Aboriginal people in the courts-litigation such as the Cubillo-Gunner stolen generations case. This is not spending which helps Indigenous people yet it is listed there as if it were for their benefit. Indeed at one stage that litigation funding made up 47 per cent of the department’s budget. Half of the spending was going on court cases that were clearly against the interests of Indigenous people generally and several Indigenous people in particular. The interesting thing about this budget is that it actually contained no new funding initiatives in these Indigenous-specific areas. Most of those funds are administered by ATSIC and there has been no new funding for ATSIC. The chairman of ATSIC said that there were no new funding initiatives this year despite the ever increasing demand. He described the extra funding last year as a down payment on funds that never seem to come. The $470 million that was taken out of ATSIC has not been filled and the government apparently has no intention of doing anything about it. There were a couple of announcements of new expenditure. The government announced a new budget measure of enhanced training of Indigenous directors but there was no new money. There were new programs that ATSIC had to find funding for but no additional funding. Better training in governance is critical to Indigenous communities and ATSIC in particular is working hard to develop new programs, as is Reconciliation Australia. But it is pretty hard to do it with no money. Another ‘new’ measure was $8.3 million announced for meeting the telecommunication needs of remote Indigenous communities-again, worthy. But the funds were taken from a different Indigenous-specific bucket of money from previous years which had not been spent. What does it deliver to these communities? It provides exactly the same service that every other Australian should be able to expect. When questioned in the Senate estimates commitMonday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3553 tee, the government was forced to acknowledge that remote Indigenous communities had very poor levels of service generally. I have listened to members in this place complain about poor telecommunication services in places like North Queensland, outback New South Wales and outback Western Australia. I understand that and I am sympathetic to it, but if you think they have a problem you should look at the Indigenous communities. Whereas 97 per cent of Australians are connected to fixed telephone services under the USO, the best estimates that we can get-from the government itself-for Indigenous communities are that five to 10 per cent of remote Indigenous people are connected. That is a huge gap in service provision. And the government provided no new money; it just moved a little bit around to give some people slightly better access to telecommunication services. We have also indicated that we are keen to support the ATSIC review that has been mooted. We were less enthusiastic about hiring former ministers Wooldridge and Reith to do the job; we did not think they would be particularly independent. But part of the problem with this review is that it will have to be paid for out of existing ATSIC funds, which were cut by $470 million. ATSIC do not even know at this stage what the review will involve-what its terms of reference will be, who will be involved, who will be consulted and how long it will take-and of course they do not know how much it will cost. They had $470 million taken out of their budget, there was no new expenditure on the part of the government for ATSIC and no genuine new expenditure on Indigenous affairs. And that is in the context of the government requiring ATSIC to quarantine big portions of its expenditure. Approximately 80 per cent is quarantined-the CDEP and the community housing program. So they have very little left to do some of these other things that are sorely needed, including tackling substance abuse and other issues which the government claims to care about and which are vitally important for the health of these communities. Finally, in the area of Indigenous affairs, I want to refer briefly to the problem with Aboriginal medical services. The government have been warned several times that several of the medical services, which are vital to the health needs of Indigenous communities, are in real trouble as a result of the public indemnity insurance problems that we have heard so much publicity about recently. Many services-particularly in remote areas such as Bourke and Walgett, and including Redfern, in inner city Sydney, and Western Sydney-are under threat of closure. They cannot get their doctors suitable insurance. They are directly the responsibility of the federal government-no-one else is responsible for these services-and when I asked the minister a question he did not know the first thing about it. It is not just the doctors who cannot get indemnity coverage but also dentists, midwives and others who are providing services in these communities. We still have not had an answer from the government on this. As far as we know, they are just going to let the due dates roll along and these people will have to find very substantial additional funds from within quite tight budgets or they will lose their doctors. I think there is no doubt about that. IfI have time, I want to turn briefly to two other areas: the arts and the status of women, for which I am responsible. The notable thing about the government’s approach in the budget to the arts is that there is no approach. You never hear ministers in this government talk about Australia’s artistic and cultural life. You can beg and plead for something-anything; a sign of life-but you will not find it. It is really very worrying. The more I talk to people in this area, the more it is clear to me that the government is prepared to let the cultural life of this nation hang-not die exactly, because there is enough funding just to keep people hanging on the 3554 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 edge. Take, for instance, the small to medium sized performing arts sector. Many theatres in Australia are dark. If you go around the cities you will find this. In my own home town of Perth, there are theatres that are dark. Ten years ago that was not true; you would very rarely find a theatre company that did not have a full program for the year. Now you find that they do it project by project. The government has just put out a little report on the small to medium sized performing arts company-and the government offered no hope. Indeed, as one of the commentators put it: ‘It’s like going to the doctor asking for treatment for lung cancer and being given treatment for bad breath.’ That is how much attention they got from the government. That is a pretty damning indictment. The person who said it said it amusingly, obviously, but they are really concerned about the status of those particular organisations. We have seen very little attention given to any of the art forms. We are told that the Myer review into the visual arts sector is going to come out soon. The minister has it but does not expect to release it until the middle of July. But he has made it clear to everybody in the arts community, ‘Don’t expect any money to come with this. We are basically going to tell you to do better with the resources you have got.’ Anyone who spends any time in the arts community will tell you that the Nugent review, which did some excellent work for the major organisations, has been a very useful contribution and additional funds were provided-overdue but welcomed. But even that is causing problems, as the life of those funds is winding down. Then we get below that to the innovative side of Australian arts. I am not saying that Australian opera and the major performing theatres are not innovative, but a lot of the really original work comes from the smaller end of the market and they are really struggling to survive. The government seems to have no concern with that at all. When you look at some of the areas of the budget where the government did provide additional funding last time-$37.2 million additional funding for the museum-you see that it was not additional funding for the arts, because the government had actually taken it out of another area; in particular, the National Archives. So the government was giving with one hand as it was taking with another. When the museum director was asked what the extra funding was needed for she said that it was due to unforeseen circumstances. That suggests to me that there is some fairly untoward planning going on-visitor numbers were not as good as expected, special exhibitions had not done as well as expected and they had not been able to get sponsorship. I can understand that with a new organisation, and I am not being critical of the museum’s director. These are propositions that the government should take on and fund appropriately. But instead what does the government do? It takes it out of the archives. The government is effectively asking the National Archives to absorb the hit because of its failure to plan properly for the new museum. At risk at the National Archives is a vital part of Australia’s records and objects. So we have, in a sense, a misunderstanding of the nature of those two organisations. I could say a lot more about the arts-and I will at another time-but the real disappointment is that there is no focus, there is no energy, there is no commitment. As far as the government is concerned the arts is a dead area; it is one of those ‘special interest’ areas; it is an area where you can poke at people and say, ‘These are all pinko lefties; you do not take them seriously.’ But their vital creative input into the nation’s life is not to be underestimated. Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3555 I want to speak about the status of women very briefly-not because it is unimportant to me but rather because I will have other opportunities to do so. One of the things that really continues to disturb me is the fact that the government has paid so little attention to the financial needs of women. For instance, in this budget and in legislation coming out of it, we are told that women who are sole parents will now enter the mutual obligation system and will be breached if they fail to meet certain conditions the government sets down. This will be my last point: the women most likely to be breached are precisely the ones who need the support and assistance of government. If you fail to turn up for an appointment or you fail to meet certain commitments to the government, what sort of person are you likely to be? You are likely to be under a great deal of pressure, probably not particularly welleducated and frightened of administrations. In my time in parliament I have found that the people who throw their letters in the bin are typically those people who have a psychiatric illness or an inability to deal with bureaucracies. They are people, in other words, who have a great deal of difficulty in managing from day to day. And what are we saying to these people? We are saying, ‘We’re going to take the money from you.’ The penalty level is really hefty; it is more than you get for a serious breach of the law. We will be putting women who are already in poverty and under stress into an impossible position. We will be saying to them, ‘Either you do what we require, and you know that you have to do it,’-it is the latter that worries me more-‘or you go and find yourself a partner.’ There is some very recent evidence to show that that kind of continual repartnering is very damaging indeed. It is not something that government policy should be seen to be encouraging, inadvertently or otherwise, but that is one of the possible consequences of this legislation. In superannuation too, a brief look at the government’s proposals here shows that they do nothing for women, the ones with least coverage in superannuation. There is a bit of splitting at the top end, which is very beneficial for those whose spouses have incomes over $100,000 but is of no benefit at all for women-many of whom have had interrupted working liveswho will end up at the end of their working lives with very little in the way of superannuation coverage. They are just a couple of issues I want to signal. I am particularly concerned about the government’s proposals to do with single parents and I intend to say a lot more about it, because it is a destructive, careless, thoughtless and child unfriendly policy, and the government deserves to be hit around the head very hard. propriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 in its original form. In particular, I wish to focus on the micro-economic elements of the proposal, knowing that the macro-economic elements have been covered in great detail elsewhere. I want to focus on the fact that this is a budget which sets out the conditions for growth, lower unemployment, sustained low interest rates and a general economic climate which will encourage the creation of jobs. I want to look at the budget on two levels. Firstly, I will look at the level of the impact of the budget on the people of Flinders. Secondly, I will address the impact of the benefits contained within the budget on three particular constituencies across Australia: families, rural communities and the aged and elderly community. Firstly, I will address the impact and highlights of the budget for the people of Flinders, within my own electorate. The first and most important benefit contained within the budget is, I believe, the initiative to establish an extra $80 million over four years for doctors for outer",143,Representatives Main Committee
259,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (6.20 P.m.),"I rise to speak with great pleasure in support of the Ap3556 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 metropolitan areas. This will be supplemented by a further $73 million which will be spent over four years in establishing up to six new radiation oncology units in regional Australia. In looking at the question of doctors for outer metropolitan areas I note that already, in the period since the budget, we have been able to secure not only the approval for but an actual doctor for the town of Koo Wee Rup. This is a town which is going ahead but has had difficulty attracting medical staff; it already has an existing, first-class doctor, but he finds himself overwhelmed by the work. So this is a real, practical and tangible benefit which flows from the budget for the people within the area of Koo Wee Rup. It also has an impact on those within Lang Lang, Clyde, Devon Meadows and Five Ways, all of which are benefiting already. The second local issue which I would like to raise is that of the baby bonus, which is available to parents of a child born on or after 1 July 2001. Mothers who are no longer working can receive up to a maximum of $2,500 each year until the child turns five. This is a tangible benefit to people within the towns of Somerville, Baxter and San Remo-growing communities with young families, working families, who need this support if they are to be able to maintain the balance of family life whilst at the same time maintaining the balance of their incomes. It is a critical initiative about which I have already received many inquiries. The third local issue that I want to raise is that of aged care. Through this budget, the coalition is establishing an additional half a billion dollars to be spent on older Australians. That includes $311 million for aged care homes, $47½ million for nurses and personal care workers and an additional $80 million for carers. On the Mornington Peninsula, in Cranbourne and on Phillip Island, all of which are areas that have significant numbers of elderly people, that means that their needs and the resources that they require are being met. In particular, I am delighted that on Friday only a week ago the Minister for Ageing, Kevin Andrews, visited the Mornington Peninsula and was able to announce that the Mornington Peninsula and Cranbourne are areas of priority for aged care. This follows from the fact that very recently, at the last aged care assessment round, specific places were made available on Phillip Island: 40 additional beds on an ongoing funding basis in perpetuity were made available for Warley Hospital, Phillip Island. That has a profound effect on all the areas of need within our area. On the question of superannuation, from 1 July 2002 qualifying low income earners who make personal superannuation contributions and have annual incomes under $32,500 will benefit from the government’s co-contribution of up to $1,000 each year. In Rosebud and Rye, working families that are working to save for their long-term future are being not only encouraged but also supported to do so. In looking at those issues, I want to turn from Flinders to the broader national picture. As I said, I want to address three particular issues in the time remaining to me. The first is the question of what the budget means more broadly for families. I have already outlined the benefits attached to the baby bonus. In addition, in an area which is often neglected, men’s health, there is over $5 million in funding for establishing national focus groups on the problems of men in rural and remote areas-the problems of suicide and depression, things which are not frequently acknowledged in a public sense. Furthermore, at the family level, over $6½ billion has been allocated in the budget for Australian schools for the coming financial year. Government schools are going to receive Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3557 $2.4 billion. Since 1995-96, Commonwealth funding for schools has grown by over 80 per cent. That has a very important impact on families. Similarly, in disability support services, new places will be provided for rehabilitation, training, education and employment. I would now like to look at rural and regional benefits and what the budget means for these communities. On the communications front, within Flinders we have an important issue relating to telecommunications black spots. An original program of $35 million to fix over 250 black spots has already been completed, but this budget allocates an additional $13.3 million over three years to find alternative technical solutions in a further 34 black spots. In Mount Martha, Safety Beach, Dromana and Rosebud we have benefits. Finally, I want to address the issue of aged care and the elderly generally. There is over $100 million for rural aged care homes to upgrade their facilities. This has a long-term impact on the quality of life for people within Flinders-for the elderly, the veterans, the more than 20,000 people in my electorate who come from that population over the age of 70. In conclusion, this budget sets down the long-term prescription for economic health-jobs and economic growth. But it also takes care of the conditions for the young, the families and the elderly within the electorate of Flinders. Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m. (No. 1) 2002-03 and to make some comments on what I view as a very woeful budget handed down by the Treasurer a while ago. In doing so, I will make clear my opposition to this budget in broad terms-that is, with respect to the consequences for the country-but I will also touch on those constituents of the Burke electorate that have been harshly hit by this cruel and unfair budget. The first thing to remind people of is that this budget will put upward pressure on interest rates and increase costs for Australian families. This budget must be placed in the proper context. Three years ago the Treasury forecast that the surplus for this financial year would amount to $14.6 billion. The latest estimate for the same year is a surplus of only $0.5 billion. Any economic observer would conclude that this means pressure on interest rates. It may well be argued that this is a result of the vagaries of the market and of external factors, but the government must take responsibility for this problem because more than 80 per cent of the loss of the estimated surplus is a direct result of some deliberate decisions it has made-decisions that in my view were made not in the national interest but to save the government’s hide prior to the election last year. What plan does the Treasurer have to make the books look like they balance? He is talking again about selling the rest of Telstra, and the government is now hinting that there may be a sale of Medibank Private. But how does one explain the state of Commonwealth finances, given the strength of the economy? I am afraid that much of this problem arises from the government’s recent reckless, selfish and irresponsible financial behaviour. We see this failed budget as a result of currency losses. The Treasurer has presided over a $5 billion loss over the past four years by gambling on foreign currency markets. He rolled the dice and they came up snake eyes. Despite numerous warnings from his own department, the Treasurer failed until September last year to do anything to address this matter. He just kept rolling the dice instead of leaving the table. It should also be remembered that the Howard government has misused an incredible $1 billion over the past five years on advertising and consultancies. In my view, this was a veiled re-",151,Representatives Main Committee
260,Mr Brendan O’connor (Burke) (8.00 P.m.),"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill3558 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 source to buy votes. In fact, it was hardly veiled-it was clear to people before the election and certainly after the election that this was a government willing to spend taxpayers’ money to basically look after its own interests before the interests of the Australian public. Of course, then there was the Pacific solution, the Clayton solution, the solution you have when you do not have a solution. It costs twice as much to process asylum seekers on Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands as on the mainland and more again in countries such as Papua New Guinea and Nauru. We are still looking to fathom the extent of the wasteful spending, which by no means could honestly be termed a solution. Another failure of the budget was to properly look after the majority of Australians with respect to superannuation. We all know that the Treasurer’s rationale for a budget deficit was always going to include the excuse that it was a war budget, a khaki budget-you could almost smell the gunpowder. Indeed, it is true to say that there are matters of national importance which the government must attend to in the national interest. It is now very apparent that if it were not for the Treasurer’s wasteful and mismanaged ways the budget would now be in surplus. Even if no new funding requirements for defence and border protection had been required, the 2001-02 budget would still have been in deficit by more than half a billion dollars. The government cannot escape the horrible consequences of this budget for those least able to afford it. The budget will increase the cost of essential medicines for more than one million pensioners, and cardholders will be $52 a year worse off. This budget will also ensure that 300,000 Australians who are in families will pay an extra $190 a year for essential medicines. The budget, if successfully passed, will mean families will now have to fork out $28.60 for each prescription, up by more than $6 per script. There are many more millions of Australians who will pay 30 per cent more for essential medicines every time they go to the chemist. This budget will cut the pensions of 200,000 disability support pensioners by $52 per fortnight, and it does not ensure any guaranteed training or rehabilitation for these pensioners. This is a disgrace, even for this government. The sickest and poorest of Australians are being asked to carry the overwhelming burden. EvenI was able to accept the contention that cuts may need to be made or tax increases imposed, but why on earth would a decent and caring government slug those least able to afford it? A decent and caring government would do no such thing. It seems as if this government could not care less for the less fortunate in this society. We have had the Howard-Costello gamble on the foreign exchange market amounting to a whopping $4.5 billion, the hundreds of millions of dollars wasted on the so-called Pacific solution and the buying of helicopters that are museum pieces. It is a wonder the government would consider devoting any further money at all to be expended by the Minister for Defence after that decision. On top of these gambling debts and financial failings we see little effort to assist the elderly, the infirm and the sick. Despite this government’s rhetoric and its hollow assurances before the election to fix the aged care problem, only $72 million was left to address the growing pressures on nursing homes and community organisations that provide support and succour to the infirm and the frail.

261,Mr Brendan O’connor,"In my electorate of Burke many thousands of people areMonday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3559 take a genius to know that there is a growing crisis, notwithstanding the remarks made by the member opposite. There is no doubt that she is aware, as all members would know, that there is a growing crisis in aged care. If they wanted to be honest with themselves, they would acknowledge that fact. Not only are there insufficient funds devoted to residential care and to home and community care programs for those in care, but the shortfall impact upon the growing disparity of income between aged care nurses and their public sector counterparts is now, on a national basis, over $80 million and climbing. Not only is this disparity inequitable; it increases the difficulty for nursing home operators to attract and retain quality staff. These problems are just a few of the concerns ordinary Australians are expecting their government to address. In my electorate constituents want to see something done to assist them in their everyday lives. They would not have expected to see such a cruel and unfair budget handed down by this coalition government, especially in light of undertakings given by the Prime Minister prior to last year’s election that no disability pensioner would be worse off. That is why Labor will oppose changes in the budget that hurt the poor, the sick and the elderly. I am sure like all members and senators across Australia, I have received much correspondence since the budget with respect to those matters that are affecting ordinary Australians. I would like, if I could, to refer to a number of those. Mr Phill McQuade wrote to me on 21 May this year in relation to matters of concern to him. He said: Dear Mr O’ConnorI am writing to you to let you know of my disgust at the planned budget changes to prescription costs and the changes to Disability Support Pension. My name is Phill McQuade. I’m a 40 year old married father of 3 children aged 7, 5, and the third baby who is 2 days old. I’m currently on the Disability Support Pension. I’m no dole bludger. I’ve worked for the last 20 years. This includes 4 years in Australian Army transport corps. Four years ago I was diagnosed with Congenital Tarsal Coalition, which in English means I was born with bones in my feet joined together that should have separated. It didn’t show up till 1998 when in a lot of pain my doctor sent me for a CT scan. My ankles and feet are worn out with arthritis. I’ve had 3 operations and had my ankles fused with bolts. I’ve been through 4 years of hell. I was working previously as a storeman driver for 5 years but I had to leave full time work in 1998. My WorkCover claim was knocked back because I was born with this condition. I’m in constant pain 24 hours a day and on a lot of medication. My medical certificate says I can work 16 hours a week. I miss out on the pension by 1 hour. The problem is I’m a truck driver with a B double licence, but my medication makes me drowsy. To work 2 days I have to stop taking my medication. IfI lose this pensioner concession card we are totally stuffed. We will lose our own house we currently live from week to week. My wife works 2 days a week as a kindergarten teacher but is taking 12 months unpaid leave for our new baby. If we are without the concession card and have to pay $28 for a script we couldn’t afford all the medication we need. My son has asthma, he’s 7. My5 year old daughter has a condition called Renal Reflux. And my wife has Marfan Syndrome. I have been doing some work doing casual driving for a labour hire company but it’s not regular. I can’t believe they want to raise money by hitting the people who can least afford it. This is the lowest act I’ve ever heard of. It seems politicians don’t know what it’s like to struggle for money each week and care nothing for people who do. They’ll pay come next election with their jobs. This is signed by Phill McQuade, and he is one of many constituents who have written to my office outlining the harsh effects of many parts of the budget handed down by the Treasurer.

262,"Meet People Like Mr Mcquade Or Indeed Read The Letters That Have, No Doubt, Been Sent To Their","3560 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 own offices to know what effects these budgetary decisions will have on people like Mr McQuade and his family. I will refer to one other. It is from Bet and Jack Luke, who reside in Gisborne. They have indicated: Dear Mr O’Connor, In regard to the changes to the Disability Pension in the new Budget. We wish to complain of the unfairness of lumping all disabilities together. We agree that there are people who use the system, but we feel very concerned about those with mental disabilities who work 30 hrs weekly in a Sheltered Workshop, with no ability to work in any other employment. These people who perhaps can’t read or write need some respect in the community. We have been involved with a particular workshop, and know that some people have been there for 25 yrs and would be lost without the continuity and companionship of “their job”. They do very repetitious work which you or I would never tolerate. Some weeks if there is a shortage of work, they are unable to be employed, and so they rely more heavily on the pension. We feel it is very unfair for these people to be getting a reduction of their pension. It is those letters that bring home in the most human sense the tragic consequences of some of the budgetary decisions made by this government. In Burke there are almost 4,000 people on a disability pension, and they are relieved to know that the Labor Party will vote against the changes proposed by the government. Families in Burke are pleased that the Labor Party is standing up for them by voting to prevent the regressive changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. These changes will hurt people who can least afford it. Another area of concern has been the failure of this government to provide necessary upgrades to the important transport road links in my electorate. An election promise to improve the Calder has been reneged upon-or, at the very least, deferred-and no commitments have been undertaken to address the critical problems of the Western Highway. The communities in Deer Park and the new estates of Burnside and Caroline Springs are sick to death of the evergrowing congestion that is developing along the highway. The residents of Rockbank, ably represented by their spokesperson Ian Cowie, have for years lamented the dangers associated with the patch of the highway adjacent to their community. The incidence of death and serious injury cannot be tolerated any longer. The residents of Melton and Bacchus Marsh, which is also connected to the Western Highway, share these concerns and have brought the dangers of the area-notably, Anthony’s Cutting-to the government’s attention, but without relief. As I have said on other occasions, this highway is a premier link between Melbourne and Adelaide and must be given greater priority. As for the changes proposed to the superannuation surcharge, in many ways this decision sums up the unabashed elitism of this government. Let us remember that, before Labor extended superannuation to the vast majority of Australians, only the well-off enjoyed the luxury of a guaranteed, comfortable retirement. The coalition have either opposed broadening the superannuation net or have been dragged kicking and screaming into supporting changes which benefit those who now receive compulsory superannuation. It is laughable for any member opposite to boast that this budget assists and helps those people’s superannuation benefits. Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3561 Contrary to the rhetoric of the Treasurer’s Intergenerational Report, this government shows scant regard for the bulk of the nation. If this is the Treasurer’s CV for the position of Prime Minister, then he failed the job interview. No wonder the minister for workplace relations is puffing his chest even more than normal! The budget contained what the Treasurer boasted was a plan to boost incentives to investments in superannuation. In truth, it is a plan to benefit the well-off, ignoring the concerns of middleand low-income earners in Australia. The budget proposal involves giving a tax cut to only the top three per cent of working Australians. Instead, Labor proposes a fairer alternative. We would consider cutting the superannuation tax for all Australians from 15 per cent to 13 per cent or we would consider cutting the tax to 11.5 per cent for people aged 40 and over. It is important to note that the packages proposed by Labor are, responsibly, revenue neutral. In my first speech to parliament this year I said, ‘Australians are seeking political leaders who will look after the interests of the many rather than the few.’ I believe this is still the case, but the budget does nothing to assist them in this pursuit. Instead, the budget highlights the disregard and contempt this government has shown for people who it should be doing its utmost to assist and protect. It is a shameful budget and it provides the electorate with an insight into what the next leader of the Liberal Party really thinks about the aged, those in need of essential medicines and those with disabilities most in need of care. tion Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 gives me the opportunity to go through some of the successes of the Howard government. If you had asked me back in 1996, when the government came to office, whether the success which has been achieved was possible, I would not have agreed at all that it was possible to achieve what has been achieved. This is another chapter in the proper management of Australia. You can talk about border control and the war against terrorism but, while those extraordinary international events are occurring, there is still an economy to be managed and a country to be run. The sure hands of this government and its executive are something that the Australian people have come to respect. Some of the comments from our political opponents are always predictable; naturally enough, they have to find something to probe us on, and that is the way it should be. I will run through a few of the general points in the budget-some significant, some quite large and some quite modest, but they are just finetuning the overall macro-effect which has been so effective in making this country currently probably the most successful economy in the world. The National Food Industry Strategy is important to the regional sector and to the value adding sector of the economy, and significant resources have been placed there to give it a greater emphasis and to point up our trade opportunities. Some of the incentives provided to individuals in terms of the rural environment are also important. Greater incentives have been created to address a problem that is emerging about the availability of rural vets, and that move is very welcome. A small measure, but one which is particularly important to my electorate, is to do with scientific research in cooperation with a number of other countries into the southern bluefin tuna. That research measure will be much appreciated. In Northern Australia we have the Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy, and the foot-and-mouth scare through Europe, the UK, Northern Ireland and small parts of the Republic of Ireland has made us more aware than ever that it is very important to stay ever alert with regard to this issue.",155,Representatives Main Committee
263,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (8.20 P.m.),"Speaking in the Main Committee on the Appropria3562 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 One measure that I particularly welcome in my part of the world is with regard to the Commonwealth legal services. We have a great lack of general legal advice in regional areas, particularly in the area that I come from, and the service that has been offered, particularly over the past couple of years, has been very much appreciated. The focus in the budget on illicit drugs is also important and, in answer to a question in the House a fortnight or so ago, the Prime Minister gave considerable hope as to the sort of success that is possible when you give support to the states-although I worry sometimes about whether the states do enough and whether they wait too long for the Commonwealth to become involved. Nevertheless, with the sort of the support the Commonwealth has been given-and I give credit to those states who have endeavoured to get on top of the issue of substance abuse, particularly illegal drugs-the statistics that are coming forward are quite encouraging. Crime Stoppers is a small program but, nevertheless, it is important and very successful. The citizenship program will receive greater support. At a time when international events are perhaps making us respect our citizenship and the quality of life that we enjoy in Australia, it is highly appropriate that we remind ourselves and the population in general that it is important to Australia to be citizens of this country, especially as much of that privilege is taken for granted by so many. In the regional sector we have a great little program called the Television Black Spots Program. For most Australians it would seem almost incongruous and most unlikely that people would not enjoy three or four television channels. But, believe it or not, some communities have only one channel. With great respect to the ABC, it is nice to have a little bit of diversity aside from that one source of television and to have Imparja and SBS. The Television Black Spots Program is a great program for small communities. As I say, most Australians would not even credit that you might have only one channel-and, of course, some do not have any television at all. That program is greatly appreciated by a significant minority of our population. There is $14.3 billion for defence in this budget-a significant contribution from taxpayers to a pretty important part of our national infrastructure. There is a similar amount of money for education-around $14 billion, I believe. The sorts of percentage increases that the Commonwealth has been putting into this area, which is now combined in the new portfolio with science, are very significant and important. The Job Network receives some modification, some changes and some improvements, and I very much welcome that. The Job Network initiative is a world leader. Whilst everybody would agree that finetuning will always give some improvement, the principle, the structure and the comparison with the previous system show us that Australia can be well proud of the effects and results of the Job Network. Apprenticeships, once again, receive generous support. It is important that we remember that, in 1996 and prior to that, our apprenticeship and traineeship systems had dropped away. It is very welcome to see the sorts of numbers of trainees and apprentices that are coming through our nation. Of course, this is the foundation of so much of the skill base for future industry. For the Natural Heritage Trust there is $1 billion-plus in this budget. It is an important program-unprecedented in Australia’s history in terms of the support given particularly, but not exclusively, to regional environmental projects, on which it is important to work with the states. The National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, combined with the Natural Heritage Trust, is seeing unprecedented work going into our natural environment. Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3563 It is very important that support continue in the family area. With the very significant focus on women’s issues over the last decade or so, I have been particularly pleased to see some focus on men. I think a very significant case can be made for the support of men in some of the issues that they face, particularly after such a significant focus on women’s issues over the years-important as those issues are. I will just touch on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the respect that I have gained for that department. We had some pretty significant issues in front of us with the US farm bill and the ever-present European Community with its subsidisation of agriculture. Right across the world we have a very excellent resource in our diplomats and our trade people. From my limited knowledge, I will talk about the people who are recruited. For example, in a place like France, they are people who understand the local situation; quite often they are nationals of the country, and there are even some Australian people who have perhaps undergone their secondary education in Paris or somewhere else in that land. I think the way these people blend into and understand those countries and represent Australia is nothing short of astounding. To conclude, it is another very good budget, building on, as I said right at the beginning, what is getting to be a long period of successful economic outcomes and reminding us all that we have one of the most successful economies in the world. Not to put too fine a point on it, there is no doubt in my mind that the government’s focus on interest rates, debt and government expenditure, its bringing down a balanced budget and its focus on the real skills of this country are things that the executive and the parliament can well be proud of. Ms ELLIS (Canberra) (8.31 p.m.)-Federal budgets always attract a great deal of attention and, in doing so, they usually attract a great range of labels. I think the worse label that you could give to a budget would be to say that it is an opportunity lost or that it is a budget that offers not terribly much at all. Basically, that is how I see this current budget. There are a number of victims of this budget. Families will certainly be paying the price. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister spent enormous levels of money in the lead-up to last year’s election, and they should be blaming no-one but themselves for the current state of the books. We are seeing the evidence of pressure on interest rates already, with the government also wanting to charge higher costs for pharmaceuticals and wanting to attack those on disability pensions in the cloak of welfare reform. Families will be paying enormously high levels for pharmaceuticals-something that we on this side are not at all impressed with, even though we do agree with some of the administrative changes that are proposed in the PBS. I have mentioned already that some sectors of the community look to a forthcoming budget with dread. I think that is a fair thing to say on behalf of many sectors of our community. The community of the ACT, the people in my electorate, have had cause over recent years-since 1996-to dread this government’s budgets. We in this town still remember very clearly what happened to us in 1996 and 1997 in particular. The attitude to this community was one of slashing Public Service numbers. In fact, I remember that terrible term ‘cut them off at the knees’-I think that was the phrase being used by a minister at the time. This community is recovering from that period in spite of those attitudes. The private sector and the businesspeople in Canberra who have invested their money, their families and their future in this town and its economy have hung on, determined to see that faith paid back in profit in every sense in the long run. I have to commend them on that. While this year’s 3564 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 budget, thankfully, did not threaten kneecapping, it offered little in the grand scheme of things. I do, however, want to acknowledge that the funding for the upgrading of the Australian Institute of Sport is very welcome. That funding helps to lessen the fears held by some as to the long-term future of the AIS in Canberra, and I am pleased to see that decision has been made. I note, however, that the overwhelming amount of that money will not be seen until 2005-06, and so the announcement in this budget is really a prediction of spending in future years rather than some very large project that is about to occur. We see the same sort of situation surrounding the construction of the new Defence headquarters, which was announced prior to the last election. Two to three days before the election the then defence minister announced that the government planned to construct the Defence Headquarters Australian Theatre at a site outside Queanbeyan. The budget papers are extremely disappointing, in reality, and people cannot not be blamed for thinking that the government are still not sure what will be built or where it will be built. Something that is not, but should have been, in the budget is the government’s decision to announce the sale of very large tracts of land in the ACT, with no consultation with the ACT government on economic or planning grounds. The ACT government has responsibility for administering an orderly program of land release and use, and has gone to a great deal of trouble in doing so, with a great deal of work being put into that area of its policy. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, just decides that it has very large blocks of land that it does not believe it needs any more, plops them onto the market and then is a little surprised when the local authorities say that this is not quite how planning ought to occur. That is perhaps something that should have been announced in the budget in a fairer and more open way. The other two areas that I want to very briefly touch on here tonight, given the limited time. I have, surround education and ageing. I am again disappointed to see the lack of good, strong investment in our future, through investment in education, particularly in the higher levels of education and in public education. I understand that there is only about $12 million for new measures for the entire science, education and training portfolios, which is about 0.1 per cent of the total education and training budget of $12 billion. It is pretty disappointing. When the government also says that we could ‘expect a fall in estimated demand for residential aged care services’, that is so unbelievable as to be laughable. It raises the question of where the government has been and where the minister or his advisers have been, if that is how they see the aged care sector. I think the front page of the Adelaide paper today had an article with the terrible prediction of possible closures of aged care services there, owing to lack of resources-or some such story. With the government going to remove subsidies by something like $152 million this year and a further $174 million in the next year in the aged care area, if it is going to have that sort of attitude towards aged care now, that raises the question of why we would go down the avenue of an Intergenerational Report which tells us that we have to worry about a growth in aged care needs in the future. I believe that the government’s program of welfare reform is one of the most contentious parts of this whole budget. There are serious concerns about the minister’s plans for people receiving disability support pensions and for those in our communities who require that type of support now and into the future. While much noise is being made about the growing numbers of people receiving DSP, it is a fact that those numbers have been trending down in recent times; but we need to look very carefully at what the government is actually planning Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3565 here. Firstly, the third Commonwealth-state-territory disability agreement, which is a five year agreement, is currently under negotiation and due by the end of June. However, I noticed in recent days that the Prime Minister and Minister Vanstone have announced a four-month extension to that current agreement. I would like to come back to that a little later. Within these negotiations is the debate surrounding the money needed for unmet needs, as demonstrated during the current five-year arrangement. An additional $100 million per year was agreed to and announced by then Minister Anthony back in July 2000 and was already factored in and, in many cases, already spent by the states and the territories in their program deliveries. The government is attempting to falsely claim this as new money or as some generous windfall. Clearly, it is not. I despair at the lack of growth funds in reality in the budget arrangement for that agreement. Secondly, proposed changes to the administration and eligibility for the DSP were announced in the budget. Currently, a person needs to demonstrate that they are unable to work a minimum of 30 hours a week at award wages to receive DSP. In the future that work test will be reduced to 15 hours a week at award wages-in other words, a tightening up of that work test rule. It is not going to affect people who are within five years of retirement age. It is going to affect existing recipients and new recipients from July of next year. There are also other changes which, unfortunately, I do not have the time to attend to here but which have been talked about in great detail in the other chamber. In the recent Senate estimates hearings, we learned that people currently working in business services, which were previously referred to as sheltered workshops, may also be facing the possibility of this new work test. Thirdly, there are serious problems emerging, with the government refusing to accept its responsibilities for increases to salaries for those working in the community sector in New South Wales. The Social and Community Services Award, or SACS Award, was passed last November. This meant that people working in the community sector, and in this case the disability sector in particular, would receive a very justified wage increase. These people were among the state’s lowest paid non-government community workers. On 26 April the New South Wales Premier, along with seven prominent community leaders, wrote to the Prime Minister, pointing out that the New South Wales government had fulfilled its responsibility to meet its share of the SACS Award increases, at a cost of $116 million over three years. In that letter it was estimated that the Commonwealth’s share was $68.8 million, or approximately 37 per cent, of the total funding required. Still the Commonwealth is refusing to face up to this responsibility. While the government remains intransigent, the services involved are paying wages to their employees and are very quickly running out of money. The services include residential disability services, day programs, respite services, youth refuge and hostels, amongst many others. If the time permitted I could quote scores of representations that I and other colleagues have received from this sector, from families and from organisations facing closure of the programs-all because we cannot see this government saying that it will pay its share of the costs. It is fair to say that Minister Vanstone uses a lot language and a lot of words to deny these claims but, in reality, I cannot find any way of justifying the Commonwealth’s actions. In actual fact, a serious crisis is looming. The government is holding the sector to ransom. The minister says that, if this parliament does not pass her changes to the DSP, funding for the disability sector through the CSTDA will be withheld. This is cold-hearted blackmail. In the words of the MS Society of Victoria, ‘This is Senator Vanstone’s own human shield strategy.’ 3566 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 People with disabilities, their families, their carers and the organisations providing services are not pawns on some game board. They are not to be used as scoring points, and they are not to be seen as people refusing to do their bit to contribute when and where they can. They are able to do those things knowing that they have the DSP to support them and to catch them if needed. Compulsorily remove that support and force them into competition in the open labour market, and you risk their chances of succeeding. I want to very briefly refer to a couple of cases where people have contacted me and given me examples of how these changes will affect them. Danielle is a 45-year-old woman who works 37 hours a week in a business service in New South Wales. She requires support to perform her duties. Open employment is not an option for Danielle, because of her support needs as a result of her intellectual, neurological and physical disabilities. Young Stephen is a 32year-old who works 36.7 hours per week in the same business service. I had the pleasure of meeting this young man when I visited there two or three months ago. He requires assistance to perform tasks. He is legally blind and he has an intellectual disability. He receives DSP. He lives at home with his parents, and he relies on that DSP to supplement his wages. Stephen is also working one day per month at the University of New South Wales in the mail room to gain experience. He earns a full wage for this work and he pays tax. He is gaining valuable skills in this work and now uses those skills at the business service in question. But he is not able to earn full award wages on a full-time basis, because of his work capacity. The government has to understand that business services and other similar areas actually offer for these people an employment base that is different from the open labour market. Those business services can actually alter their day requirements when necessary. I know of a young woman here in Canberra who works a 35-hour week, but that may take a different configuration each week, depending upon her wellness and her ability. An open labour market would very likely not be able to do that for people like those I am referring to. There is another stunning article that I recommend that everybody read if they have not. It was in the Melbourne Herald Sun on 27 May. It was written by a young man called Lachlan McLeod, who is a journalism studies graduate and is disabled and confined to a wheelchair. It is a very good article. Towards the end of it he says: To most able-bodied people, going out and doing everyday things may not seem like an achievement. But to a disabled person, I can assure them that it is indeed an accomplishment to be like everybody else. ThenI suppose at the end of the day, losing $53 isn’t as insulting as the Government assuming that the disability pension is a waste of money. These are real people. I am not making any of this up. I know that Minister Vanstone has made noises about rethinking certain bits of this, but I personally think that she has to rethink almost the whole lot. The Eastern Regions Mental Health Association in Melbourne sent me a very detailed letter of its views about these changes. The president said towards the end of the letter: I see the changes proposed by the Treasurer as not only short-sighted but potentially damaging to the mental health of many Australians disabled by mental illness. Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3567 We have to imagine what it is like to have a mental illness and to try to adapt to the new requirements, which will be stringent and harsh, given that what the government has said has not been refuted. The Melbourne City Mission had this to say: The framework for the reportthat is, the Intergenerational Reportaccepts that it is desirable for Australia to aim to maintain its position as a ‘lower taxing and spending country’. This is clearly a point that can be contested. While fiscal sustainability and accountability are necessary, consideration of current and future citizens extends beyond their role and expectations as taxpayers. Questions of common good, community cohesion and individual well being must also be considered. They had a lot more to say, but time does not allow me to go into those details. AllI can say is that we have people working in the business services area who are facing massive change through the quality assurance bill, which we supported but about which we have some concerns, given the current budget situation. We have people on DSP with chronic illness or disability who need a seamless, smooth transition from support to work as they are well and able to carry out their duties. The government is totally wrong in believing that the only way it will achieve renewed policy in the disability area is by coercion. It needs to think carefully about the gains already being made by the massive number of people on DSP with no coercion. If we could increase the support and financial resources for those people and the employers employing them, I believe we would reach stages that we could be proud of as a community with no need for coercion or compulsion at all. night, but I would like to make some comments on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03. In many respects, this is a most remarkable document. It is a remarkable document inasmuch as it has managed to provide some good, sound economic guidance for Australia at a time of very great concern; concern at our security and concern at the state of our defence forces. The government has made a commitment to ensure that they are brought up to date, that they are properly funded and that Australia can play a role not only in international affairs but in ensuring the security of the people at home. If you look back over the last five or six years, the story of our defence forces is a remarkable one indeed. I think it is good that we pay tribute to the tremendous work that has been done in places like East Timor. When the newly appointed President of East Timor arrived at question time today, the emotion in the reception he got in the House was obvious. There was a realisation by all the members in the House, as there is in the community at large, that Australia did play a most constructive and leading role as part of the UN forces that brought some peace and security and ultimately democracy to that troubled island. There is no doubt that in providing that particular support in East Timor our defence services were indeed stretched, as our equipment was stretched. The load on those forces in recent years has been considerable indeed. It has not only been East Timor. If you look at what Australia has achieved in a number of peacekeeping forces around the world-if you look at the tremendous job that is being done and what is being achieved on the troubled island of Bougainville-I think you can see the standard of the service that we provide. We really need to congratulate and support all our forces, not only as a token of thanks but as a means of making sure that Australia does play its role in the international community.",157,Representatives Main Committee
264,Mr Jull (Fadden) (8.47 P.m.),"It is not my intention to delay this chamber for long to3568 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 Bougainville is not quite there yet, but it is indeed heading towards a situation where at last-after 12 or 13 years-that troubled island may have the prospect of some peace. Mr Deputy Speaker Price, as you and I both know, what has been achieved by the Australian forces in Bougainville is really incredible. It was an invaluable experience to visit that place, to see the state that it was in just two or three years ago and to realise that a form of peace had been kept and that the peace process was working through with the support of the Australian defence forces. The thing that came back to me time and time again after that visit was the fact that the ADF people on the ground carried no arms whatsoever. It was part of the arrangements that there were not to be arms used in that particular process. Our people were indeed brave, and the people of Bougainville paid tribute to the attitude of the Australian forces in the work that they undertook. The one thing that should be pointed out in terms of the Bougainville effort is the fact that the women who were members of the Australian defence forces played an enormous role. Once again, in public meetings with the personnel of Bougainville, it was pointed out to us that it was really appreciated that the women were there, and the relationships that they built up with the local communities were such that they were regarded as being trustworthy and as having a real contribution to make. SoI was delighted to learn that this commitment was made to re-equipping our defence forces, to providing that extra support and indeed to building on their numbers. Virtually daily in the papers now we read of their efforts in the war on terrorism and the role, in particular, that they are playing in Afghanistan. That in itself is going to be a major commitment for not only this particular budget but also a great number of budgets to come. The other point I would like to allude to very briefly is the increase in allocation to our own security services. One of the things that has tended to be forgotten in recent months is that we are still very much on alert for any terrorist activity that might happen not only within this country but also in our region. I am afraid I have no time for some commentators. It would seem particularly prevalent on radio for commentators to say that there is no threat to Australia. I do not think anybody in authority in Australia, whether from the security agencies, the government or indeed the parliament itself, has ever said that there is no threat to Australia. It has been said that there has been a low threat, but never that there has been no threat. The government has recognised that our first obligation is obviously for the security of the country. Consequently, the commitment has been made for extra equipment, extra funding and, I understand, for some extra personnel. In many respects Australia has been very lucky, and we have been lucky because of the quality of our services. But I think one of the things that probably assisted us more than anything was the three years or so in the lead-up to the Olympic Games, when a massive security operation and security check were undertaken not only in terms of what may be happening in the country but also in terms of assessing people who would be visiting. The fact that the Olympic Games went by without a hitch and without an emergency spoke volumes for the standard of the work that was done by our security services in conjunction with overseas bureaus. The reality is that Australia has a very real role to play in providing that security for our region and indeed as part of the worldwide effort to stop terrorism. The quality of our work is acknowledged overseas, and I think that the work that has been done within Australia has been acknowledged not only by the public at large but also by a number of the ethnic communities scattered around Australia who have been working in conjunction with our security Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3569 services. So, in that respect, it was a major commitment of the government to undertake to look after the defence forces and our security services. Despite that, we still had the opportunity to provide some good support for community organisations and for our education system. There are a couple of areas that do not normally seem to come to light in these general debates on the appropriation bills. Australia’s record on the trade front in recent years really has been quite outstanding. We know that many of our trade figures in recent quarters have been in the black. While obviously the level of the Australian dollar has contributed to our success in going into overseas markets, I believe that the government should be congratulated on the real efforts that they have made in trade promotion. I was pleased to see that the export market development grants have once again been a focus of this budget and are to be extended. I do not think that people fully realise just what effect that can have. Maybe it is not a big deal in terms of our larger companies, but in our small and medium enterprises the fact that that assistance is there often makes the difference between having a go at exports and just leaving them alone and concentrating on a domestic market. In my electorate in Queensland the vast majority of businesses are small and medium enterprises. I was going through a list of export market development grants that have been paid in the last 12 months within that electorate, and there are some amazing stories. There is the story of a swimming pool lining manufacturer who now produces his entire output for export to Germany. He makes liners for swimming pools. There is an optical company that makes contact lenses that have been quite revolutionary. They are the only one of their type in the world. They are now exporting worldwide. Jewellery manufacturers export from Sanctuary Cove to places like Hawaii-it seems almost incongruous, but they are there. One of the classics came through just last week with some funding from the Minister for Trade. This was in the area of soft serve ice-creams. A company that was part of one of the major Australian groups decided that they would off-load their soft serve ice-cream division. Two young gentlemen took this over and decided that they could make a go of it. I tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, next time you are in Dubai or Beijing and you have a Dairy Queen icecream of the soft serve variety, it came from my electorate. That company is exporting to more than 20 countries around the world selling soft serve ice-cream. The list goes on and on. The manufacture of portable buildings is another area. A company that was involved, I understand, with the making of the sails for Expo have now got to a situation where they are exporting worldwide. They built the sails and the covers for the Commonwealth Games complex in Kuala Lumpur. Now they are building collapsible and portable silos for wheat, which they are exporting to the United States. They are making portable libraries for sale in France, car parks and major entertainment centres which can be erected in a matter of hours. This was a process which was developed in Queensland and exported to the world. Now the company are manufacturing in such diverse places as India and South Africa. I understand they will soon be going into the United States. The other area that is a concern in my electorate-and it is one with which I have been associated for many years-is tourism. I would like to congratulate the government on the initiatives that they have undertaken in recent years in making sure not only that Australia is promoted properly but indeed that major studies have been undertaken to make sure that we maximise the benefits of tourism. I do not know how many times I have stood up in this place and talked about the flow-on effect of tourism on employment. Every time we have an in3570 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 crease of something like 25,000 international visitors, there are another 1,200 jobs up for grabs. The success story of Australia over the last 15 or 20 years in the tourism industry has been quite remarkable. It is true-and we had to do it-that we looked towards volume, and we prided ourselves when we first reached the million tourists a year mark. We made great noises about the fact that during the year of the Olympics we had more than three million visitors. Now we are looking at the quality end of the industry-not to ignore the others but to ensure that those tourists who come to Australia are of a type that spend more than most and have the opportunity of providing yield for our tourist operators and for our accommodation houses. It has been true that in past years we have been through a huge construction phase, particularly in hotels. Nobody has made any money out of them. Now is the time to settle down and consolidate and to make sure we do have that capacity to bring some yield in and to provide some real returns for the investment that has been made in that industry. There is a maturity in the tourism product but, more importantly, there is a maturity in the nature of the people who work in that industry; and I think we should pay tribute to the work that is being done by TAFE and specialist colleges around Australia in producing young people who manage, run and operate various tourist facilities. I suppose my first interest in tourism arose 25 or so years ago. The thing that really used to annoy me was that the few hotels in Australia all seemed to be managed by somebody called Fritz or Helmut. If you go overseas now, more often than not you will find Australians working in or managing hotels. A number them are working in Asia, but the reality is that a number of them are now working throughout Europe in some of the great hotels of the world. When I was recently in LondonI was quite delighted when a young lady came up to me at the hotel in which I was staying to tell me that she was from my electorate and that she had graduated only recently from a course at one of the Queensland institutions and immediately got a managerial job in that particular hotel in London. A lot of effort, money and concentration has been put into the training of our young people. That money and that purpose is still there, and now of course the hospitality and tourist industries can provide our young people not only with satisfying jobs but with lucrative jobs as well. We are not just providing housemaids; we are providing the real brainpower and effort found behind the tourist industry and we are exporting that to the world. The other issue that I would like to raise very briefly concerns one particular aspect of some of the controversy that is going on at the moment over pharmaceutical benefits. There have been increases in the rates to be paid, by both ordinary Australians and, indeed, those in receipt of pensions, for drugs under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I think there has generally been an acceptance that this had to happen, much as some people may not like it. The reality is that science is making tremendous progress in the development of medicine, but that progress is often expensive: new drugs are hitting the market all the time and some of them are very expensive indeed. In fact, lists of the real prices of some of those drugs that are available have circulated around this place, and I do not think a lot of people realise the cost that is involved. One of the things that the government should be congratulated on is the decision to make sure that the real price of the drugs actually appears on the label of a prescription when it comes out of the Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3571 chemist shop. Not one but two of my local chemists who agree with this particular move have raised another issue that is of concern to them. Admittedly, it would appear from what they tell me that quite often the elderly are the offenders. Apparently a number of service clubs quite often have drives for drugs that are out of date and they ask people to take those drugs back into chemist shops where they are collected and checked. If they are still all right, they can be sent overseas to some needy countries. The situation that they point out is that there would seem to be almost a tendency by some sections of our community to hoard their prescription drugs, and that in actual fact quite often mountains of drugs come into chemist shops for distribution overseas after their official expiry date. As one of my pharmacists said the other day, it would be an interesting exercise for the government to sit down sometime and try to estimate the cost of this hoarding of drugs. Maybe that exercise could be looked at. I thought it was an interesting aspect of this whole debate on the PBS. I certainly know people in my community who do have a tendency to hoard drugs, and obviously that is also putting some pressure on our system. Mr Deputy Speaker, I said I would not delay the House too long and my time is just about up. I would just say once again a special word of congratulation to the government for a budget that I think has achieved a great deal in very difficult times. tion Bill (No. 1) 2002-03. I do so not to congratulate the government but to condemn them for the very harsh attitude they have taken to some of the most vulnerable in our communitythose with disabilities who are caught up in a very mean and tricky move by this government to change their disability support pension. I have had many calls, as I suspect have most members of parliament, not only from people with disabilities but from employers of people with disabilities. Any prospective employer who is looking for an employee would be well served to look at employing someone with a disability. People with disabilities generally make far better employees. The facts show not only that they take less time off due to sickness and other matters but that they appreciate being given the opportunity of employment and will generally work much harder than their able-bodied counterparts. You can understand why people with disabilities feel that they have had a real kick in the guts from the government when they heard the news about their pension in the budget. In the time that I have available tonight, I want to refer to the case of a young girl aged 29. Her disability was as a result of suffering from a serious stroke at the age of 22. The ongoing effects of the stroke are, firstly, reduced mobility and capacity in the right arm and leg; secondly, a speech disability; and, thirdly, anti-phosphate syndrome: a blood disorder, which requires regular medication, monitoring and analysis. Her employment position prior to 14 May was this: she is a client of BizLink, a disability employment organisation which operates in the northern suburbs of Perth and does a tremendous job. This young lady was employed by RIC Publications Pty Ltd, an educational publisher, as a production assistant. She has worked there for the past three years for 25 hours per week, a time that has been altered regularly to allow her the opportunity to comfortably manage her disability while at the same time develop an ongoing career. The employer in this circumstance is to be congratulated for the opportunity afforded this young woman.",163,Representatives Main Committee
265,Mr Edwards (Cowan) (9.05 P.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to speak on Appropria3572 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 As to her financial position prior to this government’s budget, she received the disability support allowance of $112.20 per week and had a salary of $305.75 per week, giving her a total income of some $417.95 per week. Her position post this budget of 14 May is that she is currently very uncertain of her future and is exploring the following options: first, she is looking at full-time employment, which will have negative effects on her health and well-being and will result in the loss of eligibility for health care cards which are essential to her; second, she is looking at reducing her working hours to 15 hours per week, which will see her financially disadvantaged and intellectually unchallenged, will increase her pension and increase the burden on government-an increase in the government’s contribution from $112 to $162 per week; lastly, she is looking at not working at all and receiving a full-time pension. Her financial position post 14 May is this. Her disability support allowance could be replaced by Newstart allowance. This would represent a potential reduction of some $52 per fortnight. She could cop a reduction in salary if hours worked are reduced. Then again, there could be a loss of job. The reporting regime required by the Newstart program would create a level of physical and emotional distress that would be detrimental to this young lady’s health if employment were terminated for any reason. This employer tells me that the current level of uncertainty is placing a significant level of emotional stress not only on this employee but also on a couple of other people that he employs. It has had some effect on this young lady’s work with this particular firm, but, combined with the support provided by BizLink, they have created an environment where this young lady can manage her disability well, at the same time developing her skills and making a considerable contribution to her employer and to her community. The experience of this young lady over the years since the stroke has shown that increased stress levels place health and well-being at some risk. What young people in this circumstance need, particularly young women, is not the sort of initiative that this government has written into the most recent budget. What young people like this need is support in the workplace. They need programs to help them maintain themselves at work. And people without employment need programs and support in areas that will help them find that employment. I really appreciate the job that BizLink does. It is not in my electorate, but it does service a fair area of the northern suburbs. Its staff are very committed and it does a tremendous job. It is one of those organisations which in the last three budgets has had to accept about a six per cent cut, called an efficiency dividend. On top of that, it has had to absorb the GST. That has meant that it has had to take one person away from the support position that it has had in the field and has had to put more administrative time into managing its budget, which is much tighter, and dealing with the GST. Here is an organisation that has done a tremendous job and that has not been helped in the last three budgets. It now finds that it has a much more difficult client workload to contend with simply because of the uncertainty and the concern that has resulted from this budget-concern not just to employers but to employees. Another point that needs to be made is this, and I hope the government will consider it. People with disabilities, depending upon what the particular disability is, can have really good days and really good weeks. They might go for months being fit, healthy and well, and then they can have a run of outs. They can have bad days. They can have days when the disability just gets on top of them and when they find it very difficult to cope. It is very difficult when Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3573 you are faced with an assessment at a time when you might be feeling pretty good or at a time when you are feeling very bad. I think the government has made a real blue here. It has made a blue in picking on some of the most vulnerable people in our community. I am very pleased indeed that we on this side of the parliament have indicated that we will oppose this legislation in the upper house. A number of people from the ranks of government have indicated to me that they hope that the opposition parties in the Senate will knock this off. They are not comfortable with it, they are not happy with it, they feel embarrassed by it and they feel that these moves in the budget do not reflect some of the good things that they believe the Liberal Party stands for. I think it will be a relief to many people in government to have this piece of legislation knocked off in the Senate. I want to say this to those government members who see there being some sort of a safety net in the Senate and who know that ALP members of the Senate will not let unfair measures like this through: if those government members are really dinkum about being concerned about the unfairness of these initiatives in the recent budget, they will do what people in the Liberal Party have done previously-that is, they will have the courage to stand up in their party room and say to the Treasurer that these sorts of moves are simply not acceptable and that he should go away and find other ways of raising the funds that he claims he needs. There are a number of issues that I would have liked to have had the time to raise tonight, but I understand that there is an agreement to cut things short so that everyone gets the opportunity to have a say. I am very pleased to be able to join with other members from this side in giving voice to our opposition to these moves on the disability support pension and in saying to the government that it is not an appropriate way to raise money and that, if they want revenue that badly, instead of picking on some of the most vulnerable, most deserving and most needy people in our community, they should look elsewhere. There are plenty of places that they can look, and they should. The issue that I will conclude on is that this whole budget has been sold to the community as a khaki budget-a budget which brings in increased funds because of our need to deal with the terrorist situation, because of our need to fight the war on terror, because of our need to better protect our borders and because of our need for greater security. The truth is that, when you look closely at this budget, you see that it is all camouflage; it is trickery. It is the old mean and tricky bit which this government is well known for and well identified by its own hierarchy. This is not a budget which brings in a lot more money to Defence, because much of what is being spent on defence is being achieved through cost cutting and through the delaying of longer term capital acquisition programs. The government has sought to simply con the people of Australia by talking up a khaki budget at the same time that it is hitting some of the most vulnerable people in our community. I am very pleased that the ALP is taking stock of those measures and will knock them off in the Senate, which is what it ought to do. the residents of my electorate, the federal seat of Wentworth, have benefited for seven years from low interest rates, low unemployment and economic growth as a direct result of the budgetary policies of the coalition government. The coalition’s seventh budget-and, if I may say so, my first as a member of this august parliament-continues the government’s excellent record of management of our economy, which has seen Australia perform better than most",167,Representatives Main Committee
266,Mr King (Wentworth) (9.18 P.m.),"I am delighted to support the budget tonight because3574 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 other developed economies. In 2001, it is perhaps worth noting, our growth was higher than that of each of the world’s largest seven economies and was twice as fast as the OECD average. Following the budget speech, I thought that I would do a little survey of my own in my electorate to determine what the feel on the streets was about this budget. I did some doorknocking in Randwick, in the southern part of my electorate, and in Paddington, in the eastern part of my electorate. Those are somewhat diverse communities, and I thought I would get a reasonable response in relation to the budget. I found to my interest that, in general terms, people were supportive of the direction of the budget. There were concerns in one or two places that changes to the disability support pension might impact not so much upon them personally but upon their acquaintances, but when I further examined the persons involved they said that overall they were pleased with the direction of the budget. Interestingly enough, in relation to issues of economic significance and financial implications, the greatest concern to the people of my electorate in the middle of May when I made these casual inquiries-if I can put it that way-was regarding the direction of insurance and the problems faced by the broader community, especially not-for-profit organisations, concerning premiums for public liability insurance. I wish to say something about that possibly later in this speech, although it probably deserves a separate address. I want to point out several features of the budget which, I believe, are very important. They include some general economic features, some sector by sector features, some of which have been dealt with in detail by my distinguished colleague the member for Fadden, and also some local initiatives in my seat of Wentworth which have been very welcomed by the people of that part of Australia. Let me deal firstly with some general features of the budget. The Treasurer concluded his remarks on 14 May by saying: This is a Budget to keep Australia safe, to keep our borders secure, and to keep our economy strong. I am sure that I was not the only one in the chamber that night who felt a tremendous sense of relief that these objectives had been made the priorities for the coming budget. I believe that, if we do get the support of the parliament-and I urge the Senate to reflect very carefully upon any opposition to any measure in this budget-our country will continue to enjoy those economic benefits that it has enjoyed over the last three terms of the Howard-Anderson government. The budget surplus, which is provided for, is $2.1 billion in 2002-03, with every cent being used to pay back Labor’s debt. Labor’s debt by mid-2003 will have reduced substantially from the $61 billion that it is at present. The debt interest repayments are really quite significant. The interest bill today is $4.75 billion per year less than it was under Labor. That is a very significant saving. It means that those moneys can now be put into other things such as health and education. Australian home buyers are now paying $350 less per month for a $100,000 home mortgage than they were paying when the opposition was last in office. These are not insignificant benefits of good economic management. More importantly, the coalition has created more than 980,000 new jobs since 1996 and unemployment is expected to fall to six per cent by mid-2003. It is expected that over one million jobs will have been created by Christmas this year. What a wonderful occasion it will be when somewhere around this counMonday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3575 try some lucky person becomes the one-millionth beneficiary of the economic policies of this government-that might be an interesting photo opportunity. Let me turn to some of the sector by sector features that I mentioned earlier. The first is strengthening Australia’s defence. In my electorate I have three defence facilities: one Navy and two Army. They are very significant defence facilities. The war against terrorism, which is currently being continued by our government in coalition with 35 other countries around the world, will cost an extra half a billion dollars, but I warmly commend the government for that effort. We must do all we can to ensure that innocent people, not just in our country but in all other countries around the world, can enjoy their peace and not be terrorised by people who have no regard for their rights. Therefore, the increase in defence spending of $1.3 billion in 2002-03, bringing the total defence spending to $14.1 billion, is welcome. The establishment of a permanent incident response regiment with capacity to respond to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive incidents is an important step. Major projects, too, have not been neglected. The government will continue funding for major projects such as acquiring armed reconnaissance helicopters and upgrading weapons on the ANZAC frigates. I have had the pleasure as an officer in the Defence Reserves of actually being deployed on one of those frigates. I warmly commend those measures in the budget. The establishment of a permanent special forces tactical assault group on Australia’s east coast to support the existing one on the west coast is highly commendable. As earlier speakers have said today, the government’s commitment to strengthening Australia’s defence forces and fighting in the war against terrorism, including bringing important legislation before this parliament, must be given the support not just of the Australian people but of every responsible member of this parliament. Protecting Australia’s borders is another aspect of the budget which I wish to briefly mention. Over the next five years, $1.3 billion will be spent to improve aviation security, to assist in identifying possible security threats and to increase Australia’s capacity to respond to security incidents. The offshore processing of illegal arrivals is an important measure in that regard, and it is obviously working. Border protection is also significant, and the Coastwatch patrolling activities of our northern borders must continue to be addressed. All of these are in the provision for protecting Australia’s borders. Over the next four years, $75 million will be spent for a regional cooperation agreement to fight people-smuggling and unauthorised migration in transit countries. It was pleasing to hear today that the leadership of East Timor is committed to supporting our government in this program. A strong border protection policy, maintaining the integrity of our immigration programs, is in the interests of the Australian people as a whole, of the region and of responsible migration policies around the world. Health is another sector which is of real significance. Fighting drug abuse is of particular interest and concern in my electorate. In an area bordering Kings Cross, residents often experience problems associated with the drug trade. I am therefore pleased that the budget is funding a program for the introduction of retractable needle and syringe technology in Australia and that overall $65 million will be spent on fighting drug abuse. In the area of arthritis, which is important for a number of people in my area, $11.5 million over four years to improve diagnosis, treatment and care will be appropriated. In the area of palliative care, $55 million over four years to target education and training for GPs, more efficient backup and coordination between service providers, support for family and friends and increased aware3576 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 ness for the wider community is another important health provision which I would seek to emphasise. In the area of aged care and veterans, there is a tremendous interest in my electorate in the provisions in the budget. The $654 million over four years to provide quality care for older Australians is an important measure. In particular, I would mention the 6,000 community aged care packages that will assist older Australians to continue living in their own homes. This is a measure which is proving most popular. As for aged care nurses, our aged care homes will receive increased subsidies to help them attract and retain more nurses, and facilities will be upgraded in some small aged care homes. These measures in the area of aged care are of particular importance. As the Treasurer pointed out in the Intergenerational Report, we have to ensure that we responsibly address the challenges we face into the future in dealing with an ageing population. Today 2.4 million Australians are over 65; in 20 years time, it is estimated that there will be 4.2 million. We cannot ignore those demographic changes. Another area which I would seek to address is the area of job seekers and training. In July 2003, the government will renew contracts for the most effective providers and put others out to tender. An important measure which resonates in my electorate is the announcement of 8,500 additional places each year to give job seekers greater opportunities to participate in the Work for the Dole program. For mature age workers, 11,500 places for computer skills training at a cost of $23 million over four years is a highly commendable measure. We ought not to consider that, simply because someone has reached the age of 55-or even younger these days-they are no longer able to adapt, no longer able to be trained and no longer able to be of significance in the work force. I take the opposite view; I take the view that, with measures such as these, we can exploit the tremendous experience and greater skills of our older people. In the area of education, I am particularly proud of the measures in relation to numeracy and literacy. An increase of $35.7 million over three years for programs in our schools has been announced. Just the other day it was my pleasure to attend Bronte Public School with the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, for the launch of that national program. It was an exciting day. The kids at that school and the teachers-who have not always found reason to agree with every aspect of federal policy-were very excited about the direction of the education program. Expenditure of $82.4 million over three years to expand quality teacher programs has also been announced. A massive 52 per cent increase in general funding for government schools since 1996 is part of the package. Finally, in the education area, let me mention $60 million for research into the critical new economy areas of information technology and biotechnology. Finally in the sector-by-sector analysis of measures which are of relevance to my electorate, can I mention the environment. Increased environmental funding of over $1.8 billion will be spent to protect Australia’s environment-$198 million more than in 2001-02. Another $100.7 million will be allocated to tackle salinity and improve water quality measures as part of the national plan. In addition, $103.57 million will be allocated to improve the condition of Australia’s coasts and waterways. Let me now turn to some of the measures that directly affect my electorate. I was particularly pleased that the government has, through the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, allocated more than $10 million to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. As the former chair Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3577 of the Australian Heritage Commission, I played a role in the establishment of that trust, which will establish lands for the permanent and public benefit of the people of Sydney and Australia. The trust has a vital role in managing Commonwealth-owned heritage assets around our harbour, including two in my seat: the Macquarie light station and the former marine biological research station at Watsons Bay. Funding will assist the trust to maintain these properties and continue to develop a management plan for the sites. I am also pleased that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has confirmed that the coalition’s election commitment to provide capital assistance to the Sydney Jewish Museum will be honoured during the coming financial year: $250,000 will be provided to help upgrade access to the museum for people with disabilities. This will be a major boost to its fundraising drive to complete what are vital works for an institution which is, in many respects, the heart of Sydney’s Jewish community. The museum’s educational programs, particularly those associated with the Holocaust, rely on the wonderful support of the magnificent Holocaust survivors who every day toil in that museum to ensure that their story is so poignantly told. As the years go by, the absence of lifts and ramps in the museum is having a serious impact on their ability to get about the museum. This project will particularly help those volunteers, but also ensure that the museum is more accessible for members of the general public. I am proud to support this budget. I am pleased to have the opportunity to support it and, along with my colleagues tonight, I commend it to the House. want to concentrate on a couple of broad areas, the first being the budget and its implications on government direction and the other being where the government is heading in terms of its own policy direction and the relationship it has to the budget. If there is one clear thing that we can all gather from the budget, it is that it was a complete failure. The Costello-Howard budget-proclaimed by the Treasurer himself in his own handouts and materials to be the sixth consecutive budget surplus-was actually a deficit. The Treasurer got it wrong right from the start. He sneakily tried to correct this on his own web site when the fact became common knowledge, but he was caught out. This budget is about taking from the poor and giving to the rich. That sounds like a cliche except that this time the rich are actually the government. This budget is about cutting spending to those least able to afford it. It is about cutting spending to people on disability support pensions and about cutting spending in pharmaceutical benefits. At the end of the day, this budget is about paying for the war on terror-paying for defence-by taking money away from those in the community that are least able to afford it. These cuts are targeted at the most vulnerable in our community, and these are the people whom the government should be looking after, rather than cutting back on what they get in the budget and giving it to another area. One area which I have just mentioned that did get a significant budget increase is defence. Everybody on the Labor side supports the idea that we should have extra spending on defence, but when you have extra spending in a particular area, it needs to be balanced in terms of where you get that money from. There is no objection to spending extra money on defence, but it should not be taken from people on pensions, low incomes or disability support pensions. Do not take it from those who can least afford to pay for the increases.",169,Representatives Main Committee
267,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (9.35 P.m.),"In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03, I3578 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 On the one hand it is good to see the government provide extra spending for defence and to promote what I would call ‘the government’s war on terrorism’. That is what the government is trying to do: promote its own private war on terrorism, rather than bringing all the people together with it. What we know and see in the community is that people are not ignorant or stupid. They understand what is going on. I heard one of the government members saying that he did a bit of a straw poll in his electorate and spoke to his constituents. I think we all did something similar. I went out and asked people what their concerns were about the budget. A fairly resounding response came back in my electorate that they were concerned about budget cuts. They were concerned about what would happen with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, they were concerned about people on pensions and low incomes and they were concerned about people on disability pensions that would have their funding cut. Of course, those on disability pensions that are receiving cuts are sometimes the most in need, particularly people with intellectual disabilities. They are now out in the cold, left to fend for themselves. It is the old catch cry, the ‘catch and kill your own’ approach from government. The government has wavered a bit. It got a bit shaky in the knees. It suddenly realised this might be a really bad idea and that it had not quite anticipated that the community would see what it was trying to do. There was a bit of outrage and a bit of feigned indignation from the minister, who thought the government might need to get a different approach on this and started looking at ways to make it less harsh. That is what it is: harsh. Less harsh is what the government thought it might make it. The changes the government may put forward are insignificant. They are not going to make any difference to those that need to have some positive outcomes from the budget. This is where the good news stops, believe it or not, and where the bad news really begins. Labor has said that in the Senate we will steadfastly oppose changes to DSP. We will get support from the minor parties to do this. So what does the government do? What is the government’s response to a democratically elected Senate that in the end has the majority over the government if it chooses to exercise it? The government blackmails the Senate. Call it budget blackmail or whatever you like; at the end of the day that is what it is. The government has made it clear that, if we do not pass the harsh measures and the cutting back of disability support pensions to those most in need, the government will start defunding disability to the tune of $100 million per annum. That is the choice we get. That is the alternative. It is a case of ‘damned if you do and damned if you don’t’. But there is one thing for sure: this government will take away from those least able to afford it. It will attack the weak and it will give to the wealthy and the rich-in this case, the government. It just gives it back to itself so it can pass it on to other areas. BeforeI talk about a range of other measures in the budget, I want to remind people of the link between the way the government operates-the way it treats people in the budget, the way it is treating disabilities and the way it deals with the business of government-and the way it ran the last election campaign. The last election campaign, without any doubt, was a single issue campaign. It was about war, terrorism, border control, border protection-wrap it up any way you like; that is what it was about. We all genuinely have some fears about some things that might take place, but when a government deliberately exploits the fears in the community-the deepest, lowest common denominator-this is when it has lost its way. The Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3579 government set out in the last election to deal with one issue only-to scare a whole country into concentrating on the one issue of border protection. The media had its own hand in this; the media did play a huge role. After the election it was said that something like 80 per cent of front pages during the whole 33 days of the election campaign were in relation to September 11, boats, boat people or something of that nature. There was very little to do with the election campaign. This highlights the length the government will go to win an election. You might think that everything is fair in love, war and elections, and in a sense it is. But the government has taken that election win, transposed it to the budget and said, ‘This gives us carte blanche, open slather, in terms of big spending in certain areas.’ There is some need, but let us get the need in perspective and let us get the need from the right areas. Let us not take money from people with disabilities. Why attack that group? Why attack people on disability support pensions? Why change the work test? Why attack those in the community least able to afford it? Why make it harder for people who need access to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and make them pay the extra dollar? Why make families pay that extra bit of money? It is quite simple: this government simply does not care. The easiest people to hit are often the people with the least ability to lobby, the people with the least ability to come back to the government. This government thinks it has got away with it. The government have taken some unbelievable opportunism at the time of September 11 and transposed it not only to their campaign but now into what they do in government and what they do in the budget. It is all just flowing through. If you look really closely, there is evidence everywhere you look, every day. I turn my mind quickly to a couple of weeks ago when Minister Brendan ‘Chopper Read’ Nelson was so caught up in trying to embarrass the Queensland state Labor government that he did not realise how much promotion, how much free media, he was giving to the very subject that he was denouncing. Smart move by Minister Brendan ‘Chopper Read’ Nelson! He was waving photocopiescorrect title. front of the media cameras, the front cover of the book he was denouncing. So upset was he about the impact this would have on our young kids that he was prepared to flaunt it around in front of all the media cameras, he was prepared to put it on his web site and he was prepared to keep promoting that book with that offensive front cover! At the end of the day, I think he actually likes it. It is as simple as that. What else could it be? We have a pretty smart minister! In fact, he was a little embarrassed, because he got up there attacking the Queensland state Labor government about some sort of approval of this for high schools, and he forgot that it was the federal government and federal funds that actually paid for the movie Chopper to be put together in the first place. It was funded by the federal government. How embarrassing it was to see the minister squirm all red-faced, with the front of the book cover in his hand. What a genius! He just kept coming back for more, because that is the genius he is! He is a great genius and we should all applaud him for his efforts! Then you have your fully true, tried and tested one, the ‘Big A’, one of my favourites: Minister Abbott. He is like a robot with a short circuit. He is unable to feel; he cannot see; he cannot integrate with the human race. This is a man on a mission. His mission, if he accepts it,",173,Representatives Main Committee

Forget about making money! What business really wants is more unfair dismissal laws! If the minister just keeps telling them that, perhaps one day some of them will actually be convinced. As I said, his mission, if he accepts it, is to completely destroy the union movement, kill off the Labor Party and in his spare time convince employers that they do not really want to make money. This is how the minister comes into the House every day. People refer to him as the attack dog. He is like an attack dog. It is a bit like those banned breeds across Australia-those dangerous breeds. He is one that needs to be muzzled. Through careful breeding over many generations, the minister’s brain-through that generational thing-was completely shrunk down to the size of a pea so that all he needs to do is control his breathing and his attack functions in the House. Mrs GashMr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I do believe the member is slighting the minister in tones that should not be allowed for parliamentary colleagues. parison to be made here. It is an analogy, a way of projecting. You have got to place yourself in this and think of the best way you could describe the minister. You could have a look at dangerous breeds, and this guy is just like one of those dangerous breeds. He should be kept away from all decent pet owners. Those people are decent people and they would not have a bar of it. We have the only minister, I would say, in history-apart, probably, from Minister Reith when he was a minister-that works very hard day in, day out to prolong industrial disputes. He actually attempts to convince employers and workers that they should not negotiate, that they should not resolve their disputes, that they should continue to be in dispute because that would be good-for whom, I am not sure, but probably for the minister, no-one else. So even after the dispute is resolved, as we saw today in question time, what does the minister do? He still tries to create a dispute out of one that has been resolved. This is a minister that has lost his mind. How can you bring up in the parliament today an issue that has been resolved? The workers are happy; BHP is happy; everyone has gone back to work. They have resolved their own issues through negotiation, and that is what it is about. But, no, the minister is not happy. The minister insists on continuing to try to cause disputation, because that is what the minister wants to do. It is all about the politics; it has nothing to do with the end result. It is all to do with the way this government behaves. Luckily for the majority of workers and for the majority of decent employers out there, they know there is a better way to get on with business. They actually want to get on with business to make money. But today I have to hand the prize to Minister Downer, today’s living proof that old habits die hard. I am sure a lot of us remember those famous words he uttered when he said ‘the things that batter’ in relation to domestic violence. Today he did it again. I might bring up a question that was raised by the shadow minister for foreign affairs when he asked the minister a very simple question about where he stood on something. His answer, of course, was the famous John Moore defence-that is, ‘Everybody knows very well what my view on that is, which is not much at all.’",175,Representatives Main Committee

They are really just about one thing: the government winning an election and having a budget that provides a smokescreen for the next election, because the next election is already being played out now. It is all about border protection-and we already know where it is at. Let us fight those issues. Let us get them on the table and let us be fair dinkum about the next election. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin) (9.48 p.m.)-The Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 before this chamber presents the parliament with a unique opportunity to safeguard the future of this country and our society by preserving our prosperity and our freedoms into the future. Edmund Burke observed over two centuries ago in the classic critique of the French Revolution that society is a partnership not only between those who are living but also between those who are living, those who are dead and those who are yet to be born. So we have an obligation to craft our economic and governmental arrangements today with an eye to tomorrow and the memory of yesterday. These bills and this budget do just that. The budget brought before this parliament by the Treasurer is a sturdy fiscal platform for Australia’s future development. By commissioning the Intergenerational Report, the government has set in train reforms that will safeguard our nation’s future. One of the keys to those reforms is Australia’s superannuation system, and I will give credit where credit is due: there is no doubt that it is to the credit of the Australian Labor Party that it did seek to make selfprovision through superannuation a part of Australian life. This has helped to insulate Australia from the future calamities that face nationalised pension systems in Western Europe, for example, and to turn around the wishful idea that taxation is a form of savings. Nonetheless, it is also true that Labor could never shake the union monkey from its back: it could not see superannuation except from the perspective of increased union power, influence and financial clout, and our nation’s retirement income strategy is the poorer for that failing. By contrast this government, through this budget, recognises that superannuation offers the best way for Australians to secure both their own personal retirement income and the financial health of the nation. This budget will ensure that from 1 July 2002 the rebate for personal contributions will be replaced by a co-contribution. The government will contribute up to $1,000 a year towards the superannuation savings of eligible low income earners where they make personal undeducted contributions to those savings. Contributions can continue to be made by working people aged between 70 and 75. The superannuation guarantee contributions will be fairer for small business employers. The tax rate on excessive eligible termination payments will be reduced. The fully deductible amount for superannuation contributions by the self-employed will be increased from $3,000 to $5,000 from 1 July next year. Members of accumulation funds will be able to split future contributions with their spouse. Families will be allowed to make superannuation contributions on behalf of a child, and the superannuation surcharge rate has been reduced. The budget also reaffirms the government’s commitment to choice and portability in superannuation, and it makes provision for an education campaign in that regard by the Australian Taxation Office. I think the introduction of the children’s superannuation accounts is of particular interest, given the importance of fostering a lifetime savings culture in our society. This particular measure was a very popular election commitment on the part of the coalition and will ensure that from 1 July family members, including parents and grandparents and other relations, and 3582 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 friends can make contributions on behalf of a child. Not only will that child be better able to achieve financial self-reliance in the future; they will, from the very outset, be encouraged to make their own contributions once they enter the work force. There will be a contribution limit of $3,000 per child per three-year period, and this limit is flexible enough to accommodate the needs of a contributing family without compromising the integrity of the measure. Of equal importance is the reduction in the rate of the superannuation surcharge. It is no secret that many Liberal members of parliament have had reservations about the surcharge. On a personal level, I entered this parliament some years after the surcharge’s introduction and was not a fan of it either inside or outside this place. But like many others, I recognise the valid intentions of the surcharge in addressing some tax and budget issues. Nevertheless, I welcome wholeheartedly this particular budget initiative not simply because it is an effective tax cut, an initiative that ought to be welcomed by all members of this chamber, but because it addresses the concerns of many of my constituents about this particular surcharge. Over the past 3½ years I have had numerous representations from professionals, the self-employed and many others calling for the amelioration of the effects of the surcharge, so those Australians are most pleased that from 1 July this year the surcharge rate will be reduced by one-tenth and that similar reductions will be made over the following two income years. As such, the maximum surcharge rate will be 13.5 per cent in 2002-03, 12 per cent in 2003-04 and 10.5 per cent in 2004-05 and succeeding years. The total tax relief generated by these reductions will be $50 million in 2003-04, $120 million in 2004-05 and $200 million in 2005-06. So, combined with other budgetary initiatives, this reduction in the surcharge will encourage savings and self-provision in retirement to the benefit of Australian taxpayers and the ultimate benefit of Australia as a whole. The federal government has also made it clear that it will review the surcharge arrangements after three years so as to ascertain whether any further changes will be required. Given the evidence available to date and the present circumstances of our economy, I would urge the Commonwealth to utilise that future opportunity to abolish the surcharge in its entirety. Retirement incomes policy, including superannuation, pension reform and fiscal policy more generally, is of particular interest to the people in my electorate of Curtin. The western suburbs of Perth are home to more older people than anywhere else in the state of Western Australia. In fact, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics census figures show that over 18,000 residents of Curtin-that is, about 15 per cent of the total population-are aged over 65, making my electorate one of the oldest in terms of the proportion of people aged over 65 years in Australia. Incidentally, in my electorate over one in four people are aged 55 or older. That is around 25 per cent. Not surprisingly, the findings of the Intergenerational Report released with the budget papers have been of particular interest in Curtin. That report has found that, without a change in policy direction, the social and demographic forces shaping our nation will be likely to produce a structural deficit of around five per cent of GDP within 40 years, equivalent in today’s prices to about $87 billion annually. Australia’s population will age such that the number of people aged over 65 years will double and the number aged over 85 will quadruple. Almost 25 per cent of all Australians will be 65 or older in the year 2042. It will accelerate government spending on health services and aged care. By 2042, 15c in every single dollar earned in Australia could be spent on welfare and Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3583 health-an additional $90 billion annual burden on taxpayers. It will also increase the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to Australia fivefold and double aged care costs. The report is by no means a tale of doom and gloom. The report does find that Australia is very well placed to take care of its retired citizens by virtue of our means tested age pension system and our maturing superannuation system. While 6.3 million more Australians will be of age pension age in the year 2042, spending on age pensions is likely to grow much more slowly here than in other developed societies. Further, the report’s findings take the form of challenges not problems. Armed with this comprehensive analysis, we have the opportunity to re-fashion the future. We have the opportunity to take the steps in 2002 that will bear fruit in 2042 or before-steps like the reform of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the disability support pension. For example, taxpayer support of the disability support pension has increased dramatically in recent years and is likely to increase in the future. Twenty years ago, only 229,000 Australians received a disability benefit. Today more than 624,000 receive the disability support pension. In the last 12 years, the number of recipients has doubled. Today over one in nine Australians aged between 50 and 64 is, according to our welfare system, disabled. By taking measured and reasonable steps to address these issues today, we are safeguarding the benefits to Australians of the disability support pension system and other entitlements such as the PBS. Were such entitlement systems to collapse under the weight of their extraordinary costs, either in 40 years time or before, the ultimate losers would be those who rely on those systems. Those who would threaten such necessary reforms today will most certainly be called to account in the future. The Intergenerational Report also affords us as parliamentarians the opportunity to discuss the social and demographic forces acting upon our national future. An issue often spoken about by Peter McDonald of the ANU is the fertility rate for Australian women. The decline in the number of children being born in Australia is very real, and the rate will drop to less than 1.6 births per woman. Other important social phenomena include the increasing casualisation of employment-a shift driven by the needs of employees first and foremost-and the growing instance of people under the age of 55 living without a partner. Further, young adults are staying at home longer. Amongst the 20-somethings, the proportion is over 30 per cent. Likewise, a lone parent now heads over 15 per cent of those households with young children. This government will continue to develop public policy to meet these changing social needs precisely because it is a Liberal government, and liberalism has served, does serve and will continue to serve the needs of people rather than ideology. Liberalism is about the sovereignty of the individual person, not about class or race. It is about making every man and woman the pilot of their own lives. It is for that reason that I would counsel parliamentarians to do more to reduce the burden of taxation on Australian families, businesses and employees. This government has made great strides in lessening that burden. It would have done even more had the opposition allowed for the implementation of the complete economic program endorsed by the Australian people at the 1998 federal election. But there is always more to do. Our economic future is bright, unemployment is low and we continue to lead the way in growth globally. To safeguard the extraordinary development and success of the past six years, we should turn once again to the engine of income tax reduction, particularly to the reduction in the top marginal tax rate. We can be pleased that our nation faces a lower tax burden than the OECD average: about 30 per cent compared to 37 per cent of GDP. In Western Europe, it is almost 50 per cent. But our regional partners face even lower levels of taxa3584 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 tion, averaging around 25 per cent of GDP, and that is where our competition lies. The increasing incongruity of the top marginal tax rate on income will drive away our nation’s best and brightest achievers. Labour may not be yet as mobile as capital but, in a globalised marketplace, it is increasingly picky. BeforeI embark on one of my pet topics-further tax reform-we should do a growth accounting exercise to consider the sources of growth over the next 40 years. The sources of growth will be productivity and labour force growth, which can mean population growth, the labour force participation rate, the unemployment rate and hours worked. All of these will be affected by our level of taxation. But, before we focus on this, we also need to appreciate that future economic growth rates can be improved not only by making our tax rates more competitive but by curbing spending, particularly spending on what is being termed as ‘middle class welfare’. While the key to good growth performance is lower tax rates or a much flatter tax scale, we must also be conscious of increasing government expenditure, particularly on health and medical care for those who can otherwise afford it. The price of growth enhancing tax cuts will be curbing government spending. We should re-examine our public expenditures in the light of the Intergenerational Report and hopefully will find our way clear to continue to ease the burden of taxation that falls upon those who generate the income that supports those expenditures. I commend Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 to the chamber. Peppermint Grove! Ms Julie Bishop-I don’t live in Peppermint Grove. on the other side. Today, statistics from the latest Australian census were revealed to all and sundry, and we saw the warts and all figures of Australian society. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 gives us an opportunity to wax lyrical about where we stand and to give our views on what is happening to our country and what is happening in our electorates. Most people have given a view on society. I am about to have my 61st birthday. My eldest daughter is 25 and my youngest is 23. They are both currently in Prague. The eldest works in London and the other, when not on holidays, works at Target in Melbourne to pay for her Dip. Ed. at Melbourne Uni. Today’s census, as I said, highlighted the warts and all figures of Australian society. We heard about the median age of Australians, the percentage in each age group, the average weekly earnings, the states which had the greatest increases in population and the birthrates. Someone mentioned to me over the phone tonight that there are 30,000 fewer Tasmanians than in the last census. There are a whole lot of things in this census that we can compare with similar things in the last census. We can compare things in my childhood with things in my children’s childhood. In these speeches on the budget measures we keep hearing phrases about security, threats to Australia, what is happening overseas, the Intergenerational Report, retirement income policy, superannuation surcharges and what sort of Australia we are going to have in 30, 40 or 50 years time. Tonight, in the moments that are left to me I would like to give a thumbnail sketch of my electorate. My electorate is basically the same as those of most people, although what the previous speaker says is happening in her electorate bears no relationship to what is happening in any other part of Australia that I know of.",176,Representatives Main Committee

273,Mr Quick,"I mean Peppermint Grove in the sort of Alice in Wonderland view of thoseMonday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3585 I have an electorate that is made up of three regions: huge tracts of broadacre public housing, middle-class Australia, and rural and remote regional parts of Tasmania. Each of those has specific needs. In the census statistics that are out there for everybody to see today, each of those regions can compare and contrast what they have and have not got, see where the deficiencies and needs are and see where resources need to be placed. When we come to these appropriation bills, it is incumbent upon all of us to have a realistic look at what this budget means for each and every one of us. I am a hopeless budgeter-always have been. I have always spent more than I have earned. I have been lucky enough in my few years on this earth to realise that life presents you with a hell of a lot of opportunities and, if you do not grab them with both hands and hang on to them as tightly as you can, you are never going to get another chance to enjoy what is coming along. But a lot of Australians are not in the situation where they can grab these opportunities. Constantly in my electorate office I come across families that are really doing it hard. If you listen to some people in this place, you hear about how wonderful Australia is-a booming economy, wanting for nothing, with average weekly earnings of $X, with things being great. I can tell you that there are lots and lots of families in my electorate that are doing it really tough. You see them on Friday night at the supermarkets just before closing time carefully going through their budgetary strategies to see which bits of the chicken packages, which bits of the roast and which bits of bread are going to be marked down. In this day and age I find it hard to believe that in our Australian society we have families doing it so hard. As I said, my electorate is probably no different from most electorates, apart from some in Sydney or Melbourne where there is money aplenty and you do not really worry about where it is coming from. When you are framing a budget, you need to be mindful of the good times and the bad, and of Australian society in general. Access to excellence in education, medical services, aged care facilities, adequate housing options, relevant child-care facilities, crisis accommodation for families really doing it tough, assistance for veterans and war widowsall these things are in the budget. When you look at the numbers and you listen to ministers espousing the virtues of their departmental strategies, you would think that everything is fine, but once you scratch the surface it is not. You hear of the First Home Owners Scheme, the $7,000. There are young families in my electorate who love this First Home Owners Scheme. This was their one opportunity to grab a house. They went along to the bank and said, ‘Yes, we’ve got the $7,000; we have managed to scrimp and save a few thousand dollars to pay the various bills that you need to pay, for the stamp duty and for the lawyers to do all the bits and pieces.’ Then they find that they cannot really buy the $60,000 house in the broadacre public housing areas that are now being sold by the housing department: they need a 10 per cent deposit because the mortgage insurers will not accept five per cent. If you go up the road to the town of Brighton, where the houses cost $120,000, you need only a five per cent deposit, so why not double your debt? People say, ‘We can get you into the house.’ Things should be different. You should be able to buy the house that you can afford to repay, rather than doubling your debt and putting yourself under further strain. One of the statistics today is the increase in the divorce rate, and I am firmly convinced that the stress of money is one of the key contributors to the rise of the divorce rate since I was a child. We hear lots in this place, as I said, about security threats to Australia. We hear of the wonderful role of the Americans. I have quite a few American cousins. My late Aunt May was an 3586 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 American war bride. My brother married an Irish-American girl from the east coast, and they have four American-Australian kids. I take the mickey out of them and tease them dreadfully about how the Yanks were not in the First World War until it was all over, how it was two years into the Second World War before they came and how they were hopeless in Vietnam. It really worries me that we are focusing on this supposed threat. We put our hand over our heart and, unfortunately, follow George W., and it really worries me. I grew up in the 1940s and early 1950s. As a child I remember being propagandised with stuff that was trotted out every Saturday afternoon in the movie theatres. As some speakers have said in this place, I think we need to focus on the basics. Our communities are not communities. We all have our security doors. We do not know who our neighbours are. We tend to be isolated and fragmented. Yet, when it comes to an outside threat, we are all together, all on side and all supportive. I would like to think that we can become reflective and introverted in the nicest sense, back into the communities that I remember as a child. People say that they are probably the dreams of a baby boomer, but in fact I was born before the baby boomers. Governments do have a responsibility. We as legislators have a responsibility. It is an awesome responsibility. It is incumbent upon us, as people have said in this place, to share the responsibility rather than to nitpick, blame each other and say, for example, ‘Back when interest rates were X-plus ...’ I well remember, when I was putting an addition on my house, how hard it was. Let us stop blaming and start creating. Let us start supporting our communities, supporting the families that shop on Friday nights because that is the only way they can survive, supporting the families that are making their first commitment to a home, supporting kids when they are underachieving at school, supporting sole parent families and supporting widows who are left in large houses, with large front and back yards, who are not coping and who do not want to go into nursing homes. Let us think creatively. We do have that capacity, but wethe Commonwealth government, state governments and local governments-need to work together. I support lots of the measures in this budget. I do not want nitpick and particularise, but we need to really have a vision. I have a vision for my children. I hope that when I leave this place I can spend the next 25 years contributing to that vision. I know my children do. I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03. Main Committee to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 and to outline the significant benefits that flow as a result of this government’s strong fiscal policy and strong management of the economy. This budget is another in the long line of Howard government budgets that have focused on getting the fundamentals right. It is a budget that is built upon the platform of keeping our economy strong, our borders secure and our nation safe. It is a budget that, thanks to the Howard government, has seen Australia continue to move forward, safe from the economic turmoil that has been experienced around the world. This budget, Peter Costello and the Howard government’s seventh budget, is one that will ensure Australia weathers the economic storm. As a result of this government getting the economic fundamentals right, we have succeeded in ensuring the Australian people have not suffered the turmoil that arose as a result of the Asian economic downturn. Australia has also withstood the storm resulting from the attacks on the mainland of the United States on September 11 last year. The Howard gov-",180,Representatives Main Committee
274,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (10.15 P.m.),"It gives me great pleasure to rise this evening in theMonday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3587 ernment is committed to ensuring the fundamentals are right, and it has done this by repaying approximately $62 billion of the Labor Party’s $90 billion black hole. Previous opposition speakers have made comment that we need to be mindful of the good times and the bad. This is a budget that does exactly that: it is not a budget built on short-term economic sunshine, nor is it a budget that offers a knee-jerk reaction to short-term economic decline; it is a budget that is in Australia’s best interests in the long term and it is a budget that, as I have said, has seen Australia weather economic turmoil throughout the world. This week’s Economist magazine noted as part of its economic and financial indicators table that ‘Australia’s GDP rose by 4.2 per cent in the year to the first quarter, by far the biggest increase of any country in our table’. We have seen Australia surge forward with economic growth of 4.2 per cent. Let us compare and contrast that growth with that of other developed countries around the world. Opposition members like to compare Australia with Third World and developing nations, but I will compare apples with apples-I will compare us to those other developed countries around the world. Canada has had economic growth of 2.1 per cent; France, 0.3 per cent; Japan, minus 1.9 per cent; Switzerland, 0.2 per cent; the United Statesthe economic powerhouse of the world-has had economic growth of only 1.5 per cent; and the entire European area has had economic growth over the past year of only 0.1 per cent. We see that Australia is surging ahead. We are surging ahead because this budget, like all previous Howard government budgets, is solidly built on a platform of getting the economic fundamentals right. It is not a budget that seeks to take advantage of political opportunism. It is not a budget that seeks to ensure that we creep our way back into office by only looking after certain sectoral interests; it is a budget for all Australians. It is a budget, as I said, that keeps our economy strong, our borders safe and our nation secure. When you look forward, however, you also see that Australia does not suddenly fall away. This budget will, according to the Economist magazine, continue to hold Australia in very good stead. The Economist poll predict four per cent growth for Australia in 2002. Again, let us compare that with other developed countries: Canada, only 2.9 per cent growth; France, 1.4 per cent growth; Germany, 0.9 per cent growth; Italy, 1.3 per cent; Japan, still languishing at minus 0.8 per cent; and the United States, 2.9 per cent. The same applies in the following year in the Economist forecast for 2003, where Australia is again ranked No. 1 at 3.9 per cent growth. It is very safe for the Australian people to place their faith in the Howard government. We have delivered time and time again, and this budget has once again scored a goal. One of the key government initiatives that was handed down under this budget was the additional $194 million for the war against terrorism. I find it interesting that opposition members refer to a ‘supposed threat’. The member for Franklin, who spoke immediately prior to me, mentioned a so-called supposed threat, about how he had been ‘propagandised’ throughout the sixties. He spoke of how the United States appeared, in his words, ‘to be an abject failure when it came to previous wartime experience’. I am intrigued by this notion of a ‘supposed threat’. Apparently it is only a ‘supposed threat’ that terrorists would seek to murder nearly 50,000 people in the World Trade Centre. They were only successful in murdering 3,000. I find it incredible that it is only a ‘supposed threat’ when now on almost a weekly basis we see attempts by terrorist groups throughout the world-for example, an attempt to place a shoe bomb on board a flight from Europe to the United States. These ‘supposed threats’ seem to me to be anything but ‘supposed’. They seem to me to be very real threats and threats that go to the very heart of democracy and what it means to live in a free country. 3588 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 17 June 2002 If we relent, if we move away from maintaining the defence that we have against these people who would seek to make us live in fear, who would seek to make us question the very lives and freedoms that we have, then we most certainly have lost. I am very proud to be part of a government that is playing its role in protecting the democratic ideals that Australia has embodied for over a century. In addition to the $194 million for the war against terrorism, the Howard government has also provided $1.3 billion to upgrade domestic security over the next five years. This has involved additional spending in terms of aviation security. We have seen the introduction of the air marshal system at a cost of $40.2 million for the financial year 2002-03, rising to $169 million over the next five years. The air marshal program is a very tangible way in which the Australian government is helping Australians to feel safe when they take to the skies. It is also helping the Australian tourism industry to weather the terrorism storm-and I will speak on this further. With regard to domestic security, we also have provided additional funding of $110.9 million for the financial year 2002-03 to assist agencies such as ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority to access additional investigative technology-the kind of technology that will ensure we have success, as we have had in the past, in defeating those who would seek to threaten our democratic way of life. We also have, as a result of an additional $113.7 million of funding, an increased response capacity. This will directly assist Health and Ageing to build and develop a stockpile of biological weapons vaccines and antidotes. It will also mean that we have an incident response regiment and a second counter-terrorism tactical assault group. Again, these are very tangible measures that the Howard government is taking to ensure the Australian people feel safe and secure in our way of life and know that our country will not fall victim-or will certainly have an extremely low chance of falling victim-to the kinds of base terrorist attacks that we have seen in other countries. I can honestly say from my discussions with constituents and from my own perspective, I would never want Australia to become a country that lives in fear like countries such as Israel, the United Kingdom and now the United States. Many Australians would like to believe this will never happen in this country. But it can. The way for us to prevent these attacks is to be vigilant. This budget also provides funding of $1.6 billion for border security. As a result of this funding, we will succeed in maintaining Australia’s borders. This budget provides an increase of $22.3 million for coastal surveillance. It also provides for the construction of a $21 million facility on Christmas Island to ensure that those who would seek to queue-jump, those who would seek to undermine the very equitable nature of our refugee program, will not succeed. These direct measures will ensure the Australian people can continue to offer all people around the world safety and harbour on an ongoing basis in an equitable way. We will not allow those who seek to bypass the integrity of our system to go through other countries such as Indonesia and then jump on board a boat and come to Australia. I will turn now to some very direct ways this budget will benefit the people of the Gold Coast and in the electorate of Moncrieff. This budget goes to the core of assisting a region like the Gold Coast, principally through increased spending being provided to the tourism industry. It is fair to say the Howard government and the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, the Hon. Joe Hockey, are providing a direct impetus for the tourism industry and safeguarding the future of the industry in trying times. Tourism benefits to a significant extent Monday, 17 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3589 as a result of some $50 million additional spending. Key initiatives such as $24 million of additional funding for the Australian Tourist Commission, an additional $8 million for the See Australia program and an additional $8 million for the regional tourism program are of direct benefit. Fundamentally, however, tourism benefits because Australia will once again be regarded as a safe destination. One of the key results of the attacks on the mainland United States was a loss of confidence among tourists. The Australian tourism industry, an industry that accounts for some 30 per cent of my local economy on the Gold Coast, suffered as a result of this downturn in the willingness of people to travel abroad. Now, because we have secured our country and secured our borders, people feel safe travelling to the Gold Coast. And safety is one of the principal drivers of a healthy and vibrant tourism industry. In addition to assisting the tourism industry, the Howard government’s budget extended the PELS to Bond University students. Bond University, Australia’s most successful private university, is based on the Gold Coast. Those opposite-not all those opposite, but certainly some-are opposed to the very notion of private tertiary funding. Little wonder, then, that Bond University would never stand a chance of succeeding as a private tertiary education model if those opposite were in government. In contrast, this government has looked after and directly assisted institutions such as Bond University through the extension of the PELS to postgraduate students. Likewise, additional funding has been provided for the Gold Coast film industry and for the film industry broadly. The Gold Coast film industry is a fledgling industry that really benefits as a result of this government’s film industry package. Although not announced as part of this budget, it is one of several measures the Howard government introduced. Since its introduction, the Gold Coast has attracted big budget feature productions. The direct benefit of these movies is a significant increase in employment for those who work directly on the film set and indirectly in areas such as special effects production and post production. In the time remaining, I urge all members to consider the benefits of this budget. I would also make some brief comments on those opposition members who seek to reject this government’s initiatives in the Senate. I cannot help but think that the opposition to changes to eligibility for the disability support pension and the increase in the copayment under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme reek of political opportunism. It is absurd that those opposite say this government is being mean and tricky because we seek to decrease the number of hours for those on disability support pensions from 30 hours to 15 hours. How can the opposition rationally argue that 30 hours is the acceptable level to set the threshold? At present if you are capable of working 31 hours, that is bad luck. If you are capable of working 29 hours, good on you, you are eligible for the disability support pension. We have now lowered the threshold to 15 hours, and all of a sudden the arbitrariness of the threshold does not mean anything anymore. The opposition attempts to portray this government as being mean and tricky. I urge support for this budget. Debate adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 10.30 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Media: Cross-media Ownership Rules (Question No. 3) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a presentation by the Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA), Professor David Flint, launching the ABA research report Sources of News and Current Affairs, 3 May 2001 and titled “How news is made in Australia” in which Prof Flint called for the relaxation of Australia’s cross media ownership laws. (2) Has his attention also been drawn to Prof Flint’s conclusion that the greatest influence on the media is not the media owners but the journalists, themselves, who are the most influential factor in the making of news; if so, does he concur with this view. (3) Do Australia’s cross media ownership laws need to be changed along the lines Prof Flint has suggested; if so, why. (1) and (2) I understand Professor Flint indicated that he was providing a personal viewpoint and was not speaking in his capacity as Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Authority. (3) On 21 March 2002, the government introduced the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002. The Bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the Act) to empower the Australian Broadcasting Authority to grant ‘exemption certificates’ to applicants seeking to acquire media organisations that would otherwise represent a breach of the cross-media rules. Exemptions will be subject to applicants meeting requirements to maintain separate editorial decision-making responsibilities. Regional broadcasters subject to an exemption certificate will be required to meet prescribed minimum levels of locally relevant news and information services, or maintain existing levels where those are higher. The Bill repeals the media-specific foreign ownership provisions in the Act which apply to both free-to-air and pay television. The government has also committed to discontinuing newspaper specific foreign ownership limits within its foreign investment policy. The government’s objectives are to maximise competition while protecting diversity of opinion in the marketplace. Media: Cross-media Ownership Rules (Question No. 11) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) Is he aware that (a) News Limited is an Australian subsidiary of News Corporation owned and controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch, (b) News Limited has interests in more than 100 national, regional and suburban newspapers throughout Australia, (c) in terms of its share of circulation within Australia, News Limited has approximately two thirds of the capital city and national newspaper market; three quarters of the Sunday newspaper market, almost fifty percent of the suburban newspaper market and almost one quarter of the regional newspaper market, (d) News Limited has a quarter stake in Foxtel’s pay television and News Interactive online and (e) News Limited has additional media interests in AAP Information Services. (2) Is he also aware that (a) Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) is an Australian media company which is chaired by Mr James Packer and which owns and controls the Nine Television Network and the magazine publisher Australian Consolidated Press, (b) the largest shareholder in PBL is Mr Kerry Packer, (c) PBL owns and controls three metropolitan and one regional television licences giving it a reach of more than half of the potential audience, (d) in terms of pay television, PBL has a quarter interest in Foxtel and a third interest in Sky News, (e) PBL publishes more than 65 magazines and its share of the circulation of the top thirty Australian magazines is approximately 40% and (f) PBL has a joint on-line operation known as ninemsn.",182,Representatives Main Committee
275,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Do Australia’s cross-media laws prohibit a person from owning and controlling newspapers, television stations and radio stations in the one licence area. (4) In light of numerous media reports since the last federal election, will the Government proceed with changes to Australia’s cross-media ownership laws to permit a person to own and control newspapers and television stations or radio stations, or both, in the one licence area; if so, why. (5) Can he guarantee that such changes will not lead to a further concentration of media-ownership in Australia; if so, how; if not, why not. (1) & (2) I am aware that both News Limited and Publishing and Broadcasting Limited have interests in a range of Australian media outlets. (3) Yes. (4) & (5) The government supports reform of Australia’s media ownership laws. Without reform, the government believes that the current media ownership laws will consign the Australian media sector to an outdated structure, little or no capacity for new players, an absence of further competition, and an inability to respond to a rapidly evolving and converging international media environment. The government introduced legislation on 21 March 2002 to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the Act) to allow exemptions to be granted to the cross-media rules if undertakings are given that companies will maintain existing levels of locally produced news and current affairs in respect of radio and television and that separate and distinct editorial processes are put in place. The government’s objectives are to maximise competition while protecting diversity of opinion in the market place. Suicide (Question No. 69) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to an advertorial titled “Self-Deliverance and Plastic Bags: Proven effective! Introducing the customised ‘EXIT BAG’”. (2) Is the product being marketed in Australia; if so, for how long has the Minister been aware of the marketing of this product. (3) Is the product being marketed by direct mail, through franchises or some other means; if so, what are the details of this medium. (4) Does the product facilitate suicide or euthanasia; if not, why not. (5) Does the Government have a policy on the sale of this product in Australia; if so, what are the details. (6) Will the Minister ensure that, if the product is found to facilitate suicide or euthanasia, it be removed from sale in Australia; if not, why not. the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) I have no knowledge of the product being marketed in Australia. However, if Mr Murphy has such evidence, he should forward it to the Minister as soon as possible. (3) I have no knowledge of this occurring. (4) The product describes a method of taking one’s own life. Such information has previously been published by other organisations associated with euthanasia. (5) The question as to whether the Commonwealth should take action to prohibit the importation or sale of this product in Australia has been referred to the National Advisory Council of Suicide Prevention (NACSP) for expert advice.",186,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice

Aviation: Air Safety and Cabin Air Quality (Question No. 79) 13 March 2002: Has the Civil Aviation Safety Authority reassessed its requirement for monitoring the operations and cabin and cockpit air quality of the BAe 146 aircraft operating in Australia since October 2000; if so, what reassessment has been made and have any practices changed as a result of that reassessment; if so what practice or practices have changed. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority issued an Airworthiness Directive, effective 3 April 2001, which requires all operators to undertake inspections of oil contamination at intervals not to exceed 500 flights. In October 2000 the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee tabled its report on Air Safety and Cabin Air Quality in the BAe 146 Aircraft in Parliament with eight recommendations. The issues raised have been addressed in the Government response to the Committee’s report. Action to table the Government’s final response will be progressed as quickly as possible. A final consolidated response has recently been sent to the Prime Minister seeking agreement to tabling at the earliest possible opportunity. Final clearance and tabling of the Government’s response was delayed as a result of the Federal election and to allow for the consideration of recently completed international studies. Accordingly, the response has been updated to ensure it represents a satisfactory consideration of the Senate Committee’s recommendations. Rail: Alice Springs to Darwin Railway (Question No. 104) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) In answers given during Senate Estimates (Senate Committee Hansard, 19 February 2001, page RR&T 71) concerning his Departments assessment of the viability of a proposed Parkes international freight airport, was it stated that his Department had been lobbied over a number of years and could not see any economic viability in the proposal and that a due diligence process had been followed. (2) If so, how can he justify the total lack of any economic assessment of the viability of the Alice Springs to Darwin rail project before committing expenditure by his Department, as confirmed in the answer to question No. 2036 (Hansard, 7 December 2000, page 23867), yet conduct a due diligence process and an assessment of the economic viability of a far smaller project, the Parkes international freight airport. (1) & (2) As I have indicated previously there have been a number of economic assessments conducted into the Alice Springs to Darwin railway project. Completion of the line will provide the final link between mainland capital cities on the interstate rail network, an objective that has been targeted for over 100 years. The line is also expected to enhance the importance of the port of Darwin which is well placed for access to Asian markets. Importantly, the construction and operation phases of the railway will also create significant employment, particularly in regional Australia.",187,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice

(2) What steps is he taking to ensure aged care operators bring these beds on-line. (3) When will these beds be brought on-line. (4) What action will he take if formally allocated aged care beds remain non-operational on 1 January 2004. (1) The Aged Care Act 1997 (the Act) provides that aged care providers have a period of two years to bring a bed on-line. As at 31 December 2001, there were 2,816 beds outstanding beyond two years. (2) Provisional Allocations are subject to conditions under the Act. These conditions have recently been strengthened and now require providers to report quarterly on progress towards meeting milestones and bringing places into operation. I have asked the Department to review all provisional allocations made prior to the 2000 Aged Care Approvals Round. The review will determine what action is appropriate for each provisional allocation under the legislation and guidelines. This could involve continuing to closely monitor the provisional allocation, seeking surrender of the provisional allocation by the approved provider, varying the provisional allocation or revoking the allocation. (3) Under the Act, all aged care providers have two years to bring the beds on-line. All holders of provisional allocations have to meet this limit unless the Department agrees there are extenuating circumstances as defined in the Act. (4) The legislation states at Section 15-4 that the Secretary may vary or revoke a provisional allocation if the Secretary is satisfied that a condition to which the provisional allocation is subject has not been met. Press Gallery: Pecuniary Interests (Question No. 229) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 14 March 2002: Further to the answer of the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information and the Arts to question No. 52, will he introduce legislation to require members of the Canberra Media Gallery to complete a register of pecuniary interests to be held by the Clerk of the House of Representatives; if not, why not. This issue was considered by the Committee of Inquiry Concerning Public Duty and Private Interest (the Bowen Committee) in 1979. The Committee rejected any proposal to impose a requirement for disclosure of interests or any other form of regulation upon political journalists, noting that such a requirement “would be seen as an attempt to blunt the teeth of criticism.” The Committee recommended that no form of government control be introduced to regulate conflicts of interest involving the media, and concurred with the view that “self regulation was to be preferred to government intervention”. I am advised that this approach was endorsed by the Hawke government in 1983 and, consistent with the Committee’s view, the then government indicated that the issue would be best considered by the members of the media gallery themselves and relevant organisations. The Statement of Principles issued by the Australian Press Council in October 1996 includes guidance for members on the disclosure of any commercial or other interest by publications which might be construed as influencing the publication’s presentation of news or opinion. The government has no plans to introduce legislation to replace current arrangements.

(12) How many Australian ships are currently registered to carry cargo. (13) How many Australian ships were registered to carry cargo in each year since 1996. (14) Has there been an increase in the amount of permits issued to foreign ships wishing to carry cargo, if so, has this led to a decline in the number of Australian ships in recent years. (1) Yes. The vessel has been sold to another CSL subsidiary located overseas. (2) and (3) The maritime unions and CSL have agreed on how the CSL Yarra will operate in the future and the employment of its current crew. (4) Licences to engage in the Australian coasting trade are not restricted to Australian flagged and crewed vessels, and are issued, pursuant to subsection 288 of the Navigation Act 1912. This is subject to conditions that: 1. seafarers employed on the ship are paid wages at the current rates ruling in Australia for seamen employed in that part of the coasting trade; and 2. if applicable, the crew has access to the passengers’ library. These conditions do not apply to ships with permits that may be issued to carry some coastal cargoes where licensed ships are not available. Foreign ships that are not engaging in Australia’s coasting trades are not part of Australia’s domestic economy and should not have to pay Australian levels of wages. A foreign ship holding a coasting trade permit is deemed not to be engaging in the coasting trade when carrying cargo or passengers to, from or between the ports specified in the permit. These arrangements, as set out in the Navigation Act 1912, are of very long standing. (5) The Australian Bureau of Statistics show there were 14 000 people employed in the “Water Transport” industry (defined as international sea transport, coastal water transport and inland water transport) at 31 August 2001. The Australian Bureau of Statistics does not publish a further breakup of Water Transport industry employees, to show specifically the number of sailors employed in the Australian shipping industry. (6) Australian Bureau of Statistics’ employment data for the Water Transport industry, which is a category that includes more than just the sailors in the Australian shipping industry, for each year is as follows:",190,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
285,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Calendar Year Number Australian water (sea) employed in the Australian shipping Industry 1996 13 000 1997 10 000 1998 10 000 1999 11 000 2000 12 000 2001 14 000 Source: ABS, Labour Force Employed by Industry, Australia, August 2001. (7) Australian Bureau of Statistic’s published data does not detail numbers of sailors employed specifically in the Australian shipping industry. (8) The Government has not changed the cabotage legislation, namely Part VI of the Navigation Act 1912. These provisions are long standing and have not been changed for the last 25 years. (9) The number of single voyage permits (SVPs) each year since 1996 is shown in the table below: Calendar Year Number of Cargo SVPs Issued 1996 518 1997 695 1998 741 1999 648 2000 623 2001 675 (10) The number of continuing voyage permits (CVPs) each year since 1996 is shown in the table below: Calendar Year Number of CVPs Issued 1996 0 1997 0 1998 15 1999 59 2000 84 2001 115 (11) No. A permit is only issued where there are no licensed vessels available for the intended voyage or that the services of the ship do not meet the reasonable requirements of the port or the shipper. (12) and (13) There is no separate category of registration under the Shipping Registration Act 1981 for “ships to carry cargo”. The consolidated statistics maintained by the Shipping Registrar distinguish commercial and trading ships, of which some will have the capacity to carry cargo. However, considering the context of the question, it is appropriate to provide also the numbers of ships that are licensed to carry cargo under the coasting trade provisions of the Navigation Act 1912. This is a much smaller number than the number of registered ships noted above, and could include some foreign-flag ships, as these may obtain a licence. Australian Licences can be issued to any vessel regardless of Flag State provided it meets the requirements of Part VI of the Navigation Act 1912. The numbers of commercial and trading ships on the Australian Register of Ships and the numbers of licensed vessels each year since 1996 are shown in the table below: Year ended Number of commercial and trading ships Number of coasting trade li30 June cences Issued 1996 944 81 1997 947 75 1998 945 72 1999 970 62 2000 1,000 57 2001 1,023 54 (14) The total numbers of permits are as follows: Calendar Year Number of Cargo SVPs Issued Number of CVPs Issued Totals 1996 518 0 518 1997 695 0 695 1998 741 15 756 1999 648 59 707 2000 623 84 707 2001 675 115 790 No. Permits may be only issued where there is no licensed vessel available, or where the service provided by licensed vessels is inadequate. Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 252) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 20 March 2002: (1) How many asylum seekers have been detained under the Government’s “Pacific Solution”. (2) Where have asylum seekers been detained and how many have been detained at each location. (3) What is the status of individual applications for asylum, including how many (a) have been accepted, (b) have been denied and (c) are still waiting a determination. (4) Of those who have been accepted, to what localities have they been transported and what ongoing assistance has been provided. (5) How many asylum seekers currently awaiting a determination of their status come from Afghanistan, and of these, how many are identified as being members of the Hazara community. (6) Are there any Hazara translating services available to these asylum seekers; if so, what services are available and in what detention facilities are they offered. (1) 1515 asylum seekers have been accommodated in the offshore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. (2) 1159 asylum seekers have been accommodated on Nauru and 356 on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. As at 28 May 2002, asylum seeker numbers on Nauru and Manus are 1102 and 340 respectively. (3) (a)-(c) The announcement of refugee status determinations in both centres commenced on 8 April 2002. Processing of asylum claims in Nauru is being undertaken by both the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA). DIMIA is processing all claims on Manus. As at 28 May 2002, 628 decisions have been made so far. Of these, 433 are approvals and 195 are refusals. The processing of the remaining claims of the asylum seekers is continuing. (4) A family of five, who have been found to be refugees, have been resettled in Australia from Nauru following advice that the mother was in need of medical treatment not available in Nauru. On9 May 2002, 59 persons from Nauru travelled to New Zealand. These were from the UNHCR caseload and comprised 5 Afghans and 40 Iraqis who had been found to be refugees and 14 Afghans with links to the Tampa group whose claims for protection have not yet been finalised. (5) Seven Afghans on Nauru have been found to require protection and five of these travelled to New Zealand on 9 May 2002. The remaining 753 Afghan asylum seekers on Nauru have protection claims outstanding. There are no Afghans on Manus. The number of Afghans on Nauru who identify themselves as being Hazara is not available at this stage. As at 1 May 2002 there were 137 asylum seekers from Afghanistan in Australia who have protection claims outstanding. Of the 137 in Australia 22 identify themselves as being members of the Hazara community. (6) Every effort is made by DIMIA to provide access to language specific interpreters/translators. All mainland immigration detention facilities have access to translating and interpreting services through the National Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS) via phone conferencing.",191,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
286,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:On-site interpreters are provided at Curtin and Woomera Immigration and Reception Processing Centres (IRPCs). Woomera IRPC has also had on-site access to Hazara interpreters as required. Where asylum seekers have requested access to a Hazara interpreter/translator the Department has sought to comply with this request by utilising TIS via phone conferencing if there is no on-site Hazara interpreter/translator available or readily accessible. On-site interpreters can be arranged in advance through TIS but logistical constraints including transport can delay the immediate availability of an interpreter on-site. On occasions where Hazara interpreters are not available through TIS then, with agreement from the asylum seeker, a Dari interpreter may be used given the linguistic similarity between the two languages. In Nauru there are 2 Dari interpreters and 5 Afghan Community Liaison Officers who also assist with interpreting and translating. When DIMIA undertakes refugee status determination interviews in either Manus or Nauru qualified interpreters also accompany the interviewing officers to interpret during interviews. Recording Industry: Code of Practice (Question No. 284) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 21 March 2002: (1) Further to the answer to question No 2694 (Hansard, 6 August 2001, page 29260), is he aware of the Guidelines For Retailers Handling Compact Discs And Tapes With Explicit Lyrics. (2) What is the procedure for complaint and review of audio classification where (a) an audio recording is found for sale in a retailer’s premises which has apparently no identifiable classification, (b) an audio recording is found to have a classification of the kind listed in his answer but, in the opinion of the listener, deserves a more restrictive classification and (c) despite a classification which, according to the guidelines are prohibited from being played in the store or being sold, are nonetheless being played or sold. (3) Does clause 3 of the Guidelines state that retailers must not sell recordings which contain material stronger than 18+; if so, can he define how a retailer or other person is to define material stronger than 18+. (4) Which audio classification codes correspond to the term in clause 3 as stronger than 18+. (5) What punitive provisions exist under Commonwealth law for a person breaching the guidelines. (6) Is he aware of punitive provisions in the Australian States and Territories laws for a person breaching the guidelines; if so, what are those statutory provisions. (7) Further to his answer to part (2) of question No 2694, will he list the names of the 44 audio-visual videotape and CD-ROM recordings of 13 of the 23 artists listed in Light magazine article of May 2001. (8) Further to his answer in part (2) of question No 2694 concerning titles of recordings, has his attention been drawn to recordings by the artists Niggaz With Attitude titled (a) Just don’t bite me, (b) She swallowed it, (c) I’d rather .... you and (d) One less bitch; if so, have these recordings been classified; if so, what are those classifications as defined under the audio code administered by ARIA; if not, will these recordings be classified; if so, when; if not, why not. (9) What provisions exist for the monitoring of recordings in retail outlets in Australia. (10) How is policing and surveillance of audio recordings carried out to the satisfaction of the spirit of legislation regulating audio recording classification. (11) What law, in addition to the Record Industry Code of Practice for Labelling of Product with Explicit and Potentially Offensive Lyrics, regulates the display, playing and regulation of the sale and distribution of audio recordings. (12) Who is responsible for the classification of audio recordings. (13) How is the Classification Board constituted. (14) What is the current composition of the Classification Board and profile of each member. (15) Irrespective of labelling provisions, are there provisions under the general censorship laws of the Commonwealth that prohibit a recording being displayed notwithstanding its compliance or otherwise with labelling guidelines. (16) Can he clarify whether the guidelines are a law or by-law; if not, what are they in terms of a legal instrumentality and will he ratify their regulatory force by making them a law or a by-law. (1) I am advised that the Guidelines For Retailers Handling Compact Discs And Tapes With Explicit Lyrics exist as part of the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) Code of Practice for Labelling Product with Explicit or Potentially Offensive Lyrics (the ARIA Code), which is an industry-regulated Code of Practice for the sale and labelling of audio recordings containing explicit lyrics. ARIA has estimated that 98% of record distributors are ARIA members. (2) I am advised that procedures for dealing with complaints about audio recordings are included in the ARIA Code. (3) I am advised that dot point 3 in the Guidelines for Retailers in the ARIA Code states that: “Retailers must not sell recordings which contain material stronger than 18+.” I am advised that material stronger than 18+ is defined in the ARIA Code as: “Albums containing lyrics which explicitly and gratuitously deal with and promote, incite or instruct in matters of hard drug abuse, criminal violence, sexual violence, bestiality, incest, child abuse, and being abhorrent activity or activity that specifically instructs to commit suicide [shall be refused classification as 18+, and are not permitted to be sold].” (4) As stated in (3), material stronger than 18+ is defined in the ARIA Code. (5) None. The Guidelines for Retailers exist as part of an industry self-regulatory scheme. The ARIA Code is not legislated. (6) See the response to question (5). (7) The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 (the Classification Act) does not provide for the classification of audio recordings unless they also contain visual material. Under the Classification Act, the Classification Board classifies recordings on videotape or visually enhanced CD (eg CD-Rom) as ‘films’. The list of names of the audio-visual videotape and CD-Rom recordings classified as films by the Classification Board, as requested by the honourable member, is as follows: Artist Work1 Pantera Pantera– Cowboys from Hell2 Pantera3 – Watch it go 3 Pantera Vulgar Video4 Metallica Fuel5 $19.98 Home Vid Cliff ‘Em All! 6 2 of One7 Cunning Stunts8 Hero of the Day9 Live Shit– Binge and Porge 10 Nothing Else Matters 11 S & M (No Leaf Clover) 12 Turn the Page/Whiskey in the Jar 13 Metallica Garage Inc.

No application has been made to the OFLC for classification of these recordings. Whether audio recordings by this artist will be labelled by ARIA members is a matter for ARIA. (9) The monitoring of audio recordings in retail outlets in Australia is a matter for ARIA and the Australian Music Retailers Association. With regard to films, Community Liaison Officers who are attached to the Office of Film and Literature Classification regularly visit retailers of films around Australia to assist them in complying with their legal obligations under the national classification scheme for films. Classification decisions of the Classification Board are enforced under State and Territory classification enforcement legislation which complements the Commonwealth Classification Act. (10) See response to question (5). (11) The ARIA Code sets out provisions relating to the playing, sale or distribution of audio recordings. State and Territory classification enforcement legislation sets out the provisions for the demonstration, sale and distribution of videotapes and visually enhanced CDs classified as films by the Classification Board. Under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the television and radio broadcasting sectors have developed codes of practice governing content for broadcast, including musical content. These codes of practice are registered by the Australian Broadcasting Authority (the ABA). Codes of practice for the national broadcasters, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service, are notified to the ABA. (12) ARIA members and music retailers are responsible for labelling audio recordings as necessary. (13) Members of the Classification Board are appointed by the Governor General under section 48 of the Commonwealth Classification Act. The Classification Act provides that, in appointing members, regard is to be had to the desirability of ensuring membership is broadly representative of the Australian community. Members are usually appointed for an initial period of 3 years and may be eligible for reappointment. No member may be appointed in their first term for more than 5 years, and there is a statutory limit of 7 years on membership. (14) The members of the Classification Board are the Director, Des Clark; Senior Classifiers, Paul Hunt and Paulyne Williams; full-time members, Wendy Banfield; Yiah Chan, David Griffiths, Robert Sanderson, Lynn Townsend and Rachel Williams; and part-time members, Margaret Clancy, Bronwyn Healy and Graham Shirley. Profiles of the current Classification Board members can be found on pages 12-21 of the Classification Board and Classification Review Board Annual Report 2000-2001. No new full-time or part-time appointments to the Board have been made since 30 June 2001. (15) If the cover-art or printed lyrics of an audio recording are likely to warrant restriction to adults, they can be submitted to the Classification Board for classification as ‘submittable publications’. Provisions for the display of classified publications are set out in State and Territory classification enforcement legislation which complements the Commonwealth Classification Act. The responsibility for enforcing Classification Board decisions lies with the States and Territories. (16) The guidelines are neither a law nor a by-law. As stated in (5) above, they exist as part of the industry-regulated ARIA scheme for labelling audio recordings with explicit lyrics. The effectiveness of the ARIA scheme is monitored by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers with classification responsibilities. Ministers have recently required ARIA to amend the ARIA Code to prohibit the sale to minors of audio recordings carrying the strongest ARIA warning label. As stated in (7) above, the Classification Act does not provide for the classification of audio recordings unless they also contain visual material. Environment Australia: Wildlife Conservation Plan (Question No. 307) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 14 May 2002: (1) Is Environment Australia preparing a Wildlife Conservation Plan for Dugong populations in Australia under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. (2) When is the plan due to be (a) completed and (b) released. (1) Yes, Environment Australia is preparing a Wildlife Conservation Plan for Dugongs under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. (2) Following stakeholder consultation Environment Australia expects to (a) complete the Plan within the next 12 months and (b) release the Plan shortly after. Environment Australia: Mobil Oil Company, Altona Refinery (Question No. 308) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 14 May 2002: Did he grant an 18 month exemption to Mobil Oil Company’s Altona refinery, allowing it to produce diesel with sulphur levels of up to 1300 parts per million (ppm), even though the legal standard is 500ppm; if so (a) why and (b) why was the decision initially not made public. On 26 February 2002, I approved a variation to the 500ppm diesel sulphur fuel standard to be introduced on 31 December 2002 to allow Mobil to supply up to 1300ppm sulphur diesel with the fuel additive Cleanerburn from 31 December 2002 until 30 June 2004. (a) Mobil proposed that Cleanerburn would provide an equivalent environmental outcome to 500ppm sulphur diesel and that its use would allow Mobil to upgrade its Altona refinery to produce 50ppm sulphur diesel by mid 2004, eighteen months earlier than when the 50ppm standard comes into force in 2006. An independent technical assessment of the alternative fuel was undertaken and, in the opinion of the technical experts, any potential impact on the environment would be relatively minor. My decision to grant the approval was based on the findings of the technical assessment and Mobil’s advice that Cleanerburn diesel would facilitate an early upgrade of the Altona refinery to produce 50ppm sulphur diesel. The Government does not wish to block any investment strategies that will assist",195,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
288,Dr Kemp,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,197,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
289,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:industry in moving to the ultimate goal of lowering sulphur levels to 50ppm by 2006 or earlier if possible. The approval applies for a limited period and as an interim measure until the Altona refinery commences production of 50ppm sulphur diesel in mid 2004. A number of strict conditions apply including clear labelling of bowsers to advise consumers of the potentially higher sulphur content of the fuel. Mobil will also be required to report regularly on progress with the refinery upgrade and independent audits will be carried out in this regard. (b) The approval was publicised in the Government Notices Gazette of 13 March 2002 and by placement on the Environment Australia website. Environment: Natural Heritage Trust (Question No. 309) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 14 May 2002: What funding from the Natural Heritage Trust has been directed to projects within the electoral divisions of (a) Wills, (b) Deakin and (c) McEwen since the Trust’s establishment and how does this compare with the total funding distributed by the Trust in that period. Natural Heritage Trust funding that has been directed to projects within the electoral divisions of (a) Wills, (b) Deakin and (c) McEwen since the Trust’s establishment is as follows: Electorate Total Trust Funding Provided McEwen $1,225,177 Deakin $13,800 Wills Nil It is also likely that other funding from the Trust may have been spent in these electorates. For example the Integrated Urban Bushcare Project, with Trust funding of $656,000 over two years, may have directed funding into the electorates of Wills and Deakin. The Commonwealth cannot easily track the electorate-based distribution of devolved funds in such projects. As at 9 May 2002, $1,417.8 million has been approved for 11,992 Natural Heritage Trust and related projects. Education: Job Guide (Question No. 324) 14 May 2002: Is the Government no longer distributing a hard copy version of the Job Guide for Year 10 students and instead distributing the information solely by CD-ROM; if so, and given that many students have limited access to computers, will he consider reinstating the hard copy version to give all students fair access to this important information. Job Guide distribution to schools for 2002 will be: sufficient books for each year 10 student; and 10 CD ROMS for each school as resource sets. Job Guide is also available on the Internet. Job Guide will also be distributed to, amongst others, Centrelink, public, university and TAFE libraries, correctional institutions and DEST programme providers.

291,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister For Education, Science And Training, Upon Notice, On",,198,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
292,Dr Nelson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,198,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
293,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister For Industry, Tourism And Resources, Upon Notice, On","(1) Does the Government intend to take any steps to amend paragraph 53(a) of the Trade Practices Act to take into account the 1998 Country of Origin defences particularly in relation to a claim that a product is “made in Australia”. (2) Does the Government intend to confer with State Governments with a view to requesting that State laws be amended to take these defences into account. (3) Pending appropriate amendment of the law, will he direct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to withdraw its current guidelines and to amend its website so that is made clear that the 1998 Country of Origin defences are of no benefit and, in particular, have no application to claims that a product is “made in Australia”. Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Government is drafting a consequential amendment to the Trade Practices Act 1974 to extend the scope of the Division 1AA defences for country of origin claims to cover actions under s. 53(a). The amendment will be included in the Industry Tourism and Resources Legislation Amendment Bill. (2) Once the Amendment Bill is passed I intend to write to the relevant State and Territory Ministers asking them, in the interests of harmonising State, Territory and Federal legislation, to consider amending their Fair Trading Acts to mirror the country of origin defences in the Trade Practices Act 1974. (3) In July 2000 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released amended guidelines which are explicit in recognising that where an action is brought under s. 53(a) of the Trade Practices Act, the defences provided in Division 1AA of the Act for breaches of ss. 52 and 53(eb) are not available as a defence to s. 53(a) proceedings. These guidelines are available on the Commission’s website. Environment: All-Terrain Wagons (Question No. 344) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 14 May 2002: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 251 concerning the significant growth in the numbers of All Terrain Wagons purchased as a proportion of all new light vehicle sales, what is the estimated fuel consumption for each class of new light vehicle, including All Terrain Wagons, sold in Australia. (2) What is the level of, or what is the sum of, federal tax paid on the purchase of each class of new light vehicle, including All Terrain Wagons, sold in Australia. (3 What is the registration fee payable in each State and Territory on each class of new light vehicle, including All Terrain Wagons, sold in Australia. (1) The Australian Greenhouse Office annually compiles fuel consumption information on passenger vehicles and some types of All Terrain Wagons and light commercial vehicles. However, the Fuel Consumption Guide provides model specific information, not information by class, as there is no universal class classification system for Australian passenger vehicles. (2) Imported passenger motor vehicles currently attract a 15 per cent tariff rate, which is scheduled to decrease to 10 per cent from 2005 onward. All Terrain Vehicles, all of which are imported, are classified as light commercial trucks and attract a 5 per cent tariff rate. The Goods and Service Tax is levied on all vehicles. Input tax credits are available for the purchase of vehicles for business purposes. A 25% luxury vehicle tax applies to passenger motor vehicles with a GST inclusive value greater than $55,134.

294,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Defence: Vehicle Repairs (Question No. 366) Mr Bevis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 15 May 2002: (1) What process is used to select private companies to undertake transmission repair work for army vehicles in Brisbane. (2) How many providers of this work are currently engaged. (3) What are the names of these providers. (4) How many vehicles have been repaired by each of these firms. (5) What is the process of quality control. (6) Have any firms been removed from the approved repairers’ list, if so, why. (7) What procedures exist for additional firms to be added to the approved repairers’ list. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Selection of contractors occurs through the assessment of capacity, capability, quality, insurance coverage, financial viability, cost schedule and contractual compliance. (2) Nine. (3) For Landrover transmissions: A1 Four Wheel Drive Services. Four Wheel Drive Centre. FWD Motors Pty Ltd. Paul Beauchamp Performance & Automotive. For Unimog transmissions: Daimler Chrysler. Mack Trucks Australia. Brisbane Diff& Gearbox Pty Ltd. For Mack transmissions: Mack Trucks Australia. Brisbane Diff& Gearbox Pty Ltd. (4) Of the firms engaged in transmission repairs, Four Wheel Drive Centre, FWD Motors Pty Ltd, Daimler Chrysler, and Mack Trucks Australia are involved in vehicle repairs. The number of vehicles repaired cannot be readily quantified due to difficulties in discriminating between repairs conducted by each contractor to vehicles, sub-assemblies and component parts and the fact that the vehicle fleet has been in service for approximately 18 years. (5) Quality control processes are internal to the contractors quality management system and are reviewed as part of the assessment process when selecting a supplier. Generally quality control occurs through inspection and testing during stages of repair and upon completion. All work is certified as being complete in accordance with the terms and conditions of the purchase order. Quality assurance is conducted by Commonwealth representatives through both product and process audits.
