13,Mr Fleming,"The n I give noticepresenting the M in is t e r for Defence, u p o n notice 1: Whether commercial aviation firms already established in Australia w ill be given an opportunity of tendering for the Defence Department's requirements and for mail and other services ? 2. As extensive experiments in carrying mails by air have already been made in England, France, and America, and as the records in connection therewith can be obtained in Australia, is it considered necessary for further experiments to be carried out by the Defence Department ? 3. W ill the A i r Board co-operate with and advise the 90 per cent, of shire councils in Australia who have expressed their willingness to give every assistance possible in providing landing grounds, provided they are guided by a responsible Government Department? 4. As shipping is catered for by means of charts, lighthouses, dredged channels, &c, w ill the Government consider the urgent necessity of assisting commercial aviation by providing landing grounds, hangars, maps, &c? 0. As several passenger-carrying time-tables have been arranged between several capital cities and outlying towns, and as the services have been suspended until the issue of the A i r Navigation Regulations, when w ill such regulations be issued? Sir answers to t h e honourable member's question s are as f o l l o w : 1. Yes, although it should be pointed out that requirements which must be imported are obtained, as a general rule, direct from manufacturers in the United Kingdom through the High Commissioner, who, in the case of aviation equipment, would have the assistance of the Australian Liaison Officer at the A i r Ministry. This would be usually more advantageous than dealing through an agency in Australia. I stated recently in tlie House that should thc Government receive a definite offer from any civil aviation' company stating exactly the route over which they proposed working,"" proposed time-table, type of machine and engine to be used, the number of machines to be used in the service and in reserve, the places at which they w ill establish landing grounds, hangars, and workshops, the amount of mail matter they are prepared to carry, and the remuneration they desire for the service, it would no doubt be suriously considered by the Government. 2. It is not thought that the records regarding tlie carrying of mails in England, France, and America, countries which have large populations, and where large commercial cities over various routes are f a i r l y frequent, can be taken"" as n guide in connection w it h the possibilities of aerial mails in Australia. It is considered that the commercial success of such mails depends entirely on the attitude of the public as to whether they are prepared to send correspondence by air, and, perhaps, to pay extra for the faster service. It is considered, therefore, that the only possible way of arriving at a proper conclusion is by an actual t r i a l in Australia. 3. Yes. As soon as it is possible certain definite air routes are to be surveyed and mapped, and over these particular routes officers w ill be sent out for the purpose of getting into touch w i th those shire councils and others concerned. 4. The Government w ill take action along the lines suggested in the question, though it is doubtful whether it w ill be possible to provide hangars for purely civil purposes. 5. Legislation for the control of civil aviation is being prepared for submission at the present session. Meanwhile, those whose activities w ill be regulated thereby may assume that Australian regulations w ill follow British provisions, subject only to sueh modifications as might be found necessary for local conditions. FUEL OIL. for the N a v y , u p o n not i c e Whether he will inform the House1. From whom he recently contracted to pur-' chase fuel oil at £7 10s. per ton? 2.

If the former, what w ill be the cost of transport from the well's mouth to the port of delivery in Australia? the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. From the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company. . 2. Approximately 4,000 tons; the contract covers this quantity only, which represents one cargo. 3. Part of this cargo w ill be delivered at Sj'dney, and balance to H.M.A. ships. 4. The price to be paid is f.o.b. oilerat Borneo. 5. The cost of transporting the oil w ill be £2 5s. per ton.

To what purposes must this money be applied by the' States? honourable member's questions are as follow :1. In connection with land-settlement work undertaken by the several State Governments, the Commonwealth agreed to advance a definite sum to settle a fixed quota of returned men. A t the last Premiers' Conference, further financial assistance was sought; and, as the proposals were so extensive, and the cost of placing the settlors on thc land varied so much, the Commonwealth agreed to advance, for any additional settlers over and above the quota previously agreed upon, a sum equal on a flat basis to £1,000 per settler, being £625 on the average as working capital for each settler, the balance being applied to cover the cost of land resumptions and works, incidental to land settlement, which have been approved hy the Commonwealth Government. 2. See No. 1. the honourable member for Angas( Mr with £600 in his possession to cover his mainGabb), asked the following questions:1. Whether the Colonial Sugar Befining Company have informed the South Australian Fruit-growers' Co-operative Society that it w ill be unable to let it have sugar for its new f r u it nreserving factory, at Nuriootpa? 2. If so, w ill the Minister explain how it is that this fruit-growers' society in South Australia has been refused sugar, when the jam manufacturers of Tasmania and Victoria are able to obtain sumcient, not only for home consumption, but to make and export jam to South Australia and overseas? I am now in a position to f u r n is h the honourable member w it h the f o l l o w in g replies to the above questions:1. No. The facts are that the Fruit-growers' Association of South Australia was promised 100 tons of sugar per mouth; but this quant it y was subsequently increased by 10 tons per month. The manager of the association then asked for 50 tons per month for a new cannery to be opened at Nuriootpa in December next. Tho Colonial Sugar Befining Company naturally declined to promise a definite quantity of sugar for a factory which is not yet in existence, but .promised that everytfRng possible, so far as the stocks of sugar on hand might permit, would be done to assist the new factory. I might add that arrangements which have now been made will, I hope, enable us to supply all necessary sugar for jam-making and canning purposes. 2. See reply to No. 1. MR. ERNEST TILL . honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) on behalf of the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Cunningham), asked me the following questions:1. Isi t a fact that one, ErnestT ill , permanently resident in New Guinea, but for some months past, for health reasons, temporarily resident in Sydney, has been refused permission by the Public Trustee to operate on his banking account at Rabaul, on the ground that he was an enemy alien? (2) If this is so, in view of the fact that Dr. J. V. Danes, Consul for the Czechoslovak Republic, has certified that the said ErnestT ill is a subject of the Czecho-Slovak Republic, is it the intention of the Federal Government to permit him, and other similarly situated, to freely operate on their own accounts at Rabaul? It h e n promised to m a ke in q u i r i e s in to the m a t t e r ; and 1 a m n ow in a p o s it i o n to f u r n is h the honourable member w it h the f o l l o w i ng replies:1. MrT ill is reported to be a national of an ex-enemy country, who was granted permission by the Administrator of German New Guinea to leave that Territory on 20th A p r i l, 1920, tenance in Sydney until October, 1920, when he expected to return to Rabaul. In July last, MrT ill reported to the Public Trustee that, in addition to having spent £600, he had borrowed and spent £180, making his total expenditure £780 for three months; and he asked for per""mission to withdraw from New Guinea a further sum of £500 to meet his indebtedness, and to cover his cost of living until he left for Rabaul in October, 1920. On behalf of the Administrator of German New Guinea, inquiry was made into the case by the Public Trustee, who advised MrT ill that the Public Trustee would be prepared to support any application he might make to the Administrator for £65, as representing a sum to maintain him at the rate of £5 per week u n t i l 20th October, 1920. Until MrT ill produces definite proof that he is not of German, or Austrian, nationality, it is considered undesirable to allow him to withdraw from German New Guinea large sums of money which, under the present circumstances, are subject to retention for the Reparation Fund. 2. No restriction will be placed by the Federal Government upon the property of persons who prove, in accordance with the requirements of the Treaties of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany and Austria,' that they are subjects of the Czechoslovakian Republic.",21,Granville Ryrie Th E Consideration By The State Governments National Song For Australia

I shall show directly why this inequality does not exist in reality, and I hope to show also how and why the inequality is not necessarily coextensive with the variation in the rates of exchange, even when full allowance is made for the purchase of raw material abroad by a country whose exchanges are adverse to it . When I deal with the question of raw material, as I must later, I shall show to what extent the raw material, which is being bought by France and every other country with an adverse exchange position, must necessarily cost it more in the currency of that country, as compared with sterling, than it is costing British manufacturers. But I shall also be able to show, I think, that, owing to the fact that these countries are establishing long-dated credits for the purchase of raw material at the present time, this does not enter into the calculations to anything like so great an extent .as might be otherwise anticipated. event of the exchange being the same when the amount is due, as it is to-day. those credits vary from three to five, and up to seven years, and, of course, we hope that long before those credits become due and payable, the French position, and the exchange position generally, will, if not quite normal, more closely approximate to normal than it does to-day. I should like to say this before passing on: it'has been said over and over again in the press that the exchange position in which France and other countries find themselves makes it difficult for them to trade. that that is so; because, if the exchange position of France and other countries with a depreciated exchange be made more difficult, it necessarily follows that a country with an appreciated exchange position, as America, for instance, will have its position made easy for it ; if it be difficult for France to-day, under the existing exchange position, to trade,, then, with an appreciated exchange, it must be necessarily more easy. Of course, that is absurd. In the case of America, while before the war, £100 would buy 486 dollars worth of goods, to-day £100 will buy only 343 dollars worth. I wish to turn for a moment or two to a consideratien of the position in' those days which now seem so far removed, when the rivalry of nations was practically confined to trade, and the only battlefield on which they met was the field of commerce. Exactly the same procedure which takes place in any ordered state of society between individuals, or groups of individuals, in the buying or exchanging of goods, services, or products, takes place as between nations ; that is to say, it is carried on very largely on the same principle. The only difference is found in the distance, variations of currency, the magnitude of the transaction, the time elapsing between points when exchanges can be balanced; and all these make the transactions more complex and a little more difficult to follow. It is common to talk of the balance of trade, and point to the export and import figures, which relate only and entirely to goods as if they formed the totality of what constitutes the financial relationships of nations to one another. Of course, there are many things which go to make up the credit and debit sides of the balance-sheet between nations. Besides the debts and credits for goods -that is, the .visible exports and imports-ther e are the invisible exports and imports of every country, such as national securities, coupons, the hundred and one monetary transactions of a private nature-suc h as the sale of stocks, bonds, and monetary transactions of all sorts which take place between individuals-and all have their place in and effect on the international exchange position. Then, above and beyond this, we must not forget what I might term the I do not believe for a moment export and import of services rendered, which equally play their part in the balance of international figures. For instance, there is Britain in her capacity as the world's sea-carrier. Probably the tremendous amount of work which Britain does for the nations of the world as the international sea-carrier, is one of the main factors which enables Britain to overtake the balance of trade which",24,Customs Bill

If honourable members turn to statistics for quite a number of years, they w ill see that England has imported more than has exported. help exchange position. bers will see, therefore, that the international or foreign exchange depends on the totality of all the debts owing and payable as between nations. For the purposes of my argument, it is not necessary to deal with the influence that the time at which future debts fall due has on the rate of exchange at any particular moment. exchange know well that the balance of trade may be temporarily particular nation. well known that debts falling due within an appreciable time, will become due, will very often keep exchanges at par, when otherwise they would not be. For my purpose, it is sufficient to say that, in pre-war days, the business of buying aud selling those debts between the countries of the world-which part which I need not enter into here-was carried out at rates that never varied very much, at all events, above or below tlie specie point. that, as with individuals, so with nations, if you buy more than you sell you must in some way balance the ledger or go insolvent-you serves, or borrow to meet your liaibliti.es. Consequently, drawn on any given country than the country has drawn, the competition thc few by the many leads to a premium being offered. exceed tbe specie point very much, because once it reaches a point where it pays better for an importer to buy gold and ship it in payment rather than buy a bill, he will buy gold. I do not say that that actually I am merely putting the position in its simplest form. form the subject of foreign exchange pass through quite a. number of hands; but, a3 the simplest way, I am putting the matter as between the importer and the exporter. In pre-war days, the moment gold began to move in any appreciable quantity, the usual method of checking it was by a rise Mr Greene. in the bank rate, which acted in a double way by checking trade and attracting in vestments from abroad. The moment the she bank rate went up to a particular point, But all these things money began to flow in to take advantage to balance the international of the high interest rates, and, as a Honourable memconsequence, exchanges were rectified. Foreign loans and the establishment of temporary credits, which were drawn against in many instances, all had the same effect of re-establishing the balance of exchange, and stopping the outflow or the inflow of gold, as the case might be. The fact is worth recalliug that, although Germany was nominally a country which for international purposes traded on a Students of foreign gold basis, it rarely, if ever', allowed the export of gold for many years prior to against any the war. Frequently, when it would have The fact that it is paid her merchants over and over again to export gold, the Government insisted on the bank rate being raised in Berlin, and this at once brought into Germany that loose money which waa always ready to take advantage of a temporary rise in the rate of interest in any quarter. In that way the outflow of gold was prevented, "" it was, in fact, the method Gerwas doue for the most many invariably adopted to hang on to through London, for reasons her gold. Nevertheless, these variations, such as they were, above or below par, asIt is perfectly evident between one, country and another, never altered to any great extent, and the fluctuations in the foreign exchanges were never very great of recent years as bemust either draw on retween countries whose exchange for international purposes was nominally, at all events, based on gold. W it h regard to if there are more bills silver-currency countries, of course, inasmuch as silver was in London no for more than a marketable commodity, the rate of exchange between Great Britain, This premium can never and those countries necessarily fluctuated over and above and beyond the extent to which the balance of"" debts would have caused it to fluctuate as of the debt, the price of silver rose or fell in London; but beyond making the calculations happens; very much in.ore complicated, these variations do not affect the general truth of the statement that of recent years the We know that bills which pre-war fluctuations in foreign rates of exchange were not marked, but ranged within a few points of the specie or gold point, either above or below. That is to say, the variation as between the m in t par rate of exchange for foreign bills converted into sterling and the bank rate of exchange was never very great, and was confined within certain well-defined required to balance the debts of the other. limits. Thus the position in pre-war days If the French currency be depreciated was that the mint par rate of exchange, 25 per cent., and the British currency which never varied very much, could be remains at par, France is obliged to find taken as a fair basis of calculation, and 25 per cent, more than the equivalent for that reason the exchange rate had at value in francs at their par value to that time practically no effect on prices, settle the exchanges. In other word6, except as regards silver-currency counprovided gold is free to move-and that tries. What are the reasons which have led to keep in mind-the depreciation of the to the extraordinary departure from these currency of a country can always be meaconditions, and to the enormous gap sured by the amount at which gold stands which has arisen as between the m in t par at a premium there. and the bank rate of exchange for foreign into consideration the actual cost of the bills ? While the m in t ,par rate of exmovement of gold, which arises from change remains constant, the figures other causes, and need not be calculated which I quoted at the beginning of my refor the purposes of my argument. marks show to what an enormous extent the bank rates of exchange have moved preciation of the currency of any country in an adverse direction against France as does the overissue of paper money, and It a l y . The causes which have led up which is either not at all or not readily to this position may be summarized under convertible into gold. We all know that four principal headsDepreciation of the currency in cerEurope for some years past. tain countries; Heavy importations of debtor couni t has been going on here at a great rate. tries; Cessation of gold settlement; and Loss of credit or confidence. How much these respective factors have the extent of the issue of paper money individually contributed to the general rein Europe. A t the outbreak of war the sult it is impossible to say with any accumaximum note issue of the Bank of racy, but the cessation of gold movements France, and the loss of credit and confidence are, 6,800,000,000 francs. On the 5th AugI believe, the greater factors, although it ust, 1914, immediately, after the war is probable that the principal causes will broke out, the maximum was raised tc be found in the depreciation of currency 12,000,000,000 francs, and on successiveand in the heavy importations by debtor occasions it was further increased until countries. In any case, all four factors on the 17th July, 1919, the maximum are so intimately related that it is a little was fixed at 40,000,000,000 francs. difficult to discriminate between cause As a matter of fact, at the end of 1913 and effect. It is well known that no the actual amount of paper money issued factor reacts on the rate of exchange as by the Bank of France was 238,'015 520 between one country and another w it h francs. By 1920 that amount had risen greater speed or more certainty than does to 38,355,755,000 francs. In It a l y , State the depreciation of the currency of one notes and bank notes together, at the end country in relation to that of another. of 1913, amounted to 2,772.578,545 lireI f the currency of one country becomes to-day the amount is 13,874,254,775 lire depreciated in relation to another, and In Belgiumi n 1914, the note issur the balance of indebtedness sets against amounted to 958,021,000 francs..

42,Mr Greene,"I shall deal with thatgold reserves behind these enormous note issues. The Bank of France has issued £1,500,000,000 worth of notes, whilst the cash reserves of the bank amount to £223,000,000. That reserve is against the whole of the bank's liabilities. The note issue of the three banks of issue in It a l y , viz., the Bank of Italy, the Bank of Sicilv,. and the Bank ofNaples, in September, and the cash reserve amounted to £87,000,000. There was also £90,000,000 worth of Treasury notes. I am unable to say whether there was any gold reserve against them, but as the statistics given by the Supreme Economic Council do not quote any gold reserve, I think I am safe in assuming that there is none. Having regard to the comparative smallness of nur note issue, and the fact that it has a gold backing of nearly 50 per cent., which puts into tlie shade the reserves behind Ihe note issues of other countries, it can have little effect upon the currency posit on, and is, in comparison with the : others, perfectly sound. I do not believe for a moment that our note issue has led to any depreciation of our currency. effects. has. In proportion to the other figures I have quoted, our note issue hardly represents more than a streamlet flowing into a mighty torrent. very little doubt that the currency of the other countries I havo . quoted has, by reason of the huge note issues, been depreciated in relation to Great Britain. other example of what has been taking place in Europe. From what we are able to learn, Russia has been using the printing press, and turning out notes with the -characteristic recklessness that has distinguished every phase of the Bolshevik Administration. Not only has the Russian currency no value whatever amongst the civilized nations of the earth, but even in Russia itself, all goods have risen in the value of the currency of the country to an extent that is simply grotesque. One could auote instance after instance of what has been written of the prices paid for goods in the currency of Russia, owing entirely to the fact that there has been an enormous overissue of paper money, which has depreciated the currency u n t il it has practically no value at all. I have quoted tbese illustrations, because the fact of the matter is that goods, or services, or whatever is saleable, or becomes the subject of an exchange in any country which has a depreciated currency, must sooner or later adjust themselves in price to the same extent as the measure of their value is itself altered. To whatever extent currency be1919, was £560,000,000, comes depreciated, prices must increase in proportion. Assuming that the effect of the note issue in. France, Italy, and elsewhere, has been to bring about a depreciation of the curreucy of those countries, prices must rise in proportion. As we have seen, the extent to which gold advances to a premium, invariably measures the extent of the depreciation of the currency. that that is the cause of the rise of prices in Australia? that I do not believe that is the cause of high prices in Austi..lia. WhatI am endeavouring to show is that, assuming that there is a depreciation of currency, It may have had other prices will rise accordingly, and the price of that depreciation is necessarily the exI do not believe it tent to which gold is at a premium, provided that the movement of gold is free and the premium can be ascertained. The invariable tendency with a country whose I have currency is depreciated is to become a actual debtor country. That is to say, through the inherent causes which bring about depreciation of its currency, the tendency is for imports to exceed exports', and inasI shall quote just one much as the balance of the exchanges is against the debtor country, we at once get a prohibition of the export of gold. It will be found that in every case, without exception, where there is a depreciated currency there is an embargo on the export of gold, although, of course, emWhat is the result? bargoes have been put on the export of gold for other reasons in other countries. A t once we get a new factor in the exchange situation, the nature and extent of which it is impossible to place limits upon. So long as the supply of bills drawn on such a debtor country largely exceeds the supplies of bills from that country drawn on other countries, so long will the rate of exchange, already made adverse by the depreciation of the currency, be still further pushed in an adverse direction, the extent of which will be determined only by the extent",27,Customs Bill

45,Mr Jowistt,Does the Minister say,28,Customs Bill
46,Mr Greene,"I have already saidto which the debts owing exceed the debts owed and the urgency of their settlement. That is to say with the prohibition upon the export of gold the balance of the exchange rate being against the. country, the result is thab there is an enormous Competition for bills, for debts owing to the country, leading to a depreciation of the exchanges, to which there is practically no limit , and which can only be measured by the urgency and the nature of the settlements to be effected. I should like to quote an authority in support of the statements I have just made, because this is a complex and difficult subject, upon which one does not like to dogmatize. My authority is one whose views I am sure will commend themselves to honourable members, because his reputation has for a long time stood very high indeed in regard to matters relating to international finance. I refer to the late Lord Goschen. In his work, The Theory of the Foreign Exchanges, . 1903 edition, pages 69 to 72, will be found the following. I have omitted fro m the quotation certain words bhat are irrelevant and unnecessary for the purposes of my argument, but if any honourable member cares to look up the reference he w ill find I have omitted nothing which in any way alters the sense of tbe text. Lord Goschen saysThe examination of the nature and tendency of the fluctuations just described serves to lead us conclusively enough to their limits, which is the special object of our present investhe fact of the depreciation of the currency tigation'. The bills on a given country fluctuate cannot cause them to deviate. in value, in proportion to the extent to which the prices of all purchasable articles-bullio n included-ar e affected by the depreciation of the currency; in other words, in proportion to thc discount of the paper money, or the premium on gold. Beyond that proportion the fact of the depreciation of the currency cannot cause them to deviate This is where we get to the exact position as it is to-day, namely, a country with a depreciated currency and the prohibition of the export of gold. What, however, will be the case if the export of bullion from the country where the depreciated currency exists is prohibited? How is the holder of a claim on such a country to encash that which is due to him? . . . . If, as is often the case, debtors are bound at speaking, is being felt to a large extent in any cost to place funds in English money into the hands of their creditors by a given day, there would be no limit to the price which might be exacted from them-in ' other words, no limit to the fluctuations in the exchange. Supply and demand alone determine the price. And if the exports of such a country do not equal the imports (and this is by far the most general case), so that the demand for bills to pay for the imports exceeds the quantity of bills which is supplied by the exports, the balance which the country has to pay can only be settled by an enormous sacrifice. In certain parts of the quotation, as it appears on page 72, I have substituted the word "" debtors "" for a phrase used by Viscount Goschen, not because of any altered sense, but because the phrase, as it appears in the work, would not convey any meaning to honourable members. I do not suggest, of course, that I understand the exchange position any more than does any other honourable member. I have substituted the word "" debtors"" because the phrase to which I refer relates to something which I have omitted, and, therefore, if retained in the quotation, it would not convey any meaning to honourable members. If honourable members have been following me they must realize that whilst we have here a factor which exerts an immense influence on the rates of exchange, it is not one, and this is the important point, which necessarily must be reflected in the price of goods. In regard to the depreciation of the currency itself, the measure of it must be reflected in the price of goods. Lord Goschen says in the first part of the quotation I gaveBeyond that proportionThat is, the premium on goldThis difference in the exchange position is in proportion to the extent to which the price of articles, bills included, are affected by a depreciated currency. But when you come to the other side of the question, the influence which the actual prohibition of the export of gold has on the exchanges, you are touching a factor which, though it has immense influence on the exchange position, need not necessarily be reflected in the price of commodities in the country from which those goods are exported. There is no doubt that this factor, this influence upon the exchanges of which I have just been the exchange position to-day. During the war European countries financed themselves by borrowing very largely abroad to pay for the enormous importation of goods of one sort and another that were used throughout the war. Their own source of production being cut off, they naturally had to import; and exchanges were balanced by the export of securities. Since the termination of the war the dislocation of their trade, and their lack of exports, combined with the heavy importations of coupons-the results of foreign debts incurred during the warfood ancl raw materials, throw a still heavier balance of trade against them, which they find it more difficult to meet, whilst the high rates of interest and the difficulty of getting credit abroad make their position more and more serious. Tlie consequence has heen the advance of the exchange rates to a figure probably far in excess of any.that depreciation of tha various currencies would have effected by and of themselves. rates to-day are not due entirely to the depreciation of the currency, but to that plus other influences, of which this is one. I desire now to pass on to another factor, the fourth of the four which I have enumerated. ter of the loss of credit and confidence. I believe that the disturbed state of Europe has a great deal to do w i th the present exchange rates. an influence which need not necessarily reflected in the price of goods in those countries where there is a depreciated currency when those goods come to be exported. I w ill quote one more reference from the work of Viscount Goschen, *o which I have alluded. w i ll be found the following words, addressed, in effect, to the student of foreign exchange»So, too, lie will not forget the influence of prices of goods produced in the country. credit or discredit, and at any time of panic ' nr otlier temporary derangement of confidence, the discount at which bills are sold will not be mistaken for the result of an adverse balance of trade or a depreciated currency. I came upon a notable example of this in the Melbourne Herald, when the f o l lowing paragraph was reported on the 11th inst., being a quotation from the Times of the day previously:There has been a fall in the value of Italian securities, in consequence of the decision of the Fiat Motor Company to close' its worksliops. on the grounds that the scheme of cooperation us advocated by the Goveniment. is Impossible. The lira is now quoted at 90 to the f l , compared with 35 to the f l a year afc'o. Ur. Greene. The month before that day exchange with It a l y stood at 72 lire to the £ 1 . In the course of a few days it had risen to 81 lire; and, when this f a l l in value of Italian securities occurred the rate went up to 90. These decided influences in the present exchange position in Europe, I emj)hasize, need not necessarily be reflected in the price of goods in that country where the goods are produced. Eori n stance, in It a l y when, owing to the action of the Communists,, the exchange rates went from 72 to 90 lire in a month, the goods which It a l y had for sale did not thereby cost so much more to produce. Still, owing to the f a l l in the international value of the lira, every £ 1 would buy 90 lire instead of' 72. So long as The exchange the root causes of the present position remain unchanged, so long w ill foreign exchanges remain in their present unsatisfactory state; and, not u n t i l there is a substantial, reduction in the redundant paper issues, a growth of exports from the countries with an adverse balance of trade, and the possibility of free gold I refer to the matmovements being re-established, can we expect to see that renewal of confidence, which w ill lead to the removal of those causes which, acting and reacting upon This, again, is one another, are responsible for the present unhealthy position. However that may be, it is important for us to realize that, apart from the causes which under normal conditions -would lead to fluctuations in exchange rates, apart from the variations caused by depreciated curUpon page 123 rencies, there are potent factors at work which are exercising very great influence on the exchange rates, which I repeatneed not necessarily be reflected in the In other words, while depreciation of currency does not make it any easier for a country to sell its goods, any further movement of the exchange in an unfavorable direction makes it possible for that country to sell its goods at prices below those of its competitors. I want to interpolate here that what I have said in relation to these two last factors-namely , the influence upon exchange of the prohibition of export of gold and the loss of credit, and that these factors need not necessarily be reflected in the price of goods-is entirely true, I believe, in relation to goods manufactured entirely from the raw products of a country which, for our purpose, we will suppose, is exporting its goods i u those circumstances. But it is not entirely true in regard to that country if it is importing the raw .materials for its manufactures. A t the same time, it is to be remembered that this difficulty has been overcome, to a very large extent, by the establishment of credits abroad. I have endeavoured briefly to trace the main considerations which account for normal fluctuations in exchange rates' in normal times, and the principal factors which have contributed to the acutely marked adverse position of the international relationships of certain countries and the violent fluctuations of foreign, exchange rates at the present time. And I have tried, as far as possible, to steer' clear . of the by-ways and to stick to the high road. But, if honourable members have been able to follow me, they w ill have seen that such fluctuations as took place in normal circumstances in pre-war days were so small that, with the exception of silver currency countries-and then only in the event of an abnormal move in the price of silver-the y had no material effect upon prices at all. But when one comes to the question of buying and selling today, the exchange position makes an enormous difference. I have endeavoured to show that, beside the factor of depreciated currency, the f u l l extent of which must be reflected in the cost of commodities, there are other powerful agencies which play a material part in the adverse exchange position of countries whose cu'riency is depreciated, but which need not necessarily be reflected in those countries in the cost of commodities at all. From this fact arises the danger that advantage may be taken of the position to dump goods at prices which would make it impossible for our manufacturers, or for British manufacturers either, to compete; and it is for that reason that the B ill has been introduced in its present form. NowI invite honourable members to t u r n their attentions to the B ill itself. If honourable imembers will refer to the CustomsA c t of 1901. they will find that section 154 providesWhen any duty is imposed according to value(o) the value shall be taken to be the fair market value of the goods in the principal markets of the country whence the same were exported in the usual and ordinary commercial acceptation of the term, and free on board at the port of export in such country, and a further addition of 10 per cent, on such market value. Section 155 of the Act readsThe genuine invoice means(a) the original invoice prepared and issued by the seller in the country whence the goods were, exported, showing the true description of the goods and the actual money orice aid, or to be. paid, for the goods y the purchaser in the country whence the same were exported, without any deduction. Section 157 providesWhere the genuine invoice shows the value of the goods in any currency other than British currency, the equivalent value of tlie goods in British currency shall be ascertained according to a fair rate of exchange to be declared in case of doubt by the Minister. Section 154, paragraph a, lays down the principle of what we know as the home consumption value as being the basis upon which all ad valorem duties are levied. Section 155 lays down the principle that the genuine invoice must set out the actual money price of the goods in the country whence the same were exported. Section 157 relates to the rates of exchange as between the value of the goods in the currency of the country whence the goods were exported and the equivalent value of the goods in British currency. It has been held that, as the value for dut y must be the home-consumption value in the country of export, the genuine invoice must set out the actual money price paid for goods in the currency of the country whence the goods were exported. Section 157 simply relates as between currency and currency to the proper rate of exchange, which in case of doubt is to be declared by the Minister. The only cases of doubt that could arise were those that related to the rate of exchange with silver countries, or to some similar cause which might lead to doubt as to the par value of exchange between currency and currency. I do not believe it was ever intended that that section should go any further. Customs Order No. 643 lays down the rates as between currency and currency. it has been in force for many years. when that Order was issued ?",28,Customs Bill

55,Mr Jowett,"You regard that as comso we would not be doing it . I believe bwo or tbree persons have brought actions against us, and a test case will be heard to ascertain if what we are doing is right or wrong. It is a question of an interpretation of the law. This practice has led ' to some extraordinary results, and there is no doubt that duties now being collected on some goods makes it-absolutely impossible to profitably sell them. When speaking on this subject on a former occasion I stated that manufacturers of those classes of goods for which there is a world demand have raised the home consumption value -of their goods in the currency of their country to the world's parity converted at the bank rate of exchange. In other -words, French, Italian and other manufacturers are demanding and receiving the world's parity for their goods in their home market. When they sell to Australia and we commence collecting duty on their goods, and, in the case of France, converting their bills into francs at the mint par rate of exchange, and' these goods come into competition 'with other goods sold at the world's parity, and in regard to which we are collecting the dnty at par, the procedure simply puts them out of court. ThisB ill is an attempt to remedy that. It is also an attempt to pre-vent the exporters of France and Italy, when the world demand for their goods may be not quite what it is to-day, using the exchange position to dump these goods in our market at prioes at which neither British nor other manufacturers could compete. I have taken so much trouble to state the causes of the exchange position, and to discriminate as far as possible regarding the influence of these causes, because I wish to show that it is possible to use an exchange position for the dumping of goods should it be thought desirable to do so. voured to show that, whatever the depreciation of a currency, it must be reflected in the price of goods exported from tbe country where it exists; but there are other influences, potent factors in tbe existing exchange position, which need not necessarily be reflected in those prices, of which it w ill eventually be posSydney. sible for such countries to take advantage, if they so desire, unless, of course, in the meantime, tbe exchange position drifts back to its normal pre-war state: If , as is quite possible, the tendency be for prices to f a l l suddenly, these countries can use their exchange position to dump their goods in GreatB r it a in and in Australia.

W h a t would happen if effect were given to the. suggestion of the honourable member for Kooyong, and the Board of Trade were to recommend that duty should be charged on the bank rate of exchange so fa r as exportations from America were concerned ? I think the result would be t h a t American goods would be shut out of this market, or that American goods would be much in the same position as are French and Italian goods to-day when duty is charged on the m in t par rate of exchange. Probably, however, the Board, after taking into consideration all the facts would recommend that things be l e f t in statu quo. I have no objection to the alteration should it be generally desired, though I do not think that it would have any appreciable result. Power is taken in the B ill to allow the Board of Trade to review the position from time to time, because anything may happen. There have been three very decided moves in the appreciation of the German mark, the last one a pretty big one, bringing it up at one j u m p almost a t h i r d in value, though there is still room for great improvement. As the exports of these countries tend to balance the exchange position, it may be necessary for the Board of Trade to move pretty _ rapidly at -any particular time .

But we are concerned in her obligations with regard to repatriation, finance, and economic relations, particularly new obligations relating to enemy debts and property rights. These articles provide, inter alia, for the establishment of clearing offices for the settlement of debts due by or to enemy nationals, and for the retention and liquidation of enemy property. These provisions apply not only to the Austrian Treaty, b u t to the Bulgarian Treaty. The treaties with those two countries are grouped together under this measure, by which it is proposed to carry them into effect. Honourable members have from time to time asked when the condition provided for in the War Precautions A ct will be created, three months after which that Act w ill expire by effluxion of time. These are two of the Treaties to which reference is made in the Statute to which I have referred. We have not yet had before us the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, but, so f a r as I know, that is not covered by the War Precautions Act.

If the Prime Minister cannot see his way to do that, it may be necessary for me to ascertain whether I shall be in order in moving an amendment in the measure now before us.

Wienholt) has raised a point which ought to be settledas soon as possible. Apparently, it is much easier to get into a war than to have peace declared after an armistice has been signed. We, as it were, automatically enter a war, but it seems impossible now to ascertain when the War Precautions Act and other measures which, in our opinion, contain many obnoxious provisions, are to be repealed. Last week, I was asked to arrange for a deputation to wait upon the Prime Minister on the question of the Electoral (War-time) Act and the War Precautions regulations generally; but, as the no-confidence motion was then under consideration, no arrangement could be made, it not being usual for Ministers to receive deputations under the circumstances. Cannot the Prime Minister tell the honourable member for Moreton and others when we shall come to the end of the period during which these Acts shall continue to operate ? If it is desirable to prevent certain persons doing certain things, let definite legislation be introduced, so that we may haye an opportunity of voicing our opinion. The War Precautions Act, with its regulations, is a sort of dragnet, and may be used for purposes for which it was never intended. I say unhesitatingly that that Act and certain regulations have been used for purposes that were never dreamt of when the measure received, the approval of this House. I am anxious to assist in the passage of this or any other measure which will bring us nearer peace with any country, but we ought to know how long these different regulations under the War Precautions Act are to operate. The Electoral (War-time) Act disfranchises certain persons who would be prevented from voting if an election occurred in the near future.

The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has jocularly said that he does not know where to find, the K in g of Hungary; but that is not' the question. 1 The question is whether or not the Government find it convenient to continue the operation of that Act. We are not now dealing with the K in g of Hungary: and, in any case, it is doubtful whether we shall see another monarch in that country.

There is no reason why the Electoral (War-tiine) Act should not be repealed; indeed, in my opinion, the section to which the honorholt) refers, was a blunder. Prime Minister cannot say anything definite in regard to the War Precautions Act, he might repeal that section of the Electoral (War-time) Act which prevents any naturalized alien voting exceptunder certain conditions. If the Government desire that section to remain in force they ought to introduce special legislation to that end, and allow the House to determine the matter. As I said, it is essential that new legislation should be introduced to confer certain powers on the Government, but there is no necessity to wait until the K in g of Hungary is found before we repeal the War Precautions Act. [5.29] I am glad the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) has raised a point on which I feel very strongly.

If the Government were sincere in their desire to get r i d of that Acti t might have been removed, with all its deplorable consequences, long ago. But I hold the Government absolutely guiltless of any desire to repeal it , and I think it is beyond question that by the time it automatically ceases, this Government, if they last so long, w ill have taken good care by fresh legislation to have given effect to its most objectionable features. If the better to do something now so that we may have an opportunity of dealing with the whole question. that is the reason that the Government, instead of taking the better course, have availed themselves, as long as possible, of the technical excuse that we have not yet made peace with our late enemies. We made peace with Germanyi n 1918. That peace was subsequently ratified. We made peace with Austria and Bulgaria, and that peace, too, has been ratified. But peace with Hungary has not yet been ratified. Those who had hoped that three months after the expiration of the ratification of peace with Austria, the War Precautions Act would come to an end, are now met by the technical objection, which the Prime Minister advertised here a few weeks ago, that ,we have not yet ratified the peace with Hungary, and now he tells us cynically that he does not know where the K in g of Hungary is. Of course he does not. While the second reading of this B ill has afforded, the honourable member for Moreton the opportunity of raising the question of the disfranchisement of so many Australian-born representatives of the race from which he springs, I venture to point out to h i m that his consistent support of the Government, which i m posed that iniquity upon his fellow' countrymen challenges, in a very sinister manner, the sincerity of a gentleman who now pretends to be so great a champion say it , but this seems to me so obvious a rejoinder to his expression of interest in the representatives of his race at this late hour of the day. I speak, perhaps, with greater feeling on this subject by reason of the circumstance that the men on whom this outrage was committed were men, not born in the country from which the honourable member for Moreton comes, but born in m y country; that is to say, in the country in which I take a particular interest.

Directly that body ratifies the Treaty we shall follow the same procedure as we are adopting in regard to the Treaty with Austria and Bulgaria. The point I Minister inform us why the ratification of the Peace Treaty with Hungary is delayed ? makes the Treaty of Peace, and then submits it to the various Governments in turn, but, in effect, it is the principal powers which determine when the peace shall be ratified. that when peace was made w i th Austria and Germany, our two principal enemies, the war was over ?' continue in operation the Wa r Precautions Act , so that Australia is governed under regulation instead of under legislation?

What is the need for any pretence in this matter? In common with every other man, I wish to get backto the conditions of pre'-war days, and to fight out political battles under the Constitution and Acts of Parliament; but the bitterness which was created by the War Precautions Act will not be removed so long as that measure remains on the statute-book. Australians should give close consideration to the causes which brought Bulgaria into the war. That country became an opponent of the Allies through the biggest bit of blundering that international diplomacy could possibly perpetrate. Bulgaria should never have come into the war as an enemy of the Allies; but, unfortunately, there was an Economy party in. Great Britain, as there is in other surround us under the existing circumcountries. The entry of Bulgaria on the side of Germany and Austria was one of the principal factors in prolonging the war, because if Bulgaria had not been our enemy, Servia could not bave been attacked in the rear, and there could not have been a continuous line of communication between Turkey and Middle Europe. We are often told that it is a great advantage to Australia to be under the British flag; but the blundering with Bulgaria is an illustration of one of the disadvantages of being associated with the Mother Country. The Bulgarians are almost Eastern in their natures; tbey like a lot of glamour and show. When, like Roumania, they were tain as to which eide they would supj>ort in the war, Germany sent plenipotentiaries extraordinary to Bulgaria to influence the feeling of the people in her favour, so that the Central Powers might get access to Turkey and be able to attack the Allies in the rear. The diplomats of Germany, in the fulness of tlieir knowledge of the Bulgarian, sent ambassadors to Bucharest in smart motor cars and with a great amount of ostentation. They entertained the people in the capital with champagne and turkey, and did many things to impress the Bulgarians with the idea that they were the richer and stronger power. What did Great Britain do? A British plenipotentiary was also sent, but the Government Germany was our principal haggled as to whether they would allow him £60 or £100 for his expenses. Surely the diplomats of the Allies ought to have known that their policy was suicidal. The display made by the Germans completely won over the Bulgarian people, and the consequences were disastrous to the Allies. Bulgarian newspapers said that it was a war to end war ancl to put down might by right. than that. I know the statement. I am making is correct, and the Prime Minister must know as well as I do thut it would have been better for the world if Bulgaria had not become our enemy, and that it was only through the blundering of Allied diplomacy that Bulgaria sided with the Central Powers. I mention this as an illustration of the difficulties which stances. I was rearedunder such conditions as to impress me with the glamour of the British flag; but I say that the Mother Country blundered in regard to Bulgaria as it has done on many other occasions, ancl that her mistake considerably lengthened the war. We have -statesmen in Parliament, and we have politicians. I am one of the politicians; but statesmen have shown that they can blunder more than the politicians. The mishandling of Bulgaria was one instance of the kind. I hope the Prime Minister will assist us in getting back to pre-war conditions. He must see that there is no further need for this pin-pricking legislauncertion. ful Assemblies Bill, the Passports Bill, and the Aliens Registration Bill. required in order to prevent an enemy alien from' injuring Australia or the Empire? It can have no possible effect in that way.

There may have been amongst them a few men who were paid to come to Australia to cause trouble, but the majority of them had come to Australia as refugees from the German system of governanent. Here they proved themselves good citizens, as we understand the term under our present political and economic systems. Instead of being democratic in their political ideas, they were as Conservative as any men in the country. The Prime Minister knows that, so why keep in existence the legislation that was introduced as a protection against them ? It cannot possibly be a political factor to-day.

PerhapsI may be first permittedto say a word as to the extraordinary attitude adopted by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). I do not understand what he wishes us to do. That we should bring down a B ill to give effect to these Treaties, but should be deprived of any power to do so is a most extraordinary suggestion. effect, if not in so many words, that whatever action we were to take under this measure to give effect to the Treaty, should be taken by virtue of Bills or other resolutions of the House. The honourable member cannot have considered the matter seriously. this Treatyi n Australia have reference to the settlement of debts owing by Austrians to Australians 'and by Australians -to Austrians. There will probably be five or six thousand separate debts requiring adjustment under the economic clauses of the Treaty. Does the honor-, able member suggest that we should bring down each one of them to be settled in this House? member assented to a Treaty wi+h Germany giving us the very power which is sought in this B ill . It is now in operation, but the Government have handed over to a Public Trustee the responsibility of adjusting these debts, and, outside the reparation 'clauses and the control of the Islands, which are matters for this Parliament, there is little else which concerns us in the ratification of peace with Austria. Therefore, I pass by the honourable member's suggestion as one that is impracticable, and as one that I am unable to understand, let alone accept. The honourable members for Moreton( Mr Wienholt), Dampier( Mr Gregory), and Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) are very anxious to know when we may expect that day which is the condition precedent to the expiry of the War Precautions Act. They are not at all satisfied w i th my reference, by way of interjection, to the K in g of Hungary, which their statements. I intended to quote the section of the War Precautions Act , and, now that I am on my feet, I gladly take this opportunity of explaining the position. The Wa r Precautions Act saysThis Act shall continue in operation during the continuance of the present state* of ""war, and no longer. "" The present state of war "" is defined as continuing "" u n t i l the issue of a proclamation by the Governor General that the war between His Majesty the K in g and the German Emperor, and between His Majesty the K in g and the Emperor of AustriaK in g of Hungary has ceased."" So far as Germanv and Austria are concerned, the condition precedent He said, in has been satisfied. There remains Hungary, which is now divorced from Austria, and, as I explained by way of interjection, peace with Hungary has been agreed to, but has not yet been ratified by the different Parliaments of the Great Powers. I am sure honourable memThe main operations of bers will not censure me for any delay in making peace with Hungary. I had the honour, if it be an honour, which seems very doubtful, of introducing the War Precautions B ill of 1914, when circumstances were somewhat different from what they are now in the arrangement of parties and in other directions. A t that time a good deal of criticism was directed against the GovernThe honourable ment from tlie benches behind the Ministry, on which some of my honourable",43,Robert Best H E Delivered A Measure Has Been Repaired I N This So That
168,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime Minisfriends who are now opposite were then located. Speaking as the result of the experience of five years of war, I regard the passage of that measure as haying been absolutely necessary; but I entirely agree with those who think that it is bad for a-country that delights to boast that it is governed by a Parliament elected by a free people, that it should be governed by regulations. BefoTe the Christmas recess I hope the Treaty with Hungary w i ll be ratified, but, if it is not, I shall do my best to give the House the opportunity of repealing the Wa r Precautions Act. I make one reservation in that regard. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr poles, as to what should be the policy for Richard Poster) has pointed out how necessary it is that this Parliament should have certain powers conferred on it by Statute, and as I agree w i th the view put forward by the honourable member, I wish, therefore, the House to clearly understand that whether the War Precautions Act expires by proclamation or as the result of legislation passed by this Parliament, the Government will introduce, if it considers it necessary, which I do in the present circumstances, legislation that will give it . statutory power to deal with certain conditions. Otherwise the Government would have no authority to deal with a position that might menace the safety of the Commonwealth. However, the circumstances will then be entirely different. We should be administering an Act of Parliament. When the Electoral (War-time) B ill lost in asking the House to assent to it , so was introduced I am sure it was necessary. that the War Precautions Act w ill autoNo one can accuse me of being halfhearted in this matter. like about the honourable member.

If a war broke or which may hereafter exist, and we shall out between Great Britain and GermanyI would be for Great Britain. I agree with what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) has said. Now that the war is over, we have to deal with a new set of conditions. It was necessary, in the interests of the country, when the war was raging to prevent.those who were the friends and supporters of Germany from dominating the political life of Australia. I do not know what their views are. One thing is certain, that in Germany there are at least two sections of thought as widely set apart as are the the world and even for Germany. I do not know to which section those who are in Australia belong; but I am not one of those who believe in life-long vendettas. While there was a war I fought. Now that the war is over I want to create conditions that w ill make for peace, and I agree that this part of the electoral law to which the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Wienholt) has referred has outlived its usefulness. The honourable member w ill hardly expect me, without an opportunity of consulting my colleagues, to make a definite statement on the matter; but, speaking for myself, I carr see no reason why the Electoral (War-time) A.ct should not be repealed. I hope that the Treaty with Hungary will be ratified.

I trust, further, that I have l e f t no ground for misunderstanding concerning where my sympathies lie, while at the same time stating-jus t as I did in the midst of the war-that I have quite understood why Germans adopted the attitude they did, and that I should have thought very little of them if they had not.

While there was a unanimous decision in -regard to having more comprehensive provisions for naturalization w it h in the Empire, there was a great difference of opinion as to who should give eifect to them. A t one stage, it was suggested that GreatB r i tain should legislate for the whole Empire; but as that raised the question of sovereign rights, it was thought that the British Parliament should deal only with Great Britain, and that other parts of the Empire should pass their own legislation. In 1914, the Imperial Parliament passed an Act somewhat similar to this measure, and it was then necessary for the Dominions to enact a similar law. Owing to the war intervening, action in the Commonwealth was delayed; but I do not know whether we have lost anything because, as the result of experience, it has been shown that there were many defects in the Imperial A.ct passed in 1914. In 1917, an amending measure became law, and the B ill now before honourable members is based on that Statute. Nationality B ill , because it deals with nationality in general, and it is Empirewide in its scojie.

Honourable members are probably aware that, under our present law-apar t from war conditions-a n alien has to be resident in the Commonwealth for two years before he is entitled to become naturalized. Under this measure, it w ill mean five years, but the previous residence need not all have been spent in Australia.

It does not follow that because this measure becomes law Chinese, Indians, or any of those prohibited under our Immigration Act can come to Australia. That law remains as it is at present; but we are broadening the scope of our naturalization laws to cover those whom we' consider are fit The measure is entitled a people to become citizens of the Commonwealth. Quite recently I have heard a number of complaints from people who come from Mount Lebanon, and who are placed at a great disadvantage under our Commonwealth laws. Mount Lebanon is a small principality which, since I860, has been under French and British rule, and is surrounded by the TurkishE m pire. Under our laws there is no power to naturalize these people, and quite a number of them, w it h whom I have come in contact, are as good citizens as we have in the Commonwealth.

227,Mr Poynton,"It is an inherentrefuse permission to any one to land in the country. that that right could be exercised in regard to an Australian. matic on the point. Certainly we have a right to exclude from the Commonwealth any other person, though it is rarely that the right is exercised. The Governor General may revoke a certificate obtained by false representation, or fraud, or concealment of material circumstances, or, if the person to whom the certificate is granted has during a war unlawfully traded with or communicated with the enemy, or .has within five years of the date of the grant of the certificate been sentenced by a Court to imprisonment for not less than twelve months, to penal servitude, or to a fine of not less than £100, or was not of good character at the date of the grant of the certificate. But provision is made for an inquiry by a committee presided over by a person who is, or has been, a Justice of the High Court, or a Judge of a Supreme Court, and this inquiry is to be conducted in such manner as the Governor General may direct. Very liberal treatment is given to British-born or Australian-born wives of denaturalized persons, who, under the Bill, will retain their British or Australian nationality unless they signify a desire for the nationality of their husbands. As the law stands, a British-born or Australian-born woman who marries a foreigner takes his nationality, and so do their children, and should the husband be naturalized, and subsequently denaturalized, the wife and children, of course, follow him. Under the Bill, however, the wife of a denaturalized person may, if she is British or Australian born, retain her British or Australian nationality. On the other hand, if she desires to follow her the policy of the Government, in husband, she can apply to take his nationality. Her children will have the mother's nationality, and should she elect to be denaturalized, will have the right to apply, within six months after arrival at the age of twenty-one years, for Australian naturalization. SinceI took office, quite a large number of persons whose wives by their marriage had lost their British or Australian nationality have been naturalized. I do not think that there is a case in which I have refused naturalization to a person of good character who has resided in Australia for a reasonable length of time. Italians who did not go to the war ? what cases the honourable member has in his mind. that he is granting naturalization to Australian-born women married to aliens? husbands of such women are naturalized, the wives re-assume their Australian nationality. There was never a more liberal nationalization measure introduced into this Parliament. who applied for naturalization get a reference from the Italian Consul in addition to references from three Australians ? what case the honourable member refers. I have had letters from a number of persons complaining that I am naturalizing too many Italians; but I draw no distinction, if the. character of the applicant is good. I refer do not possess birth certificates, and have no documentary evidence of the fact that they are Italians. It is extremely difficult for them to get evidence from Italy. Many Italians were naturalized under the State laws, and many more under our Naturalization Act. Many are still being naturalized. that they had to produce that evidence previously. more evidence is required to-day than previously. My policy, and indeed connection with this matter, is to deal with applicants for naturalization as liberally as possible, so long as they are of good character. I have even gone farther than that. I recognise that during the war period panic ideas were sometimes prevalent, with the result that the reports which we obtained in regard to certain applicants for naturalization were not as reliable as they might have been.

I suppose it and a number of other Acts will be passed, so far as they are necessary to perpetuate the main provisions of the War Precautions Act , because there is in power in Australia a Government who cannot divest themselves of the war feeling, and the pleasure of indulging war powers and war restrictions, and, in a general way, if I may say so without giving offence, making themselves, as far as is consistent with true patriotism, public nuisances. The Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Poynton) contends that this B i ll is absolutely necessary, in order to bring us into line w it h the legislation enacted in other countries, and that unless it is passed it w ill be very difficult for citizens of the Commonwealth to travel. the two previous speakers, I Tegret that, now that the war is out of the way, we should be bringing in restrictive legislaintpose severe penalties on any person tion every day throughout the British who makes a mistake.

In other words, the Minister says that the carrying of a passport is no guarantee to a traveller that he will be able to land in Australia. If it is necessary for people's freedom to be curtailed in this way, and for them to be compelled before they can sail from Australia to England, or from England to Australia, to obtain a passport, then dt ought to be equally incumbent on the Government of the country of destination to accept that passport in all good f a it h . If a person is armed w i th a passport we have no right to refuse to allow him to enter. If we can so refuse, the passport .is of no value. We must give some consideration to the trouble to which people are put. Wet r y to simplify things in our own country as much as possible, yet many people have been put to great inconvenience in the endeavour to obtain passports in order to go away. I have had letters on the subject, and Senator Gardiner, in another place, quoted the case of a lady who found it difficult to obtain a passport w it h in a reasonable time of the date for which she had booked to sail. If we are to pass legislation of this kind, every facilit y should be given to the citizens of Australia to obtain a passport within a reasonable period. I cannot understand why we should enact legislation of this kind.

I object to the evil customs of Europe being transplanted to Australia. It will not be long before Australia is in the same position as some European countries, such as Germany and Austria, where a man cannot go round the corner, without a passport, which he must take to some oflicial, who asks all sorts of impertinent questions. I foresee the time when a man passing from Victoria to New South Wales will be subjected to scrutiny by some meddlesome official, whose especial duty it will be to see that the working class agitators do not freely mix with the community. What, is the necessity for such restrictions? A r e the Government afraid of a revolution ? Are a' large number of people, who will seek to wreck the present system of government, tryin g to gain admission to Australia?

The record of ever}' militant journalist and politician in Australia is known to the authorities in Europe, and if any of those men attempted to land in America, they would be watched, if not refused a landing.
