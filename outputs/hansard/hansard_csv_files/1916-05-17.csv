TheB ill is a lengthy one, containing some fifty-five clauses, b u t PartI . , and the latter portions of the measure, consist of machinery clauses taken almost bodily from our Income Tax Act. Th© clauses which demand the attention of honourable members are clauses 7 to 17, inclusive. Honourable members will observe that the title of the B ill is the "" War-time Profits Tax Assessment B ill . "" The phrase ""WartimeP r of it s "" has been chosen because there might be a difficulty in proving that a war-time profit was a war profit. The Government considered it advisable to call the B ill a War-time ProfitsB ill , because certain firms and companies are enjoying huge profits during war timeprofits as high as those reaped by firms which might be deemed to be particularly engaged in making war profits. Therefore, all war-time profits in any trade or business above a standard or date and line to be defined will be taxable to the extent of 50 per cent. Before being taxable, however, the profits must exceed the sum of £ 2 0 0 over a f u l l year, or £100 over a half-year. This exemption, which w ill mean very little to a large firm or company, w ill , nevertheless, mean a greab deal to smaller business people, and will exempt the latter from taxation on war-time profits. Sir WILLIAMIBVINE orable member's question by asking another ? DoI understand that the honourable member is in favour of no exemption I sincerely hope I may whatever in the matter of war-time profits? However, I am thankful to the distinction in this case? of small business people. If the honourable gentleman w ill propose an amendment in favour of abolishing the exemption, I shall be very glad to put the matter before the Government for their favorable consideration. I imagine there is no necesformed any opinion on the matter at a l l. I was merely seeking for information. All the referon the profits arising from any business to which this B ill applies, during any accounting period ending after the 30th Under tha cirJune, 1915. In the United Kingdom the War ProfitsB ill was passed in 1915, and covered the first eleven months of the war. The Government do not propose to tax the profits accruing during that period, because the firms and companies have probably in all cases distributed their profits, and it might cause a very great deal of irritation if we now demanded that they should make good those profits. to draw a distinction between the man who grows the wheat and the man who afterwards handles it ? the provisions of this B ill , which from its very nature is technical and abstruse in some particulars, it is necessary for honourable members to keep clearly in view three factors-the profit standard, the pre-war standard, and the percentage standard. Now, the profit standard will vary in different businesses, and in order to discover what is that standard we must first ascertain what was the pre-war standard. The pre-war standard, too, will vary in different businesses, but in all cases it must reach the percentage standard, which is defined in this B ill as the return of 6 per cent, on the capital invested in the case of a company, and of 7 per cent, in the case of a private firm. company has increased its capital in the meantime it will be allowed 6 per cent, or 7 per cent, on the additional capital ?",8,Higgs Read A First Time Second Reading

56,Mr Boyd,"Does that mean that if aphase of the matter presently. Assuming that amounted to a neb return of 5 per cent, on the capital invested and the post-war profits represented 6 per cent, after allowing for an exemption of £200, that company would not pay a war-time profits tax, would he added to the .5 per cent, netted before the war, and its profits would thus fall outeide the taxable arena. But if a company's pre-war profits amounted to 5 per cent., and its postwar profits to 10 per cent., after allowing for a £200 exemption, it follows that 1 per cent, would be added to its 5 per cent, pre-war profits, and the balance would be divided between the Government and the company. In order that the pre-war standard of profits may be arrived at, a taxpayer will be allowed to average his profits over any two of the last three pre-war trade years. If , however, he feels that the last three pre-war trade years were years of abnormal depression, the Commissioner of Taxation will allow him to calculate his profits upon four out of the last six pre-war trade years, but he will not permit him to plead that the last three pre-war trade years were years of abnormal depression unless he can show that during those years his profits were at least 25 per cent, less than they were when averaged over the previous threa years man allow for the normal growth of business in his calculations? orable member would consider normal growth in the case of a business would, in the minds ' of other people, mean abnormal prosperity. is not justified in making that remark, because he knows nothing about the matter. quite in accord with the honourable member's customary and polite method of replying. no definition of "" p r of it s "" in this Bill? that the Treasurer is quite out of order in discussing the details of this measure. In moving its second reading he should confine his remarks to its main prin ciples. me, I wish to say that the honourable a company's pre-war profits member for Balaclava considers that I have been discourteous to him. He asked me whether I would make any allowance for the normal growth of a business. May I point out to him that ono man might consider that the growth of his because 1 per cent, business had not been in any way normal, and tliat he had sustained abnormal losses? In the B ill we have provided tlie definition for which th© honourable member for Bourke is asking, and I think he will find it quite ample. Honourable members will be interested to know that the B ill will apply to all businesses carried on in Australia or owned or carried on in any other place by persons ordinarily resident in Australia, excepting businesses carried on by municipal corporations, other local governing bodies, by public authorities, by societies registered under a Friendly Societies Act of the Commonwealth or of a State cr Territory, and not carried on for pecuniary profit, or by a religious, charitable, or public educational institution. Agriculture within Australia is also exempted. toralists, too ? toralists will get the benefit of the £200 exemption over their ordinary profits. W it h regard to agriculture, the Government are of opinion that the cultivation of the soil in its various forms, such as the growing of cereals, f r u it , vegetables, and flowers, ought to b© exempted. I imagine what the honinclude sugar growing, but it will not in clude the timber industry or dairying. Dairy farmers will be in th© same position as the small pastoralists; they will have the benefit of the £200 exemption. All persons, firms, or companies conducting businesses associated with agriculture, such as commission agents for the purchase and sale of the products of the soil, will be regarded as taxable, but the Government, in their sympathy with the man on the land, consider that tlie farmers, as a class, do not, as a rule, earn 6 per cent, upon the capital invested I would point out after making due allowances for all charges. The exemptions also include offices, or employments, and any profession the profits of which depend mainly on the personal qualifications of the person by whom it is carried on, and in which",9,Higgs Read A First Time Second Reading

The honourable member for Henty has referred to cases of capital being increased. Where capital has increased during an accounting period, or portion of an accounting period, an allowance in profits is made to enable a return of the percentage standard, viz., 6 per cent, or 7 per cent, on the increased capital. creased during an accounting period, an addition to the profits must be made amounting to 6 per cent, or 7 per cent, on the capital withdrawn from the firm. If a firm with a capital of £50,000 is producing a return of 10 per cent., and takes half that capital and invests it in some other concern, the Commissioner w ill add to the profits on account of the capital which has been taken out of the firm. Provision is made that the Commissioner may, in any case where he thinks fit, allow the tax to be paid in instalments of such amount, and payable at such times, as he directs. NowI come to the request of the honourable member for Bourke, who asks for a definition. The profits shall be taken to be the actual profits arising in the accounting period, after making certain deductions which are allowed under the Income TaxA c t , such as all losses and outgoings, including commission, discount, travelling expenses, interest, expenses actually incurred in gaining or producing profits; all rates and taxes, including State and Federal land taxes; deductions for wear and tear, or for any expenditure of a capital nature for renewals. to get? seems to think that if we allow these deductions we shall get no revenue. These deductions are only those whioh are allowed in the case of the income tax, from which we derived £3,000,000 this year. We must allow the deductions in order to arrive at the net profit. TheB ill providesDeductions for wear and tear or for any expenditure of a capital nature for renewals, or for the development of the business or otherwise in respect of the business, shall not be allowed except' such as may be allowed under the Income Tax Assessment Acts 1915, and if allowed shall be only of such amount as appears to the Commissioner to be reasonably and properly attributable to the year or accounting period. Deductions shall not be allowed on account of the liability to pay, or the payment of, Commonwealth or State income tax or wartime profits tax, but a deduction shall be It will mean that the allowed for any sum which has been paid in respect of the profits on account of any wartime profits tax or similar tax imposed in any country outside the Commonwealth. This brings me to the latter portion of the resolution passed by the InterState Chambers of Commerce Conference at Brisbane, pointing out that, unless some equitable provision is made to meet the case of British companies whose AusWhere capital has been detraliau trading profits are subject to taxation of a similar character in Great Britain, a manifest injustice will be wrought. The honourable member for Hindmarsh, for whom I have great respect, and who takes a very keen interest in financial questions, and the desirability of making people pay according to their ability to pay a principle with which I quite agree-ha s interjected that by following the lines of the British war profits tax we should not get very much revenue. I propose to give an illustration for the purpose of showing that if we do as well in some cases as is being done in the United Kingdom we should tax a fair amount of profits if they are made, and also for the purpose of showing that the provision for avoiding double taxation is a reasonable one. The Colonial Ammunitio n Company Limited carries on portion of its business in Australia, and I understand from the Commissioner of Taxation that it has no objection to its business in this regard being disclosed. Th© gross income of the company is £129,652. The deductions allowable under the income tax in Australia are £39,435, leaving a taxable income of £90,217. The amount of the Commonwealth tax of l s . 6d. in H o w much do you expect the £ 1 is £6,766 5s. 6d. against a total net profit of £90,217. In England £42,000 has been assessed as war-time profits and income tax. The Commonwealth collects a further £6,766, and the State of Victoria collects over £5,000. It w ill thus be seen that in the absence of a provision to make a deduction for a tax payable in England, the whole of this company's profits would be absorbed. vernment reciprocate ? w ill reciprocate in that regard.

A l ready I have had brought under my notice a case where the manager of a business hopes to avoid the war-time profits taxation by increasing the salary he sets apart for himself. He will not be allowed to do so. It is further provided that, in estimating the profits, no account shall be taken of income received from investments, except in the case of l if e assurance businesses and businesses where the principal business consists of the making of investments; and thab in the case of any contract extending beyond one accounting period, and only partially performed during that period, the Commissioner shall attribute to each of the accounting periods in which the contract was partially performed such proportion of the entire profits or losses or estimated profits or losses as is properly attributable to such accounting periods respectively. The profits of any pre-war trade year are to be computed on the same principles and subject to the same provisions as the profits of the accounting period. When I said that we had followed the lines of the Imperial measure I meant bhat we have done so to a very great extent, but we do not adopt its definition of capital.

100,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [4.20],"essential for the proper prosecution of the war. The time for the discussion of this question is long overdue. We have been hurled into a contest which we believe can be won only by marshalling the whole of our manhood and resources side by side with those of the Allied Eorces in Europe. Under the present system we are dependent on the public spirit and self-sacrifice of a section of our people to voluntarily do the work which the whole nation should be doing. In this war sacrifice should be spread equally and equitably over the whole community, in stead of our allowing the more publicspirited of our young men to take upon themselves the burden of the Empire. Sometimes we seem to forget that we are fighting the most highly organized military nation that the world has ever knowna nation that for many years has brought science and organization to bear on its whole civil and military system, and we can successfully oppose to that preparedness nothing short of the entire resources of the Allied Forces. In time of peace, thc British people are not a highly organized military nation. have had to depend exclusively on the authority of our Democracy, and there can be no shadow of doubt that at the present time Democracy as a war machine is on its t r i a l. That central authority which alone can exercise the power necessary to prosecute the war has in a large measure failed to properly organize the resources of the nation for war purposes. Compulsion does not apply alone to the necessity for sending the maximum numbers to the front . It is adopted in order that the manhood and resources of a nation may be so ordered and regulated that its utmost effort can be put into the fight. A lot of fustian is talked about compulsion. whole structure of society is based on some form of compulsion. pelled to obey laws, and to support"" certain institutions, sion falls on the individual severity, but the general welfare of the State makes it necessary that such compulsion shall be exercised in order that the authority of the State may be paramount. dealt with by Mr Hughes in 1907, when he introduced into the House a motion for the establishment of a system of compulsory military training in the Mr Sampson, The position was so well put by the Prime Minister that I think, at this stage, the House should have the benefit of his utterances. Referring to compulsion, as it applies to society generally, he saidCompulsion, to which my critics take exception, is the very essence of the government of these States, and, indeed, the very essence of civilization itself. Those who object to compulsion are recruited chiefly from two schools -the Socialists and the Individualists. It is dimcult to understand how either school can consistently object to the proposal merely because it is compulsory in its nature. The Socialistic theory depends absolutely upon compulsion, the Individualistic upon absolute freedom. But the Individualist is not less illogical in this inatter than is the Socialist, because the whole system of law, which regulates and orders all things in a civilized community, is based upon compulsion Absolute freedom is a chimera. All men are bound in their actions by thc law. A citizen is not told to do something merely because it is right, hut because it is the law, and if he does not do it something happens to him. A law without a penalty is usually of no effect, and is not regarded seriously. That lays down the principle of compulWe sion on which society is based, and it could scarcely be stated with more force. During a period of peace, after calm, f u l l and exhaustive discussion on the platform , in the press, and in this House, we established compulsory military training in Australia, and that law has been in dorsed by two successive Governments. It was believed at that time that the only way in which Australia could properly defend herself was by a compulsory system of citizen forces, so that each individual, who enjoys the rights and benefits and privileges of our laws, should have laid upon h i m the duty and responsibility of defending the country. If it was found necessary during a period of peace to place such a law upon the statute-book, what can be said of a Government, who As a matter of fact, the are the central authority, and the only authority that can enforce such a law, We are comfailin g to perform its obvious duty of putting the Defence Act into operation? and sometimes compulI know that it has been urged that our with great Defence Act in this regard does not apply because the enemy is not battering at our gates. But who can say that there is any difference between defending Australia on The issue of compulsion was Australian soil and defending her on the battlefields of Europe? No one who calmly and dispassionately considers the question can hold for a moment that we Commonwealth. are not as much on our defence now in meeting the great military organizations of Europe as we should be if confronted with the enemy on Australian soil. The Defence Act, after f u l l discussion, was declared to be necessary for the efficient defence of the nation; and yet it has been allowed to remain inoperative, simply because the Government have failed to show themselves strong and courageous enough to make it applicable to the present war. They have failed to make that necessary and slight amendment which would render the Act an efficient instrument in the effective prosecution of the war. The DefenceA c t was passed in 1909, and its intention was clearly shown by the honourable member for Gippsland on Friday last. The war provisions of an earlier Act were embodied in tlie Act of 1909, and further .endorsed by a subsequent Act of 1910; and these set for t h a thorough scheme of organization. Under these Acts, which found support in every part of the House, the Minister of Defence, or the Governor General, has power to call out for service on the battlefield all men between the ages of eighteen and sixty years; and I do not see why those provisions should not be proclaimed and made applicable to the present conditions. We could, I think, leave our medical men to discriminate between those who should and those who should not go on active service UD to the age of sixty years. Every one of ns who has been on the recruiting platform mnst, in view of our present inefficient system of voluntaryism, have felt a certain amount of diffidence in asking others to do what we are not prepared to do ourselves; and I , for one, am quite in favour of making those sections apply to present circumstances. Ewing's DefenceB ill was before the House in 1908 the present Prime Minister dwelt on the necessity for compulsion; and the views he then expressed afford the strongest argument for the application of such a system now. On that occasion the present Prime Minister saidWliy should only one man in forty be asked to bear upon his shoulders the responsibility and burden of defending his country? It is true that under the present system that burden is voluntarily undertaken, and whilst that is mueh in the volunteer's favour it is very much against those who decline to do their part in the defence of the Commonwealth. It appears to me, and to all who support tlie principle embodied in thc Bill, that since defence con[286 ] cems every one, every one has a right to take part in it. The case could hardly be put better. The debates in this House oni that occasion show conclusively that the present debate should have been unnecessary,, for the Government, shortly after the war broke out, ought to have introduced a measure applying the compulsory provisions. We prided ourselves on baving led the whole Empirei n placing the duty and responsibility of defence on all citizens. We were proud of the fact that we had no standing army in the ordinary sense of the word-that we had eliminated from our Democracy all traces of militarism as understood in Europe-and had imposed the duty of defence on all those who enjoyed the protection and privileges of our laws. We have also, had utterances by the Prime Minister on this subject since he l e f t Australia, and these show, I think, that we ought not to allow th© voluntary system to continue unless we are prepared to face the danger of discredit being, cast on the Commonwealth. We are all proud of the Prime Minister's brilliant and eloquent speeches at the heart of the Empire, in which he has expressed the sentiments of Australia in regard to trade relations and Empire preference. The righ t honourable gentleman has also expressed views as to the need for still more efficienit military organization, and, when in Canada, at a luncheon given to him by the PrimeM in ister of the Dominion, the Leader of the Opposition, members of the Cabinet, and Judges, he saidAustralia has been able t» accomplish what she has because, as the eovHcr stone of her democratic edifice, she had a system of compulsory military training. In a Democracy When Sir Thomas every man must be taught tliat the primary duty of a citizen was ability to defend his country, his home, and himseff. That is reported in the Times of 25th February of this year; and, later on, at a great public meeting in London, the right honourable gentleman declaredGermany's military power must be utterly crushed. In no other way can the peace of thc world be secured. Peace under any other conditions would be only a period of feverish preparation for another and even Hi more fearful struggle. Here we have it laid down that th© system of compulsion is the corner stone of tlie organization of Australia, and he urges greater effort and efficiency in the prosecution of the wax. I i i Great Britain a system of compulsion has been introduced, and yet, in spite of all, our Defence Act, so far as the present crisis is concerned, is allowed to remain inoperative, simply because the Government, apparently, have not the courage to take the proper steps for the moblization of our Forces. sory service has been introduced. Zealand some such system has been adopted, or is about to be adopted. suggested; there is no guarantee that it will be adopted. gested as a policy. it being adopted. any honourable member, or anybody outside of this chamber, will dispute the fact that if we had a system of 'compulsion operating, and if the central authority were able to call up our manhood and to marshal our resources in a scientific manner, it would be able to prosecute the war much more effectively than it is doing at the present time. ""We know that the Government have a representative in London, in the person of the PrimeM in ister, and we know that because of the speeches which he has delivered there in favour of a more active prosecution of th© war much is expected of Australia. Th© Acting Prime Minister, too, recognises the peril of the present situation, and that recognition carries with it the responsibility of putting into the fight every ounce of our energies. Senator Pearce, in speaking a little time ago, saidDefeat in this war meant good-night fot ever to the British Empire, and it meant goodnight for ever to Australia and all ideals of advancement along the lines on which we believed true human advancement should run. How great and strong was the call to every man of military ago in Australia to-day, when their lives, liberties, and freedom, and the very existence of Australia, were all at stake But there is a suspicion that the directI venture to say that the utterances of the Prime Minister and of the Acting Prime Ministeri n themselves convincingly show that there is only one course for this Parliament to pursue if Australia is to discharge her duty to the present war.1 Public opinion is now conscription throughout the Commonwealth. It is obvious that we are not doing cur utmost in the prosecution of the Titanic struggle in which the Empire is engaged. Realizing all these facts, I contend that this House is entitled to know why tlie Government are paltering with the important and vital question of compulsion. Do they regard the pressure exerted by the organized unions of Australia, upon which they depend for their political existence, as more important than is their sacred and honourable duty of bringing the centralized authority of the State to bear in the prosecution of the war in the most effective manner possible ? The resolution adopted last week by the TradesH a l l Council in reference to . conscription does not reflect the opinion of the unions throughout Australia. I am satisfied that a referendum on the question would disclose a very different result. Tens of thousands of unionists have gone to the front, and tens of thousands more are in favour of putting forward every effort that we can towards the prosecution of the war. I do not know that the TradesH a l l Council has not l e f t itself open to a charge of being opposed to the voluntary system as well as to the compulsory system. One may search the exterior of the TradesH a l l building in vain for a single poster calling upon men to volunteer for the front. exhibit posters there. that the executive forces which control the TradesH a l l I am excluding the great body of the rank and file of the Labour organizations-ar e opposed to voluntary enlistment as well as to conscription 1 to the honourable member to learn that sons of the members of the executive have enlisted, and are already at the front. ar© thousands of unionists at the front. action section, the Syndicalistic section, which is eating its way into the executive power of the various trade organizations throughoub Ausbralia-the section which Mr Hughes declared has neither religion nor nationality, and ought to be cast oub the Empirei n connection with of the Labour movement as one would cast devils out of swine-is opposed bo demanding the introduction of bhe volunbary sysbem as well as bo conscription.",14,Budget 1915 16

Great Britain has shown the need which exists for compulsory service, notwithstanding that she has already enrolled some 5,000,000 of men. a similar percentage in Australia. corresponding percentage of our eligible population. I am not going to undervalue the organization which has been effected in the Commonwealth. Defence Department is to be commended for the wonderful work it has done in the enrolment, equipment, and transportation of such large numbers of men as have already gone to the front . Buti t is not a question whether we have done as much as Great Britain, Canada, or any other country. What we have to bear in mind is that we are engaged in a struggle which threatens our very existence, and that, according to the Acting Prime Miuister, if we lose in that struggle, we may say good-bye to the independence of Australia and to all the privileges we enjoy. We phave to ask ourselves whether we have -done all that we could do to successfully prosecute the war, and, if we have not, we have failed in our duty to the extent to which we have failed to put forward the best efforts of which we are capable. We ought to prosecute the war in a way that w ill be worthy of us as an integral part of the Empire. I hope that this debate w ill cause the Government to come forward with some plain statement of what their future attitude on the war say how fa r they intend to defy, and for ever destroy, the influence of the authority that exists in Labour organizations, and which, if not met, w ill threaten the very authority of the State. They should tell us why it is that, after being in power for something like eighteen mouths, they have made no attempt to put into operation in the conduct of the war the compulsory provisions of an Act upon our statute-book which received the assent of all parties, and was ratified on two or three occasions long before the declaration of the war. The question of what is to be done in connection with the repatriation of returned soldiers is to be brought before the Housei n a concrete form , but I have one or two observations to make upon the matter at this stage. I wish, first of all, to pay my tribute of praise to the work done by the honourable member for Wannoni n connection w it h the scheme of repatriation he has organWe have not enlisted anything like ized, and which has been so consistently successful in his own electorate and in men. that of the honourable member for Corangamite. I wish also to congratula te some of our public-spirited citizens on the princely character of the donations they have made to the f u n d established by the honourable The member. Whatever scheme may be decided upon by this Housef o r the benefit of our returned soldiers w ill have m y hearty support, and I shall do all I can to make it a success. I must, however, express regret that in connection with the B ill which has been introduced to deal with the subject, the Government have not taken the view that the debt we owe to those who have fought on our behalf would be best redeemed by assistance afforded from the National Treasury. I believe in compulsion for military service. I believe that those who are fighting for the country at the f r o n t should be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue derived from general taxation. I believe that pensions paid to or on behalf of soldiers should be met in the same way, and in my view, it follows that a repatriation scheme for the benefit of our returned soldiers, and to redeem -the debt which the country owes them, should be financed, on the same principle, out of general taxation. I woul,d not exclude voluntary contributions from those who are prepared to is to be, and that they w ill render assistance in that way, but I say that the great burden of the cost of the repatriation of our soldiers should be borne by the Government, and financed by their powers of taxation. I regret that the Government have not realized their duty in that respect more clearly. I am sorry that the Minister for the Navy is not present, because I wish to say a word or two on the question of shipping. We know the difficulties that have been experienced in getting bur wheat away to the markets of the world. The Minister of Trade and Customs may be able to say how f a r the Government have taken charge of shipping in Australia, and to what extent they have worked in conjunction with the Imperial authorities in connection with its control.

Yet the Imperial Government and the Government of the Commonwealth have apparently allowed the shipping companies to do just as they please. To show how the value of ships has gone up as a result of the high freights which may be earned during the war, I may mention that a vessel which, before the war, could be bought for £7,000, has, since the war, been sold for £47,000. Instances might be quoted in which, owing to the enormous increase of freights, the returns from one short voyage have been sufficient to cover the cost of a vessel previous to the war. It does not appear to be generally known that thc Imperial Government have taken the war risks on vessels, though not on tlieir cargoes, during the war, and have guaranteed the owners against loss. The ship-owners are giving nothing in return for this special protection which they enjoy under the guarantee of the Imperial Government. member suggest that the Government should take over the shipping? that there should have been a little more organization by the different Governments of the Empire for the control of shipping during the period of th© war. We know that freights have increased many times over. The freight on some goods from America has gone up from £ 2 to nearly £ 2 0 per ton, and on the top of that there is increased insurance and other charges owing to the war. This is a matter which the Government should look into. They should ascertain how far the use of the vessels which they have commandeered for transports in the carriage of cargo has indirectly contributed to the enormous increase of shipping freights. In the Budget the Treasurer has told us that the Government earned something like £1,000,000 from freights, and that after meeting all expenses there has been a profit returned to the Treasury of some hundreds of thousands of pounds. We should be given some in formation as to the basis on which the Government fix tlie freights charged for the carriage of goods by these transport vessels. Do they make use of the large number of vessels they have commandeered for the transport of troops in such a way as to keep freights down to a reasonable level ? A good deal might have been done in that direction towards the reduction of freights charged on general merchandise. ber referring to interned steamers only ? commandeered by the Government for th© transport of troops. some of them empty. used for the carriage of goods, and there is a suspicion that the Government have been adopting the current rates of ""freight on all goods carried in these commandeered vessels.

I am afraid that in the matter of Government and private expenditure we have failed to realize that the country is at war. We can see no signs of economy in Government Departments or amongst the civil population. Business is going on as usual, and, as a matter of fact, the unlocking of large sums of money has created something like a boom in many parts of Australia. We have spent £70,000,000 so fa r in this war. Our war loans have realized £35,000,000, and £20,000,000 has been borrowed on the credit of our note issue. So far, however, there has been no sign of economy in public expenditure or on the part of private individuals. self 1 member wishes to know, I am prepared to tell h i m privately. I was about to point out that we are unlocking large reserves of capital in Australia by the flotation of our war loans. We have already raised £35,000,000 locally, and probably before the war is over another £50,000,000 will have to be taken out of our reserve capital. circulation, but after the war we shall have to borrow more money to meet our obligations. the world will be shut against us, and we shall have to borrow locally to carry on our public undertakings. A t a time like this the Government should set an example in economy by curtailing administrative expenses in such a way as will enable the money so saved to be placed in the war chest, and thus help to defray our expenditure on the war. It is difficult to resist the temptation to follow the honourable member's arguments and to combat them, a task which, from my point of view, is comparatively easy. I am against conscription absolutely; I am against it on principle. To me it seems peculiar that the thing we condemn in Germany, and which we are agreed is the main cause of this lamentable war, I am asking the Goshould be held up now as the remedy for the destruction of the very evil we are complaining about. I find myself unable -unlik e the honourable member for Henty, who admitted last night that he had had abandoned his previous predilections for the voluntary system-to agree that it has failed.

Of course, we have conscription for home defence. Society, under our present condition of civilization, could not exist without some form of compulsion. We compel people to register, and we compel doctors to register .and to notif y any outbreak of disease; but in every such case compulsion is exercised for the benefit of the people as a whole, for the safety of human life. Conscription for war, on the other hand, is conscription for the destruction of human life. to the conscription provisions in our present DefenceA c t for home defence. compulsion is exactly the same as the compulsion which is being exercised in It is true that it is all going into France, where every man is called upon to fight for the defence of his country; but the position in France has no parallel Probably the markets of with that of Australia at the present time. Were Australia invaded, as France is today, the compulsory provisions of our Act would properly and legitimately become operative, and no objection could be reasonably offered to that system. France was the first amongst the European nations to adopt it . It was imposed upon that country, I believe, by Napoleon for his European wars, and there can really be no comparison between the French system and the adoption in Australia of conscription as we understand it to-day.

If to that enormous number I stand shoulof men is added those who have offered and been rejected, it will be found that we have practically enlisted not less than I about 400,000 men. If Australia did nothing further in connection with this war, she would have done more than her share as compared with any other part of the British Empire. In proportion to our population we are far ahead of any other But, in my opinion, part of the Empire. Three days before the war broke out the Leader of the Opposition, who was then Prime Minister, said at ColacI hope there will be no need for our brave men to leave our -shores, but I am perfectly certain, if the need arise, we shall see a response as spontaneous and complete as at any time in our history. There would be no lack of volunteers. My impression is that if war breaks out, the trouble will be to get our men to stay at home The response has been magnificent. I think the Leader of the Opposition himself must be delighted with what Australia has accomplished. One feels utterly unable, with the limited vocabulary at one's disposal, to appreciate adequately the heroism and conduct of our men. Australia has a record of which she has every reason to be proud, and no reason at all to be ashamed. The recruiting figures show that the response of the men has exceeded all expectations. The speeches of the present Prime Minister have already been referred to. Here is what he said in a remarkable outburst in SydneyI t was no use going round like a.tame cat to these men.

I do not know what honourable members imagine will be the feelings of the men who have responded voluntarily and so nobly to the call for recruits if they find that they have to be supported by men who are compelled to go to the front. I am certain that no man who would go under compulsion would feel very comfortable in the company of men who harl volunteered to go, and I believe that the men who have volunteered to go will not feel very comfortable in the company of men who are forced to go. say, th© bulk of those who have volunteered to go are ardent conscriptionists. conscriptionists are those who are unable to go, ' and ar© always willing to find others to take tlieir places, and those who have their representatives at the front .

The Defence Department itself has done more than any other, institution to hinder recruiting. It has under its control a large number of permanent officers who have been trained at considerable expense, paid good salaries for many years, and kept in comfort and good fettle; and at the W h e n the war broke out outbreak of the war many of these men were anxious to g o ' to the front .

Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that a very large proportion of these officers was anxious to go to the front , the Defence Department said, "" No ; we will not allow you to go,"" and in consequence, u n t i l a few months ago, we had the very strange spectacle of many of these officers not doing the duty for which they were paid and trained, but walking about tlie streets, engaged in local routine defence work. have thought that they could do better work here.",22,Smith Nearl Y 800 000 Altered His Opinions On This Matter And

164,Mr Thomas,"The Department mayof the reason why the Defence Department did not allow these men to go. It was thought that they could do better work here. The Department reckons that these men were indispensable here, probably in just the same way as the Lord Mayor of London thought that his footman was indispensable, and asked that he should be exempted, or as one British employer thought that a supervisor employed by him on a Government contract at the rate of 30s. a week was indispensable and should be exempted, or as another employer thought that a single man to whom he was paying 16s. 6d. a week was indispensable and should be exempted. tary ServiceB ill before the House of a great deputation of one-man shopkeepers claimed exemption, because their services were indispensable to tbe carrying on of their businesses. I am not so certain that the services of these military officers were necessary in Australia at the beginning of the war. If so, why did the Defence Department a few months ago issue an order that every man on the permanent staff should offer for enlistment or produce a medical certificate justifying his exemption? Many of these men are very capable. On the other hand, many are utterly incapableprincipally those on the reserve staffand their incapacity has been proved during the war. Many of them are just about as adept at tripping the light fantastic toe at Government House as they would be in showing a clean pair of heels at Gallipoli. Perhapsi t was just as well that they did not go. I shall quote some records later on in regard to the conduct of some officers at the f r o n t ; but my point now is that we have occupv' ing positions in the permanent Defence service a number of capable, efficient men, officers, and instructors, whose whole opportunity of life has gone, whose whoi© opportunity for promotion in their profession has gone, whose health and ability warranted their going to the front , but who are held back by the Department. In the street every day we can hear people say, "" W h y should I enlist while those military Johnnies are walking about the street? When they go I shall go."" The remark is quite a common one. Another hindrance to recruiting is the-incapacity of the officers I am well aware in Australia as shown by their incompetency to control the men in the training camps. This was particularly noticeable in the early stages of the war. We had disgraceful reports of camp and street riots. Time and again Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide were absolutely in the hands of the soldiers. Their officers had no power, influence, or control over them. Fortunately, we have overcome that difficulty to some extent. The experience of Brisbane may be in dicative of the experience in other States. We had men in charge of the camp there of great reputation-me n presumed to possess experience and ability in the handling of recruits-bu t it was not Eveni n regard to the miliuntil we got r i d of all those picture officei's and obtained the services of a young Commons at the present time, man who, though only twenty-seven years of age, possessed some courage and in telligence, that we were able to secure order in the camp. young man come? Wasi t not Tasmania? came from Tasmania originally. The incapacity of some officers was further proved by the conditions of the camps. In the early stages of the war the condition of affairs in the various camps was a matter for discussion in this Chamber day after day. There were motions for adjournment, and questions without number, honourable members complaining of the state of affairs, and pointing out that soldiers were compelled to live and carry on their training under conditions that were simply disgraceful. The faul t did not lie entirely with the arrangements made by the Defence Department. It was largely due to the fact that men absolutely incompetent to fill the positions were placed in charge of these various sections of defence activity. When the reports of these conditions in the camps were spread by the soldiers, honourable members must have heard it said time after time, "" If that is how things are, I am not going."" One of the greatest hindrances to recruiting in the early stages of the war-and to a lesser extent now that some kind of oi'ganization has been brought about-wa s the incompetence of the officers managing affairs for the Department.

Why is it that the response to the appeal of the recruiting sergeant is so poor? lieves that it is because men do not realize their duty, or are unwilling to do it. appreciate the gravity of the situation; it is not because of lack of patriotism, but it is because of their instinctive objection to the insults and suggestions made by the recruiting sergeants. son. the character of a man who invites a woman f o be his wife has generally a good deal to do with the reply, and' so, too, the character of the men who invite young fellows to enlist is very often an obstacle to their doing so. control over the recruiting sergeants would result in tlieir being more of a help than, as at present, a hindrance to recruiting. the bad recruiting sergeants? tioned one. ing your criticism generally.

Another hindrance to recruiting is the reports by returned soldiers. All of us have received communications from men who have enlisted, but the most painful have been the reports by men who have returned from the front. I desire to read to the Committee a few extracts from a statement made by a returned captain who says that he has been recomNo one bemended for discharge, although the Empire requires fightersThere is too much graft and rapid promotion It is not because men are unable to going on, and tlie hospital staff helping themselves unreservedly. . . . The Minister relies on the board reports, whicli I contend are faked. . . . Although we are crying out for conscription, good men are being humbugged, and such as I are being shelved out of pure vindictiveness. This is a puny resort, and it is a pity that those concerned do not effectually employ their methods against the enemy. That we are all subject to lying indictments when It may be; but sueh a state of affairs prevails is true. . . .

I admit; but the Defence Department has laid it down that descendants of the first generation are not to be accepted for service. scendants are going to the war. tion. generation is looked on witli suspicion. It is a most peculiar fact-though , of course, it has an explanation, in one way -that it is not Germans or Austrians who have come here from their own countries who are the most dangerous citizens in Australia, but their descendants who were born here, many of them, and who do not realize the great impassable gulf that there is between German rule and British rule. Because of their ignorance of the contrast, they are not able to properly value their position as British subjects. However, it is a wise thing on the part of the Government to l i m it their enlistment to a large extent. There is another hindrance to recruiting amongst the working classes-thos e classes whom the honourable member for Wimmera is particularly anxious to get hold of, and who, I believe, in spite of his suggestion, have responded more nobly and numerously than any other section of the community. We may call them ""unionists"" if honourable members like, but the fact is that one thing keeping back men from enlisting to-day is the increased cost of living experienced during the war. Over and over again that they would not go to the f r o n t to preserve the property and businesses of wealthy men who, immediately they get the opportunity, increase the cost of living and sacrifice everything or anything in order to make money. The honourable Married men, anxious and willing to enlist, have asked how they can do so when they do not know how their wives and children will fare during their absence at the hands of men who are robbing the community. It is interesting to notice in Mr Knibbs' latest figures, covering the period up to March, 1916, the increase there has been in house rent aud the cost of living generally. AsA good mauy to the purchasing power of money,, the following figures show the difference between the fourth quarter of 1914when the war commenced and the fourth quarter of 1915 :-Sydney, 24s.. 7d. in 1914, as against 28s. I d . in 1915.; Melbourne, 22s. I d . , as against 26s. 5 d . ; Brisbane, 20s. 4d., as against 25s. I d . ; Adelaide, 22s. 5d., as against. 25s. 8 d . j Perth, 23s., as against 24s. I d . ; Hobart, 22s. 3d., as against 25s. 9 d . ; and for the Commonwealth, 22s. 10d., as against 26s. 8d. Mr Knibbs has later figures, from July, 1914, to March, 1916, showing that the increase in the retail prices of food, But the first groceries, and so forth, was:-In New South Wales, 35 per cent.; Victoria, 39' per cent.; Queensland, 43 per cent.; South Australia, 26 per cent.; Western Australia, 13 per cent.; and Tasmania, 34 per cent -a n average for the Commonwealth of 34.6 per cent. something to do with that?' to be corrected by this time. The drought was only temporary at the beginning of the war, and we have had ample time to reoover, as witness the remarkable wheat and f r u it crops. During the period covered by the figures I have quoted, I notice that the increase in wages has been 9 per cent., as against 34.6 per cent, increase in the cost of living. I am asked; why the workers do not go to the warwhy they do not go and fight for robbers who would take the bread out of the mouths of the wives and children l e ft behind. Why should they?

We have the power to impose taxation, but not the power to l i m it the price of goods; and the only remedy I can see at present is to have one authority in Australia, with power and courage to tackle the question, and say, "" Thus far shalt thou go, and no f u r t h e r .

Just now, when things are so finely cut that on© can scarcely realize how the housewife manages to keep bread upon the table, tlie wonder to me is that there are so few strikes. It is the manuiacturers who control the foodstuffs and tlie groceries of the people who are going upon strike, and whose patriotism might be very properly impugned. No greater obstacle to recruiting exists in Australia to-day than the continual rise in the prices of the necessaries of lile , which prevents meu from enlisting to fight Germany because they feel that it is much more necessary for them to fight here. Another hindrance to recruiting of which I desire to speak more particularly concerns the I m perial Government. we may' entertain of Senator Pearce, his name will be for ever remembered by many of the mothers of Australia because of the protection which he sought to extend to their sons during this war by keeping the temptation to drink out of their reach. I have nothing to complain of his conduct in giving effect to the advice tendered by Lord Kitchener at the inception of th© war-advic e which was supported the other day by General Birdwood. Whatever faults exist to-day in respect of offering temptation to drink to our troops lie principally at the door of the Imperial Government. I have heard it reneatedly stated that the condition of affairs which obtained in the camps in Egypt, so far as drinking .was concerned, has exercised a very detrimental effect upon recruiting. I have heard mothers repeatedly say, "" I cannot believe that I ought to let my son go to the f r o n t if the statements made in regard to the conditions which obtain at the military camps in Egypt are t r u e . "" than drink in Egypt. from CanadaWhat kind of men will the Mother Country send hack to us when this war is over? We know that tens of thousands will be killed or mainicd, but that is a light thing by comparison with moral degradation. Is it not a cruel response to tbe loyalty of the wives and mothers of Britain's overseas Possessions, who have yielded so fully their sons and husbands, that the interest of the British brewers and distillers, and tbe preference of drinking officers, should outweigh theirs; and should make of no account the known temperance sentiments of the countries who arc furnishing, equipping, and paying the Colonial troops? We have had exactly a similar experience here. I cannot forget what happened one morning in Brisbane recently. A father who has two sons at tlie f r o n t came to me and said, "" L o o k at this""-pointin g to a letter from one of his sons who was in the trenches at Gallipoli. His boy in that letter told him how day after day, although up to his knees in water, he had steadfastly refused the rum ration. He went on to say that at last one bitterly cold morning, after he had been out all night, and was feeling very dispirited, he was tempted to take just a mouthful of the rum. H© promptly spat it out, and in his letter he told his father how the thought of his past, his regard for his parents, and his Good Templar obligaWhatever opinions tions, came to his rescue. He concluded by saying that he would rather die than taste the abominable stuff again. His father at once wrote a letter to Lord Kitchener, in which he said, "" If this is the best that the Imperial Government can do for our soldiers they do not deserve much consideration from us."" Adam. Th© honourable member should tell us something new. it annoys the honourable member. I propose now to quote a few sentences from The Way of Martha and the Way of Mary, by Stephen Graham. On page 250 the author, in speaking of our soldiers, saysThey come to Egypt from a fresh colonial country, from good homes, pure women who arc their mothers, gentle and innocent girls who are their brides. They nobly offer themselves to fight for their race against a false idea and a predatory nation. He then goes on to sayThe first army that came was the wildest, boldest, and they plunged right away into the sin and gaiety and dangerous pleasures of the city, conducted by the money-grubbing but inH e r e is a letter genious and smiling Arabs, to the gambling dens, dancing houses, and strange parlours of the back streets. They were cheated, swindled, robbed whilst drunk, robbed whilst asleep, but they saw strange sights and tasted unusual pleasures, sating the new eyes and lips which Egypt had given them. At last, the time drawing nigh for their departure for the Dardanelles, they resolved to get back part of what they had lost in the back streets of the city-certai n things they could never get back -and they went down in foree and sacked the houses and rushed the Arabs and Arab women to the streets and took back what they could find.

232,Member Mr Patten,"The honourable membercan illustrate t i e only limitation which should be put upon freedom of action or speech. Standing where I am, I can swing my arms about in any way I please; but if I get too close to my neighbour, my liberty to swing my arms freely may be very properly interfered with. Freedom of action, speech, or criticism, is only logically and properly limited when it interferes with the -equal liberty of some one else. I wish I had time to make a few quotations from a little book I have here entitled The History of Freedom of Thought, which honourable members can obtain from the Library, and which I advise them to read. They will learn there what was said by Socrates, the pagan of old, by Milton, by StuartM ill , and many other authorities worth quoting on the subject of free speech and liberty of conscience. It is remarkable that people who, when in opposition and out of power, struggle and fight for liberty of conscience and freedom of speech as legitimate rights always demanded by every Britisher, become, when positions are reversed, the greatest tyrants and opponents of freedom of speech. We find that in religion, politics, and social affairs. I believe that today the limitation of the freedom of speech, and the stoppage of public criticism, are doing as much as anything else to hinder recruiting. It is of no use to talk to me about compulsion whilst such obstacles to voluntary recruiting may be removed. Until we have exhausted the resources of the voluntary system, I refuse to consider conscription as a reasonable issue. Until we have arrived at a time when we can say that, after every reasonable effort to secure a sufficient number of men by the voluntary system, we have absolutely failed to do so, there will, i u my opinion, be no reasonable or logical justification for the imposition of compulsion. Sitting [7.45] -This debate, since the delivery of his Budget speech by the Treasurer, has been confined almost entirely to the question of conscription. In my view a diversion from even so important a matter as the consideration of the Budget is justifiable in the circumstances, because it is impossible to conceive of anything of greater moment than the means to proT h a t is not so. I vide effectively sufficient numbers to represent the Commonwealth at the f r o n t in the great conflict that is raging at the present time. I have listened with pleasure to many of the speeches that have been made, and with a good deal of amazement to the speech of the honourable member for Brisbane. I must say that that speech was fearfully and wonderfully made. I did not know where the honourable member was going to land himself. He seemed to be struggling violently with some ruling passion in his own bosom, and trying to get under shelter in some city of refuge. Eighty per cent, of the arguments the honourable member used were the strongest that possibly could be used in favour of conscription, yet he protested against. it . He protested over much, and when he came to the close of his speech he admitted fairly that he was against conscription, at all events u n t i l it was proved that the voluntary system of recruiting had failed. I hope I do not misrepresent what he said. In my opinion, and I think in that of most of the people of the Commonwealth, the voluntary system of recruiting has failed absolutely. It has failed in the State from which I come. We have had there two recruiting movements by special trains. No one could have promoted and supported those recruiting trips more in dustriously and enthusiastically than did the Premier of South Australia, Mr. Vaughan, and those associated with him . Yet they were failures. I believe that similar recruiting movements in Victoria have also been failures. In my own Statei t is admitted all round, that recruiting on the voluntary principle is played out, and that many who are prepared to go to the f r o n t are waiting for the application of the compulsory principle, when they will cheerfully present themselves for enlistment. I cannot recognise any consistency in the people of the Commonwealth in protesting against the application to recruiting for the war suspended from-6.80 to 7.J/.5 p.m. of a principle that breathes through all OUT legislation for the defence of Australia. The conception and execution of the whole of the designs of Australia against an invading enemy are based on compulsion. It has been pointed out eloquently and effectively by the Prime Minister, when appealing in Australia to his own political supporters, that their industrial organization and all its success are due to and based on the principle of",31,Smith Nearl Y 800 000 Altered His Opinions On This Matter And

234,Mr Richard Foster (Wakefield),"compulsion. If compulsion is a proper principle to apply in our defence for the local protection of Australia, is it not consistent with that principle that we should be prepared to apply service for the defence of the country on the other side of the world? to thank God every moment of every day that we are defending Australia there in this war, and not here on our own soil. I am a whole-hearted this case. In the prosecution of this war time is of the essence of the and a resort to a method provide numbers sufficient to represent Australia would be of infinitely more value to-day tlian it would be in three months' Prompt and effective measures would, undoubtedly, help to determine the duration of the war and to conserve human life by bringing it speedily to an end. We owe a duty to the 200,000 men who have offered themselves, pared to lay down their lives for this magnificent Southern Seas. Is not every man at the front, and every returned soldier, almost without authorities bring, without this principle of compulsory national service into operation splendid sacrifices that have been made may accomplish the best and widest results? to do so at some length, I wish to deal concisely to-night with a matter of public expenditure, with the construction to Port Augusta apology for this, because I have repeatedly in this House referred to the demoralized enormous which has been associated with the construction of that railway. ought to have been brought under the consideration of this House for searching inquiry a year or two years ago.

But I want compulsory to say that the conditions under which Mr Bell works in the construction of We ought the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, and those under which he was engaged for very many years in railway construction in Queensland, are conscriptionist in just as different as night is from day. It is very difficult to apportion the blame contract, for what has occurred. So far as the that will Ministers or the Engineer-in-Chief are adequately concerned, we ought first to investigate at the battle front the system under which this railway construction is being carried out, and if we time. give the most rudimentary thought to this matter we must admit that failure is in evitable under any management if the enterprise is to be conducted under this system whicli now obtains.

When I asked the Engineer-inChief whether he had ever seen Port Pirie, he admitted that he had not, and I said, "" Well, the Government ought to send you there."" I repeat that the BrokenH ill traffic, representing pretty well 1,000,000 tons a year, is handled at Port Pirie with no more conveniences than would have been afforded the Commonwealth railway at Port Augusta by adopting the suggestion I made. But what did the oflicials do ? In selecting a route they cut right through the town and nark lands of Port Augusta, and got into the worse sand-drift country that could be found anywhere.

It had never previously been heard of. When a railway is being extended by sections, a traffic department may ru n traffic on a partially-completed section before the whole has been completed; but here was an altogether new enterprise, and no traffic department in existence. The officers of our Railway Department dealt with my written protest, and said that I knew nothing about the matter. They assured the Government that the establishment of a traffic department would be a good paying venture; and so it was started. W h a t has been the result? The other day I asked for a return showing the operations of this traffic department from the date of the last return supplied to me; and, though my request was promptly met, strange to say, a period of five months between the previous return and the nine months covered by the present return is not accounted for. It may be au oversight. However, the return shows that, for the nine months ended in A p r i l last, the Government traffic over the line yielded £143,588 l is . 8d., and the -.iblic traffic £12,793 19s.

I have discussed these matters with the Engineer-in-Chief on two occasions; on one of them, before the Minister. I was asked if I did not consider railway construction a big factor in the development of a country, and I replied that, of course, I did, but that it was necessary to recognise the limitation of development by the nature of the country to be traversed, and more particularly the rainfall. If a railway passes through fairly good soil, with an abundant rainfall, we can place no l i m it to the possibility of the country so developed. two or three good mines close to the line. bine the two we have great possibilities; but in this instance we have not those possibilities.

325,Mr Richard Foster,"He is as a matter of policy which would result in considerable economy in working, of converting the line between Port Augusta and Quorn from 3-ft. 6-in. to 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. I estimate that, roughly speaking, to relay this line, which is 25 miles long, with rails of 80 lbs. to the yard, the strengthening of the bridges between the two points, and mixing the gauge in Quorn yard, and also mixing the gauge in the Quorn locomotive yard and sheds, would not cost the Commonwealth more than about £4,000 per mile, as it must be taken into account that no heavy earthwork would be encountered. honourable member follows me he w ill see that is discounted later onThe line is at present well ballasted, and it would only mean the difference in cost as between the 50 lbs. line which now exists on the 3-ft. 0-in. gauge and the proposed 4-ft. SJ-in. gauge line with 80 lbs. plant. In those circumstances, you will readily perceive that it would be an economical move to carry out this as a part of your policy, and get it put in hand at the. earliest possible moment before the EastWest railway is opened, as by converting this line would mean tlie first seution of the strategical line which was recommended by the War Department (Lord Kitchener), and which must eventually be carried through from Quorn to Broken Hill, connecting up with the New South Wales State system at that point, now in course of construction. You will thus see that the approximate cost of conversion of this 25 miles of line will amount to practically £100,000, thus showing absolutely a saving to the Commonwealth of the very large amount which is proposed to spend at Port Augusta in workshops and appliances suggested above. AU that would be necessary at Quorn for dealing adequately with repairs to all the rolling-stock running on the East-West line would be the. provision of a wheel lathe and one or two other smaller machines which would not cost, at the outside, more than £5,000. I ask the Government to take this expression of opinion into consideration, and also to have the matter properly investigated. that there is not. a mechanical engineer on the Sonth Australian railways whose opinion is not in accord with that I have read. electorate ? not. I commend tliis scheme to your very careful consideration, as you will notice that there is money to be saved in it, and the goal ulti'matcly to be reached is one central depot for dealing adequately with the repairs and renewals to your rolling-stock running on the Great Northern, and also on the East-West railway, and later on with the strategical railway, which must come sooner or later in connecting Sydney with Port Augusta. orable member know a responsible man to investigate this matter? say to the Minister that he ought to call for the opinion of the South Australian officials, because, if they have not the. requisite knowledge, I do not know who has. Griffin, the architect? a bad man, and tlie honourable member w i ll hear a good deal more about him. It would be in the interests of the Commonwealth if there were a little b it more checking of our own men. If they are the best men, they will come out on top. Buti f they are not the most efficient men we ought to have a check upon them. I would do that; but I may tell the honourable member that by occasionally introducing one or two of the best men in the world, we will elevate the Australians into better men than they are.

Had the Government obtained data which were available in South Australia, and utilized the services of men who had been in touch with the Territory for forty or f if t y years, or had they appointed men of capacity from other countries with interior areas where similar difficulties had been encountered, they would not have wasted the money which has been wasted there. this waste we have now reached the position which was put before the Government by South Australian representatives at the inception of our administration of this area, namely, that tropical agriculture, and, indeed, agriculture of any kind there, is foredoomed to failure. Territory can be developed only along pastoral and mineral lines by the opening up of stock routes, and by the construction ""of a railway right through the country. plished, and success has attended development along these lines, we may gradu ally extend that development in other directions. If that policy had been adopted we should have saved hundreds of thousands of pounds. It is a source of satisfaction to me to know that the Minister controlling the Territory and the Government generally, have now arrived at the conclusion that the policy which has hitherto been adopted was a great speculation, and has resulted in as great a failure. tempt to give effect to any policy there. been a mighty expenditure, with a very little increase in population. If we were to take away from the Territory all the Government officials there, practically no population would be left. Territory back to South Australia? one fact to be remembered, namely, that the South Australian Government did not spend upon the Northern Territory a tithe, or even a twentieth part of what has been expended upon it by the Commonwealth. When the Commonwealth commenced to administer this Territory, it seemed of set purpose to lay it down that no South Australian should occupy any official position. want to take population from South Australia. not want men of experience or of local knowledge. There were a few Government officials in South Australia who, if they had been appointed by the Oommonwealth to positions in the Territory, could have done as well as any man, and they, because of their local knowledge, would have warned the Government against And after all many of the mistakes which Ministers have made, which have resulted in an enormous expenditure completely wasted.

Upon that occasion he practically affirmed thatThe re-appointment of Mr Griffin was an absolutely profligate waste of public money. There was no necessity for him to be here at all. His plan having been accepted, wore tbere no competent architects in Australia who could carry it out? I think I shall be able to show, before I resume my seat, that instead of the reappointment of Mr Griffin being an absolutely profligate waste of public money, it was the very reverse. I shall never be one to remain silent when a man who has no opportunity of defending himself is being maligned. For the information of honourable members who were not in the House when this question first cropped up; I wish to say that there was a time when Parliament decided to call for competitive designs for the building and planning of the Eederal Capital.

When Mr Griffin's plan was awarded the first prize, one would naturally have thought that the first duty of those responsible for the building of the Capital was to bring h i m to Australia to give effect to his design. But that was not done. attempt was made to do it . However, owing to lack of foresight, and of a keen appreciation of what was right, the proper step was not taken. The result was that after his plan had been decided by experts to be the best, it was not put into execution. Having awarded h i m the first prize for that design, I submit that we should have trusted to the judgment of the adjudicators, and not to that of amateurs who came on the scene later on. No sooner had the House decided to proceed with the work of founding the Federal Capital than the officers of the Home Affairs Department set to work to give effect to a composite plana plan built up from several of the premiated designs. Out of these scattered fragments they formulated a new design, which was not submitted to experts for their critical opinion, but was submitted only to the Deyjartment. The Department, finding no other -wiiy out of the difficulty, very wrongly, in my judgment, allowed this amateur plana composite plan which its framers could not interpret to-day not. could, as I shall presently show.

Then a change of Ministry took place, and, to the credit of the Cook Goman was never allowed to exercise the vernment, I must say that they saw what power, without which it was impossible ought to have been seen at first, namely, for him to carry out his plan.

The first step taken by the departmental gentlemen was in connection with th© location of a site for an arsenal. been responsible by what has occurred. The site selected was condemned by the designer of the Federal Capital as being hopelessly in the wrong place, for very material reasons. It appears that, when this site was selected for a Small Arms Factory, a plan of the Factory was also drawn out. In the meantime, the Standing Committee on Public Works had been brought into existence by this Parliament, and the matter was submitted to that Committee. the members of the Committee turned down the site selected by the departmental officers in opposition to the advice of the designer of the Federal Capital. The Small Arms Factory, which, but for the Public Works Committee, would have been erected, would have been quite unfit for the purpose for which it was designed. Tf the departmental plans had been f o l lowed, the structure would have been built without any proper recognition of the necessary weight-carrying capacity for any establishment of that character. A3 a matter of fact, the floors of the Factory, as proposed to be built, were designed to carry 100 lbs. to the square inch; whereas, in tlie case of the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, the management asked for a carrying capacity of not less than 250 lbs. to the square inch. In Melbourne, i : i the case of ordinary city retail shops, provision has to be made for a carrying capacity 40 per cent, in excess of what was provided for by these men who were superseding the designer of the Federal Capitali n the carrying out of his work. H a d this building been erected in accordance with their plans, we should have had another abortion and disgrace added to the many already included amongst Federal works. The next step these people took in opposition to Mr GriJhn, and despite his objection, was to build a power-house costing £88,196; in such a place as to defeat one of the principal objects of the Federal Capital design. There were many other places where the power-house might have been erected, and where it would be I do impeach the adequally serviceable for the purpose in The idea of a plan being view. the river. necessary condition might have been secured in more tlian one quarter of the Capital site.

The departmental officers b u i lt a railway to these works of some 5 miles in To their credit, be it said, length'. The usual thing occurred, and their estimates for the work were largely exceeded. This appears to be the in evitable result, and they gave a hundred and one excuses in the usual way for their ill-digested estimates by blaming some one else.

If the site which I saw is to be set apart for a sewage farm, then I say that another blunder has been made, because it is well known that soil of a special character is necessary for a sewage farm.

One of the essentials for a modern city is cheap water, without which it would be impossible to beautify its environs. the water supply ought to have been secured by a gravitation scheme, and this was one of the conditions laid down when the site was selected, but to-day we find, in opposition to the advice of the designer of the Capital, that a water scheme involving pumping to a head of 850 feet has been adopted. U p to date the expenditure on this work totals £196,614, and ultimately it will cost £275,000.

Private works of considerable size and variety occupied mc, until the bad times of 1893 brought about acceptance of an engagement with the Queensland Government. After eleven years in the Queensland Government Architect's Department, my transference in 1904 to the Commonwealth Government Service occurred, which engagement still continues. In tlie capacity of designer, or supervisor of construction, or both, the buildings engaged upon number very many hundreds of every kind, and in value from a quarter of a million pounds downwards.

When I was intrusted with the position which I now hold, one of the first things I did was to look into the characteristics of the buildings in which the work of the Postal Department had to be done. I have realized for eight or ten years past that, unless we have buildings in which the staff and appliances can be co-ordinated and kept under proper supervision, we cannot attain tliat efficiency, service, discipline, or organization which are necessary for tlie successful conduct of a Department. The first step taken by a man about to build a factory in which a number of men are to be employed is to see that the place is built so that the employees can do their work with the least amount of inconvenience and the greatest amount of profit. Soi t should be with the Post Office and other Departments. But when I went to see the result of the expenditure of £84,000 near the Sydney dealing with mails and parcels, I found Mr Murdoch is a better that the place was so constructed as to be absolutely incapable of meeting the needs of the Department, or of being adapted to do so. The ceilings were 11 feet high.

Hundreds of human beings would have been working in that building, and ultimately locked in between other high buildings with an exit only 12 feet wide. The Public Works Committee wisely drew attention to the lack of exits for the employees if any of the buildings caught fire. It was at that stage that I came upon the scene, and my purpose was to find a way out of the difficulty. MrW . ELLIOT JOHNSON -Was it to be a fireproof building? is to be anticipated from fire in the adjacent buildings. which the Home Affairs Department could suggest was the expenditure of large sums of money in the purchase of means of exit, £9,000 for one scheme, and £30,000 for another. I considered it to be my duty to avoid that expenditure if possible. On consulting the plans of the proposed exchange, I found that the designers have neither provided for the coordination of the machinery of an automatic exchange nor made provision for the staff which would occupy the building immediately on its completion. The whole basement, comprising 4,000 superficial feet, had been wasted by being utilized for the carrying in of cables, and that provision, together with a light area, had made impossible the co-ordination of the machinery in such a way as to allow of economical and efficient working. I told the Minister of Home Affairs that I could not adopt plans which did not provide the essentials for the service, and that I proposed to employ the assistance of an outside architect. suggested that I should consult Mr Griffin. I did so, and he designed a plan which utilized the whole of the basement, allocated and co-ordinated the plant on two floors, and made a building of five stories ample for the accommodation of the staff that will be required to occupy it forthwith. In addition, he provided for the walls to be so constructed that two stories can be added later to meet the requirements of the trunk-line staff when they are transferred in seven years' time. It is the duty of a Department to look ahead, and to get what it really requires, but the trouble is that plans are drawn without a f u l l comprehension of what they are wanted for. Anotheri n stance is the parcels and mails office being constructed at Spencer-street, at a cost of about £200,000. The external design is all right, but when one looks into the in ternal design he becomes almost paralyzed by the evidence of ineptitude on the part of those responsible. The plan does not seem to have been worked out with a f u l l knowledge of what the building was to be utilized for. The first floor is allocated in an indifferent way, and the rest of the floors are divided like a chequer board, with walls built from pillar to pillar on not floor after floor, without any regard to the need for co-ordination of management It was, but trouble and supervision. In that case I did not call in Mr Griffin. I employed one of The only remedy my staff who has an aptitude for this kind of work, who has gone through every branch of the service, and thoroughly understands the requirements of the post office. I indicated to him what I thought was necessary, and the result has been that, whereas the scheme worked out by the Home Affairs Department, under the advice of the Postal Department, would absorb the whole of the six floors, comprising 18,000 superficial feet, by striking out the dividing walls, removing all barriers between -the supervisors and. the supervised, and bringing the whole operations of each department under proper review, we shall have two of the six floors available for otlier purposes, either to be utilized by ourselves or to be rented, and thus to bring in an income which w ill help to pay the interest on the capital cost. A lack of thoroughness, and of knowledge of what is intended to be done, seems to be characteristic all through the Department. I had before me a proposal for the expenditure of £12,000 on a The Minister motor garage. That seemed to be a large sum of money to expend in this time of war. I inspected the stables which up to that time had been used as a garage, and suggested that they should be reconstructed to meet the requirements of the motor service. A plan was submitted for reconstruction at a cost of £ 4 5 0 , but it seemed to me that the altered structure under that proposal would be no better than the original. I therefore gave in structions that the stanchions should be taken out of the centre of the stables, and placed near the walls, with brackets to hold the roof; that a suitable cement floor should be put down, and tanks in stalled, so that we could have a meter on our petrol consumption, and avoid the",48,Tempora Ry Chairman Letters With Which I Do Not Trouble The
471,Mr Webster,"waste which had taken place formerly. Tliat scheme was carried out, and the result is that at a cost of £1,000, instead of £12,000, we have a motor garage that will last us for the next ten years. Cabinet changes have justified themselves. the condition of affairs into whicli the Department has fallen is provided by the General Post Officei n Sydney. There we have a building of handsome external design, but a veritable rabbit warren in ternally, oue of the worse buildings for a post-office tliat I have ever seen. The telephone exchange and the testing room are situated on the third floor. The testing room ought never to have been placed there, but having once been put there, it grew with the building, until, finally, the floor was in danger of collapsing under the weight, and had to be supported by strong girders resting on the main wall. The cables ran from the tunnel to the testing room in a chute measuring 9 feet by 2 f t . 6 in . To my amazement I found the chute to be constructed of wood, without a fire break. occurred, and it was only by the mercy of Providence that it did not take hold of tlie chute. H a d that been done tliere would have been one great flue to carry the flames into the testing room, where there are wooden joists and floors, and where 350 telephone girls are at work. If that room caught fire none of the girls could get down by the stairs, for the whole place would be a fiery furnace. When, on a visit of inspection, I saw this, I could hardly credit that such a state of affairs could be allowed. through the papers I found that nine years before attention had been called to this menace to human life, and that the Fire Brigades Board had three times adversely reported on the conditions. W it h an outbreak of fire the whole of the testing room would have gone, and Sydney would have been without telephones for seven or eight years, for it takes about that time to build up a new system. All this danger was well known, and warnings had been given regarding it . During the last three years a move has been made to have the arrangements altered, and ultimately a new chute was designed, and the designs were there when I came on the scene. But the design for this chute pays no regard to t-he requirements of [287]3 the case. The present chute is more than ample for all the cables that w ill ever go up, but the new chute was designed twice the size, the only effect of which was to shut out light from the staircase. ItI t seems as if the recent seems almost impossible to believe that these things can be. The new chute, as designed, would not only shut out the light, b u t would increase the cost; and before going to New Zealand, when the officials were very much excited owing to the Fire Brigades Board's report which I had asked for, I told them to leave the matter until I returned, because I could not settle it at the moment. When I returned, however, I found that, in spite of my caution, and in spite of what had been told them by the Minister of Home Affairs my absence a tender had been accepted, and the Department committed to the expenditure. I need not say that I cancelled the tender; and I intend to throw the responsibility on those who disobeyed the orders. I may say further that the One fire has already tender accepted was for £ 4 5 5 , while the estimate for the design prepared by Mr. Griffin, and endorsed by the FireB r i gades Board as filling every requirement, is only £240, or only a little more tlian half. It was because I saw this money could be saved that I left orders that nothing should be done unti l my return from New Zealand. The present chute is surrounded with some of the most beautif u l cedar panels that I have ever seen. These, I suppose, were used in order to preserve uniformity with other parts of the work, and as there are about 2,000 On looking feet of the cedar, and it is very valuable, I am having it carefully taken down in order that it may be utilized in the in ternal remodelling of the General Post Office. If that can be done, then the chute that is to be built will cost the Government nothingI shall save the whole. There is another important matter to which I desire to t u r n. Recently, in all our large post-offices, alterations and renovations have had to be undertaken. In Adelaide the office is congested"", and the State Works Department has drawn plans which have been submitted to me. I always take it that the Federal authorities, to whom we pay large salaries, should be held responsible, no matter who draws the plans, because, after all, it is the Federal authorities who recommend",49,Tempora Ry Chairman Letters With Which I Do Not Trouble The

475,Mr Webster,"I found that during the plans to me. I found by these plans that it was intended to spend a very large sum in making additions on the same design as that of the old building:. I tell honourable members that the Adelaide Post Office is so designed that one branch is located in twelve rooms, and another branch in twenty rooms, will understand how much supervision' is possible. in this way, but the rooms of a branch are not even adjacent, some being on one floor and some on another, and idling is thus rendered quite easy. the original plans it was intended create a further hutches on the top floor at heavy expense; and, as I am not able to go myself, I have sent a gentleman from the Department to Adelaide to get all the plans and other data, and bring them to Melbourne. So far we have so redesigned the building as to be able to insure that the cost of other alterations will not, I tliink, be more than that of the original plan, though I am not quite sure what the cost itself will be. the requirements of five years, necessitating a further extension at the end of that period, whereas we have managed to provide for twenty-five years' growth at the same price. I desire to show that, if I had taken the ordinary course of accepting the plans presented to me, and I had had no knowledge of the requirements of the Department, have proceeded in such a way as to bring trouble in the administration. we are building a new general post office to cost within. £20,000 for which price, I think, we ought to get a modern building that will be a credit to Australia. have designed this building, and I must admit that I regard it as a rather gorgeous production, office in time, I probably could have saved some £30,000 or £40,000 without lessening the accommodation. plans I found that it was intended to put in walls on every floor that would only have had to be immediately and the contractors would have charged extras, as contractors only can charge. Fortunately, fore the main walls were put up, and we have been able to so arrange that, the space is required for post-office business, all the-other Commonwealth tions in Perth can be housed there, instead ilfr. Webster. of paying rent as at present. Thousands of pounds have been saved by preventing these walls and fittingsgoing in . HonorWhen able members will appreciate the difference between having open spaces, where the men may sit at their work at tables under supervision, and separate rooms in they different parts of the building; and, further, it must be remembered that all Th& officers are not only divided these rooms would have to be furnished a i a cost of thousands of pounds. In these buildings there w i ll be no rooms either for supervisors or workmen. They According to will be built on the lines of the modern to banks in New York, where the bankers sit number of rabbitin the same rooms as do the clerks who are engaged in the performance of their functions. That is the modern method of conducting a big department. In order to stress the defects which have occurred in the building of some of our Government Departments, let me point to the Commonwealth Treasury to-day. Those buildings were recently erected, and their estimated cost was about half of their actual cost. Only the other day, whilst The original plan provided only for sitting at my table, I heard a chipping in progress close by, and went outside to ascertain its cause. I found that a concrete balconette, on which there was an outlet for water at both ends, had been so constructed that the water would not 'reach either end, but lay in the centre. Workmen were engaged in endeavouring to remedy this defect. I maintain that I should, as in the past, there was .no excuse for such a fault. Downi n the lower levels, where there is In Perth a court-yard, the same thing occurs. The water falls and runs into the buildings of £250,000, instead of into the gratings. I merely point out these faults to illustrate the lack of thoroughness that is observed in The State authorities the construction of our large buildings, even when adequate funds are available. Such errors are inexcusable, and would on which, had I assumed not be forgiven by any contractor. MrJ . H .

I go to Mr Griffin because I have proved that he possesses an ability to grasp any problem in architecture that I have not met with in any other man.
