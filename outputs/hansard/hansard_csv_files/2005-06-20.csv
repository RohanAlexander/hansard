190,Mr Mcgauran To Present A Bill For An Act To,"Monday, 20 June 2005 ----Franklin Electorate: Community Work Training pilot training program in my electorate of Franklin. I am referring to the certificate II course in community work recently completed in Clarendon Vale and Bridgewater-Gagebrook. Access to training is a huge barrier to overcome for people in disadvantaged suburbs. Neighbourhood houses and family support in my electorate provide a facility for women, single-parent and two-parent families-amongst others-to gather and learn in an informal environment. These people, who traditional schooling failed, now wish to re-enter the work force and need to access formal training and education. They need skill development and, more importantly, workplace opportunities. APW Training, which is part of the Anglicare organisation, obtained funding from the VET priority placements program-or PPP-to run a program for people returning to the work force, people with disabilities and mature age people on a benefit. Training took place in the local environment-in this case neighbourhood houses in Gagebrook and Clarendon Vale. This was a brave move and a welcome initiative from APW. Enrolments exceeded expectations-there were 12 at Clarendon Vale and 14 at Gagebrook. Participants on the course had to overcome many problems, but lateral thinking and committed resources produced solutions that enabled all participants to continue. At graduation ceremonies last week, graduates told of their pride, increased confidence and higher self-esteem not to mention the camaraderie with fellow students that will develop into long-lasting friendships. Out of 26 enrolments, 24 students graduated last week. TAFE and other education and training providers would kill for that kind of retention rate. Medical reasons accounted for the two who did not finish. Hard on the heels of this success, celebrations are a touch guarded because, in spite of the employers’ rave reviews of students during their work placements, certificate II graduates need to go on and complete certificate III to be employed in the field. There are employers waiting for this group to attain their level III certification. Funding is desperately needed to enable the next step of this training program to commence. In the interests of the participants, potential employers and the community, the certificate III course should start as soon as possible. VET PPP funding is now somewhere between the Australian government and the states. Talks continue between federal and state bodies, but unfortunately government departments move slowly. I have had discussions with the relevant ministers in this place to find the money to ensure this pilot program delivers the certificate III in community work to these 24 participants. The vibes are positive. Censorship watch in the privacy of their homes is largely up to them. Some material which is broadcast on the Big Brother program at times when children could be watching leaves a lot to be desired. There is nothing wrong with nudity in context.

193,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (5.02 Pm),"Let me say that I am no prude. What adults want toment has no artistic merit whatsoever and no justification for the gratuitous sex that it offers. We have a reasonably good censorship regime in this country. We have general exhibition, parental guidance, two levels of M certification-one requiring the accompaniment of adults-and the R classification category. Everyone knows what they are watching. We understand that X classification films are not generally available for exhibition in cinemas. They are made and distributed in the ACT and the Northern Territory. The government did not approve the move towards non-violent erotica, which would have mollified Australians into believing that they were watching something a bit naughty but not too harmful. If this is the standard we set for the exhibition of films in cinemas, where people choose to pay their money, or for their sale as videos then are we not entitled to expect that free-to-air television maintains the same if not a higher standard? Why? Because by their very definition free-to-air films are available to all Australians and hold a privileged place in Australian households. We are therefore entitled to believe that classification is more important in this context. People do not deserve to be affronted by material that would otherwise be excluded under normal censorship provisions. For that reason, I understand the anger of people who have been affronted by Big Brother and Big Brother Uncut. Surely we have not stooped to such a level in Australia in free-to-air television that community debate centres around whether Michelle and Glenn had real sex or not. Quite apart from the mind-numbing banality of most of this reality television, do we really need to further degrade the standards of Australian television production and presentation to such a pathetic level? The program, to which so many people have objected, cannot be justified on the grounds of artistic merit. Let us hope it is not a genuine reflection of Australian society, the other classic justification. Let us be frank: some episodes are nothing more than gratuitous sex and innuendo, and I seriously question whether our censorship authorities, particularly Channel 10 internally and the ABA, are doing their job. (Time expired) Whaling to the slaughter of whales in Australian waters. I want to illustrate the overwhelming and passionate reaction that my community and indeed all Australians have had to Japanese whaling. On behalf of our community, I urge the Prime Minister to stop the rhetoric and start acting on this issue. On SundayI had the privilege of attending a special community-driven protest against whaling in Australian waters. ThereI received many heartfelt drawings and letters, mostly from local children, asking the Prime Minister to put a stop to Japan’s whaling plans. I ask the Prime Minister to please listen to what these children are saying. Rebecca says: These are precious creatures. I think they deserve to live. That’s why I’m totally against the idea of hunting whales. Perry writes: You are the only Australian that has the power to try and end it.

194,Mrs Elliot (Richmond) (5.05 Pm),"TodayI want to raise my community’s objectionsRuby says: I wait every year for the whales to come and if you take this away from me and everyone else that enjoys this, we will be very upset. Mason says: You really should stop the whaling. It will badly hurt the tourism in my town. Jesse says: I think you have the powers to make a difference. Whales have rights too. Grace says: We want you to put pressure on them to stop this madness. Maraya says: There is one humpback whale that comes up and down the east coast, which is where I live, and I would some day like to see it. However, I won’t be able to do that if it’s dead. Robert says: We think that you could stop all of this. The whales are precious. They’re beautiful. Charam says: I’d really like you to at least try and do something. I know you have a lot to do but if you think about it, whales should be at the top of your priority list. Hannah says: I am very disturbed by the Japanese killing the very beautiful whales because if they do they’ll be no whales left for our children’s children to see and admire. Grace says: Whales are beautiful animals and don’t deserve to be harmed. Imagine if someone started hunting you down for your fat. I hope that the Prime Minister takes these messages from local children straight to the Japanese government. The drawings are heartfelt and illustrate how passionate the children are about this very, very important issue, and I will be sending all of these-about 50 drawings in total-to the Prime Minister so that he can see them and read the children’s letters and hear how desperately passionate they are about this very important issue. Whaling in Australian waters is indeed unacceptable-it is as simple as that, and the government should be taking greater action in relation to it. I note also that the member for Moncrieff has sent a petition to the Gold Coast council calling upon them to take action in relation to their sister city in Japan and the issue of whaling. I would like to say to the member for Moncrieff that he should be speaking to his fellow coalition MPs and the Prime Minister about taking action, not sending a petition to the Gold Coast council. He should be speaking to the Prime Minister and getting him to take some action. My community feels very strongly about this; there were at least 100 people at the community gathering on Sunday, mostly children, who presented these drawings and who feel strongly about this. I will be forwarding them to the Prime Minister and urging him to take action on this very important issue. We have to protect the whales and we have to do it now. MAIN COMMITTEE Ryan Electorate our social fabric and I want to pay tribute to them in the parliament today. It is estimated that if a cash value were put on the hours that volunteers spend in this country it would amount to some $50 billion. That is why I think it is important that all members of the federal parliament pay tribute to the volunteers in their respective electorates. I want to commend the federal government very strongly today because it has allocated some $11,400 to the Ryan electorate, which I of course have the great privilege of representing here in the parliament. It has permitted 10 local community organisations to benefit from this, and I want to pay tribute to and acknowledge them here in the parliament today. The Gap Pioneer and History Group, under the stewardship of Mr Jeff Hilder, has received almost $2,000; his organisation will benefit tremendously from this. The Kenmore branch of Little Athletics, under the guidance of Mrs Diane Thornton, is going to receive some $1,600, which will go towards a marquee. The Moggill Cricket Association, under the guidance of Mr Ian Bartholomew, is going to receive some $2,281, which will go towards putting up a quickshade. Also, very importantly, the Moggill branch of the Queensland Country Women’s Association, under the guidance of Mrs Robyn Brand, will receive $1,400-plus towards a roving microphone, a microwave, a benchtop food warmer and some portable tables. The branch does a wonderful job in the Ryan electorate. The Centenary Meals on Wheels, under the guidance of Miss Sandra Goode, who lives in Jindalee, will receive over $600 towards mobile phone handsets and some eskies. These are examples of the wonderful organisations throughout the country, and it is very important that we pay tribute to them. The Queensland branch of the Scout Association of Australia, under the guidance of Mr Ken Whyte, who lives at Mount Ommaney, will receive over $600 towards a colour printer. This is an example of how good local membership can help local community organisations. Accordingly, $11,000 has been provided to the Ryan electorate and 10 organisations will benefit. These funds will make an important contribution to the viability of these organisations, for which people give up their time to contribute to the local community. I want to mention one more: the Moggill Scout Group, under the guidance of Mr Norm Holliman, who lives in Bellbowrie, will receive almost $900 to go towards coolers and an outboard motor, which will make an important difference to the activities of the young people in the Moggill community.

198,Mr Murphy,"I know you are. The Brazilian government first mandated a five per centleading sugar cane and ethanol producer in the world. By adding ethanol to gasoline, Brazil has secured its energy needs and created many job opportunities as well as a reduction in pollution and the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions. It is well known that sugar cane producers in Australia are struggling. My concern is that the government continues to subsidise an inefficient industry without helping it to go in different directions-for example, by providing further financial assistance to the sugar cane producers to encourage them to make ethanol. It is also well known that the oil industry is a very powerful lobby. It is disgraceful that many petrol stations in Sydney put out messages guaranteeing that no ethanol is mixed in the gasoline. This perpetuates the myth to Sydney motorists that ethanol is harmful to the motors of ordinary cars. Nothing could be further from the truth. A mix of 10 per cent ethanol with gasoline is a very safe and environmentally friendly measure. In Brazil today, all cars run on a minimum of 25 per cent ethanol. Brazil has shown the world that the use of ethanol to power motor vehicles is the way to go, both environmentally and economically. I can report first hand that the Brazilians are laughing at the almost daily price hikes in the cost of a barrel of oil. Oil is a finite resource and it is not environmentally friendly, so today I call on the Howard government to follow Brazil’s example and to do everything to assist and encourage the production of ethanol in Australia. I am sure that one day, once Australians discover for themselves that the mix of 10 per cent ethanol with gasoline is not dangerous to their motor vehicles, Australia, like Brazil, will produce cars that run on 25 per cent to 100 per cent ethanol. That would be good for our environment and for the economy. Unexploded Ordnance exploded ordnance in Australia. For those who might not be aware of what this is, unexploded ordnance includes bombs, artillery shells and similar munitions that lie idle and unexploded, a potential hazard, in hundreds of locations right around our nation. There are currently 1,196 identified UXO sites around Australia, and one of those sites is in my electorate of Fisher on the Sunshine Coast. I have been fighting to make sure that we achieve an appropriate outcome and an equitable solution with respect to the issue of UXOs. On the Sunshine CoastI believe that all levels of government bear some responsibility for the current situation. Obviously the Australian government was defending Australia and these particular items were fired as part of our defence preparations. However, the principal problem locally has been caused by the fact that the government of Queensland permitted the freeholding of the land and its use for sub-divisional purposes and the City of Caloundra approved sub-divisional plans without requiring in each case that the land be cleared of UXOs. So we have a situation where UXOs are partly on private property and also on public land. What we want is an outcome that will ensure that they are cleared from those areas where they pose a danger to the public. As a parent, I, of course, experience concerns when I look at the dangers to young children when they locate these UXOs. Happily, no lives have been lost, and let us hope that that remains the situation. The issue of UXOs locally was recently ignited when a team from the Caloundra City Council, using a mini excavator, came across what they suspected was a UXO. They were doing water mains work on a road owned by the Queensland state government. Naturally, the MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Statements By Members
199,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (5.14 Pm),"There has been an ongoing debate over the issue of unwork was brought to a standstill as their Caloundra Council superiors were notified and they in turn notified the police and the military authorities. As it turned out what they had found was not a UXO at all; it was something else. However, the local state member, Chris Cummins, jumped on the bandwagon and claimed that the Australian government should bear the full cost of clearing these items. The Caloundra City Council and I have had discussions and they are coming forward with a plan of what they suggest should be done, but, as I said earlier, all levels of government bear some responsibility here-particularly the state government and the local authority, because we would not have the present situation had the state government not approved the freeholding and had Caloundra City Council not permitted the plans for the subdivision to proceed. What we need to do is look at those areas of public land that are used by the public, work out a map and work out costings. In my view, there then has to be an appropriate compromise arrangement whereby the federal government, the state government and the local council work together to remove this potential menace. (Time expired) Northern Territory Election noon and congratulate Clare Martin and the Labor team in the Northern Territory on their historic win last Saturday. Ms Hall-An outstanding result. it, especially as some of my conservative colleagues are here in the chamber. What we have seen is an absolute routing of the CLP-the Country Liberal Party-in the Northern Territory. It has been such a routing that we have seen a swing to Clare Martin and her governmentthe Labor Party-of 20.3 percent. A swing like that to a government is unprecedented. As a result, we have seen the leader of the opposition, Denis Burke, have a swing of 22 per cent against him and he has lost his seat. I might point out that in the last election Matthew Bonson, an Aboriginal bloke, stood for the seat of Millner. He won that seat with a margin of 80 votes. I am happy to announce that he won this time with a 22 per cent swing and now sits on 73.2 per cent, a margin all of us in this place would like to have. I would also point out that two other Indigenous candidates were elected to the Territory’s assembly-as new members. Alison Anderson, a former ATSIC commissioner, won the seat of MacDonnell, with a swing of-wait for it-30.5 per cent. Barbara McCarthy won the seat of Arnhem with a slightly lower swing-only 15.2 per centbecause she was taking it over from a former Labor member. She got a massive swing on the top of taking over the seat from Jack Ah Kit, a previous Labor minister. Labor also won the seat of Daly from the CLP. In that seat Bob Knight got a reasonable swing-30.4 per cent. He now sits on a margin of 70.8 percent. These are historically unprecedented results. Another candidate, and the person who has beaten the Territory Leader of the Opposition, is James Burke. As it happens, his father stood for the Labor Party in the 1983 election when the Labor Party only won six seats-something like the CLP is going to win this time. His father stood for the seat of Wanguri but lost. James Burke now has the pleasure of saying, although his father stood for the Labor Party in 1983, that he stood this year-in 2005-and he defeated the Leader of the Opposition. That is not a bad result. MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Statements By Members

They were running flights from Sydney’s Rose Bay through to Brisbane which then stopped at Gladstone in the member for Hinkler’s electorate before landing in Townsville en route to Singapore and London. These days we have something a little more significant than a flying boat service from Qantas. I am pleased to advise the parliament that on Friday, Jetstar, which is part of the Qantas group, announced that it will be servicing Townsville with some very significant new services. I am very pleased to see that Jetstar will run a service which I believe is a first-that is, Melbourne-Townsville direct. That is a great result, particularly for our commercial and our military people in Townsville because many of them have families and friends in the southern part of the state. We will now see Qantas running 38 services a week to Townsville. Jetstar will run 14 services a week to Townsville and QantasLink, the other member of the Qantas stable, will run 49 services to Townsville. This gives a total of 101 services every week from the Qantas group. I really appreciate the support that Qantas has shown to our city, Australia’s largest tropical city. I know that it will continue to operate and to offer appropriate services for our region. Townsville also has Virgin services. Another airline, which is known as Alliance Airlines, provides jet services from Townsville. So we are well serviced as the regional communications and business centre of the north. I also note that Qantas has a national partnership with Tourism Australia in relation to a major marketing thrust over the next three years to promote Australia and to promote inbound tourism. Qantas has once again demonstrated through this partnership that it does call Australia home. It is committed to working with Tourism Australia globally and it is committed to growing Australia’s tourism industry from all major regions. That is why I would like to strongly support Qantas in its position as flagship carrier for Australia and to support anything that we can do as a government that will help it.

They very reasonably ask that basic rights at work guaranteed under New South Wales industrial relations are also enshrined in federal industrial legislation. I will table these petitions in the House of Representatives during this sitting week. As the member for Kingsford SmithI support the teachers at these schools and their call for the maintenance of their current hard-won rights. These petitions are more evidence of the degree of concern the community of Kingsford Smith has about the Howard government’s approach to and performance in education-from primary schools to universities and on a number of fronts. The Senate committee’s student income support report will be tabled shortly. Alarmingly, its findings reveal that over one-third of students are living below the poverty line.

203,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith) (5.23 Pm),"I have received petitions from Our Lady offrom the internet. This practice, I can verify from students at the University of New South Wales, is increasing. Students therefore are not able to achieve their best results and they end up simply doing the bare minimum to scrape by. I think members would agree that that is a completely unacceptable situation for our future teachers, future doctors, future health technicians, future lawyers, future surveyors and so on to find themselves in. Their capacity to act as competent professionals once they graduate is very much determined by their ability to focus properly on their studies during the term of their education, and if most of them-or many of them-find themselves on the poverty line, this capacity is greatly impaired. The ongoing and, it must be said, destructive pattern of reduced funding in higher education means for instance that students of few means have less access to scholarships as universities such as University of New South Wales struggle to provide services previously supplied through federal government funding. Already facing strained and difficult circumstances, these students are now faced with a mounting attack on student unions-the so-called voluntary student unionism attack. It is against the wishes of the majority of students and universities. We should oppose government policy that jeopardises the capacity of students to study, as they scrabble to make ends meet-even to the extent of offering themselves for medical experiments, as we read in the newspapers last week. At the same time these students now face removal of services that are so significant to them: counselling, legal advice, sports facilities and the like. The education of Australian students deserves better. Workplace Relations Reform of these new industrial relations reforms. My brother and I ran three restaurants and, combining full-time, part-time permanent and casual employees, we had around 60 employees on our books at any given time. The scare campaign by the unions would have you believe that employers will now be able to fire people just for the sake of it. This notion is ridiculous to anyone who has owned or has been associated with small business. The old mentality of labour just being one component in the manufacturing process along with other raw materials and other inputs is thinking of an age gone by. I can tell you, as other small business people can, that your staff-or team, as the current mentality would have it-are the most important component in any business and that you must treat them very well. These people are essential to the smooth running of the organisation and to exploit them or to terminate them only hurts you and your business. In most organisations the owner of the business and his or her team form great friendships, long-lasting even well after the business is sold or the employee leaves. I still keep in contact with many former employees and I am willing to assist-as I have-with references or advice. However, I have also been the victim of employees who have had personal problems, where the stealing of money, goods and time have occurred; where they have openly defied responsibility by hiding behind unfair dismissal laws and the so-called ‘three written warnings’ before termination can occur otherwise industrial action will occur-that is, through the courts. I know many other employers who would take on extra staff if the unfair dismissal laws were removed today. The law must protect employees, I agree. However, the survival of small business is precarious at best and I see the future industrial relations laws as a muchneeded shot in the arm for the backbone of this country.

It relates to continuing referrals to specialists. It is possible for our constituents to obtain a continuing referral from their general practitioner that enables them to see a specialist without being required to go back and get a new referral. Unfortunately, this is not widely known and therefore very few specialists accept this. Only if our constituents ask their general practitioner can they get a continuing referral, but even when they have one sometimes specialists are quite reticent in taking up the referrals. I would like this parliament to put in place proper procedures whereby specialists are made aware of the importance of these referrals and of the fact that they are acceptable, and to undertake an information campaign to advise general practitioners that continuing referrals are available so patients can benefit from them. agreed to on 14 July 2005, the time for members’ statements has concluded.

As we speak, in South Korea there is a meeting of the International Whaling Commission, and we will see whether Japan has been successful in its attempts to stack that commission. The apparent success of Japan in bringing this issue to the point where they are actually arguing to hunt humpback whales and other species and to expand their quota of whales slaughtered for so-called scientific purposes raises a number of issues. One issue, which is agreed by everyone in this parliament, is that whaling is an activity which should be consigned to the dustbin of history; that it is inappropriate to hunt and slaughter whales in the cruel way in which it is currently being done by a small number of countries.

208,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (5.31 Pm),"This is a critical week for Migaloo, the whitefront. But I must say that there is considerable concern that inaction has brought us to this point. It appears, from Senate estimates last month, that the foreign minister did not make any representations to Japan on this issue between 1996 and 2004. We have also seen the environment minister undertake a last-ditch attempt to travel around the world in the couple of weeks leading up to the IWC. This suggests that the government has been asleep at the wheel while Japan has been busy recruiting countries who would vote for its pro-whaling position. It is also the case, I believe, that mixed messages have been sent. In particular, I refer to the Humane Society International case, in which the Attorney-General, Philip Ruddock, intervened and made a submission stating that the case should not be allowed because it would ‘lead to an international disagreement with Japan’. We do have an international disagreement with Japan when it comes to the issue of whaling. The legal intervention on whaling stands in very stark contrast to the action in 1999 where the government took Japan-the same country-to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea over southern bluefin tuna and was, in fact, represented in that case by the then Attorney-General, Daryl Williams. It seems to the Labor Party that it is entirely appropriate that diplomatic measures not only take place but be backed up by legal measures. In particular, the government should take action in the International Court of Justice to stop whaling. At the IWC meeting held in Adelaide there was a legal opinion given to suggest that the actions of Japan and other whaling nations were a clear breach of the provisions in the IWC which outlawed whaling and that so called scientific whaling was clearly not occurring and was an abuse. Given that the government made much of the changes to the EPBC Act 1999, which the Prime Minister was prepared to quote in the 2001 election policy of the coalition, saying that the slaughter of whales and dolphins in Australia’s territory should be stopped, why hasn’t the government been prepared to take legal action to stop the illegal slaughter of whales in Australian waters? (Time expired) Heritage) (5.36 pm)-In response to our amiable friend from the opposition, the member for Grayndler, I have three points about the government’s position on whaling. First, the government’s position on whaling is absolutely clear: we stand utterly opposed to whaling in any form. Our friend from the other side raises the point that in 1999 the Australian government, through the form of the then Attorney-General, were willing to take the Japanese to court in relation to the bluefin case. What that demonstrates is that there is no fear of taking action. What we do is take steps as and when appropriate and necessary. I would note particularly the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has very specifically-and I quote the words precisely-said: We have not ruled out any legal or diplomatic options to bring further pressure to Japan if that is necessary, but we obviously have to work these things through carefully, step by step ... So the position and the possibility there is clear and open, but the first task is to fight within the context of the International Whaling Commission. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, has spared absolutely no effort in that process. His life, the government’s efforts and the full efforts of our diplomatic service over a long period have been dedicated to precisely the care and protection of whales. So that is the first point. MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
209,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andThe second point is: what is the government’s formal position on scientific and commercial whaling? We are dead against both. We are absolutely, fundamentally, categorically against scientific whaling and commercial whaling. My definition of ‘scientific whaling’ is a photograph, a tracking device and a hug to send them on their way. That is about as far as it gets from our perspective. But we stand completely, resolutely, absolutely against them. The third thing is: what about the International Whaling Commission? We have heard from the member for Grayndler that it will be a catastrophe. I am delighted to report to the House a small, early, preliminary victory which has become known only in the last couple of hours. I hope the member for Grayndler hears this. I quote from a newswire report just received: Japan failed today to passand I hope that the member for Grayndler pays attentionan early procedural vote at the International Whaling Commission, suggesting the body would remain dominated by the anti-whaling lobby, as it has been for 23 years. So that is an initial step. The points in relation to our friend from the opposition are very simple. Firstly, we have been strong in relation to the protection of our waters, and we will continue to be so. Secondly, we utterly reject scientific and commercial whaling as unacceptable practices in the 21st century. Thirdly, we have had a very clear result just in the last couple of hours which is promising, which is preliminary. There is a lot more to do. We are against strong forces. But we will be absolutely clear in fighting to prevent whaling. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (5.40 pm)-I would like to raise a matter with the parliamentary secretary. He was a member of a House of Representatives committee which produced a report on employment in the environment sector which was tabled in November 2003. To date, neither the department nor the government appear to have responded to many of the very important recommendations in that report. They are asleep at the wheel on a number of issues to do with the environment, this being another one of them. In particular tonight I want to raise the fact that in Australia we lack a comprehensive national data collection on the scope of the environment industry in this country. We might have differences about and debate what exactly we mean by the environment industry, but state by state there has been progress made in trying to identify the scope of green jobs and the environment industry. However nothing has happened at the national level. This is a great tragedy because back in 2001 one of the recommendations made in the Environment Industry Action Agenda was that the ABS, together with the department, ought to get a move on and ensure that comprehensive information was available. From what I understand, the Australian Bureau of Statistics were quite open to the proposal because they had had a number of requests from industry members, from overseas and from international bodies in other countries asking for comparable data on the scope of the environment industry in Australia. In 2001 the ABS actually released a paper, the ABS Prospectus on a national survey of the environment industry. The ABS indicated that they were quite capable of carrying out such analysis and that they believed the cost of doing so would be in the order of $1.54 million for the initial survey. They estimated it would take about $1 million annually to keep that data up to date. They indicated then that they were not in a position to finance the work. MAIN COMMITTEE The matter has been raised on numerous occasions and was again raised in the report from the committee of which the parliamentary secretary was a member. Interestingly enough, the first significant recommendation was as follows: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government provide the additional funding required to enable the Australian Bureau of Statistics to collect and make available ongoing and trend data on the environment industry in Australia. The committee went on to say: ... failure to do so may impede the development of the industry and hence result in greater long term national costs to Australia. SoI am quite amazed that, year after year, attention is drawn to the obvious inadequacies in terms of having a national response to issues to do with green jobs, employment opportunities, the scope of the domestic market, the rate at which that market is growing and the export potential for green technologies. Despite many references to the need to have such data on a national basis, here we are today with no comprehensive figures that can be verified by the ABS. It appears from the budget papers-I certainly cannot find a line item on this-that the government is not responding in a serious way to this glaring omission. Heritage) (5.44 pm)-I wish to make two points in response to the member for Throsby’s contribution. The first is in relation to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage report on employment in the environment sector. It was a pleasure and a honour to share membership of that committee with the member for Throsby. In relation to that specific report, we are very close to a final presentation. One of the reasons for that delay is precisely because of the fact that we have taken this seriously. We have looked at all of the points. It is very close to a final position. I do take a personal responsibility for seeing something like that through. I have had a role in both helping to prepare the report and helping to respond to it. They are personal responsibilities and I accept the need to undertake them. We are actually in a very good position. My second comment is in relation to jobs and the environment. I note simply that the Australian government recently established the Australian water fund, which is about $2 billion for one sector of the environment. That will have a profound effect both on employment, on efficiency and on environmental care and protection. palling performance of the government when it comes to protecting Australia’s heritage. We have seen only nine sites listed on the National Heritage List. The government’s failure in this area is perhaps best exemplified by the fact that they had a special provision in the legislation to list world heritage sites and yet they chose not to simply because they were, once again, complacent. Twelve months after becoming the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Minister Campbell still has not met with his key advisory body: the National Cultural Heritage Forum. What an extraordinary performance! This body has not met-not once. It is not surprising that the minister does not want to face his critics, because this is what forum members have been saying. Emeritus Professor John Mulvaney, Australia’s pre-eminent expert on Australia’s prehistory, said in the Canberra Times on 15 June: The public should realise the cavalier and biased manner in which the new Heritage Act is administered.

Professor Bill Logan, former chairman of the National Cultural Heritage Forum, said: In a single act, the federal Environment and Heritage Ministerthat is, Minister Campbellthreatens to bring the entire national heritage list into disrepute. The Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology speaking about the Howard government’s roadworks at ANZAC Cove, which perhaps best exemplify the government’s contempt for looking after our heritage, said: ... AIMA was alarmed by the recent damage to this near-pristine archaeological site. The current works program has done more than compromise the archaeological integrity of fragile relics situated along the length of the affected road area ... may have impacted on archaeological remains within the near-shore areas. They continued: If the current management practices are allowed to continue more of Australia’s and Turkey’s cultural heritage will be lost. With regard to ANZAC Cove, we saw an absolute farcical situation whereby damage was done to one of World War I’s best-preserved battlefields. During last Friday’s Senate inquiry, it became clear that the Department of Environment and Heritage was not even made aware of the Howard government’s August 2004 request for roadworks. Perhaps what is even worse is that departmental officers were not aware of the damage caused until they read about it in the Daily Telegraph-this is according to their own evidence at that hearing. Heritage considerations were not borne in mind at all-which is extraordinary. I think it is up to the parliamentary secretary here, because he has been given the berth on this issue and Minister Truss has been exiled. It is extraordinary that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage was silent when it came to the issue of ANZAC Cove and the destruction that was caused at that site. Why has the Howard government failed so appallingly when it comes to heritage protection, when it comes to the listing of sites and when it comes to meetings of the National Cultural Heritage Forum? The only time that the minister has intervened and shown some leadership was the reactionary move to intervene against the Victorian government’s decision on alpine grazing. I would be interested in the parliamentary secretary’s view of that issue and how that reflected this government’s attitude towards our heritage. practice which had bipartisan support, at least for a number of years, in this parliament, and that was the giving of grants to conservation organisations at a national and state level and which by the action of the environment minister has now been reduced to virtually nil. I want to put on record my great appreciation of the work that voluntary conservation organisations at a state and national level have done in this country prior to the existence of the current act. In fact, I think that probably since the time of the Fraser government voluntary conservation organisations have been in receipt of modest amounts of funds which have enabled them to MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
212,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith) (5.49 Pm),"I want to draw attention to the end of aeducate the community, to campaign in their local areas and to achieve some very significant environmental outcomes. What has happened today is that environment groups have had $250,000 cut from them from most state conservation councils, and they find themselves losing out. Unfortunately, this is a trend that has been under way during the term of the Howard government and it reflects one of the most insidious trends that arise when ministers are making grants of this kind and deciding whether or not they will be maintained-that is, those who speak out are penalised. If you speak out now in Australia on conservation issues and you have an advocacy role, you can surely expect to find that this Howard government will reduce your funding and, by reducing the funding, hope to silence the voices of those in ordinary communities who seek to campaign on environment issues. I really deplore this trend, and I think it is not at all to the credit of the minister that, in this case, he has chosen to take such an action. It really renders this grants program pretty insignificant. It is really just a political program now; it does not have any aspects of the bipartisan structure that it has had in the past. Alarmingly, the cuts came one day before the end of the financial year. I just ask people to contemplate for a moment what it is like to run a state conservation council, particularly in the more remote states of South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. These state conservation councils work cooperatively at the local level with local councils-they work with people of all political persuasions-and they work very effectively with the community; they are made up significantly of volunteers. The amount of money that gets provided for them generally to pay a coordinator or someone of that sort keeps them going. As a result of the minister’s decision, their future prospects are significantly impaired and their capacity to continue to do that work and even to organise the volunteers so the volunteers can continue to make their contribution is greatly reduced. I think it is a very sad day when that happens. It is worthwhile, while I am speaking to the House, to affirm the campaign outcomes that conservation councils, local organisations and national conservation organisations have achieved. We can go back as far as the Great Barrier Reef outcome and identify most of Australia’s major national icons that have endured and taken protection from actions taken by the Commonwealth and state governments to ensure their protection because of the campaigning that these community groups were involved in. I do not think I need to labour the point, but our national income is in part provided for us by sharing these places of great natural beauty with visitors both from within Australia and from other parts of the world. The campaigns that existed from the Great Barrier Reef right through to Ningaloo Reef, for the most part, have been opposed by those interests that would see it within their realm to take some income from abusing or exploiting the natural conservation area in question. But it is the conservation councils and their wider membership from local and community groups cast around the states which provide the community interest in ensuring that someone stands up for these natural areas. It is a matter of great regret that under this environment minister these tremendous contributors to protection of the environment in Australia have had their funding so significantly reduced. I can only condemn the action of the minister in the House. Heritage) (5.54 pm)-In responding very briefly to the member for Kingsford Smith, I have three brief points to make. The first is that in relation to the grants to voluntary environment and heritage organisations, the number of groups that received grants this year has increased MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
213,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andby 62, up to 128. I significantly note that the two largest recipients are conservation councils. For, I believe, the first time, 28 groups are receiving multiyear funding. The two largest grants were for three years of $60,000 each for the South Australian Conservation Council and for Environment Victoria. So the first point is that it is an increase in the number of groups; it includes multiyear funding and, significantly-and I will come to this in a minute-small groups, in many cases, have received grants for the first time. The second point is this notion that it is about people being closed down. Environment Victoria, as I have mentioned, was the group which did best. Only today, the Executive Director of Environment Victoria put an extremely critical argument about the government in the Herald Sun. That is his right. Marcus Godinho is, in fact, somebody I know and respect but with whom on many issues I disagree. But today, with the benefit of three-year funding, it is quite interesting that he gave one of his strongest arguments ever against the Commonwealth government. I think that is precisely the opposite of what the member for Kingsford Smith put forward. The third point is that it is my understanding that 91 new small organisations who have never received GVEHOs before have been given such grants for practical purposes around Australia. Those are groups such as the Dolphin Research Institute and the Clean Ocean Foundation. The head of the Dolphin Research Institute said to me: ‘For us, this money is gold. This is worth twice the value of any other grant because of the way in which it can be applied.’ So it does have a practical impact. I respect the views presented but I respectfully disagree. raise all the issues I would like to raise. Certainly, I want to associate myself with the comments of the member for Kingsford Smith when it comes to the GVEHO program. It is symptomatic of a government that is prepared to silence civil society when the funds to voluntary environmental organisations that have served this nation so well are cut off. In particular, I do not want to miss the opportunity to raise the most important issue when it comes to the environment-that is, climate change. The parliamentary secretary would be aware that today my private member’s bill, the Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2005, had its second reading. Would the parliamentary secretary and the government agree to have a full debate and a vote on that bill in the parliament, now that it has had its second reading? It should be up to the parliament to vote on it. I noticed the parliamentary secretary did not participate in the debate today, because he knows the right thing to do is to join with other countries to be part of the international effort. The member for Stirling and, most extraordinarily, the member for Tangney spoke today in the second reading debate on my private member’s bill, and the parliament should be aware of their comments. The member for Tangney said essentially that climate change was not occurring. He said: Glaciologists working at this glacier utterly reject global warming as the causes of this glacier’s retreat. He joined with the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, who also said that climate change is not occurring. But the member for Tangney has gone one step further, because he is calling for nuclear energy. Today, he said: Total radioactivity levels on earth are slightly less after the nuclear power process. MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
214,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (5.56 Pm),"Because of time constraints I am not able toThat is an extraordinary proposition from the member for Tangney, but not quite as extraordinary as last week, when in a doorstop the member for Tangney dismissed the after-effects of Chernobyl as a minor issue and said that the impact of Chernobyl was no greater than the impact of Three Mile Island. Is it the government’s position that Chernobyl was a minor hiccup that should not be held against those who have concerns about nuclear energy? Where is the government going on this issue, given the Prime Minister and others have been openly calling for a debate on this issue and expressing support for nuclear energy? We want to hold the government accountable. If it is the case that the government wants nuclear energy, we want to know which member opposite will put up their hand and say, ‘I want a nuclear reactor in my electorate’whether it is the member for Tangney, the member for Flinders or other members. This is an important issue, because it is a distraction from the fact that the government is not prepared to take the issue of climate change seriously and take action. If you look at the massive increases in greenhouse gas emissions in every sector of the economy-except in land clearing, which, due to the decisions of the Beattie and Carr governments, is why Australia will meet its target of 108 per cent on 1990 levels-it is of great concern that current projections by the Australian Greenhouse Office show emissions of 123 per cent by the year 2020 on 1990 levels. The final question which I would like addressed by the parliamentary secretary is: in an era of climate change, where such change is a dominant political and environmental issue, why was it confirmed that the Australian Greenhouse Office was abolished in the budget, following the announcement in October last year, and why is it that the National Oceans Office has also been abolished and taken back into the department? Isn’t it the case that, by doing that to the Australian Greenhouse Office and the National Oceans Office, their independence and ability to put forward positions will be stifled by a government which, when you go back to its attitude towards community organisations, is very clearly determined to stifle any dissent? Heritage) (6.01 pm)-I am delighted to present the Environment and Heritage portfolio appropriation for 2005-06, and I thank all members who have spoken. I have endeavoured to respond to them, and I will address one or two of the questions they have raised. Overall, I wish to address three things during the course of this response: firstly, some of the major items which are part of the government’s package; secondly, some of the specific initiatives; and, thirdly, the question of water and also climate change. In looking at the major items, it is important to note that the whole-of-government allocation in the current budget for expenditure on Environment and Heritage functions for the coming year is $3.2 billion. In particular, $923.7 million is within the Environment and Heritage portfolio itself. The major items can be categorised as follows. Firstly, there is $337 million for the Australian water fund-a fund which, I think it would be agreed by members of both sides, is an outstanding step forward in dealing with Australia’s water issues and water challenges. That is made up of $253 million for Water Smart Australia and $30 million for national water standards, both of which are administered by the National Water Commission, and a further $54 million for the Australian government’s community water grants, which will be administered jointly by the Department of the Environment and Heritage and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I think that is a tremendous initiative. A second MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
215,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andcore initiative in the coming year is the $310 million for the Natural Heritage Trust. This is administered, again, by the two departments. A third element is $168 million for the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. Those three elements together-the Australian water fund, the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality-are absolutely fundamental, along with the greenhouse work we are doing, in providing the pillars of major practical work for the environment. The second element that I want to talk about is the set of specific new initiatives which are highlighted within the appropriations bill. Firstly, there is $100 million over five years for the Commonwealth environment research facilities, the CERFs. This includes $40 million to create a marine and tropical research facility, and $60 million more generally for environmental research. These are very important steps forward. There is an amount of $46.3 million over four years for the Australia-Antarctic air link-again, a very important step forward and a particular initiative proposed and driven by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell. In terms of national and regional security, there is $40.5 million over four years for the Australian tsunami warning system for the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean coastlines. Something which I am very pleased to support is a contribution of $19.8 million additional funding-which, rounded up, makes about $30 million all up-over six years to replace 12 of the Bureau of Meteorology’s oldest field meteorological offices around Australia. I was recently able to see the capacity that exists within a new field office and the way in which that gives us better forecasting capability. There are other significant initiatives that we take forward. They include $10.5 million for the National Heritage Investment Initiative, which in part answers some of the criticisms made by the member for Grayndler in relation to heritage. The focus is on practical heritage application and protection. There is $11.4 million for the Photovoltaic Rebate Program, $9½ million for regional marine planning, another $5.2 million over four years for the National Pollutant Inventory and, very importantly, $2 million for used oil recycling. So there is a series of initiatives. I also note the National Water Initiative going forward, specifically the investment of $1.8 billion in greenhouse and climate change responses. That is a very significant process and represents the total package that the Australian government announced over a year ago in relation to energy, greenhouse emissions and climate change. It is all of those things taken together. For those reasons, I commend the appropriation to the House. I believe it represents an important investment in the Australian environment and heritage sector. diture for the Environment and Heritage portfolio be agreed to. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Health and Ageing Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $3,696,264,000. Ms GILLARD (Lalor) (6.07 pm)-It is no surprise that today started with newspapers with banner headlines about the Howard government trashing democracy, because this evening the Howard government is trashing the opportunity to question the Minister for Health and Ageing on matters in the budget. We were advised that the minister for health would perMAIN COMMITTEE",173,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
216,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bk Bishop),"The question is that the proposed expensonally attend this consideration in detail, only to find that he is now not in attendance. Clearly that decision has been taken because the Medicare safety net cover-up has to continue. The minister would have been aware that many of our questions to him would have been about his personal state of knowledge about the likelihood-or, should I say, lack of likelihood-of the Howard government keeping its ‘iron-clad, rock solid guarantee’ on the Medicare safety net on the day it was given. Of course, the Howard government has pulled the old trick of sending along a different minister who cannot possibly know about someone else’s state of knowledge. However, what I will do is indicate the key areas in the Medicare safety net that require answers. These relate to the budget measure titled ‘Medicare-increase in thresholds for the Medicare safety net’. That measure stripped some $499 million from the Medicare safety net. I am in a position to supply those questions in writing to the Minister for Ageing, who is at the table. I note that one of Minister Abbott’s key political advisers is present in the gallery, so it ought to be a simple matter for the minister at the table to turn to Minister Abbott’s key political adviser and get a guarantee that these questions, which are in writing, will be answered in writing before the parliament rises today-given that Minister Abbott indicated he was going to be here and at the last minute is not here. The questions that I am seeking answers to on this appropriation are as follows. The recent Senate estimates process revealed that the minister’s department was well equipped with information about the escalating cost of the Medicare safety net. The Health Insurance Commission was providing weekly and monthly reports on the Medicare safety net. This included weekly data reports to the department which provided information such as actual Medicare safety net benefits paid. These weekly reports came on top of existing daily reports on Medicare being delivered by the HIC to the department. This weekly information was revealing to the department variations between the estimates in the cost of the safety net compared with the actual cost of 72 per cent in August, 60 per cent in July and 43 per cent in June. Against that backdrop where we know for sure that the department of health was getting weekly data about the cost blow-outs in the Medicare safety net, the questions the minister for health needs to answer-and the minister at the table needs to give an undertaking that he will answer-are these. On what date was the minister first briefed about the blow-out in costs? On how many occasions was he briefed? What actions did he take following these briefings? Is the minister-that is, the Minister for Health and Ageing-aware that an officer in the department of finance was concerned enough about the blow-out to contact the finance minister’s office on more than one occasion? When was the minister first made aware that an officer in the department of finance was so concerned he contacted the finance minister’s office? Given that the finance minister was orally briefed on this issue, does the minister for health maintain that he was not briefed or contacted by the finance minister or his office about the matter? Specifically, did the minister or his staff discuss the blow-out with the Prime Minister, the minister for finance, the Treasurer or their staff? If so, when and what were the contents of these discussions? Is the minister aware of a graph detailing the safety net blow-out consistently referred to by his departmental secretary at Senate estimates? Is the minister aware that his departmental secretary refused to table the graph despite repeated requests to do so? Will the minister now table that graph? MAIN COMMITTEE It ought to be a simple matter for the Minister for Ageing, now at the table, to ascertain from Mr Barnes in the gallery that she is in a position to offer a ministerial undertaking that these questions will be answered in writing, given the minister’s nonattendance at this consideration in detail debate, before the House rises this evening? that it is perfectly proper for the Minister for Ageing to be in attendance in these discussions in detail. The minister may reply now if she wishes to or at a later point in the debate. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Minister for Ageing) (6.12 pm)-At this point I do not require nor do I seek advice from the member for Lalor on how I should conduct myself in this debate. I will wait until she has concluded her submissions before responding. Ms GILLARD (Lalor) (6.12 pm)-I understand that the Minister for Ageing would be attending in her capacity to answer questions in the consideration in detail debate insofar as they relate to allocations for ageing in the budget. The problem here is, of course, that she is the only person who has attended who could deal with the consideration in detail on health, given the nonattendance of the Minister for Health and Ageing. I am also in a position to supply questions to the minister at the table-and would seek an undertaking in respect of these as well-relating to the electorate by electorate data about the Medicare safety net. As I think anybody who participated in the last federal election campaign would be aware, the Minister for Health and Ageing released during the campaign electorate by electorate breakdowns of expenditure on the safety net. That was done during the campaign-probably one of the greatest own goals in Australian politics, but I will not let that delay me. What we know from Senate estimates is that the minister is regularly briefed on electorate by electorate breakdowns on Medicare safety net expenditure and that electorate by electorate expenditure can be ascertained from the regular report provided by the Health Insurance Commission to the department. So if the minister is not releasing this information publicly, that is not a cost matter; that is simply a public accountability matter-that is, he has data of relevance to the Australian community and he chooses to cover it up. On that basis I would ask for an undertaking from the minister at the table that the Minister for Health and Ageing will answer the following questions in writing before the close of parliament today. Firstly, why won’t the minister release information about the safety net by electorate, as he did during the last election, which revealed that those with the highest incomes and capacity to spend more are getting the most benefit from the safety net? Is the minister-that is, the Minister for Health and Ageing-aware that this information can be ascertained from the regular report provided from the HIC to the department? Given that his own department admitted to briefing the minister regularly on this data, why won’t the minister release it? I will now take steps to supply these questions in writing to the Minister for Ageing and I will seek her undertaking on them before the close of this consideration in detail debate. sponds to your question. Ms HALL (Shortland) (6.15 pm)-There are four issues that I wish to raise. I trust that the Minister for Ageing will pass them on to the Minister for Health and Ageing.

217,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bk Bishop),I would point out to the member for Lalor,176,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
218,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bk Bishop),"It is a matter for the minister how she reto see what happens over the next 12 months with the trials that are taking place-tonight I would like to raise issues relating to health. The first is the issue of the Belmont Medicare office. One of the first acts of the Howard government was to close the Belmont Medicare office. It was closed not because it was not processing a high number of claims but for some perverse reason that I have yet to have explained to me. It supported a very elderly population. Old people in the electorate who did not have cars had to travel about 20 kilometres, to either Charlestown or Lake Haven, to access a Medicare office. Belmont is in a central position for the people of Swansea, an area that maintains a very elderly population. The Shortland electorate is the 10th oldest electorate in Australia, as I am sure the Minister for Ageing is aware. This is quite a big issue. The previous member for Shortland and I have submitted in excess of 20,000 signatures to this House from people within the electorate who really need the Medicare office reopened. I ask the minister to consider that request. The Medicare office at Toukley is, once again, an area with an elderly population. I have submitted petitions to this House of around 1,000 signatures from people within that area. There is poor transport provided in that area-it is private as opposed to public transportand it takes people an hour to two hours to travel some eight kilometres to the nearest Medicare office. The member for Dobell is in the chamber. I am sure he would like to join with me on this next issue: the need to address the chronic doctor shortage that exists on the Central Coast. Mr Ticehurst interjectingto see a doctor. Was that an agreement, Member for Dobell? worked with a number of organisations, including the Hunter Urban Division of GPs and the local council. I have called before for the member for Dobell to work with me on this issue to no avail. I think it is an absolute disgrace when elderly people have to wait for up to two or three weeks to get an appointment with a doctor. There is an absolute crisis on the Central Coast. If something does not happen now, I think the government will be culpable because people will lose their lives simply because they cannot get an appointment with their doctor. Unfortunately, the doctor shortage is increasing and is now finding its way into the Lake Macquarie area of the Shortland electorate. Once again, the extremities of the electorate-the people in the far north of the Central Coast-are experiencing the greatest doctor shortage. Within Lake Macquarie, the people on the southern end are experiencing the greatest shortage. Unless something happens soon, there is going to be a real crisis in this area. The final point that I want to raise is that, at the New South Wales ALP conference the weekend before last, Bob Carr announced that there would be an after-hours GP service set up in Wyong Hospital. WhatI am asking for tonight is an undertakingMr Ticehurst interjectingMAIN COMMITTEE",176,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006

223,Mr Ticehurst,"I thought they were closing down the beds and wards at Wyong Hospital.at Wyong Hospital. But, believe me, the people of Wyong shire, the people that live in that area, do. (Extension of time granted) WhatI am doing tonight is calling on the government to support that after-hours clinic at Wyong Hospital, to work with the state government to ensure that the people of the Central Coast get the absolute best service that they can. They need that after-hours service. I would like the minister to come back to me with answers to those four questions. Health and Ageing is not here this evening to address these issues, because some of the ones that I am bringing up are vitally important, particularly dental care. This is a huge issue within my electorate, particularly considering that 20 per cent of the population are aged over 65. Health matters, and particularly dental health matters, are ones that I hear about every single day. So many people are having to wait, sometimes over two years, to get their teeth fixed or to get their dentures repaired. I often hear terrible stories of people in pain who are unable to eat and of people whose ill-fitting dentures have fallen out. The situations that some people are in because of the fact that the federal funding was removed from this program in 1997 are just horrendous across the board. In fact it is a constitutional responsibility for the federal government to provide for dental health care. I had hoped to ask the minister directly why that federal funding is not being put into this very important area, because it is not just your teeth that are affected-dental care can affect your overall health as well. It can have impacts upon people in terms of strokes and heart disease, and also for people suffering from diabetes. This really is a major health concern across the nation but particularly in my electorate, as I say, because of the large number of elderly people. I would like to hear from the minister as to when he intends adhering to the federal government responsibility, as contained in the Constitution, to ensure that there is funding for dental health care. The other major health issue that I want to raise with him is the absolute desperate need for a Medicare office in the southern section of my electorate. Presently people can only travel to Tweed or Lismore to access a Medicare office, and it is often very difficult-again, particularly for elderly people or for those on low incomes-for them to get transport to those areas. During the election campaign when Labor announced the policy of having a Medicare office in Mullumbimby, this was received so well by so many people who so desperately needed to have a Medicare office close by. I was hoping to ask the minister first-hand as to when there would be a Medicare office in the southern section of the Richmond electorate. The other matter that I want to raise is specifically in relation to ageing and the provision of home care. As I said, 20 per cent of the Richmond electorate are aged over 65. This is one of the highest proportions in the country. Current estimates are saying that in 2040 that is what Australia’s population will be like. That is many years away. Right here and now on the ground that is what we have got in Richmond. So we are seeing first-hand the needs of an ageing population and indeed how desperate those needs have become. In AprilI held an aged care summit, for the very reason that people were approaching me daily about their concerns, particularly in relation to the lack of home care within the Richmond electorate. People were saying that they would be assessed for home care and would have to wait sometimes eight, nine or 10 months. Let us just take a moment to look at these MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
224,Ms Hall,No. The member for Dobell does not seem to support the after-hours service,178,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
225,Mrs Elliot (Richmond) (6.20 Pm),"I, too, am very disappointed that the Minister forpeople. They have moved to this area and they have retired there. They often tend to not have a lot of family or community networks. One of the partners gets sick, they get assessed for home care and they have to sit at home waiting for those eight, nine or 10 months. In fact, most people are often told: ‘Look, there is just no federal funding, so you’ll just have to wait.’ What do these people do? What ends up happening, often, if they are lucky, is that a volunteer organisation is able to provide some sort of limited care. But at the end of the day you have many hundreds of elderly people sitting in their homes deteriorating day by day. I think, in this day and age, that is absolutely horrendous. As I say, this is what Australia’s population is going to be like in 35 years. We have got to get it right-on the ground, here and now, in Richmond-with our ageing population. I notice that 2,000 new dementia packages were announced in the budget, but that is nationally. It hardly touches the surface of what is desperately needed in this area. I want to comment on the 75 packages that were released not too long ago from Grafton to the border. We are talking about a huge area: the electorate of Richmond goes from Skennars Head to Tweed Heads and we have the highest proportion of elderly people, and they are not getting the packages they so desperately need. As I say, they wait eight, nine and 10 months. What sort of respect is that for elderly people who have worked all their lives, who have now retired, who have been assessed for this home care and who then have to wait this long period of time? Sometimes they are even waiting longer than this. I think our elderly deserve better and I would like to know from the Minister for Ageing why there was not more provision for home care from the federal government in areas like Richmond where we have the highest proportion of elderly people and where the need is so desperate. We have to make sure that we are providing for the elderly people in our society. Ms HALL (Shortland) (6.25 pm)-I have a couple of quick questions for the Minister for Ageing. I would like to join with the member for Richmond on the issue that she raised about the lack of HACC services for people living in the community of Lake Macquarie on the Central Coast. I ask the minister to consider extending those services so that there are more available. I note that more packages have been released, as the member for Richmond said, but I think that the minister needs to look at a strategy to encourage the service providers to deliver those packages to more outlying areas. Within the electorate of Shortland many of the providers are in the inner Newcastle area-this is in the Lake Macquarie part-and it is very difficult to find any providers at all in the outlying regions like Catherine Hill Bay and Nords Wharf. Similarly people living in the more outlying and difficult areas on the Central Coast are not serviced in the same way. The other issue I raise is respite. I note that the government has increased the time available for respite for people but I am not sure whether the minister is aware that in many areas throughout Australia, particularly in my electorate, it is very difficult to access respite beds. Therefore there needs to be a strategy put in place, not only extending the time but ensuring that people can access respite beds when they need them. Ms GILLARD (Lalor) (6.27 pm)-I have two more questions about the budget measures which require answer andquorum. MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
226,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bk Bishop),"I advise that the bells are ringing for adid not supply answers to these questions because they are of vital interest to Australians with lung cancer, epilepsy and depression and to those at risk of osteoporosis. One of the measures in the budget was the implementation of the Howard government’s election savings measure which was the 12.5 per cent benchmark pricing measure in respect of the PBS. My questions are these: will the Minister for Health and Ageing or the Minister for Ageing, who is at the table on his behalf-and if the Minister for Ageing is unable to do so will she procure an undertaking that the Minister for Health and Ageing will answer these questions-confirm that the Department of Health and Ageing did not have anything to do with costing the 12.5 per cent benchmark price changes under the PBS? Will the minister guarantee that no drugs other than the ones announced last Wednesday will be subject to a special patient contribution-that is, drugs beyond the four comprehended in last Wednesday’s press release? I refer to that press release, which announced the special patient contributions, in which the minister said that he had received expert advice that other PBS-listed drugs can be used in place of the four drugs that now have special patient contributions. Who provided this advice? When was it provided and will the minister release it? As patented drugs move to generics, there is a question about the way in which savings are catered for on the PBS. We have been advised-and this was a badge of honour worn by the minister’s department at Senate estimates-that the department have been in consultation with the drug industry about when branded drugs are going to move to generics in respect of the 12½ per cent pricing measure. Yet we had been told by them before the last election that they could not quantify such savings for the general costs of the PBS. My question is: why aren’t the savings from the statins, which everybody knows are coming off patent, and from the SSRI group of drugs, which everybody knows are coming off patent, factored into the expenditure forecasts of the PBS? Why is the department of health capable of forecasting and costing these savings for one budget purpose-that is, to support the Howard government’s election promise about 12½ per cent benchmark pricing-but not for the general purpose of accurately forecasting PBS spending and the potential for savings? Briefly, on the decision to take calcium tablets off the PBS, has any modelling been done on the impact of the removal of calcium tablets from the PBS on calcium tablet usage by people at risk of osteoporosis? Finally, will the minister guarantee that no other medicine will be delisted from the PBS without a recommendation of the PBAC? I am in a position to supply those questions to the minister at the table, the Minister for Ageing, in writing. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Minister for Ageing) (6.31 pm)-The member for Lalor has produced a series of questions in writing. She has offered to produce more questions in writing. The undertaking I give to her is that I will pass the questions on to the Minister for Health and Ageing. I turn to the matters that the member for Shortland raised. In relation to afterhours GP services, we are working with New South Wales to establish after-hours GP clinics at the hospitals in Liverpool, Nepean and Lismore, and Wyong could be eligible for support from the Round the Clock Medicare election commitment. The minister would certainly be happy to have discussions with the New South Wales government in that regard. Both the member for Shortland and the member for Richmond raised Medicare offices. The Minister for Human Services, Minister Joe Hockey, is responsible for the Health Insurance Commission. The issue of when Medicare offices open and close obviously depends on local MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
227,Ms Gillard,"It would be a breathtaking act of arrogance if the Howard governmentdemand, as that changes. I am happy to pass these issues on to Minister Hockey, as the minister responsible for the Health Insurance Commission. The member for Shortland also raised the issue of respite care. The Australian government introduced the National Respite for Carers Program. It currently has funding of about $130 million. In the last budget we announced further funding of $208 million specifically for respite care, directed to areas of need, including further respite for working carers. In other words, this is to give them more flexibility by having respite centres open before and after working hours. There are increased incentives for residential aged care providers to have respite places available and to increase the uptake of respite, because we find that not all providers are fully utilising the allocated respite. That is why the extra funding has been allocated in this budget. We have also increased the funding for overnight and cottage style respite, which will be welcome in all areas-metropolitan, outer metropolitan, rural and regional-and there is more funding for respite in rural and regional Australia through the multipurpose services. The issue of dental care was raised by the member for Richmond. Dental care is a matter for state and territory governments. It is not a matter for the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth’s role has been in supporting dental services through the private health insurance rebate, and that is also focusing on the needs of older Australians with the increasing private health rebate for people over the ages of 65 and 70. The member for Richmond also complained of the lack of aged care funding in her electorate. I thought that when I visited her electorate over the weekend for the very pleasant opening of an aged care home in Byron BayI was able to outline to her and to the community representatives present that, in fact, the Australian government has committed a great deal of funding to the Far North Coast region in which the electorate of Richmond lies. There has been a 50 per cent increase in the allocation of aged care places in the Far North Coast region. The national increase has been 33 per cent but in the Far North Coast, in response to the increasing numbers of people over the age of 70, there has been a 50 per cent increase even though the age cohort over 70 has increased by some 29 per cent. The member for Richmond must be aware that aged care planning allocations are made via an independent, objective arms-length process that involves local planning advisory committees who advise on special needs. It is done through the Department of Health and Ageing. In terms of the allocation of places, this government’s record is exemplary. From the period of 1996 to 2007, over 95,200 aged care places will have been allocated across Australia. The member for Richmond obviously was not in parliament in 1996. She would have been mightily embarrassed by the report of the Auditor-General that when Labor left office in 1996 there was a 10,000 place deficit. SoI do not think Labor members can come into this House with any integrity and complain about the allocation of aged care places when this government rectified the deficit and has now allocated some 95,200 places across Australia for the period 1996 to 2007.

This incident prompted an extraordinary reaction from Australians from every walk of life. Over 1,500 locals donned their wetsuits and waded into the shallows to help rescue these stranded whales. Their efforts were rewarded with the successful return of the bulk of that pod to the open sea. This incident demonstrates the deep respect and affection which the Australian people have for these giants of the deep. Furthermore, it demonstrates the strong public interest in Australia in the conservation of the species. So it is worth taking this opportunity to reflect on what steps our fearless foreign minister has taken to protect these creatures. It is particularly timely to do so today, the first day of the 2005 annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Ulsan in South Korea. Regrettably, our foreign minister has been missing in action on this issue. We have seen a flurry of activity from the environment minister, Senator Campbell, over the last six weeks or so, largely I suspect in response to prompting from those of us on this side of the House and from those in the media. But we fear that this may prove to be an inadequate response if what we are concerned about is the ending of Japan’s abuse of the practice of so-called whaling for scientific purposes. Japan of course has made no secret of its whaling ambitions. Since the commercial whaling ban was first introduced in 1986, Japan has been building up its support base within the International Whaling Commission, and its efforts have hardly gone unnoticed. At every IWC meeting since 1986 Japan has proposed a motion to allow it to hunt whales commercially in the Pacific. Over the years the balance of support on this matter within the IWC has gradually changed from a majority in favour of keeping the ban to an approximate fifty-fifty split. Today, on this first day of the 2005 IWC meeting, we will see whether Japan has finally been able to stack out this meeting. Voting on procedural motions today should begin to reveal the final balance between the proand anti-whaling lobbies of the IWC. Japan may be getting very close to achieving a majority vote in support of a resumption of commercial whaling. But our concern, whether or not that occurs, is with what happens about Japan’s continued abuse of so-called scientific whaling in general. Under the IWC rules, a change to the moratorium on commercial whaling requires a 75 per cent majority of the meeting. The political reality is that a simple majority vote in favour of commercial whaling would be a serious setback for those wanting to bring an end to the slaughter of these magnificent beasts. Japanese whaling ambitions and its efforts to increase its influence on the IWC are of course not new. These have been looming for years. This is therefore a matter on which the government should have been working for years, just as the government of Japan has been working for years on this matter-not just for the past six weeks, when it became a public item of media attention. So today, on the day when the balance at the IWC is at risk of tipping in favour of the pro-whaling lobby for the first time or at least getting close to that, the question must be asked: what has the government done to counteract the influence of Japan and other prowhaling countries on the IWC over the past few years? We are in the ridiculous situation MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
229,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (6.36 Pm),"Members may be aware that on 2 June 2005 a pod of 60where neighbours and good friends of Australia such as Kiribati, the Solomons, Tuvalu and now, as we discovered over the weekend, Nauru may well have joined Japan in the IWC to support the lifting of the commercial whaling ban. If that occurs-and it is still a big ‘if’, because we do not know the outcome of the vote-it would be a most disturbing development in terms of the effectiveness of Australian diplomacy in the south-west Pacific. With Nauru’s overnight announcement that it would be joining the IWC as part of the pro-whaling lobby, questions must be asked about the effectiveness of, in particular, Australia’s diplomatic efforts with that country. (Time expired) pm)-The member for Griffith-and I think the entire nation-is aware that Australia is strongly opposed to Japan’s plans to increase its scientific whaling effort. In fact, Australia is one of the leading organisations in advocating for the interests of this remarkable mammal. This includes our actions in our own immediate neighbourhood but also more broadly in our work through the International Whaling Commission. More than half of the IWC, including Australia, have refused to review the Japanese arrangements until an independent review of the original scientific whaling program of Japan has been undertaken. We have not ruled in or out any particular action, because at this stage the crucial thing, to which I think the member for Griffith was alluding, is diplomacy. Diplomacy is at this stage our most direct pathway for securing the best prospect for success. Our nation has been working with other like-minded countries to put pressure on the Japanese not only directly through their Ministry of Foreign Affairs but also through their fishing agencies-so at a diplomatic level and at a scientific level. Australia has also been urging other members of the IWC to cease this so-called scientific whaling. As you would know, Senator Campbell has done a remarkable job in directly approaching a number of Pacific island countries and European countries to lobby in support of our position. The Prime Minister and the foreign minister have directly written to their counterparts in the governments of a number of IWC member states, seeking support for our position on whaling. That work continues, including most recent representations in light of Nauru’s decision to join the IWC. SoI think it is a little unfair and disingenuous to say that nothing has been happening. There has been extensive effort going forward. We understand the diplomatic pressures that are being brought to bear on countries through Japan using levers such as aid projects and the like. We are mindful of that. Ordinarily we are partners with Japan on good governance, aid harmonisation and the like, but here we are on different sides of the argument. But absolutely no suggestion can be sustained that anything other than complete vigour is going into the Australian effort to support our position at the IWC. was considering joining the International Whaling Commission? Did Senator Campbell visit Nauru? Has the Australian foreign minister raised these matters with his counterpart in Nauru? What action was taken to influence and persuade Nauru to support Australia’s strong antiwhaling position? What representations has the government, at its broadest level, made to the government of Nauru? There is a larger question about Foreign Minister Downer’s role in the conduct of Australia’s diplomatic efforts in the IWC. What action has the foreign minister personally taken in support of Australia’s antiwhaling stance?

231,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (6.44 Pm),"When did the government first become aware that Naurunated us. When asked, the department was unable to point to any representations made by the foreign minister since the IWC meeting in 2004-not one. Senator Faulkner said: Thank you. Before the Prime Minister raised this issue on his visit to Japan from 20 to 21 April, are you aware of this issue being raised at the ministerial level at all? Ms Adams, who I believe is Ambassador for the Environment, replied: No, I am not aware of it being raised at ministerial level prior to the recent set of representations on the proposed increase of the so-called scientific whaling program. It would appear that Mr Downer has not even bothered to pick up the phone to call his Japanese counterpart about this issue. If he has, he has not made that public. It would appear that, when the foreign minister visited Japan, he did not raise it face to face with his Japanese counterpart during his visit to Japan between 21 and 23 March this year. We also have some illuminating revelations from Senate estimates. Senator Faulkner, a great friend to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in his role in Senate estimates, asked: Was the whaling issue raised by Minister Downer during that visit? Ms Morton replied: I do not recall that it was, no. Senator FAULKNER-It was not? Ms Morton-I do not believe so, no. Senator FAULKNER-It was not raised by the minister. Was it raised by officials during that visit? Ms Morton-Not to my knowledge. So there we have the minister, on this matter of deep concern to the Australian people, simply asleep at the wheel. The bottom line is that he was in Japan, in Tokyo. He was meeting with the Japanese government. He is the foreign minister of Australia. His departmental annual report says he has co-responsibility with the Minister for the Environment and Heritage for discharging Australia’s policy obligations in whaling policy around the world. And what does our fearless foreign minister do in Japan? I presume he had a great game of tennis-a bit of golf maybe, I am not quite sure-but did he actually engage in the whaling policy issue? I do not think so. In fact, Senate estimates confirms through departmental officials that he did no such thing. Let us go again to Senate estimates, where we have further interesting revelations on the government’s energetic efforts in defence of the world’s whaling population. Senator FAULKNER-Is it the foreign minister who is responsible for dealing with the Japanese on this? It is being handled by DFAT and the foreign minister, isn’t it? Campbell has been taking the lead on this. The Ambassador for the Environment has been a long standing position based in DFAT, but on all these matters the foreign minister takes a very close interest. Mind you, not close enough to actually raise this during his visit to Japan-that would be too close an interest-but Dr Raby, ever the loyal public servant, said that in fact the minister has a very close interest in whaling matters. Senator Faulkner asked: What is DFAT’s role? Now, there is a core and cutting question. Dr Raby said: DFAT’s role is to support the activities of Senator Campbell, to support the Ambassador for the EnvironmentMAIN COMMITTEE",183,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
232,Dr Raby,"No, the lead agency is the Department of the Environment and Heritage, and Senatora DFAT appointeeand, as necessary and required through our diplomatic mission in Tokyo, to make representations. It seems that, despite the fact that this matter involved a major international meeting and the lobbying of foreign governments-all matters that clearly fall within the job description of the Minister for Foreign AffairsMr Downer has seen fit to outsource his responsibility on this to a junior minister in another portfolio. Bruce, you could have done a lot better than this. In fact, I would have been much happier had you taken up the cudgels on this matter instead of throwing it to the C team-namely, the minister for environment. Having made only half-hearted, last-minute efforts to save whales on the international stage-and then, largely in response to political pressure from the opposition and the mediawhat has the Howard government’s record been much closer to home? Let us look at the whole question of whaling in the Australian Whale Sanctuary. (Extension of time granted) With great fanfare, the Howard government proposed the establishment of an Australian whale protection zone in the Australian Antarctic waters. It established that under an act of the Australian parliament, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Section 229 of that act makes it a criminal offence to take any action which leads to the death or injury of a whale within the Australian Whale Sanctuary. The offence is punishable by imprisonment of up to two years or a $110,000 fine. These are serious laws. The government has obviously seen fit to legislate in this parliament to protect Australia’s whale population. But what has happened since? When it became known that since 1999, Japanese whalers have taken out hundreds of whales in those waters and the matter was then brought to the Federal Court, what did the Australian government do through the Attorney General? One answer is that it did nothing; another answer is that it did a lot. What it did was effectively harpoon the case being brought by the Humane Society International to try and protect Australian whales in the self-proclaimed Australian Whale Sanctuary. The Humane Society International, HSI, launched proceedings in the Federal Court against the Japanese company Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd. It has asked the Federal Court of Australia for a ruling that the company’s actions are illegal. It has also asked the court for an injunction which would prohibit the further killing of whales in Australian waters. The bulk of HSI’s evidence against the company comes from the Japanese government’s own reports to the IWC on its scientific research program. HSI claims that the cruise reports of the Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the Antarctic, JARPA, indicate that, since 2000, the Japanese company the subject of the legal challenge has illegally killed over 400 whales within the Australian Whale Sanctuary. What was the Howard government’s response to this move by the humane society to enforce its own laws? Not only has the government refused to do its own job of enforcing Australian law; it has actually moved to block the Humane Society International’s attempts to do so. The Attorney-General, on behalf of the Howard government and presumably Foreign Minister Downer and Environment Minister Senator Campbell, made a submission to the Federal Court in which he argued: (1) that Australia’s sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory and the adjacent maritime zones are not recognised by Japan; and (2) that Japan would consider any attempt by Australia to enforce Australian law in the Australian Antarctic Territory as a breach of international law. The Attorney-General admitted in his submission that, firstly, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act has force in the AustraMAIN COMMITTEE lian Antarctic Territory, including against foreigners; and, secondly, the fact that foreign states do not recognise the law does not preclude the application of the law to nationals of that state. Nevertheless, the Attorney-General said that the government considers it ‘more appropriate to pursue diplomatic solutions in relation to the activities by foreign vessels’ off the Australian Antarctic Territory. In other words, the government says: ‘Yes, the Japanese are breaking Australian laws, and the fact that Japan does not recognise our sovereignty does not preclude us from taking action to enforce our laws, but we would prefer not to enforce our laws. We would rather use diplomacy instead.’ That diplomacy appears to be demonstrably failing. In other words-‘Oops! Sorry, we don’t want to offend the Japanese. We don’t want to create a diplomatic incident. We’re not about to enforce our own laws.’ This is a Howard government law to protect a Howard government proclaimed Australian Whale Sanctuary, established under a Howard government act of parliament. Their response to the Australian people has been that they are too weak to do anything about it. Frankly, it is pathetic. It is more than pathetic; it involves a level of deception as well. On 27 May, the Federal Court in Sydney confirmed what we would argue as being the Howard government’s hypocritical response to the slaughter of whales in the Australian Whale Sanctuary adjacent to Antarctica. The Howard government’s intervention in the case caused the court to refuse permission to the Humane Society International to proceed against Japanese whaling companies. Specifically, the Federal Court cited the intervention of the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, who argued that to enforce Australian law against the Japanese company ‘would be likely to give rise to international disagreement with Japan’. Labor’s calls for the government to take action against Japan in the International Court of Justice have only been reinforced by the decision of the Federal Court. Our view now is that, because of the difficulties this case has run into, we need to take the legal challenge to Japan to a new level. We say that, given what has occurred in the Federal Court, the only available jurisdiction to bring about the proper protection for whales world wide is for an appropriate action to be taken in the International Court of Justice. (Extension of time granted) You see, what happened with the Federal Court matter was this: we had an Australian government proclaimed law concerning the Australian Antarctic Territory waters, within which was proclaimed an Australian Whale Sanctuary, and the government said, ‘Well, we can’t really enforce that law because there’s not sufficient international legal recognition of Australia’s sovereignty claim in that area.’ Isn’t that a problem at the very time you proclaim the Australian Whale Sanctuary in the first place? If you thought in 1999 it was a bogus proposition, why did you do it? Why did you put out the press releases? Why did you try and claim the political credit? If you thought back then it was unenforceable, why go through the great political song-and-dance routine of pretending that it is real? This is an extraordinary matter. The argument, however, that the government put in submissions was that Australian law does apply in these areas, including in relation to foreign vessels-and it is time the government got serious about this. That is why we think the only course of action available is an appropriate action before the ICJ. The scientific research exemption on the international whaling convention provides an opportunity for Japanese whalers to flout the ban on commercial whaling. We believe that there may well be a strong case under international law that Japan is not acting in good faith or in accordance with its treaty obligations under the International Convention for the Regulation MAIN COMMITTEE of Whaling, 1946. In support of this proposition we would point to an article by professor of international law Gillian Triggs. The article was published in the Asia Pacific Journal of International Law 2000 and explored the possibility of taking Japan to the ICJ on the basis that its hunting of whales for scientific purposes constitutes an abuse of rights. In summary, the basis of a possible claim would be that Japan is abusing its permit to kill whales for scientific purposes and that this is not in accordance with the intention of the IWC treaty. The doctrine of the abuse of rights is essentially an extension of the principle that rights must be exercised in good faith-in other words, that a right must be exercised for the purpose for which it exists, not to undermine that purpose. In other words, a right granted under a treaty must not be used for the purpose of evading an obligation under that treaty. The doctrine of the abuse of rights has recently been recognised in the shrimp-turtle case, in which the WTO appellate body found that a state must exercise its treaty rights reasonably and in a bona fide matter and that, while the state may invoke an exception allowed in a treaty, a balance must be achieved between the exercise of that exceptional right and the treaty rights of other parties. Professor Triggs in her article sets out the possible case against Japan. As a member of the IWC, Japan has voluntarily agreed to be bound by the international convention on whaling, which prohibits the killing of whales for commercial use. Japan’s hunting of whales is conducted under an exemption to that treaty which allows for special permits to be granted for the killing of whales for scientific purposes. It is argued that Japan, through its use of this exemption, is not acting for scientific purposes as required but instead using the exemption to procure whales for commercial sale, which is prohibited under the convention. It is therefore argued that Japan is not acting in good faith and is in fact abusing this right in order to evade its treaty obligations under the convention to observe the moratorium on commercial whaling. It is further argued that Japan’s evasion of its treaty obligations undermines the legitimate interests of other states party to the IWC which have a legitimate interest in the moratorium on commercial whaling being honoured. It is basically a matter of degrees. To make out the case, Australia would need to demonstrate that the primary purpose of the permit was other than for scientific research. While Japan would be able to show that the permits are used for scientific research, Australia could call its bona fides into doubt if it could demonstrate, for example, that the research (1) has little scientific value, (2) could be conducted without actually killing whales, (3) could be conducted by the killing of a smaller number of whales or (4) is insignificant when compared with the commercial uses to which whale meat is put. This particular legal opinion has in fact been made available during a year 2000 IWC meeting in Adelaide by a DFAT legal officer. I quote the verbatim transcript of the IWC meeting, where the Australian legal representative supplied by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says: ... Mr Chairman, I would now like to bring to the attention of the Commission some recent developments in international legal practice and precedent which for many international lawyers raise the possibility that Japan might not be acting properly within its legal rights when it issues scientific permits. That is the department of foreign affairs legal representative at an International Whaling Commission meeting in Adelaide in the year 2000. That is not the Australian Labor Party speaking. That is not the international antiwhaling movement speaking. That is DFAT’s own MAIN COMMITTEE legal officer sending a shot across the bow, so to speak, of Japan’s whaling interest. (Extension of time granted.) The department admitted that it had taken legal advice on whaling issues and refused to confirm or deny whether an action in the ICJ was being considered, saying no option had been ruled out, whether diplomatic or legal. In summary, looking at the whaling issue as a whole, what we have seen is a range of failures on the part of the government to properly protect whales. Firstly, we have seen what appears to be a very laggardly approach by the government in the prosecution of its diplomatic relationships in the South Pacific and elsewhere in the world in the lead-up to this meeting of the IWC in South Korea. Secondly, we have seen the whole question of the government’s intervention in the court case in the Federal Court brought by Humane Society International. Thirdly, we have seen a government so timorous in its approach to this question that it has refused so far to countenance taking this matter to the International Court of Justice, despite having flagged the possibility of such an action in a legal opinion that was presented to the IWC meeting in Adelaide in 2000. When it comes to the proper protection of whales our challenge to the Howard government is very simple. In plain spoken English, it is simply this: get real, cut to the chase, do something that will actually cause the end of this abuse of so-called scientific whaling by Japan around the world-not just in Australian Antarctic Territory waters, not just in our own part of the world, but worldwide. The best way to do that is through a focused legal action before the ICJ in order to bring this unacceptable slaughter of the world’s whale population to a close. be very brief. I would appreciate some advice on one issue from the parliamentary secretary. That issue is the ECP, which is regarded by both sides of the parliament as a key program in Australia’s involvement with and relationship to Papua New Guinea. As you would be aware just recently the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled key elements of the program-or the legislation in relation to the police component of the program-unconstitutional. It would be helpful to get advice from the parliamentary secretary about what steps are now being taken to get the key elements and the core goals of the program back on track. It would also be helpful to get some explanation from the parliamentary secretary about what contributed to the failures of the arrangements to date. I note, for example, that on 16 May the foreign minister when asked to comment on the supreme court’s ruling was quoted as saying, ‘We were not involved.’ That position has been directly contradicted by the foreign minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, who said: A statement by the Australian Foreign Minister ... that Australia was not involved ... was both unfortunate and incorrect ... The suggestion that somehow Australia was in the dark when it came to the final ECP legislation is totally ... incorrect. The police minister, Bire Kimisopa, made the following comment: These are things that both governments, the Australian government and the PNG government, knew very well. We are talking here about in excess of $1 billion of Australian taxpayers’ money over five years, and yet it would appear that the foreign minister in particular has treated issues related to the constitutionality of the program in a most cavalier manner.

233,Mr Sercombe (Maribyrnong) (7.01 Pm),"I am aware that time is very limited so I willpm)-I will go first to the member for Griffith’s comments. As I made clear in an earlier contribution, the government have not ruled out any legal or diplomatic avenues to bring pressure to bear on Japan. I thought we had made that point quite clear. In relation to the court action he was referring to, the Attorney-General’s submission did what you would hope all lawyers would do and that was point out frankly and clearly the practical difficulties associated with enforcing Australian law against foreign nationals in the EEZ off the Australian Antarctic Territory-a point that the Federal Court recognised. In relation to other avenues, as I have mentioned we have not ruled out any legal or diplomatic options, and I have characterised the spread of diplomatic overtures. But even on the doctrine of abuse of rights, where one may argue that scientific whaling permits are in breach of rights, you need a scientific basis to argue that case. As I mentioned earlier, that is why Australia, together with about half the other countries that send delegates to the IWC, is arguing for an independent review of Japan’s original scientific whaling program. One needs evidence in order to support any argument one may mount if it is to work going forward. The foreign minister has also written to the President of Nauru, Ludwig Scotty, and Foreign Affairs Minister, David Adeang. At this stage it is unclear whether the delegation would attend the IWC meeting, but it appears as though they will and that is another avenue for advocacy. I turn quickly to the member for Maribyrnong. He and I share a concern that the setback regarding the Wenge decision in Papua New Guinea has taken some momentum out of the program, out of the ECP. The foreign minister met with the PNG Foreign Minister and the Minister for Internal Security on 26 May, and I think there was a shared commitment to finding a way forward. Senior officials also met in Port Moresby on 9 and 10 June to examine possible solutions. The discussions have been constructive. A range of possible avenues are being canvassed, given the complexity of the court ruling. (Extension of time granted) Given the strong commitment on both sides to finding a way forward, a range of avenues are being canvassed. One is how to find a solution that will maintain the ECP in its current form and protect it from future legal challenges. There is some interest in whether a constitutional amendment is warranted, and that is a subject that is being discussed as not the preferred pathway. But the Wenge decision gives rise to diplomatic immunity available to all foreign nationals. Through you, Mr Chairman, to the member for Maribyrnong, I think that is resonating with some of the people in Port Moresby-that it is one thing to deal with the ECP; it is another thing, in light of that court decision, to provide for appropriate immunities for foreign government representation in that country. That is not a dead duck, if I can put it that way, but it is certainly not straightforward either. The other avenue being canvassed is whether some amendment to the PNG legislation is another pathway, but that may still leave some residual issues to be resolved. The last point related to the Australian government’s awareness of the PNG legislation. In June 2004, officials provided some suggested text to assist the PNG draft the legislation. PNG took responsibility for its own legislation but took on board those drafting suggestions. I am aware of some concerns that some PNG officials had about constitutional inconsistencies.

An honourable member interjectingwas first mentioned in the Australian under the title ‘Howard protects Qantas’ on 11 June this year, following the government deferring its decision to liberalise airline access on routes to the United States. I am talking about the Qantas-Singapore Airlines wrangling. I have a number of questions, which I will list, and hopefully the parliamentary secretary can make note and give the parliament some answers. Firstly, how will this review differ from the aviation industry outlook put to cabinet last month? Secondly, which department will conduct that review? What will be the terms of reference for that review? Will these include an assessment of potential industry consolidation-and I refer back to an article entitled ‘Vaile backs Qantas merger’, which appeared in the media just recently? Further, what is the time frame for the completion of the review? Will industry public submissions be called for and, if so, how and when? Will there be public hearings on this matter? Will the report of the review be made public? Will the report offer time lines against any recommendations? They are the first lot of questions I want to deal with. I am also interested in whether the Deputy Prime Minister had been consulted prior to this decision being taken-and, if so, when. I am not sure whether the parliamentary secretary can answer that-that is, regarding the decision of cabinet. Also, how does this decision reconcile with comments made by the Deputy Prime Minister on 11 April 2005 in a press release titled ‘2004: A record year for airlines’? In that media release, he said the following: Competition is alive and well in Australia’s skies with more Australians flying than ever before ... And: ... the industry has rebounded to be more robust and more productive than ever ... I know there is a series of questions there for the parliamentary secretary, but they are really just in two lots and are about the decisions being made by cabinet and the views of the government in terms of how they are going to deal with those and whether they will make those public.

My question to the minister, through the parliamentary secretary, is: when will the government announce that it will proceed with the full upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway, in light of this further and final report?

I have a quote from the Prime Minister where he said that, for the Ipswich Motorway corridor-which would be the Ipswich Motorway road and, if you wanted to include it, the northern option as well-$627 million was on the table and available right now. When will the money be forthcoming? When will it be spent? When will we get some resolution in terms of the Ipswich Motorway upgrade? liamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services relate to the administration of the Regional Partnerships program; I know the parliamentary secretary is involved in the administration of that program. Given the lavish advertising budgets of the Howard government, particularly in election years, it could be remarked on as a rather surprising fact that no advertising campaigns have been conducted to promote or encourage funding applications for the Regional Partnerships program. Since the increased budget allocations in 2005-06, this program is a half a billion dollar program. It has been about bolstering the government in target electorates. It has become rather better known, as a result of the opposition’s scrutiny of the government’s pork-barrelling, than it was before. When the program was launched, there were no as on TV, no as on radio and no as in the newspapers. The government did not write to Labor or other non-government MPs telling us about the program and how constituents of non-government electorates could make funding applications. So my question to the parliamentary secretary is: can he advise whether the department prepared a communications strategy for the Regional Partnerships program, including things like letters to MPs to explain the purpose of the program and to provide information for the Australian community? Indeed, was the department only tasked to prepare letters to government members of parliament, providing information about the program? Has it become standard practice under the Howard government to differentiate between government MPs and non-government MPs in providing advice on programs distributing taxpayers’ funds? It has also emerged from scrutiny of the government’s regional programs in the House and from the Senate inquiry into the Regional Partnerships program that there was a set of guidelines which applied to some but not all grants-the so-called Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocation or SONA guidelines. I have a number of questions concerning these guidelines. Is it correct that these guidelines were kept secret from the public? Is it correct that chairs of area consultative committees were not advised of their existence? Is it also correct that spending MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
240,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (7.13 Pm),"The questions I want to raise with the Paron projects under these secret guidelines blew out from an expected $3 million last financial year to $21 million? Is it correct that projects that fell outside the public Regional Partnerships guidelines could be approved under SONA guidelines but that prospective applicants were never made aware of this and so may have been deterred from lodging applications? The Deputy Prime Minister, under the heat of the opposition’s scrutiny, has refused reasonable information requests from the Senate inquiry. This does not bode particularly well for the transparency and accountability of this government post July 1. In particular, the government has refused to release all area consultative committee advice on Regional Partnerships applications across the board. Yet it selectively releases area consultative committee advice to back up some of its funding decisions that have been queried-for example, the Deputy Prime Minister tabled on 2 December last year the RM Williams centre funding application. How does the government justify this lack of transparency? Has the department been directed to withhold this information by the minister? I think the processes of the department require further scrutiny. We see that some applications lodged by area consultative committees under the Regional Partnerships program were not processed for up to nine months while 12 projects were approved within 24 hours of the applications being made. I also refer the parliamentary secretary to the department’s evidence to the Senate inquiry that in a number of applications, including the $4.95 million grant to the University of New England, the minister explicitly asked the department to bring the application forward as quickly as possible. On how many occasions did this happen and why did the minister ask for some projects to be brought forward and not others? Another point about the evidence to the Senate inquiry into Regional Partnerships is that the department advised that the decision making minister-in most cases parliamentary secretary Mrs Kelly-on 11 occasions approved grants that the department recommended be rejected, on three occasions approved full funding for projects the department proposed should receive a lesser amount and in three cases rejected a project the department recommended be approved. (Extension of time granted) Will details of those projects and the reason that the minister ignored the departmental recommendations in each of those cases be provided to the parliament? In my book they certainly should be. I would appreciate responses from the parliamentary secretary on these issues. swer the questions I will ask on behalf of my electorate of Lowe in relation to aircraft noise. I want to inform the parliamentary secretary, that I was elected to this place on this very issue. My predecessor was a member of the Howard government and in January 1998 resigned in disgust because the Prime Minister was not prepared to back his local member in relation to the excessive amounts of aircraft noise over the electorate of Lowe and indeed the inner west of Sydney. I have spoken on this issue more often than any other during my 6½ years in this House. It is a very important issue for my electorate. But I am very concerned that the Deputy Prime Minister is behaving very arrogantly in response to the innumerable questions that I have placed on the Notice Paper and the speeches that I have made in this House. I want to highlight for the parliamentary secretary some of the questions that I have raised since 2002, to give him some insight into this issue. Since 27 May 2002, there has been a mantra by the Deputy Prime Minister in answer to my questions, which are serious questions. The mantra has been: MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
241,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (7.19 Pm),"I regret that the minister is not here this evening to anI have dealt with these matters exhaustively in response to questions previously asked by the Honourable member. I will give you a taste. I asked the Deputy Prime Minister on 27 May 2002, for the umpteenth time: ... will he guarantee the people of Sydney that the long term lease of Sydney Airport will not be sold until the Long Term Operating Plan is fully implemented; if not, why not. And: Can and will the LTOP be implemented before Sydney Airport is sold; if not, why not. I have just told you what his response to that question was. I asked the Deputy Prime Minister another question two days later: Further to the reply to question No. 27... , how is the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) for Sydney Airport substantially implemented in terms of the LTOPs 17% forecast targets for air traffic movements to and from the north of Sydney Airport. And what was the answer I got? The Deputy Prime Minister answered: I have dealt with these matters exhaustively in response to questions previously asked by the Honourable member. On 25 June 2002 I asked: Is it a fact that the motions to implement the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) fully for Sydney Airport passed by the Sydney Airport Community Forum have not been met by Airservices Australia. And: Will he direct Airservices Australia to implement fully the LTOP for Sydney Airport forthwith; if not, why not. And what do you think he replied? I am very pleased to see that the member for Grayndler is in this chamber because he too has spoken more often on this issue than on any other topic in relation to his electorate. The arrogant response I got from the minister to my question was as follows: I have dealt with these matters exhaustively in response to questions previously asked by the Honourable member. A day later I asked another question of the minister, inter alia: Is it also a fact that the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) cannot be sustained for an indefinite period because (a) the only air traffic modes that enable Sydney Airport to reach 80 movements per hour are those modes that revert to parallel runway operations and (b) in reaching 80 aircraft movements per hour, only parallel runway use can be expected when the airport approaches that ultimate capacity. And: If he allows Sydney Airport to reach the ultimate capacity of 80 movements per hour over 17 hours, will Sydney residents, especially those to the north of the airport, be exposed to the noise impacts of parallel runway operations at Sydney Airport every day, that is, approximately 700 landings per day and 700 take offs per day. What do you think the answer was? It was: I have dealt with these matters exhaustively in response to questions previously asked by the Honourable member. On 26 June 2002 I also asked: MAIN COMMITTEE In light of the SACF Chairpersons media comments, can the LTOP targets for total aircraft movements to the north, east and west of Sydney Airport ever be achieved in light of prevailing meteorological and other environmental factors; if so, when and how will those targets be achieved. And: Are the LTOP targets reasonable in light of the scientific data relied upon at the time the LTOP was made; if so, why is it that the LTOP targets have never been achieved in the history of its implementation. And: Why does the LTOP continue to be asserted as the answer to Sydney Airports aircraft noise problems, when the people residing to the north of the airport, especially those residents living in the electoral division of Lowe, continue to have their noise sharing and respite hopes dashed by perpetually unmet LTOP targets. (Extension of time granted) The minister replied: I have dealt with these matters exhaustively ... I know the member for Grayndler is anxious to contribute, and I will allow him to, because I am sure he wants to speak on this very issue. I will truncate my contribution by drawing attention to my question on 26 June 2002, where I got a similar response from the minister, and to my questions on 27 June 2002, 28 August 2002, 14 October 2002, 5 June 2003, 11 August 2003, 19 August 2003, 2 December 2003, 24 March 2004 and 17 November 2004. It goes on and on and on, and all we get is a dishonest response from the minister. By way of finality, I turn to a second issue: why have the government decided that over the next 20 years there is no requirement for a second airport for the people of Sydney and of New South Wales? That is outrageous. Quite plainly the government have said they are more interested in looking after Macquarie Bank and the Southern Cross consortium, who bought the airport in the interests of their shareholders, and in making sure that Sydney airport operates as a shopping centre and a car park and not an airport. that it would review Sydney’s airport needs in 2005. The time has come. However, thanks to the member for Batman’s question on notice, it has been revealed that the government has breached its commitment to review Sydney’s airport needs in 2005. Indeed, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services continues to cling to his flawed master plan as an explanation for the government’s inaction on Sydney airport. The minister for transport approved the Sydney airport master plan on 22 March 2004. The plan claims that Kingsford Smith is able to cope with increased traffic over the next 20 years, yet the plan projects a 180 per cent increase in the number of aircraft movements at Sydney airport-from 225,200 movements per year in 2001-02 to 412,000 movements per year by 2023-24. Further, the next 20 years will see a tripling of passengers, from 23 million to 68 million. The plan denies that this dramatic increase in traffic will result in an eventual removal of the curfew and movement cap. The reality is that already movements are seriously encroaching on these curfew periods. A recent Airservices Australia report indicated that the number of aircraft movements increased by nine per cent between January 2002 and January 2005. Residents in and around my electorate are suffering the bulk of this increase, along with those in the member for Lowe’s electorate. As the number of movements increase at the airport, the concentration is increased to the north. This is the most densely populated area of Sydney.

242,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (7.25 Pm),"In the year 2000, the Howard government saidThe residents of Sydenham, St Peters and Marrickville are being subjected to between 13 and 18 more flights per day that exceed the 70 decibel level-that is, the level at which conversations are interrupted and watching television or listening to the radio becomes impossible. Such a significant increase over the past three years alone highlights the undeniable falsehoods of the master plan. Claims that Sydney airport can cope alone are dishonest and misleading. I draw the House’s attention once again to the issue of Fort Street High School. The fact that kids have their education disrupted up to every three minutes by low-flying aircraft is an outrage. It should be addressed, and that school should be insulated. You do not have different hearing according to your wealth. The fact is that some schools have been insulated around the site. Taverners Hill Infants School, 200 metres down the road, has been insulated but Fort Street missed out. The government should fix it. It is playing politics with people’s futures, and young people deserve better. There must be a mandatory enforcement of the curfew and the movement cap. International flights at KSA continue to be scheduled to land outside of the 6 am and 11 pm curfew period. These are scheduled flights. This morning a British Airways flight, BA15 from London, landed at 5.05 am. In all, 10 international flights landed this morning before 6 am. Seven flights are scheduled to breach the curfew tomorrow morning between 5 am and 6 am. Freight flights also continue to be granted dispensations to land outside of the curfew period. The use and abuse of the so-called shoulder period continues to inflict aircraft noise on communities that already suffer considerably during the non-curfew periods. Just last month I informed the House about a low-flying jet which created a vortex that lifted 100 tiles from the roof of a residence in my electorate-this is the kind of impact aircraft are having on residents in my electorate. This is a practical reality of living in Sydenham in 2005. Instead of reviewing and addressing these issues, as previously committed, the government has instead approved an outrageous expansion of Sydney airport’s commercial facilities with no regard for the fact that $1.8 billion of extra infrastructure will be required. Twelve-storey car parks and tower blocks of shops, hotels and offices are instead the minister’s plans for the airport. The minister is ignoring the ever-increasing crisis of aircraft noise in Sydney’s inner west and is instead creating one of increased traffic and congestion on the ground. The minister has not paid a single visit to a school, a nursing home, a church or a community organisation around the airport. He has shown contempt since he became the minister-unlike, I might say, Mark Vaile and John Sharp, his predecessors, who both came to the electorate and had a look first-hand. This is a minister who has shown contempt. Whatever Max Moore-Wilton wants simply goes at Sydney airport. It is unacceptable. (Time expired) Ms Hall-There are more questions.

For the information of the parliamentary secretary, I misled you earlier: this debate can go on for as long as is needed. firmation of the government’s intention with regard to the Ipswich Motorway northern option. I now have a comparison, and I want to put on the record that comparison between the two options. The full upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway would provide a full upgrade along the entire 19 kilometres of the motorway. It would cost $1.1 billion, which includes $160 million for the Logan interchange upgrade. This equates to around $57 million per kilometre. In terms MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006

244,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (7.31 Pm),"I want to add to a question I asked earlier and seek conof timing, the planning has been finalised, and, if construction were started today, the full upgrade could be completed by the end of 2009. In terms of construction, it can be done in stages to minimise traffic disruption. The Goodna-Gailes section could be completed by 2008 and only five per cent of construction would be done under traffic, with some sections of the motorway realigned completely. With regard to the long-term benefits of upgrading the Ipswich Motorway, it is designed to cater for traffic flow for more than 20 years and would deliver six lanes for through traffic along an entire route, as well as a series of local and service roads to cater for local traffic. That means a network of between 10 and 17 lanes. Compare that, Parliamentary Secretary, with the half-bypass option. It is only eight kilometres of road. It would cost about the same sort of money-$1.1 billion-but would exclude the $160 million for the Logan interchange upgrade. That equates to around $142 million per kilometre. In terms of timing, a minimum of another three years of planning would be required before design and construction could begin, in mid-2009, and the project would not be completed before 2012. Given that the Ipswich Motorway is part of the national highway network, funding for any maintenance and construction activity rests with the federal government. When will the minister announce that the project will go ahead, and provide the money that everyone from the PM down during the last federal election campaign promised was on the table? Do we now, after all, find that that was not the truth-that there is no money allocated for this project? Can the minister either confirm or deny that? When will the minister stop misleading the people of south-east Queensland and actually get on with the job of fixing the road? Perhaps the parliamentary secretary would attempt to answer a couple of questions. Firstly, in relation to the Namoi structural adjustment fund criteria, could the parliamentary secretary outline the processes involved in obtaining funding from the Namoi structural adjustment fund, with particular reference to the two zeolite mines which are within that catchment area within the Gwydir electorate. Could he explain why one zeolite mine has been funded to the competitive disadvantage of another zeolite mine; and how that fits with the processes of application for funding that have come out of the Namoi structural adjustment package? The other question I will ask the parliamentary secretary relates to a story in the Northern Daily Leader of 21 September 2004. I understand that the parliamentary secretary will probably be unable to answer this, but I think the minister in question really should answer it. In a story on 21 September 2004 in the Northern Daily Leader the Mayor of Tamworth, Councillor James Treloar, was quoted as saying: The $6 millionwhich was for the equine centre, which the parliamentary secretary is well aware ofis coming from the Federal Government’s Regional Partnerships Program and even if the Labor Party won next month’s Federal election, the money would still be there. The story went on to say: ... the announcement about the funding had been made possible before the October9 election because the application, plans and financial details had been submitted by the Australian Equine and Livestock Centre about a month ago … So that was just prior to the calling of the election. According to the Mayor of Tamworth: MAIN COMMITTEE",195,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
245,Mr Windsor (New England) (7.33 Pm),"I am disappointed that the minister is not here.This meant that the government could allocate the $6 million and not be tainted by accusations of pork barrelling. If, as the story in the Northern Daily Leader tells us, everything had been received by the department and the minister, so that it was possible to make an ironclad announcement during the election campaign, why did the Tamworth Regional Council have to submit further information for analysis earlier this year? If it was not the case that everything had been received, why didn’t the Deputy Prime Minister or the department correct the inaccuracy in the Northern Daily Leader story? In addition, why has the Deputy Prime Minister asserted that funding for the equine centre, particularly given this preamble, was held up by the Senate inquiry into the Regional Partnerships Program? time, I would like to make a very short contribution to this debate and take the opportunity to put some very specific questions to the parliamentary secretary. I would invite him to answer them tonight if he can, but if he cannot do so I would certainly request that he take them on notice and get back to me at a later date. My questions involve three road projects in my electorate. The first is the proposed link between the F3 freeway and the New England Highway north of Branxton, sometimes colloquially known as the Kurri corridor; the second is the Weekley’s Drive intersection; and the third is the Muswellbrook bypass. All of those three projects were part of what was known, I suppose, as the national highway project, and all are projects that have been on the drawing board for some time. Indeed, all three projects had financial commitments from the Commonwealth prior to the 1996 election. I have to say I find the budget documents increasingly difficult to read. I say that with no embarrassment whatsoever, because I think making them increasingly difficult to read is a deliberate ploy on the part of the government. I know with respect to the Kurri corridor that there was a $250 million commitment in the AusLink program, but my understanding is that there is no commitment to the Kurri corridor-or the F3 link-in the forward estimates, and I specifically ask the minister to clarify whether that is the case. If there is no commitment in the forward estimates, where does the $250-odd million now stand; is it entirely dependent on an agreement yet to be reached with the New South Wales government; and when does the parliamentary secretary expect any such agreement to be met? The second project I wish to find out about is the Weekley’s Drive intersection. It is a project whose cost ranges between some $25 million and $35 million, depending on what treatment is embraced eventually by the Commonwealth, in consultation with the state. Again, this is a project which is now 10 years overdue. The Commonwealth seems to be blaming the state for holding up design on the project. The state advises me that that is not true and that in fact the Commonwealth has been seeking to embrace a cheaper design, which the RTA in New South Wales says is not up to speed for the proper treatment of that intersection in safety terms. SoI invite the parliamentary secretary to make some comment on that. The third project is the Muswellbrook bypass, a much needed bypass for that particular town. Again, that is a project that has been on the drawing board and has been much discussed since prior to the 1996 election. It seems to now be in limbo. I welcome any response that the parliamentary secretary can give me on that particular project. MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006

Most of them. I will refer on but some I will answer myself. The member for Grayndler raised some issues about airlines and the public time frame for the review et cetera. I will refer those to the minister, and we will get back to him on those questions, including the aircraft noise issues which he brought up. With regard to the member for Oxley, the only thing I will mention specifically is the Ipswich Motorway. I think he mentioned a figure of $650 million and indicated that it was all available straight away. That is actually not so. Under the AusLink package, $627 million was available over the first five-year investment for improvements to that road’s infrastructure and the urban Brisbane corridor. A significant amount out of those funds has already been committed to upgrading works along the Ipswich Motorway. That includes the preconstruction and design of a new $160 million interchange at the junction of the Ipswich and Logan motorways, which is also the highest priority work in Queensland’s six-lane proposal, and the implementation of a range of safety works and further planning along the Ipswich Motorway, valued at around $66 million. Mr Hardgrave interjectingback to him on those, including those about aircraft noise. The member for Wills wanted to talk about Regional Partnerships and he raised the question of due process. There is only one process for Regional Partnerships. He also asked if we advertise. The area consultative committees around Australia, all 50 of them, have budgets. They make provision in their budgets to publicise what they do and how they do it. They get the information out to community organisations, to local government councils, to small business and to anyone who might have an opportunity to make use of Regional Partnerships. It is their job, not the government’s, to make known around Australia what is available in that sense and how it is done. At various times we put out certain press releases on the program, but we do not advertise as a government about Regional Partnerships. As a matter of fact, the opposition has probably done a better job of advertising how much good Regional Partnerships does; we have not needed to do it. I can assure the honourable member that all the area consultative committees right around Australia get a budget commensurate with the size of their region and commensurate with the number of employees they need. It is their job to publicise the benefits of the program to people, to organisations, to local government, to state government and to individual businesses. The government do not do that; they do. The member for Wills also mentioned the SONA program. It is not a secret program. There are no secret instructions given to ACCs, the department or anyone else. In that context, he brought up the national centre for maths, science and information technology at the University of New England and the status of that project. It established a national centre for mathematics, science and information technology for rural and regional education. The project he referred to involves a hub at UNE and training applications around Australia. Nobody can apply for a Regional Partnerships grant under the SONA procedures. It is a strategic element of Regional Partnerships. It is used to fund projects of high national significance that may fall outside the administrative constraints of Regional Partnerships.

You cannot, because one is far more disadvantaged than the other and they all have different issues.

Regional Partnerships will provide the mechanism to deliver this election commitment. Obviously it is far more efficient than creating a new program. It is one of the six icon projects around Australia, totalling $27½ million, two of which are actually in non-government electorates. I am not quite sure where the member for Wills is going with this one, but all I can tell him is that this is a $4 million icon project that is centred on a great Australian. The member for Wills may wish to put down RM Williams, but the centre aims to have wide appeal and to link well with other tourist venues in the Wide Bay region. It should also attract related agriforestry industry to the region. All these projects centre around creating employment and helping a region. Whether they are an icon project, a normal Regional Partnerships program project or a SONA project, they are designed to help regional centres in outer metropolitan areas or wherever they might be. Some projects have been almost in a centre: I have been involved in launching projects which were almost in Brisbane, and the same goes for Sydney. They are not discriminatory programs; they are designed to help people. If there are those who do not want those people helped then that is their business. The member for Lowe brought up aircraft noise. I will refer those issues to the minister, and we will get back to him. The member for Grayndler mentioned Sydney airport, and we will get back to him on those issues. The member for New England mentioned the Namoi groundwater structural adjustment program.

The Tamworth equine centre, which was announced a couple of weeks ago by the Deputy Prime Minister, is a $6 million project, one of the six icon projects announced prior to the last election. The member for New England brought up issues about the differences between now and then-that is, the differences between when the project was originally brought up some years ago and now. (Time expired) the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services relates to the University of New England maths and science centre that he mentioned a moment ago. Given the role of the area consultative committees in some of the funding arrangements that the government has put in place, the parliamentary secretary may like to report back to the parliament to explain why the New England North West Area Consultative Committee’s web site in November of 2004 highlighted as its No. 1 project achievement the University of New England maths and science centre whereas, if one looks at that web site today, there is no mention of the University of New England maths and science centre. Could the parliamentary secretary clarify the role, if any, that the area consultative committee had in relation to the funding program and explain why it has airbrushed its web site? During the latter months of 2004, prior to the formation of the Regional Partnerships inquiry, the centre was a project achievement that the area consultative committee was very keen to claim, whereas nowadays-as I understand it from the situation there a couple of weeks ago-the No. 1 achievement on its web site has something to do with the CWA hall in Gunnedah. gional Services) (7.53 pm)-I might go back to where I was when I was interrupted. The member for New England brought up what he felt were questions to be answered about the equine centre. Basically, this government had two different proposals, both were about an equine centre and both were to be sited at Tamworth. The original proposal put up in 2001 wanted $3½ million towards a proposed $21 million to $24 million project. That was provided to Professor John Chudleigh for an independent review-as to whether it was a goer, in effect. Advice to government was that it was not. Further work was done on this proposal, taking into account Professor Chudleigh’s findings, and a second proposal was provided to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Minister Anderson, in 2004. The second proposal had very serious key changes that did address all the concerns raised by Professor Chudleigh. There was a review of the scale of the original proposal and a minor relocation to take into account an existing exhibition facility, saving an estimated $10 million. The original proposal in 2001 and the one announced by the minister were like chalk and cheese. The first was pie in the sky; the second was a serious proposal with management costs and the whole lot done. So, despite what the member for New England may wish to find on this one, he will not find anything.

Therefore, one was knocked back and the other one was approved. On the issue of the national centre for maths, science and information at the University of New England, despite what the opposition, the member for New England or anyone else want to believe about the project being approved overnight or in three days-or 24 hours, as I think the member for Wills tried to say-this project was funded for just under $5 million, GST inclusive, under Regional Partnerships in June 2004. It is subject to stringent conditions to ensure its long-term viability. The project is currently on target to meet the contracted milestones, with a full progress report and drafts of the business plans received in January this year. The state based hubs have been contracted, and it is great to note that a hub will be established this year in each state and territory. Minister Anderson’s colleague, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, has also approved additional funding for the centre to undertake research in relation to attracting and retaining teachers in rural and regional schools. I apologise to those members whose questions I am unable to answer. I will endeavour to get them information on those as soon as possible. back to the minister the message that the whole theme of my contribution here this evening was to highlight the fact that in relation to aircraft noise in SydneyI have received from him-the minister-a gormless, irresponsible and asinine response, to the effect that he has exhaustively answered these questions. The people who are drafting these replies for the minister should be flogged. I ask you to go back to the minister and his staff and then tell me, so that I can report to the people of Lowe, what the Deputy Prime Minister is going to do to fully implement the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport, to ensure that people living to the north of Sydney airport only receive what they were promised-17 per cent of air-traffic movements. for his incapacity to answer my questions. By the sound of the member for Lowe and others, he has not answered their questions either. I ask that the appropriate minister, who should have a greater grasp of these issues than the parliamentary secretary, be asked to present the answers to the questions-not the diatribe that we just had to put up with. that the parliamentary secretary, probably not deliberately, failed to either answer my questions or indicate that he would refer them for a later response.

There were some minor offsets to deal with the Office for the Status of Women being transferred to Family and Community Services; the finalisation of task forces from 2004-05; and some other minor increases. But essentially the increase that you see before you in the consideration of this bill in detail has come from the government’s commitment to what we will be working very hard to achieve-that is, a very successful APEC in 2007. me if it is not-to congratulate the Prime Minister and the state premiers on a recent initiative. At a recent Council of Australian Governments meeting, significant priority was given for the first time to the issue of young people with disabilities who are currently ‘inappropriately’ housed. I would like to place on record my congratulations to all of those involved-to the Prime Minister, who led the delegation, and to the states-for recognising those who need a little more help than they have perhaps been getting in the past. I do not mean that that is the fault of anybody, but I think there is growing recognition that people with disabilities are going to grow older than they used to, in the majority of cases, and that in many cases they are inappropriately housed and require other services so that they can be more appropriately cared for. I would urge the minister in the chair to convey my thanks to the Prime Minister but also to encourage the Prime Minister and those in the appropriate portfolios to really take this issue forward and address it. It is not one that will be terribly expensive to address in terms of the budgetary processes in total, but in my view, and I think in the view of many, it is an issue that really passes judgment on us as a parliament and on Australians as a society, as to how we care for people who have disabilities. ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (8.03 pm)-I assure the member for New England and indeed this chamber that I certainly will make known to the Prime Minister his comments and his encouragement. There is no doubt that the edge of disagreement between the states and the Commonwealth on matters to do with disability causes an enormous amount of hurt and frustration to individual people. We find it awfully frustrating to see the states always retreating from the ground that we try to move onto, leaving further ground for us to have to accommodate certain aspects. Along the way, it is often the case that individual people are the ones who miss out. I have plenty in my electorate, and I have had to say to previous state disabilities ministers, ‘These people are your constituents as well as mine.’ I remember that then Minister Spence had no idea about the sort of suffering and indignity that certain families were facing because of the Commonwealth-state squabble over these matters. I thank the member for New England for his very timely reminder on this matter. Proposed expenditure agreed to.

270,Mr Mcmullan (Fraser) (8.04 Pm),"I seek some information from the parliamentaryother such fora. This proposal is related to the need to mobilise funds to meet the millennium development goals, which Australia signed on to when they were dealt with at the Millennium Summit in 2000 and about which there has subsequently been a lot of international debate. The general acceptance is that there is a need to mobilise substantially more resources from the international community to meet these goals which, broadly put, are about fighting global poverty. Some part of the responsibility for this lies in the foreign affairs department and relates to ODA matters, but I am not going there. I want to go to those matters that relate to the Treasurer’s responsibility and to the Treasury portfolio. It is very difficult to find what, if anything, Australia has said about this important debate, although we have been at a large number of meetings where communiques have been issued. I assume that means we have agreed, but we have not heard anything about it back home. It is hard to find in the budget, or in any other set of statements made by the Australian government, where any resources might be to meet in future years the implications of any support Australia might give to this proposition-and I think we should support it. As I understand it, the proposal for an international finance facility has been considered at, amongst other meetings, the G20, the Commonwealth Finance Ministers Meeting-or perhaps it was the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, but I think it was Commonwealth Finance Ministers Meeting-the IMF and the World Bank, at all of which the Australian government is represented by the Treasurer. Also, there has been some consideration of it, as I understand it, at the OECD. In any event, I will come back to some OECD comments about this. I understand that in September 2003 there was an IMF communique from the Dubai annual meeting calling for examination of the merits of the international finance facility. I want to know what Australia said in its ministerial contribution on that occasion. I want to know what view Australia took and what advocacy it made. I am advised that there was a Commonwealth ministerial statement made in March 2004 reiterating support for the proposed new international finance facility designed to double ODA to $100 billion. I want to know what Australia said at that meeting, what attitude it has taken and how that has been reflected in any subsequent policies of the Australian government. There were subsequent meetings in April and September 2004 for further consideration of this matter. I assume, although I have seen no written report of it, that that was also the case in the April 2005 considerations of the IMF and the World Bank. There is a general proposal about the international finance facility and a proposal for a trial based on an international finance facility for immunisation, bringing forward commitments to meet global objectives with regard to the global initiative for immunisation. SoI am seeking some information from the Treasurer, through the parliamentary secretary, about what Australia has said with regard to these proposals-whether, as is usually the case, the fact that a communique has gone out from these various meetings indicates that Australia agrees with it. If Australia does agree, I would like information about how we are going to meet our obligations. The OECD review of the Australian aid budget makes it clear that Australia is one of the few countries-one of only two, if I am correctly advised, although the OECD report says, ‘One of the few’-at the Monterey summit about international finance for development that did not make any commitment to increased ODA. If we have not made any MAIN COMMITTEE commitment of that sort, how will we fund the obligations that an international finance facility will impose upon Australia in future years? (Extension of time granted) In conclusion, if we did not make any commitment-and I am advised we did not-at Monterey before the international community and we supported the international finance facility, what arrangements do we have in mind to generate the finances to meet the obligation that that will impose upon us? If it turns out that we did not make a commitment to the international finance facility, firstly, I will be very surprised, secondly, I will be very disappointed and, thirdly, I would like to get some indication of why we do not support it and what attitude we have expressed about it at these various international meetings at which we have been represented, often by the Treasurer himself, where resolutions have been made indicating ongoing support for a proposition such as this or similar propositions. honourable member for Fraser for his series of questions. I would be happy to get the answers for him and forward them to him. say about the so-called infrastructure crisis in this country and in more recent weeks there has been an indication from the government that the Commonwealth might move towards a greater responsibility for the nation’s infrastructure, in particular as it relates to our export performance. On a number of occasions, the Treasurer has referred to the difficulties being experienced at Dalrymple Bay, the coal loading port in Queensland. In particular, he has suggested that the Commonwealth might take control of the regulation of that facility. In broader terms, he has suggested that the Commonwealth might take control of export facilities generally. I would assume that that would involve some review of clause 6 of the original Competition Principles Agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. To take that further, I would assume that the government is contemplating revisiting the Competition Principles Agreement and suggesting that clause 6 may no longer provide an opportunity for the state governments to have their particular state based regimes certified under part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act; rather, the Commonwealth might seek to insist that all these industry based schemes come under the Commonwealth umbrella. This would have ramifications for Commonwealth allocation of funds, I would assume, because I would expect that the Commonwealth, if it were contemplating a renegotiation of clause 6, in particular, of the Competition Principles Agreement, would be thinking about compensating the states, as it did under the original agreement. So, if the Commonwealth has such a move in mind, I wonder whether there might be some allocation hidden away in the budget somewhere for those purposes. I invite the parliamentary secretary to respond, if he can. the member’s question on notice and get back to him. Proposed expenditure agreed to.

273,Mr Pearce (Aston,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (8.13 pm)-I will takeThe issue I want to raise relates to the human services portfolio-more particularly, to the Belmont Medicare office. I have made numerous representations in this parliament and to ministers over a long period of time about the need for the Belmont Medicare office to be reopened. In the lead-up to the last election, we on this side of the parliament promised to reopen the Medicare office, and that was based on a very sound principle. The office was closed in 1996, which was a very unfortunate action by the government. It was closed and offices that had a much lighter workload were left open. That office had a very high utilisation rate but it was closed and a Medibank Private office was opened at Charlestown, an adjoining suburb. I think that the decision was made because the minister of the time did not really understand the area. It is a very old area. Shortland electorate is the 10th oldest electorate in Australia. Belmont, whilst only some 10 kilometres from Charlestown, was a central point for this elderly population. People who lived in the Swansea part of Shortland electorate, even when they were on restricted licences, could drive to Belmont. The public transport to Belmont was a lot easier. Accessing the Medicare office was a lot easier than having to travel to Charlestown or, alternatively, hopping in their car and driving to Lake Haven on the Central Coast. It had a very wide drawing area. The previous member for Shortland has also been involved in the campaign to have the office reopened and between the two of us we have submitted to the parliament over 20,000 signatures from people asking to have this office reopened. There is a demonstrated need for the Belmont Medicare office. One factor in this is the age of the population and another is the fact that very few doctors in the area bulk-bill. Elderly people go and see their doctors and then have to somehow travel quite a distance to claim their Medicare benefits. It is not a wealthy area, and the people need to get their money back, sometimes even to buy their medications. I implore the government to revisit the issue of Belmont Medicare office, because it has been identified by the staff that worked in the office and by the people of the area as one of the single most important issues in the area. WhilstI am on the subject of Medicare offices, there has also been an identified need for a Medicare office at Toukley. I believe some time ago-and it was not an act of this government-there was a Medicare office at Toukley that was moved to the shopping centre at Lake Haven. Since then the population has aged considerably, and there is a real problem with transport. The area is only serviced by a private bus company. It is something like six or eight kilometres to this Medicare office, but if you catch a bus it takes you an hour and a half to two hours to get there. Once again, there is a low level of doctors that bulk-bill-possibly the level is even lower in that area. I have also submitted petitions to the parliament on that issue, with some thousands of signatures on them. I ask that the government seriously look at both those offices, particularly Belmont, because of the enormous community support and the enormous community demand for that office to be made operational again. If you go back and look at the records from before its closure, you will find that it was better than, I believe, Erina and a couple of other offices in that area. Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (8.19 pm)-I will respond to the member for Shortland’s concern now before I sum up after the next speaker. In the first instance let me say that the minister for the portfolio area, the Minister for Finance and Administration, is, of course, a senator, so he does not appear in MAIN COMMITTEE Main Committee. In relation to the issue you raised of the issue of a new office in Belmont for MedicareMs Hall-The reopening. HIC does assess demand for all these types of offices on an ongoing basis. They are opened if there is sufficient counter trade and if it is obviously a considerable distance to another office. So the demographics of the area and its geographic locality are under consideration. At the moment, Belmont does not meet the criteria for opening a new Medicare office but I can assure the member for Shortland that, if the demographics change or some other significant circumstances change, this will be noted. I am sure you will bring to the attention of the minister any of those changes so they can be taken into the assessment process. Likewise, I am assured by the officials who are here tonight that, at the moment, customer traffic would not support an office at Toukley. Offices are generally not located less than 12 kilometres from another, but I again invite the member for Shortland to keep the minister closely informed of her particular concerns. The aim of this government is to make sure the population is properly serviced, and that is why our business cases are developed in the way they are: to make sure the population is properly served. Ms HALL (Shortland) (8.20 pm)-I note the comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration. I was referring to the Minister for Human Services, who I believe is a member of the House of Representatives. I am quite aware that the overarching minister is a senator and of course I would not expect him to be present in the Main Committee tonight. I accept the comments that the parliamentary secretary has made about Toukley, the distance and the possibility that there would be a great deal of difficulty in sustaining that office, but I cannot accept her comments about the Belmont office and I question the advice that she has received. If you made a comparison of the trade in other offices in the area with the trade that was conducted across the counter at Belmont, you would find that not only did it compare favourably but its performance was at a higher level than offices that were left open. I also inform the parliamentary secretary of a staff survey conducted at the Charlestown Medicare office one, two or three years ago-I cannot quite remember when. I was reliably advised that staff identified the single most important issue for that office was the reopening of the Belmont Medicare office. So it was a need identified not only by the community but also by the staff. Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (8.22 pm)-I would like to raise with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration my interest in the proposals by the Department of Finance and Administration to computerise the submission of pay claims by electorate staff. I commend that. I preface my question by saying that I have been particularly frustrated with the process of reimbursing relief staff in particular. As many of us would know, the operations of our offices are very important in the servicing of our local communities. When relief staff are called in because someone is sick, for instance, they incur costs in child care, travel and so forth. Unfortunately it is not uncommon for it to take four to six weeks for them to get paid for providing that work. That is entirely unacceptable. It has been explained to me that that is the result of the process by which new contracts have to be submitted-they are several pages long, and the member has to sign them to verify them. MAIN COMMITTEE",204,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
274,Dr Stone,"The reopening of the Belmont Medicare office, let me assure you that theOn my reckoning, posting from Wollongong to getting to the actual processing at DOFA is regularly one week, which is problematic in itself. If the department is looking to move to an electronic lodgement, there are ways of doing it securely these days. In the interests of the very good people that we all utilise in our communities to do relief work for us, it is incumbent on us to pay them the money they earn from that work as soon as possible. I would like to know whether there is a commitment to finance the move to an electronic system. I would also like an assurance that it will extend beyond permanent and permanent part-time staff and will cover people who come in on short-term relief. Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (8.25 pm)-I begin by thanking the member for Cunningham for her question on electronic payroll systems and, in particular, on relief electorate staff. I share with her a concern that electorate staff are paid quickly. With her, I think it is an excellent idea that the Department of Finance and Administration is now exploring a computerised or electronic system. I am not personally aware of all of the details of when and how it is to be rolled out, but I can give her the details if she wishes to have them. I turn now to the consideration in detail of the Department of Finance and Administration’s component of the budget. In 2005-06, the Department of Finance and Administration will be appropriated $423.5 million from Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 and $249.4 million from Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2005-2006. I would like to talk about some of the new measures that were announced in the budget. One new measure of enormous significance is the Future Fund Management Agency. Inprinciple agreement has been provided to establish such an agency for the purpose of accumulating financial assets to offset the Australian government’s unfunded superannuation liability. The fund will be managed by an independent board, which will make investments in accordance with a broad investment mandate issued by the government. The government will provide $31.2 million to Finance over four years-$7.3 million in 2005-06-to establish and administer what I will call the Future Fund Management Agency, the FFMA. This agency will provide executive support and advice to the Future Fund Management Board. The cost of contracting out investment activities to fund managers and the remuneration of board members will be met from the Future Fund. The government will provide $16,137,000,000 to the FFMA for investment in 2005-06. Investment earnings are anticipated to be in the order of $538.6 million. There is also the enhanced budget information system. We believe a capital saving of $4 million in 2004-05 and reduced depreciation savings of $0.8 million per year from 2005-06 will be achieved as a result of successful negotiations with the preferred supplier for the provision of system development, implementation and support services for the enhanced budget information system. Depreciation savings do not have an impact on fiscal balance. We are also helping to provide for Australia’s security through funding the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation’s central office building. Without appropriate infrastructure, we cannot expect our agencies like ASIO to be world best. The government will provide $63.2 million over four years-$3.6 million in 2005-06-to Finance for project management and construction of an extension to the ASIO central office building to accommodate the expanded and co-located ASIO and Office of National Assessments. MAIN COMMITTEE The government will also provide $25.1 million to Finance over three years-$4 million in 2005-06-to refurbish the historic Royal Australian Mint buildings. The buildings have not had a major upgrade work done since their construction. The refurbishment will address occupational health and safety requirements, improve the building’s energy efficiency and enable the Mint to meet its functional requirements more effectively. Additional rent revenue of $0.9 million will have a positive impact on the budget in 2008-09. A centralised claims record management unit will be established within the Employment and Workplace Relations portfolio from 1 July 2005 to manage all asbestos related disease claims against the Commonwealth, with the exception of those claims against the Department of Defence or those made by former Australian Defence Force members and their dependants under the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Scheme and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. Consequently, from 1 July 2005, the Australian government’s estimated potential liability for ARD-which stands for asbestos related disease-claims will be recorded in the DEWR administered accounts. Accordingly, Finance will return a total of $3.9 million to the budget in 2004-05 and transfer liabilities currently valued at $158.3 million to the EWR portfolio on 1 July 2005. Finance’s budget and forward estimates have been reduced by a total of $1.6 million to reflect the associated decrease in expense. (Extension of time granted) In 2005-06 the government will provide an additional $1 million in funding to enable the continuation of the program of asset sales activities and in 2005-06 the government will provide additional funding of $2.2 million to conduct a scoping study into the sale of the Australian Submarine Corporation Pty Ltd. The scoping study will assess the likely sale environment and seek to ascertain the optimal timing and method of sale. The Australian Government Information Management Office is now incorporated into the Department of Finance and Administration. Ongoing efficiency savings of $1.2 million per year from 2005-06 will be achieved as a result of the incorporation of the Australian Government Information Management Office into Finance. In relation to the efficiency dividend, the increase in the rate from one per cent to 1.25 per cent, a 0.25 per cent additional efficiency dividend, has been applied to agency estimates from 2005-06 to 2007-08. The 2005-06 administered expenses have increased by $9.8 million from the 2004-05 additional expenditures to $218.1 million, mainly due to additional funding for the administering of the electorate offices of all parliamentarians’, and ministers’ offices. The funding for this increase was provided for in prior year measures. In relation to a new part of the Finance and Administration portfolio, the Department of Human Services, this comprises the core department of the Child Support Agency, the CSA, and the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, CRS Australia. In addition, Centrelink, the Health Insurance Commission, Health Services Australia and Australian Hearing report to the Minister for Human Services through the secretary. The Department of Human Services was established in October 2004 by the Australian government to improve the development and delivery of government services to all Australian people. The core department and the CSA receive appropriation funding while CRS is fully funded via purchase-provider arrangements with government and non-government entities. The department will receive $466.004 million in revenue in 2005-06. MAIN COMMITTEE This comprises appropriation funding of $298.277 million, the core department being appropriated $11.883 million and the CSA $286.394 million. CRS will receive revenue from the sale of goods and services of $167.727 million. The department’s administering funding is comprised of annual appropriations, special appropriations and revenues from other sources. We are very pleased about the development of the new Department of Human Services being able to better service the needs of all Australians. The appropriations that have been made to this department reflect its significance and importance for the Australian people. Proposed expenditure agreed to.

Main Committee adjourned at 8.37 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Australian Electoral Commission (Question No. 224) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, in writing, on 30 November 2004: (1) Has the Minister seen the statistics provided by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) following the federal election of 9 October 2004 that reveal a marked increase in the informal vote, particularly in thirteen electoral divisions located in Sydney. (2) Is the Minister aware that research undertaken by the AEC demonstrates that many informal votes cast during the 2004 federal election were not deliberate and may be the result of frustration or an inability to understand Australia’s complex voting system. (3) What is the AEC doing to (a) provide more educational resources to voters in electoral divisions that recorded a high informal vote, (b) simplify ballot papers that will reduce confusion between federal, state and local government electoral systems, and (c) permit alternative methods of marking ballot papers, for example a tick or cross, so that a voter’s intention is unambiguous. ourable member’s question: (1) Yes. Statistics on the levels of informal voting on a division-by-division basis are available from the AEC’s website at www.aec.gov.au. The Special Minister of State advises that the following answer has been provided to him by the AEC: (2) The AEC has not yet completed its analysis of informal voting for the 2004 federal election, and therefore it is inappropriate to hypothesise or speculate as to the outcome of the result of such research. (3) (a) The AEC conducts a multi-million dollar national advertising and public relations campaign at federal elections, supported by a national call centre, AEC website and distribution of an AEC elector leaflet to every Australian household. In addition to the mainstream advertising and public relations, targeted activities are undertaken for youth, people from non-English speaking backgrounds (NESB) and Indigenous Australians. At the 2004 election, NESB advertising was provided in 26 community languages for radio and 18 languages for press covering how to cast a formal ballot and the range of voter services available. Regional radio and Imparja television carried advertising and information for Indigenous electors. Some further initiatives were trialled prior to the 2004 federal election. For example, the AEC trialled community electoral information sessions in Migrant Resource Centres in five electorates in South Western Sydney during August and September 2004, namely Reid, Parramatta, Fowler, Blaxland and Chifley. The sessions were only conducted in these electorates. An analysis of the results of the 2001 federal election indicated high levels of informal voting in these selected electorates and the community electoral information sessions were aimed a helping reduce informal voting rates in these areas for the 2004 election. In South Australia, the AEC distributed “how to vote” information in community languages to approximately 10,000 electors in the Division of Port Adelaide in selected polling areas, with post-election analysis to be undertaken to measure its impact on the informal voting rates.",206,Appropriation Bill No 1 2005 2006
275,Mr Abbott,"The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the hon(b) The format of ballot papers is prescribed by the Commonwealth Electoral Act1918 (the Electoral Act), so the scope for the AEC to simplify the ballot papers is limited. Amending the Electoral Act to simplify ballot papers is a matter for Parliament. (c) The methods for casting a valid vote are prescribed in the Electoral Act. Currently, in all but limited circumstances, marking a ballot paper with a tick or cross would be invalid. The AEC cannot admit votes that are informal, regardless of how clear the voter’s intention. Amending the Electoral Act to allow electors to mark their ballot papers with ticks or crosses is a matter for Parliament. Aged Care (Question No. 624) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Ageing, in writing, on 17 February 2005: (1) What is the name and street address of each aged care facility in the electoral division of Banks that receives Commonwealth funding. (2) Have any facilities in part (1) failed accreditation; if so, which.
