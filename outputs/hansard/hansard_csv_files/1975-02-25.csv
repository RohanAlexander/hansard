The delegation is led by Senator the Hon. G. J. Mcllraith, P.C., QC. On behalf of the HouseI extend a very warm welcome to these gentlemen. Honourable members-Hear, hear! presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned Citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble Petition respectfully showeth: (a) That the present matrimonial laws are archaic, unrealistic and cruel and the cause of so much distress, bitterness and injustice as to make their continued operation intolerable to the vast majority of fair minded citizens of Australia and that the Family Law Bill at present before ParUament should be passed without delay. (b) That the ground of Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage determined by a maximum of twelve months' separation, embodied in the Family Law Bill already passed in the Senate, be the sole ground for divorce. (c) That there is widespread dissatisfaction with the enormous discretionary powers given Judges in the present legislation and that the non fault maintenance concept (according to need) based on specific criteria, as enunciated in Clause 54 (2) of the Family Law Bill 1974 No. 2, should be tried and we humbly pray Members of tbe House will restore thus concept fully by deleting Clause 75 (n) from the new Bill ""as read a third time"". And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Hayden, Mr Charles Jones, Mr Cross, Dr Jenkins, Mr Kerin and Mr Thorburn. Petitions received. Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That marriage is an exclusive lifelong partnership between one woman and one man, which should not be dissolved at the will of one party after 12 months notice nor without a reasonable attempt at reconciliation and That a husband should normally be responsible for maintaining his wife and children within marriage. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Family Law Bill 1974 be amended (1) To require a reasonable attempt at reconciliation with the aid of counselling at least twelve months prior to the application for a divorce; (2) To specify three objective tests for irretrievable breakdown, namely (a) intolerable behaviour.

The humble Petition of the undersigned, all being of or above the age of 18 years as follows:(1) Your Petitioners oppose and seek the deletion of those provisions of the Family Law Bill 1974 which supplant the existing grounds by the introduction of the sole ground of irretrievable break-down, which remove any consideration of fault, and which will weaken the family unit while causing more widespread injustice because:(a) it imposes on society a radical alteration of divorce law far beyond identifiable requirements or desires; (b) it lowers the status of marriage by permitting people to ""drift"" into divorce, reduces parental importance and leads to increasing institutionalisation of children with consequential deliquency; (c) it will not reduce the ""in-fighting"" in a divorce suit which mainly occurs over matters of property and custody; (d) it will not encourage maturity in acceptance of marital and parental obligations and responsibilities. (2) Your Petitioners commend the divorce legislation introduced in Great Britain in 1973, which acknowledges the importance of the family unit, mirrors community requirements, secures justice for innocent people and establishes a realistic definition of irretrievable background, and call for similar legislation to be provided in Australia. Your Petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the House of Representatives in ParUament assembled will make provision accordingly. by Mr Adermann, Mr Drury and Mr Hodges. Petitions received.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of AustraUa respectfully showeth: That the Family Law Bill 1974 would be an unjust law if passed since the innocent party could be divorced against his or her will after a year's separation. That the Bill does not only facilitate divorces but changes the nature of marriage and the husband-wife relationship. Legislation ought to reflect pubhc opinion, not attempt to condition it.

There? fore ParUament has no.mandate from the people to ask such a far teaching change in the nature of our society.

Marriage is not merely a contract; it is a relationship. 2. If a party withdraws from that relationship for whatever reason there is no good to be achieved by insisting on a continuance of a contractual shell. 3Where a marriage relationship has demonstrably broken down divorce should be as quick and simple as possible in the interests of the dignity of the parties and the emotional well-being of the children.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas uranium found in vast quantities in Australia is the raw material for the nuclear fission reaction, And whereas presently assured reserves of uranium in Australia represent a potential production of over 540 000 kilograms of Plutonium 239 if utilized in Light Water Reactors overseas, And whereas the maximum permissible inhalation of Plutonium 239 is 0.00000025 gram, And whereas Plutonium 239 is one of the most dangerous substances human society has ever created, causing mutations and cancers, And whereas there are no methods of safely and absolutely confining Plutonium from the biosphere for the requisite quarter of a million years, And whereas Plutonium coming in contact with the air forms an aerosol cloud of micron-sized particles, its most dangerous form, And whereas the export of uranium may return to us an import of Plutonium particles dispersed in the global environment via the circulation of the atmosphere, And whereas there are no sure safeguards against the military use of nuclearfission,and the nuclear proliferation represents a prime environmental threat to all forms of life on the only earth available to us, And that it is therefore an act of self-preservation to demand a halt to all exports of uranium except for bio-medical uses, Your petitioners humbly pray that the members, in the House assembled, will take the most urgent steps to ensure: 1. That further mining and export of uranium from Australia except for bio-medical purposes be banned; 2. That the Australian Atomic Energy Commission be transformed by the rewriting of its charter into an Australian Energy Commission to further the understanding of energy flows through our society and to promote national economicindependence and self-sufficiency.

Are sufficient doctors graduating from AustraUan medical schools to satisfy our needs? Can something be done to ensure that those entering medical schools are not only academically the most brilliant students, nearly all of whom want to be specialists? Has he noticed the suggestion of the Doctors Reform Society that there should be assistant doctors? How can we obtain more salt of the earth doctors, namely, general practitioners with a social conscience? ment. Government supporters-No. Dr EVERINGHAMI thank the interjectors who have commended the general practitioners who have moved into this Parliament. The question of supplying more doctors, and particularly more general practitioners, is one that has exercised the minds not only of the Government but also of the AustraUan Medical Association and aU sorts of people who are concerned with the present trends. Over a period of 7 years the proportion of general practitioners to population has remained fairly stationary. The average age of general practitioners is rising and the average number of hours they work per week is declining. So obviously this is getting close to a crisis situation. The Government has moved to do several things about it. First of aU it has funded universiMinistry. This matter is under active considerties to set up schools of community medicine and general practice so that undergraduates, before they graduate will get a taste of what general practice reaUy is. AU too often during their undergraduate years they learn about the rare conditions and do not see the bread and butter conditions with which general practitioners have to deal-or , as we used to say, they learn about the canaries but cannot recognise the sparrows. Another initiative has been to fund the family medicine plan which is a program of training administered, planned, designed and carried on by the College of General Practitioners. This has received universal acclaim from every organisation except, I think, the Society of General Prachas been reached between the Australian Post titioners which represents a minority group opposed on principle to anything done by governments anyway. In its first 12 months the plan has already enrolled over 300 doctors who are training in general practice. Not only the trainees but also their principals-the people employing them-hav e been enthusiastic about the plan. They are doctors chosen by the College for their ability to train juniors. The assistants salary is subsidised by the Government for the first 2 years of the doctor's assistanceship, particularly the first year. The whole scheme is funded 100 per cent by my Department on the recommendation of the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. The Commission was ' another initiative of this Government. As regards the output of graduates generally, the Karmel Committee on Medical Education has recommended the scope and location of new medical schools and where extension of medical schools should occur. The Committee foreshadowed an increasing proportion of graduates to population between now and 1990 or 2000 which it believes will be adequate. In other words it is not a shortage of graduates that is the problem, but there is a mal, distribution of graduates as between, say, the area of general practice and other areas of medicine that may be more glamorous and more attractive. In short, I think that we have done as much as we can, in the present state of our knowledge, to offset the difficulties. We tabled recently in this ParUament a report from the Hospitals and Health Services Commission on health careers, personnel and training. The suggestion that the honourable member has made of using nurse practitioners and other medical assistants to eke out the scarce resources of doctors appeals to me. I have said this consistently both before and since I have been in the ation. It has considerable support, particularly for isolated areas where bush nurses have been doing this sort of work under difficulties for many years.

29,Mr Luchettt,"In view of the concernhonourable member says. The travelling post office service is in jeopardy because of a decision apparently made by the New South Wales Government to withdraw certain rail services. The Postmaster-General has confirmed that he is most anxious to retain this service and has, in fact, never requested any withdrawal of it. There is an agreement between the Australian Government and the New South Wales Government that the agreement establishing the service can be altered by either party giving 12 months' notice. It is significant that the New South Wales Government has given such notice. So it would appear as the honourable member fears that the service will be terminated because the rail services will not be available. The Postmaster General, however, assures me that he has arranged for the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs to discuss this matter personally with the appropriate Minister in the New South Wales Government. There has been correspondence between the AustraUan Government and the New South Wales Minister in which the Postmaster-General has urged the retention of the service. In other words, the Government is anxious that the service be maintained because of its great benefit to rural areas. As the honourable member will appreciate, if the train services are discontinued the AustraUan Government has no alternative but to use other services which would not be as effective. Nevertheless, every effort will be made to maintain the service. the Prime Minister. In answering a question from the Leader of the AustraUan Country Party last Thursday, the Prime Minister excluded the Deputy Prime Minister from the list he gave of Ministers whose staff had been given full security clearances. Has he taken any steps since to ascertain the position with respect to the staff of the Deputy Prime Minister? what I said some 2 years before. I had not been asked any questions since then. Later that day in speaking to a matter of pubUc importance introduced by the honourable member for Mackellar the Deputy Prime Minister stated the position as regards his staff. I myself said that if any honourable members had any qualms about these matters they should raise them with me. I would take this opportunity to say that if any honourable member for MackeUar is not in the person has any doubt at aU about the integrity or chamber today. He is otherwise occupied. Some the security of any person on the staff of a Minister the decent thing, surely, is to let the Minister know. (Opposition members interjecting)asked. The Prime Minister will answer the question. traUan Country Party finds it amusing that people should mention to an employer that there is somebody on his staff who is notfitto be on his staff. I would have thought that was the decent course. But, of course, it now seems that the Leaders of the Opposition are prepared to support private members-thos e on their last gasp or last rasp-bringin g up charges against individuals and against Ministers. The honourable member for Mackellar last Thursday brought up as a matter of urgency an attack on the Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister, and he could not have made that attack had there not been a sufficient number of members in the Opposition to rise to support him when the matter was called on. It is significant that the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the AustraUan Country Party, who rose to support him, did not speak themselves; none of them sought to speak. Opposition members-We were gagged. the Ust given to you, Mr Speaker, and none of them rose to speak unannounced. One would think that if the Deputy Prime Minister had committed any act or was likely to commit any act which was inappropriate to his office or was a danger to the country, the Leader of the Opposition would have seen fit to make the allegation, or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the Country Party. But no, they hide behind a man who is in his last term in the Parliament, a man who has disgraced the most honoured name in this Parliament by his consistent viUfication for a quarter of a century. They hide behind a man who is on the way out. They will not stand up themselves to make the allegation. If my deputy. Mr Malcolm FraserA point of order. leader!

CouldI suggest that since he is forcibly absent, Mr Speaker, there is therefore a duty upon you, from the Chair, to protect him using your rights and prerogatives. for Mackellar thinks he has been insulted I will give him the usual opportunity to speak when he returns tomorrow. The Prime Minister may continue to answer the question. the Opposition has been prepared to defend the conduct of the honourable member for Mackellar. The honourable member for Mackellar read in the House under privilege, with the support, we later learned, of his leader, an article which had been peddled around every newspaper office in Australia and which none of them was prepared to publish. That is the type of leadership we get from the Liberal Party and the Country Party-willin g to wound and yet afraid to strike. MISS JUNIE MOROSI tion to the Attorney-General and allude to the fact that due to a tip-off to the Commonwealth Police that there was to be a break and entry into the home of Miss Junie Morosi, the Commonwealth Police were called out to surround the house. I ask the Minister: Who would have ordered the Commonwealth Police to do a job which is normally the duty of a State police force? Is it correct for this side of the House to take it that if any ministerial staff members or members on the Government side are in trouble in the future they will have the protection of the Minister for Defence. Has the Department of Commonwealth Police Force? informant did pass certain information to the cadet? If not, why not? If the Department will Commonwealth police. I do not know whether not replace these rifles with SLRs, will each unit he passed information to the New South Wales be permitted to purchase .303 rifles from the Depolice. It may be that he did; it may be that he partment for its own use? did not. My understanding is that the Commonwealth police then took the appropriate action and effected an arrest. That power is within their fence has recalled from the cadet corps units authority and certainly they did have authority throughout Australia the .303 rifles. There are 3 to make the arrest. An information was laid and reasons for this. The first is that the recommenproceedings then commenced in the magistrates dation for this action was contained in the report court. I understand that the gentleman who was of the Millar Committee which investigated the arrested was charged with stealing. There may Australian cadet corps and pointed out that the have been another chargeI think there wasabout illegal use, a false number plate or an offence of that kind. I understand that the charge guilty, certainly to one charge, perhaps both, and was dealt with by the magistrate. Everything that has been put to me confirms that the police acted properly, that the magistrate acted properly and that the man was dealt with properly. question concerning standing order 152 which relates to the proper administration of the Standing Orders of this House. I ask: Is it properly and sensibly within the Standing Orders of this House for an honourable member to use in debate a form of language such as 'Woof, woof? I refer, of course, to the example shown in Hansard at page 427 of 19 February 1975 which shows that the Leader of the Opposition made the remarkable contribution: 'Come on. Woof, woof!'. In seeking your ruling, Mr Speaker, I should mention, in case it is relevant that the expression 'woof, woof had an exclamation mark following it. the Hansard report of last week. I do not think 'woof, woof is a very devastating term to apply to anyone. I also read the term 'ga-ga'. Only last Saturday morning I was visited by a relative of mine; a little grandnephew. He was playing with a silky terrier which says 'woof, woof, and the little grandnephew says 'ga-ga', so I do not think there is anything very devastating about the terms. Sometimes in this House, I imagine, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition show a dislike of one another but underneath it all I really think they love each other.

The second reason is that we do not manufacture .303 ammunition in AustraUa; it has to be imported and it is very costly. The third reason is the question of security which has been raised in this House on a number of occasions. It is well known that there have been problems of security in relation to armouries located at Australian schools for the cadet corps. Basically, they are the 3 reasons. The .22 rifle will be retained for shooting practice and the 7.62 millimetre SLR will be made available to cadet corps units for shooting practice and for ceremonial purposes. In the last part of his question, the honourable member asked whether it would be possible for cadet corps to purchase .303 rifles. This is a matter for my colleague, Senator James McClelland, the Minister for Manufacturing Industry, to determine. Once rifles have been declared for disposal, it is a matter for him to determine what should happen to them. But if the honourable member is asking for my own personal view, the answer would be no. I would be reluctant to allow .303 rifles to be purchased by school cadet corps and kept under their own management in armouries at the schools.

In the autumn session of this ParUament in 1973 my Government introduced thefirstFederal legislation to implement the Court's advice, but the Opposition, which in government had introduced no measures, defeated the Bill in the Senate. An amendment to overcome one deficiency to which the Court directed attention was passed by the Federal Parliament in November 1973, but by the fifth anniversary of the judgment no further action had yet been taken by any of the State parliaments. Accordingly, a year ago the Government appointed Mr order. This is an extremely important report and Justice J. B. Sweeney to inquire into and report upon the legislative changes necessary to carry out the advice of the Industrial Court. I sent the bate it. I ask that the Minister move that the Premiers a copy of His Honour's report on 18 July last and drew particular attention to his recommendation for complementary State legislation. The Federal legislation which His Honour drafted was passed on 24 October last, and I so advised the Premiers on the foUowing day. I understand that South Australia is prepared to pass the complementary legislation. I received acknowledgments only from the former Premier of New South Wales and the Acting Premier of Queensland. I have not yet heard from the Premier of Western AustraUa. I shall now telegraph all present a Green Paper entitled 'A Review of the Premiers again.

Last Wednesday I made a personal explanation in the Parliament. The question is to be found at page 359 of Hansard. Since then I have been further misrepresented by the Prime Minister( Mr Whklam) and I think it is necessary that I put the matter in context in this single personal explanation. On 17 February at a function at the Southern Cross Hotel in Melbourne I was asked about the present system of tertiary allowances and scholarships. I replied: I am not satisfied that the Australian Government is disme. tributing the education dollar right. I think that the scholarships operate unfairly to a great number. Of the two systemsof scholarshipsI prefer the old system. On 18 February on page 3 of the 'Sydney Morning Herald' there appeared a report of the luncheon. It incorrectly interpreted those comments of mine to mean that I would re-introduce university fees and abolish tertiary allowances. My comments permitted of no such possible construction. The report was totally incorrect. University fees will not be re-introduced under a Liberal-Country Party government. Assistance to students will be increased. That is the written policy of the 2 Parties. The policy is binding on all members of both Parties. On Tuesday, 18 February, the honourable member for Holt asked the Minister for Education ( Mr Beazley) to comment on the 'Sydney Morning Herald' report. The Minister commented on it, assuming that the report was correct. Later that day the Minister issued a Press statement commenting further on the reported statement. I was not in the House on 18 February. At the first available opportunity-the next day, 19 FebruaryI made a personal explanation and stated categorically that the report was wrong. The policy of the Liberal and Country Parties as printed in the policy document ""The Way Ahead' states: We will not re-introduce the payment of fees by students in universities and tertiary colleges. We shall review existing means tested tertiary allowances to see that students can undertake tertiary education. We promised: Revision of the grants to needy students undertaking tertiary education to ensure that they are adequate. Rules governing allowances to tertiary students should be reviewed to make more realistic and humane the requirements in relation to the circumstances in which the student is living. There should be less reliance on bureaucratic control. We will investigate the desirability of establishing a tertiary students' loan scheme to cover necessary costs and at the same time encourage self-help. Revision of the effectiveness, in the light of the TAFE Committee report, and generally of current assistance to technical education students. That is our policy. My personal explanation last Wednesday indicated that the report in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' was false. I assumed that all honourable members would, as is the convention of the House, take note of my explanation and not continue to attribute the false report to However, on last Sunday, 23 February, in Launceston the Prime Minister addressed the Tasmanian State Australian Labor Party Conference and said: Only last week in an unguarded moment, Mr Snedden let slip one of Liberal's less attractive promises-the restoration of fees for tertiary education and a cutback in student allowances. That's the sort of Liberal economy measure the youth of Australia could expect. That shows the tactics of the Prime Minister. It is quite clearly a smear campaign of misrepresentation and mistruth and, if I were allowed to do so, I would call it utter dishonesty. One wonders why we have the established convention of allowing honourable members to make personal explanations if people like the Prime Minister lack the decency to take note of them. Any further statements by the Prime Minister or any member of his Government imputing to me any suggestion of a restoration of tertiary fees will be a gross misrepresentation, wilful deceit and, in the Prime Minister's own words, a peddling of lies.",29,Customs Valuation System Review

Mr remarks relate to the Thirtyseventh General Report. During the middle of last year-in May-ther e was an election, which is the reason why two annual reports have been presented for last year. The election in May caused disruption to the Public Works Committee, and the membership of the Committee changed. Mr Fulton, the honourable member for Leichhardt, Mr Whittorn, the former honourable member for Balaclava, and Mr Corbett, the honourable member for Maranoa, did not seek re-appointment to the Committee. Mr Whittorn did not seek re-appointment to the Committee because he did not seek re-election to this Parliament. I wish to pay tribute to his contribution to the work of the Committee for 5 years from 25 November 1969 to 11 April 1974. Mr Corbett, who had the same length of service, from 25 November 1969 to 11 April 1974-as o 5 yearsfound his other parliamentary duties such that time did not permit his usual devotion to his duties as a member of the Committee. Mr Fulton, the honourable member for Leichhardt, served a decade with the Committee, from 4 March 1964 until 11 April 1974. During his 10 years of service Mr Fulton served as Deputy Chairman and from 7 March 1973 to 11 April 1974 served a distinguished period as Chairman of the Committee. It was my privilege to serve for only one year with these 3 gentlemen but I would feel remiss if I did not take this opportunity to mention their service. As Mr Fulton was the only chairman with whom I have served I am unable to make comparisons, but I can say that his wisdom, fairness and judgment have been an inspiration to me.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their place. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places) is raised as a matter of public importance. It is a matter which should be dealt with urgently by this Parliament. We see it as a clear public responsibility that any doubts and pubhc concern should be settled.

I trust that the Government will at least have sent an immediate cable. We believe and hope that the Indonesian Government shares with us a respect for the right of colonial territories to determine their future. As members of the United Nations and as participants in cooperation in this region we, with others, such as Papua New Guinea, also share a concern for the development of the region, for co-operation, consultation and for the security and well-being of all in the region. member's time has expired. Science) (3.40)-That was one of the most extratralian people and for the AustraUan Governordinary speeches that I have heard from the ment. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Peacock). Willesee) had discussions in New York in He began by asserting that the purpose of his October with Mr Soares, the Portuguese Minister speech was not to disrupt Australia's very close for Foreign Affairs, and Dr Adam Malik, the relations with Indonesia. Yet the rest of his Minister for Foreign Affairs in Indonesia. A conspeech was designed to create a barrier to these siderable amount of the time taken up by these very close relations and the continuing discussion discussions dwelt on this very subject, a subject that Australia has had with Indonesia and Porwhich the Opposition had not even worried tugal over this very question. It is a great pity about to that stage, a subject that we saw was when any member of the Opposition, in order to going to be vital in our relations with Indonesia, substantiate his own position in the party, seeks vital in terms of the peace and stabiUty of this to create in the public mind a difference of part of the world. This matter has been a cause of opinion between Australia and Indonesia and concern to the Australian Government for a long between the countries in this area that are vitally time. concerned with the future of Timor. The honourable member mentioned that he Territorial Co-ordination, visited Australia on has raised this question before, and indeed he 13-16 October. He came to AustraUa because he has. In a debate in this House last October he did knew of our concern and because he knew of the forthcoming. He argued in his introductory statepromptly, hke a prima donna, departed the chamber and did not wait for what was said subThe Governmentdoes not seek any special position in Portuguese Timor and it believes that the views and attitudes and of the people of Portuguese Timor should be decisive. The Government has indicated that if the people of Portuguese Timor wish to associate themselves in some way with Indonesia, Australia would welcome this provided -and I repeat 'provided'-that the decision were based on an internationally accepted act of self-determination. In short, the Government believes that the Timorese people should be allowed to proceed deliberately towards a decision about their own future... It is quite clear that the honourable gentleman did not even bother reading Hansard. He certainly was not in the chamber when the statement was made. The honourable member talked about a lack of discussion between Australia, Indonesia and Portugal. Perhaps1 could remind the honourable gentleman that very intensive discussions have taken place on this very subject. The honourable member alluded to discussions between the Prime Minister and President Suharto in Septralian viewpoint that self-determination was a Dr Santos, the Portuguese Minister for Inter-",32,Foreign Affairs East Timor

108,Mr Morrison (St George,"Minister for principal issue, a principal concern, for the Ausrole that AustraUa could play in discussions with Indonesia. On that visit Dr Santos saw the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He also saw me in my capacity as Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Matters Relating to Papua New Guinea. Since that date there has, in these top level discussions with the Portuguese and the Indonesians, been intense diplomatic activity taking place in Lisbon, Jakarta, New York and Canberra. All of these discussions reiterated the AustraUan viewpoint and the Australian viewpoint is weU known in Indonesia not only amongst the Ministers and the Cabinet in Indonesia but also amongst the Indonesian people. IfI may I wul quote to the House from an article in one of the Indonesian newspapers, the 'New Standard', which came out yesterday. It states: . . . although Indonesia makes no legal claim whatsoever to Portuguese Timor, it regards the Territory as geographically a part of the Indonesian world. For cultural, ethnic and historical reasons an integration of the territory into Indonesia would represent valid decolonisation and the most natural source to that end. Australia which has been following the developments in the Territory with concern, has no ambitions in the area. It is however firmly committed to the principle of self determination of all remaining colonial territories. Honourable members will notice that it is a repetition throughout of the propositions and the statements that have been made by the AustraUan Government. We have come out very clearly before any action may be contemplated or may be taken by either the Portuguese or the Indonesians. And what a change this is. The honourable member for Kooyong talks about influence in world affairs. If he looks back through the record to see what his predecessors in foreign affairs said on the subject when India moved into Goa he will see what the comment and response was then. Australia had no influence at that stage on India or any other pan of the world. When India moved into Goa with forcible aggression and took over Goa there was a plaintive statement by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Menzies, to the effect that 'WeU, we do understand India's reasons and it is rather bad that it happened that way'. That is the type of dynamic politics in foreign affairs that was conducted by honourable gentlemen opposite when they were sitting on the Government benches. We on this side have taken every opportunity representatives of the Indonesian Government for discussion-hig h level discussion. I want to and Portuguese Government, the views that are make it very clear because obviously the honourexpressed and a lot of the things that make the able member for Kooyong and other honourable diplomatic worlds turn round, must remain members opposite find it very difficult to understand clear and concise terminology. The AustraUan Government's position in relation to both Portugal and Indonesia is clear, has been clear and it is well understood by both the Portuguese and the Indonesians. We support a measured and dehberate process of decolonisation in Portuguese Timor through arrangements leading to an internationally acceptable act of self-determination. We do not believe that political development in the Territory has yet reached a stage at which such an act could take place. We look to Portugal to maintain its responsibilities in the Territory in order to bring about the necessary conditions for it. We do understand Indonesia's substantial interest in the future of the Territory. Is this so remarkably odd when Indonesia and Portugal have half of the island of Timor and the island of Timor itself is part of the geographical entity of the Indonesian Archlpeligo? Quite obviously Indonesia does have a very close and concerned interest in the future development of Portuguese Timor. We believe that there is time and opportunity for a political solution to be found which will meet the proper aspirations of the people of the Territory and also the natural interests of Indonesia. We have made it very clear to the Indonesian Government that we would be seriously concerned if there were to be any unilateral action on the part of Indonesia which would prevent an act of self-determination in Portuguese Timor. The Indonesian Government is aware of the AustraUan attitude and of the importance which the Australian Government attaches to an internationally acceptable act of self-determination. The honourable member for Kooyong has followed up Press reports and has indicated that there is a possibiUty, so he says-o r some pundit of the Press likes to think there is-that there may be some Indonesian military activity in the area. I should like to quote from a statement that was reported last night from Jakarta. It says: Indonesian Defence Ministry officials today dismissed as totally untrue AustraUan newspaper reports that Indonesia planned to invade Portuguese Timor within the next few weeks. An official in the Defence Ministry said in reply to a question that the reports were false and totally without foundation. The honourable member for Kooyong has always recognised-h e even restated it todaythat the basis of these discussions that take place at the top level between Foreign Ministers, Ministers and the Prime Minister and senior secret and must remain confidential. The honourable member pointed out that that was one of the propositions to which the former Government, a government of which he was a Minister, adhered. In all these discussions we have put very forcibly the AustraUan viewpoint. Because of the position that AustraUa has now reached in international affairs throughout the world, because we de undertake a poUcy that is essentially Australian, a policy which owes its influence to no other country but AustraUa, because we have been accepted in the international community as people who can stand on their own feet and are recognised and appreciated for doing exactly that, we have a degree of influence to which the Opposition when it was in govern* ment could never aspire and we have been exerting that influence, not from yesterday when the honourable member for Kooyong happened to read a Press report or receive a telegram from somewhere in Timor which he is not prepared to table. It is only when he can see an opportunity for some short term political capital, when he is thinking about tomorrow's headlines rather than the future of the People of Portuguese Timor or the future of Australia's relations with Indonesia thatMr PeacockI rise to a point of order. As the records of this Parliament will show I have had an interest in this matter that goes back far beyond yesterday both in questions and speeches. that is so. the point is that it is a cheap poUtical gimmick. I have a great respect for the honourable member for Kooyong. He knows full well the significance colleague, the honourable member for Kooyong of bringing this issue into pubUc debate at the ( Mr Peacock). On this side of the House and, I very moment when Australia is in very close conbeUeve, bilaterally within the ParUament, there sultation with Indonesia and at the very moment is a universal desire to maintain close and when Australia is in close consultation with Porfriendly relations with Indonesia. We on this side tugal. It is because we have achieved a position of the House happen to beUeve that regional in world affairs which AustraUa has never had security and regional discussions in matters perbefore that we are able to conduct these negotaining to foreign poUcy are a fundamental way tiations and that our viewpoint will not only be by which the whole of this nation's foreign policy respected but will be listened to, and I am sure should be approached. Quite in contrast to that that the viewpoint which we wiU put forward wiU the Prime Minister made to this Parliament a be acted upon. SoI very much regret that the statement, only a fortnight ago, on his return honourable member for Kooyong has sought from his recent 6 weeks'jaunt abroad. In that today to bring to public debate for very base perstatement, the Prime Minister spoke in grandiose sonal poUtical motives a problem that nobody terms of his participation in world affairs but says is easy, a problem that has continually conneglected an area which is now obviously at a cerned Australia and to which since last Seppoint where anything can happen. tember and October we have devoted our attention. I beUeve that the honourable member and the Opposition have done a disservice to this viously the future of Timor has been a matter of House and to Australia's relations with pubhc debate and of very real concern, certainly Indonesia and Portugal in bringing up this matter for debate. We are acting responsibly on behalf of the Australian people and looking towards not tomorrow's headlines but the peace and the stability of Indonesia, of the Indonesian Archipelago and the peace and stability of that part of the world in which we live. incredible fashion the Minister for Science( Mr Morrison) has just suggested that this ParUament should not be discussing a matter which is of national importance, a matter which is canvassed across the front pages in the headlines of almost every Australian newspaper, a matter which is currently of very real pubUc moment in this country. Yet this open Government is asserting that this matter should not be canvassed in the ParUament of the Commonwealth. That alone is an absolutely deplorable consequence of the statement which has just been made by the Minister for Science. The second part is the impUcations which flow from statements which he has made about tbe independently Australian attitude which has been established by this Whitlam Government. He talks about the degree of influence that the Labor Goverament has been able to accomplish in international arenas; yet he fatfs to mention that one of the fundamental causes for our disquiet on this side of the House is the contrast between the publicly expressed and stated attitude of the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam), of his Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Willesee) on this very issue. Let me revert to the opening comment by my Since last April, since the coup in Portugal, ob-",34,Foreign Affairs East Timor

111,Mr Sinclair (New England) (3.54),"In anto members on this side of the House. I am delighted to know that members of the Government have actually been talking about it. But the difficulty with this Government's talks is that it would seem that its foreign policy is motivated at several levels. We have private discussions by the Prime Minister. We are told about those private discussions in the media for the media tell us more than the Prime Minister himself. But even in this Parliament from statements that he makes to us, we learn that those private discussions are leading this country in a way which is distinctly to our advantage. Yet, in a very important matter of pubhc concern about a colonial country which is so adjacent to our own that it is only 55 kilometres from the north-west coast of Australia, we find that the Prime Minister in his personal discussions has an attitude different from that of his Foreign Minister. At atimewhen the matter is being blazoned across the headlines of the newspapers, I believe it is important that we elicit from the Government just what it is doing and that the people of Australia be shown that tbere is a capacity by Australia to act in such a way as to ensure that the people in our vicinity will act, as we beUeve they will, responsibly and that those within eastern Timor will be given an opportunity to express their own point of view in accordance with the statements that the Indonesian Foreign Minister and others have already asserted will be so. The difficulty is that the statements by the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr Adam Malik, and the statements by the AustraUan Foreign Minister and the AustraUan Prime Minister are in such marked contrast. Let me, for the sake of the Minister for Science, go back to the statement that was canvassed by the Prime Minister after his discussions with President Suharto in Indonesia late last year. In an article in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' on 16 November 1974, Peter Hastings commented on the attitude of Indonesia after there had been various comments by members of the Government that the Prime Minister did not say what he is alleged to have said. Tbis article states: There should be no misunderstanding in Canberra, either, about the conviction of many Indonesians that the Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, gave Indonesia the green light for a takeover in his talks with President Suharto in Jogjakarta a or not, it is important that the Prime Minister's few weeks ago when his briefing officer told Pressmen that the Prime Minister regarded an independent Portuguese Timor as non-viable economically and a 'potential threat to regional stability'. It is important that, irrespective of denials by the tiatives in pubUc and not just in private places to Government, it is recognised that there is an attidemonstrate its concern for the maintenance of tude of belief hi Indonesia that the Australian regional security in our particular part of the Prime Minister has stated that he and the Australian Government would be sympathetic to some type of takeover by Indonesia. It is interesting that in this debate this afternoon, on a matter of critical foreign poUcy importance to this country, the Prime Minister did not even participate. Yet, earlier in the afternoon, we were told that he is Acting Foreign Minister. So, the Acting Foreign Minister having just returned from his jaunts to Europe, sent one of his more junior Ministers into the House who teUs us: 'We have been talking about this all the time. We are really worried about it. We have estabUshed a new independence in attitude'. whatsoever. Not only is there no evidence of concern but also is there distinct evidence and tragicaUy evidence of belief in Indonesia that the attitude of the Prime Minister, the attitude of AustraUa's Acting Foreign Minister, is completely in contradiction to that of Mr Adam Malik, Indonesia's Foreign Minister, and to the attitude of the AustraUan Minister for Foreign Affairs who in Singapore on 5 December last told a Press conference that he, Senator Willesee, did not agree with the Indonesian attitude to the colony of Timor. The Indonesian attitude to the colony at that stage was said to be that independence for east Timor was not a practical option. It is true that, as far as the AustraUan people are concerned, there are several things that we expect of this Government. First of all, we on this side of the Parliament beUeve that the Prime Minister has a responsibility to remove the justifiable doubts that there are in the minds of the Australian people as to what his attitude is and what the attitude of the Australian Government is on this matter. It is of no use the Minister for Science coming in here and pretending to state what the Australian Government's attitude is; nor indeed for my friend, the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Cross), who will foUow me in this debate, to do so. The Prime Minister of AustraUa has on record a statement which rightly or wrongly is being taken by many people to be the expression of a beUef that the Australian Government condones the appropriation of Portuguese Timor by Indonesia. Were that to be so attitude be declared. The second point is that it is important that the AustraUan Government should take positive ini-",36,Foreign Affairs East Timor
112,Mr Kilien,There is no evidence of it.,37,Foreign Affairs East Timor
113,Mr Sinclair,"There is no evidence of itworld. It is nonsense for the Minister for Science to talk about any parallel between the rights of government and the roles of government in the Indian acquisition of Goa in the same sentence even as our rights and roles with respect to the future of Portuguese Timor. I beUeve that there is an opportunity for the AustraUan Government in international forums and certainly in regional forums to ensure that this whole matter is canvassed, that there are discussions not just, as he asserted, in Lisbon, Jakarta, New York and Canberra, but that there are discussions in a pubUc way which will ensure AustraUa's long term continued interest in the maintenance of the closest and friendUest relations with Indonesia will be preserved and that the future of Timor is settled in such a way as to ensure the maintenance of peace in this region and to ensure that ultimately the rights of the people of Timor are not denied. I regard it as being a great tragedy that in this debate the Prime Minister himself has not been prepared to assert the Government's attitude but that instead we have had an apology from the Minister for Science saying: 'ReaUy, don't you worry, AustraUan people. AU is in the best of hands. But we are just not going to tell you anything about that'. That attitude is not good enough. This is a matter of national importance which requires national action. It is a tragedy that we have not a government that is capable of such positive action. The honourable member'stimehas expired. to come out of this discussion it is that the Opposition has quite clearly stated its support for the Government's policy of self-deternunation by the people of Portuguese Timor. I shall answer one or two of the points that have been made. The Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party( Mr Sinclair) said that the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) is on record on the question of allowing Indonesia to take over what will be the former Portuguese territory in East Timor. Let us just look at that statement that the Prime Minister is on record. When one looks at this record onefindsthat it is an article by Peter Hastings in an AustraUan newspaperI think it was the Melbourne 'Age'. There is no question that the Prime Minister made any statement on what, after all, were confidential discussions between him and the President of Indonesia. So the Opposition again is, as it has done on previous occasions, basing its foreign policy on newspaper reports. In this debate, notwithstanding some emphatic denials from the Indonesian defence authorities, the Opposition's argument is based on newspaper reports. When I was listening to the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Peacock), the shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, talking about relations with Indonesia-thi s very sensitive area of AustraUan foreign poUcyI could not help thinking that his distinguished predecessor, Sir Garfield Barwick, made a contribution to Indonesian-Australian relations which has never been properly recognised in AustraUa. The Deputy Leader of the AustraUan Country Party and I were members of a parUamentary delegation which went to Sarawak and Sabah at the end of Indonesian confrontation. We were very much aware of the fact that during that period when Indonesian and Australian troops were exchanging fire in North Borneo, when people were being killed, we were able to talk to the government of Indonesia because of good relations that had been estabhshed. The sad part about this discussion is that it is based on newspaper reports and could prejudice those good relations built up very carefully over the years. I wish that the honourable member for Kooyong had some concept of the responsible attitude of his distinguished predecessor who, if I might add in passing, was later elevated by his government to an important position on the High Court of AustraUa. This irresponsible attack, based as it is on unconfirmed newspaper reports, stands out in contrast with the bi-partisan attitude of the AustraUan Labor Party in opposition over many years prior to 1972 when we supported every effort made by the then government for better relations with Indonesia. We were criticised by the honourable member for Kooyong because we have no representative in DiU. I remind members of the Opposition that it was their Government that closed the consulate in Dili. The facts about the importance of Timor-it s nearness to our shores-surel y have not developed only in the last month or two; they have been facts that have been transparently obvious to every member of this House over a substantial period oftime.It is a fact that Mr Taylor, a senior political adviser of the Australian Embassy, is on his way from Jakarta to east Timor now. It is not thefirsttime that there have been representatives of the Depaitment of Foreign Affairs there in recenttimes.Lest anyone hearing that he is on his way there today should think that this is some arrangement made since the honourable member for Kooyong raised this",37,Foreign Affairs East Timor
114,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Drury),Order!,38,Foreign Affairs East Timor
115,Mr Cross (Brisbane) (4.5),"If any good ismatter in the House, I state that these arrangements that Mr Taylor would go to Dili were officer of the AustraUan Embassy in Jakarta, visited east Timor late last year and spent some time there reporting to the Government on these questions. The point was made with a lot of drama that a letter will be in the pocket of Mr Woolcott for the very weU. We wish him well in his support for next 14 days as he perambulates around the States on his way to Jakarta. The truth of the matter is that he leaves for Jakarta on Thursday-in 2 days. That is just a difference of 12 days, not really very much! Mr Woolcott is going to Jakarta with great expedition. I made the point of the emphatic denials. The Australian Goverament, of course, has sought official confirmation of these denials from the Indonesian Government. Australia supports an act of self determination by Portuguese Timor. I trust that it will be a meaningful act of self-determination. These people, notwithstanding the fact that they come from the multitude of people in the Indonesian Archipelago, have had the impact upon them of 400 years of Portuguese cultural influence and one cannot erode that. It is a matter for them to make the decision on what their future might be. The point was made that when Mr Horta came proved at the 1973 conference. In the last section to Australia on the first occasion the Minister for on foreign affairs deaUng with general principles Foreign Affairs did not see him.

I APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1974-1975 have mentioned that the Australian Government has a policy of self-determination. We recognise the great importance to Indonesia of this small ing appropriation for proposed expenditure colony. We know that the Indonesians would be announced. concerned to see that forces hostile to Indonesia did not use Portuguese Timor as a base. Having first time. looked at this problem myself I can see no evidence of that at thistime. Mr Horta and the Opposition Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee also had discussions but I would not like members of the Opposition to create the impression that Mr Horta discussed these matters only with them. We of the Government members foreign affairs committee had several extremely long sessions with him in which he put his point of view self-determination. In contrast to newspaper reports, I wish to read 2 short extracts. One is from the report of the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Willesee, in Singapore on 5 December. The Australian position remained as he had expressed it in Parliament several times, that is to say the principle of self determination should apply. He described the three options This is the gentleman from the AustraUan Broadcasting Commissionto say whether Australia accepted the Indonesian argument that independence was not a practical solution, the Minister replied that this was a matter for the people themselves to decide.

The Bills also include provisions for a number of other items for which funds additional to those appropriated by Appropriation Acts (Nos1 and 2) are required in advance of the normal additional Estimates Bills which we expect to bring before the Parliament, as usual, early in April. Darwin Cyclone The cyclone which struck Darwin in the early appropriation hours of Christmas morning largely demolished the city. Honourable members will be aware that the Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) gave very full details of the extent of the damage and losses and the resulting probof ah charters for the massive air lift that was lems when he introduced the Darwin Reconorganised and to pay for fuel, tyres and essential struction Bill into this House on 11 February repairs for the vehicles of self evacuated persons, 1975. The Government moved quickly to meet the situation. I visited Darwin, as Acting Prime Minister, on Boxing Day and as a result of what I saw there I authorised the use of all resources at the cost ofGovernment disposal of the Government for the relief of the appropriate time. This amount city, the evacuation of the majority of its popurequired to meet the return fares lation, the provision of services to care for the Government employees.

The Natural Disasters Organisation and the Defence Force, the Departments of the Northern Territory, Housing and Construction, Social Security, Manufacturing Industry, and elements of other departments all contributed to the relief operwas necessary for foodstuffs to be issued to the ations. I take this opportunity of recording the population of Darwin. Government's appreciation of the tremendous effort on the part of all concerned. The normal processes of administration in Darwin were seriously disrupted by the cyclone. Because of this, the amounts included in these Bills for many of the items of expenditure in very broad estimates only. Nor can we be confident that all the expenditures that need to be the subject of appropriations have yet been clearly identified. Accordingly, contingency provisions of $ 15m in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and $10m in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) are being sought. These contingency provisions would be available only for expenditures resulting from the Darwin cyclone. I now refer briefly to some of the more significant items of expenditure resulting from the cyclone for which appropriations are sought. Special Benefit Payments-$3.5m Persons who were evacuated from Darwin and those who remained were given an emergency cash payment equivalent to 2 weeks' special benefit free of means test. From9 January 1975 a similar type of payment was made to persons who qualified under a more liberal means test than normally applies to special benefit. From6 February Darwin people residing in the southern States were entitled to receive special benefit subject to the normal means test conditions. An ments. of $3.5m is sought for these payEvacuation of Population-$3.5 m The sum sought in this item is to cover the cost and fares of evacuees between southern cities and country centres. Repatriation of Population-$2.5 m The retuniing has undertaken to meet the evacuees to Darwin at the is specifically of nonmeet cost of returning their own employees. Provision of Emergency Food Supplies-$2,050,000 Under the state of emergency which existed it Repairs and Maintenance-$26.7m The Department of Housing and Construction proceeded prompdy with the task of clearing the streets, restoring electric power, water supply and sewerage, and with repairs to buildings. Some of these were temporary repairs to enable shelter or working space to become quickly usable. Others were of a more substantial kind. As an indication of what was achieved, the program for the restoration of public utilities envisaged that by day 35 water supply would be available to all areas requiring supply. That was achieved with very minor exceptions as was the restoration of sewerage facilities. It was planned purpose. to waterproof .1000 houses by day 35. Over 1400 houses plus 83 flats were repaired to this standard by then. Fifty per cent of major public buildings were to be be waterproofed and temporarily repaired and this target was also achieved. All roads were cleared to permit traffic ible. These loans will be available through the and all major roads were cleared fence-to-fence by 10 January. The achievements reflect a magnificent effort by all concerned. There were very significant contributions by the Defence Force, repair gangs whose equipment included equipment lent by various State authorities and the trade unions' in Darwin volunteer aid program. Emergency Accommodation An amount of $2.1m is sought for Commonbased public servants temporarily located in wealth Hostels for the operation of emergency southern cities. Various departments have facilities and the repair of existing hostels, and incurred specific additional administrative $1,960,000 for the cost of hiring the vessel expenditures as a result of the cyclone.

No appropriation is ditional capital grants, representing portion of sought in the present Bills for the major reconstruction programs to be put in hand under the authority of the Commission as it is not expected that substantial funds will be required before 1 July 1975. Any requirements that do arise before then can be met from the special contingency fund for Darwin cyclone expenditures. Compensation for Personal Injury and Death Compensation for personal injury and death arising from the cyclone will be paid along the lines proposed in the National Compensation Bill 1974 which is currently before the Senate. An appropriation of $300,000 is sought for this Loans to Small Businesses Loans will be available to small businesses unable to obtainfinancefrom normal sources to enable them to return to operation as soon as possCommonwealth Trading Bank and $lm is sought to enable advances to be made to the bank in the period up to 30 June 1975.

119,They Have The Greatest Practicable Effects In Terms Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Drury),"IsAppropriation Bill (No. 4) also authorises the provision of financial assistance of $6m for Tasmania in 1974-75 in connection with the disaster that occurred in Hobart on 5 January 1975 when the Australian National Line's bulk-ore carrier the Lake Illawarra hit the Tasman Bridge with consequent loss of life and serious damage to the bridge. The Australian Government has undertaken to meet the full costs incurred by the State and its authorities on agreed measures associated with or attributable to the bridge collapse, including assistance to the State in respect of the investigation of a proposal' for a further permanent bridge across the Derwent River. The Bill also provides for funds additional to those provided in the Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1974-75 to assist New South Wales and Victoria in meeting the cost of agreed natural disaster relief and restoration measures. The additional funds have been made necessary by damage caused by bushfires in the western region of New South Wales and by furtherfloodingin various areas in Victoria. Other items I mentioned earlier that the Bills included proWaterloo in Sydney. visions for a number of items, additional to the items relating to the Darwin cyclone and assistance to the States, for which further appropriations are required in advance of the normal Additional estimates. In Appropriation Bill (No. 3), an additional $85m has been included for the Regional Employment Development Scheme which is designed to create employment opportunities in areas of relatively high unemployment. Already some 3000 projects to cost $76m have been approved under this scheme, and the AustraUan Government is committed to provide $60m in respect of these. These projects wiU provide employment for over 24 000 people, including more than 21 000 from the unemployed. Additional projects are being approved progressively. Emphasis is placed on projects which are able to be commenced promptly and completed in a reasonably short period. The cost of income maintenance payments to individuals under the structional adjustment assistance scheme is expected to reach $69m by the end of 1974-75. Accordingly, provision has been made for an additional $57.2m in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). . Amounts of $6.2m for the National Employment and Training Scheme-the NEAT scheme-and $7.85m for the national apprenticeship assistance scheme are required to supplement existing appropriations-the first because of an unexpected increase in the number of trainees under the scheme and the second as a result of the Government's decision last month to increase significantly the subsidies payable to employers under the scheme and to pay a training bonus to employers who fail to qualify under the scheme but who take on apprentices. An additional $4m is sought in respect of hostel accommodation for the aged. The increased requirement arises because of a greater number of appUcations for assistance than expected when the maximum capital grant was raised to $9,000 a unit following amendment of the Aged Persons Hostels Act in December. An additional $4.5 m is sought to meet the cost of providing nursing home and domiciliary nursing care for veterans. There has been a marked improvement in 1974-75 in the rate of progress in the construction of housing and other capital facilities for the Services. Thus, $8.07 lm is being sought for additional advances to the States for housing being erected for servicemen and $8.36lm for other capital facilities being constructed by the Department of Housing and Construction. An amount of $19.5m is being provided for the purchase for defence purposes of the Leyland site at Among the remaining amounts included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) are a number which are needed because of the effect of the devaluation of the AustraUan dollar on the value in other currencies of amounts appropriated for payments overseas. The amount of $4.4m sought for food aid is one such item. There is also a number of other particular items for which amounts of additional funds are sought. These include a payment of $2m to the Medical Research Endowment Fund and contributions to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and to the Howard Florey Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine, $500,000 each; $ 1.1m for the Department of Labor and Immigration for additional staff; $ 1.35m for the AustraUan Film Corporation; $723,000 for the Interim Committee for the Children's Commission, $650,000 for additional staff for members and senators; $500,000 for grants to eUgible organisations under the Handicapped Children (Assistance) Act; $537,000 for Expo 75 at Okinawa; $lm subsidies on ship contruction; and amounts of $6.2m and $5.3m for the AustraUan Capital Territory and Northern Territory Education Services respectively for additions to staff establishments and other increased costs. In BiU (No. 4) an amount of $ 18.57m is sought for the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission. This is required tofinancethe purchases of ships and to meet unforeseen changes in the amounts andtimingof commitments such as the salvaging of the 'Lake Illawarra' and the effects of the devaluation of the AustraUan doUar. An amount of Sim is also sought for expenditure under the River Murray Waters Act. It wUl be clear from the nature of the items included in these Bills that the granting of these appropriations could not be deferred until the time of the normal additional estimates. They need to be dealt with expeditiously. I commend the Bills to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Garland) adjourned.

The provisions in this Bill pubUc hospital treatment. are identical to those, relating to the supervision of health insurance organisations, which were included in the National Health Bill (No. 2) consistent with the recommendations of the 1974. Honourable members will recall that the Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance-the National Health BiU (No. 2) 1974 was passed Nimmo Committee-whic h was set up by the without amendment by this House on 3 Liberal-Country Party Government and with December 1974. However, during the debate on recommendations from the major investigation the BiU, the Opposition stated that it was not prepared to support the provisions in the Bill relating to the supervision of health insurance organisations. The BUI was amended by the Senate to delete those provisions. On 11 February 19751 moved on behalf of the Government that the amendments to the BUI be agreed to and the BiU was passed. The Government agreed to the amendments only because the Senate had agreed to other provisions in the BUI that are very important to the people of Australia. For example, the BUI authorised the provision of certain medical and surgical aids and appliances. The Government did not wish to allow the Senate's obstruction to prevent the benefits of those provisions from flowing to individuals as quickly as possible. However, as I regard the Senate's rejection of the provisions in the Bill relating to the supervision of health setback in the attempt by this Parliament to estabUsh the protection of people'srights.The people in this instance are the contributors to erly taken by some of the major inquiries into health insurance funds in this country, that consumers do not have representation on the bodies This responsibibty is all the greater because of the Government'sfinancialinvolvement in the private health insurance scheme. The scheme is supported by extremely generous direct and indirect government subsidies. The health insurance organisations could not have they continue to operate, except for the very generous support that comes from government sources. For instance, on average over 60 per medical insurance is met by direct subsidy by the Australian Government through the health scheme and by indirect subsidy from the same source tax concessions which Government.

It was recognised by the Liberal-Country Party Government-and it has caused concern to me-that where an organisation does not comply with the Act, or actions taken under the Act, ultimately the only course of action available is to cancel the registration of the organisation. This is a most unsatisof action to be taken in relation to the fund. Tbis factory punitive measure as the penalty falls on the contributor who is deprived of AustraUan Government benefits. Furthermore, deregistration would effectively end any control the Australian Government could exercise over reserves. This could be a most unhappy situation for contributors whose money, in fact, has been accumulated in reserves. It is a grave deficiency in the provisions of the manager or the organisation conducting the National Health Act at present that in an extreme case of a health insurance organisation flouting the reasonable directions of government, only the extremely punitive and unsatisfactory measure of deregistration is really avaUable to government. There is no alternative if the Government wishes to ensure that organisations properly discharge their responsibUities to contributors. FoUowing careful consideration of this situation, the Government has framed provisions similar to those in the Insurance Act to protect the interests of contributors. These provisions are compatible with the expressed intentions of the Liberal and Country parties when in office. This Government believes these to be proper measures which should be included in Federal legislation relating to aspects of private insurance to ensure that the administration of such insurance arrangements can be adequately supervised in the interests of contributors. I am placing these proposals before this ParUament again to give the Opposition a further opportunity to objectively consider these measures which in office they intended to propose. The BUI includes provisions to enable the Minfund in which there are large reserves to a fund ister, where he believes it to be in the contribuoperated by the same organisation in which tors' interests, to request an organisation to show there are inadequate reserves.

Alternatively, the Minisspecified matters relating to the affairs of the ter may direct the transfer of reserves in this way organisation. The BUI further provides that after after receiving a recommendation from the he has considered the report of the inspector, the Registration Committee. Minister may take such action consistent with the Act as he considers appropriate. This may include making an appUcation to the AustraUan special accounts operated within medical and Industrial Court for the appointment by the hospital funds by registered organisations. The Court of a judicial manager to manage the affairs special accounts arrangements are authorised by of the fund or for the fund to be wound up by the Court. Provision is included in the BUI to require a judicial manager, appointed by the Court, to conduct the affairs of the fund with the greatest economy consistent with efficiency and to report to the Court, as soon as possible, as to the course could include recommendations to return the fund to its former management; to transfer all or part of its affairs to another organisation with the consent of the other organisation; or that the fund be wound up. The BUI provides for funds to be wound up under the supervision of the Court upon an appUcation and in accordance with a scheme submitted by the Minister, the judicial fund. All schemes for winding up are to be subject to confirmation by the Court which may vary the schemes. The Court is required where practicable to effect the transfer of contributors to a fund to be wound up to a fund conducted by another registered organisation. As I stated earlier, the arrangements I have outlined are along the Unes of arrangements provided for in the Insurance Act and I beUeve that all contributors to health benefits funds would welcome their enactment as a positive step forward in the protection of their interests. The BUI further provides for the transfer of excess reserves between medical and hospital funds conducted by an organisation. This is an extension of a principle incorporated in the National Health Act by the Liberal-Country Party Government. The Act at present permits a registered organisation to transfer moneys from a medical benefits fund in one State to a medical benefits fund conducted by the organisation in another State. Similar provisions exist in relation to hospital benefits funds. The provision in the BUI will enable moneys to be transferred from a There is an allied provision that concerns the Division2 of Part VI of the National Health Act.

I would like to incorporate in Hansard the opinion of Mr Ron Withnall, an independent member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, concerning the amendments to this Bill. granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)The Independent Member for Port Darwin in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, Mr Ron Withnall, who is a Darwin lawyer, said today that he fully supported the Opposition amendments to the Darwin Reconstruction Bill. The amendments have the support of the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party of the Legislative Assembly. Mr Withnall said in Canberra that it had been alleged in the Senate debate on the bill that amendments 'were a move designed to embarrass the Federal Government. 'This allegation has been made by Senator McLaren and Senator Cavanagh, as well as Senator Gietzelt 'Nothing could be further from the truth. 'My support as an independent member for the amendments could not be described as inspired by political enmity. ""They are based on a genuine desire to improve the bill in areas where, I think, personally, it's defective. ' I know that my attitude has the full support of my electorate and in Darwin as a whole.

123,The Chairman ( Mr Scholes),"Is leavethe people of Darwin of having the right to object to planning proposals as they arise and also the provisions proposing a right of compensation, where persons suffer loss or damage as a result of the Commission s acdon or the actions of the Minister. 'In the interests of the people of Darwin, I sincerely urge the Government to accept the amendments, which will make the Bill, an effective and acceptable Act. from the Nightcliff Residents Action Committee concerning the overall power of the Minister for the Northern Territory contained in the clause. The telegram reads as follows: The Nightcliff Residents Action Committee considers there is an urgent need for a Darwin Reconstruction Commission but requests that the following amendments be made to the Bill now before the House: (1) That the Commission be autonomous and not be under the direct control of the Minister for the Northern Territory. There are several other clauses which will become relevant later on. I will read them now so that I will not have to mention them again. They are as follows: (2) That there be adequate provision for appeal against a decision of the Commission by those people affected by that decision. That motion was in effect moved and passed previously. The telegram continues: (3) That the provision for any current Act or ordinance affecting the Northern Territory to be changed on request be removed. The Bill should clearly and concisely spell out what Acts or ordinances it is felt will conflict with the operations of the Commission and deal with each specifically. That is signed by the Secretary. I have said all I intended to say on this clause. The Minister will realise that my opinion and the opinions of my colleagues-bot h in the Senate and in this chamber-ar e very strongly backed up by the citizens of Darwin. We consider it regrettable that the Government has not accepted this amendment and many of the other amendments. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (4.55)I want to comment briefly on 2 things without wishing in any way to be acrimonious. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Calder) referred to the independent member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, Mr Withnall. Apparently my definition of 'independent' is somewhat different from his. I mentioned last week that Mr were contrary to decisions of the Government or Withnall had sent a long telex-virtuall y a brief-to the Leader of the Australian Country Party( Mr Anthony), but he did not send a copy to me. Similarly, the document which the honourable member for the Northern Territory has just incorporated in Hansard was sent to the honourable member, which is all right, but the independent member did not send a copy to me. If a person is independent he would not be so biased as that; he would give a copy of the document to both sides in this chamber. However, Dr Letts did give me a copy which I have read and which I agreed should be incorporated in Hansard. There was no problem there. The basic issue involved relates to the ministerial power of direction. Obviously this is what the honourable member for the Northern Territory and some people in the Northern Territory object to. I have pointed out previously that the reconstruction of Darwin will be a tremendous job. It will involve large sums of taxpayers' money. In fact the Treasurer (Dr. J. F. Cairns) a short time ago introduced legislation to appropriate funds for this purpose. The Government believes that it, through the Minister and, obviously, this Parliament, has the responsibility to make certain that that money is spent effectively and efficiently in accordance with its policy, keeping in mind always that it is not the Commission's money and it is not private money-it is money belonging to the Government of Australia and provided by the people of Australia in taxes and through other types of revenue. As was pointed out last week, the previous Liberal-Country Party Government provided for ministrial direction of this type in some pieces of legislation which it introduced. This Parliament approved of ministerial direction of this kind with respect to the development of Albury Wodonga. It has been pointed out that the situation in respect of Albury-Wodonga is not the same as that of Darwin. I am thefirstto admit that. But if ministerial direction is all right for Albury-Wodonga, it most certainly should apply to Darwin. This Bill provides for the reconstruction of a devastated city over a period of 5 years. It provides for the welfare, over a short period, of thousands of people and it involves tremendous sums of money. The Government would argue that this is an excellent example of why there should be provision for ministerial direction. The Minister will be responsible to the Government. I think this has been overlooked. Nobody would expect me as the Minister for the Northern Territory to be making unilateral decisions which the Cabinet, or the policies given effect to by the Bill itself. In Parliament, of course, my actions are subjected to the scrutiny of members of Parliament. To take this power of direction from me and to place the responsibility not on a member of ParUament, not on a Minister, not on this ParUament or the Government but on an outside",49,Independent Supports Opposition Amendments To Darwin Bill
124,Mr Calderi Have Received A Telegram,"body I believe could not be in the best interests of the community and certainly would not be in the 'best interests of the taxpayers of Australia. It could be argued, of course, as occurred in the Senate, that the Commission could be given certain powers, and for the Commission to inform the Minister of what is taking place. Then, if the Minister does not agree with the Commission, the Governor General, the Government or Cabinet will decide the issue. To my mind what is proposed is an archaic, frustrating and delaying tactic. Certainly it was incorporated in the National Capital Development Commission Act which provided for the development of Canberra over a number of years-that is the principle underlying that argument-bu t the Government beheves that the Minister should have power of direction with respect to the reconstruction of Darwin because of the emergency of the situation and the tremendous amount of money involved. In the eyes of the Government it is quite clear that it is in the best interests of the people of the Northern Territory to get this job done quickly with a minimum of frustration and delay. The Goverament beheves that what it proposes is the best way to achieve that and, therefore, it rejects the amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (5.2)I move: That Senate Amendment No. 9 be disagreed to, but that, in place thereof, the following amendment be made: Clause 18, omit sub-clause (1), substitute the following plenty of reasons why a member of the Darwin sub-clause: '(1) The Commission shall consist of 8 members, namely(a) a Chairman; (b) a Deputy Chairman; (c) the General Manager; (d) 1 member nominated by the Legislative Assembly for the Territory; (e) 1 member nominated by the Corporation of the City of Darwin; (f) 1 member of the Darwin Citizens' Council; and (g) 2 other members. The Government cannot accept Senate amendment No. 9 which proposes the replacement of the General Manager on the Commission by one member of the Commission nominated by the Darwin Citizens' Council. However, the Government will agree to the addition to the Commission of one member from the Darwin Citizens'Council. thefirstplace? we cannot accept the Senate amendment proposing that one member be nominated by the Darwin Citizens' Council, but we will accept that the Commission can have one member from the Darwin Citizens' Council. In other words, it is a question of appointment. The Government sees the General Manager as the key member of the Commission based in Darwin. In fact, we believe that as the chief executive officer of the Commission he will not be able to hold any other position. He will be selected from applicants who apply to the open advertisements which have already been placed in the Press. The sole criterion for his appointment will be bis suitabihty for the job. It will be a full time position and the successful applicant will be based in Darwin. He will be active, at all times, with respect to the Commission. It is quite clear that he should be an integral part of that Commission. Because of the level at which he will be required to operate during the Ufe of the Commission there will be at alltimesa need for constant Uaison between the Commission and its executive. For these reasons the Government believes that the General Manager should be a member of the Commission with full votingrights.The Senate amendment proposes that the General Manager shaU not be appointed and, as I indicated earUer, substitutes for 'the General Manager' the words 'one member nominated by the Darwin Citizens' Council'. I wUl Usten to what the honourable member for the Northern Territory has to say about this matter. There are Citizens' CouncU should be appointed by the Governor General in the same way as are other members of the Commission. If one looks at the situation one can see that the Commission could be stacked. Even though nominations wUl be called throughout AustraUa it is not unheard of for such a thing to happen. We could reach the position where a person nominated by the Darwin Citizens' CouncU is a member of the Corporation of the City of Darwin or the Legislative Assembly and this, of course, could upset the balance of the Commission. The principal objective is to advertise widely in an accepted fashion. The intention is to have the Governor General appoint a person from the CouncU to the Commission. The overall objective is to give the Commission as much balance as possible. I do not want to say anything more than that. It does seem quite clear to me that the General member of the Commission. He wUl, of course,",50,Independent Supports Opposition Amendments To Darwin Bill

It was proposed that the Commission would comprise 2 members from private enterprise, 4 government servants and a Chairman. Therefore our thinking was to try to level up the composition of the membership so as to avoid establishing a great bureaucratic body. That is why the amendment was introduced in the Senate. However, we do not want to hold up the establishment of the Commission. I have just returned from Darwin where I got the message loud and clear that the citizens are calling for the Commission to get into action although they are asking for various amendments to be accepted. We are pleased that a member of the Darwin Citizens' Council will be on the Commission. We believe that if members are appointed by the Governor General the Commission, to use the Minister's own words, could be stacked. So we will eagerly wait to see exactly which people are appointed to the Commission. The Majority Leader in the Legislative Assembly suggested that a member of the Darwin Citizens' Council should be represented on the Commission. Although a member of the Council was to be represented on the Commission in an observer capacity, I think it is a good move that he is to be a member of the Commission. One does not know at this time who will be the Deputy Chairman of the Commission. It could well be that he will be a civil servant. One has to bear in mind that if he is, and if he is living in Darwin, he will be under the almost direct instruction of his Minister. That was our thinking on this clause. If the amendment is as printed we have no objection to it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for That Senate amendments Nos 10 and 14 be disagreed to. Amendments Nos 10 and 14 are consequential Question resolved in the affirmative. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for That Senate amendment No. 13 be disagreed to, but that, Clause 19Page 7, line 35, omit '(d) or (e)', substitute '(d), (e) or (f)'. Page 7, line 38, omit '(0', substitute '(g)'. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Calder) will notice that it is proposed to add paragraph (g) to the Bill. One has to be a mathematical genius to work out what is involved. But the consequential amendment has been put forward simply to adjust the original Bill and to take into account the changed order of the membership of the Commission. The Commission, as a result of my amendment No. 9, will not also consist of a member of the Darwin Citizens' Council, which is set down in paragraph (f) and '2 other members', which is set out in paragraph (g).

All it boUs down to is that the honourable member for Griffith is deUberately frustrating and delaying this BUI again. We reject Senate amendment No. 13. We simply wish to amend clause 19 by omitting '(d) or (e)' and substituting '(d), (e) or (f)' and by omitting '(f)' and substituting '(g)'. Paragraph (d) refers to one member nominated by the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory. Paragraph (e) refers to one member nominated by the Corporation of the City of Darwin and paragraph (f) refers to one member of the Darwin Citizens' CouncU. This is a consequential amendment to the amendments which were accepted by the chamber a few minutes ago. It is simply a matter of re-arranging the actual lettering in the clause to take account of the inclusion of One member of the Darwin Citizens' CouncU on the Commission. Question resolved in the affirmative. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (5.19)I move: That Senate amendment No. IS be disagreed to, but that, in place thereof, the following amendment be made: Clause 24, omit '(d) or (e)', substitute '(d), (e) or (f)'. Again this is simply a re-arrangement of the lettering in the clause and, ofcourse, it makes provision for one more member on the Commission. It is a consequential amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (5.20)I move: That Senate amendment No. 16 be disagreed to, but that, in place thereof, the following amendment be made: Clause 24, omit'(e) or (f)', substitute '(e), (0 or (g)'. We reject the Senate amendment in view of what happened to clause 18. We seek the inclusion in clause 24 of paragraph (g) which provides that the Governor General may terminate appointments as outUned in the amended clause. Again it is a consequential amendment with direct relevance to clause 18. Question resolved in the affirmative. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for Northern Territory) (5.21)I move: That amendments Nos 18 to 33 be disagreed to. Many of these are reaUy relevant to whether or not the General Manager is a member of the Commission. If he is a member of the Commission, as the Government insists, then clearly he should be appointed by the Governor General as are part-time members of the Commission and clearly those matters which are relevant to his terms and conditions of appointment should be within the purview of the Governor General and governed by the Remuneration Tribunal, as in the case of other members of the Commission.

144,Dr Patterson,"That interlude has interwhich have been expressed in the Senate.' As I have already explained, if the Governor General appoints the General Manager, naturally the terms and conditions will be laid down by the Governor General in the same way as applies to other members of the Commission. know that these are all consequential amendments but they aretiedup with the feelings of the people of the Northern Territory and that is why we put them forward. Once again they were consequential upon the original alteration made to clause 18 of the Bill. We do not object to the amendments. Question resolved in the affirmative. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (5.23)I move: That the following additional amendment be made: Clause 61, omit paragraph (e), insert the following paragraph: ""(e) making provision for and in relation to reviews and appeals (including appeals to the courts of the Territory) in respect of matters arising under this Act or the regulations; and"". The Government agrees that in this legislation there should be arightof appeal in appropriate cases. Clause 61 (1) (e) of the Bill as it stands makes provision for appeals in respect of matters arising under the regulations. I stress that it is specificallytiedto the regulations. We accept the argument that it is only fair that anything done under this proposed Act which may cause some injustice should be subject to appeal. In the Bill as it stands the clause refers only to regulations and not to provisions in the Act. What this amendment does is widen the appeal provisions to cover not only matters arising under the regulations but also under the Act. Honourable senators who have expressed concern that the Bill does not make it mandatory on the Governor General to make regulations will be aware that this would be inappropriate as I have mentioned but in my capacity as Minister for the Northern Territory I have undertaken to have regulations prepared as a matter of urgency to provide for appeals in respect of matters arising under the ActI stress the words 'under the Act'-and regulations which should be subject to such a process. I mention also that it is my intention to ask the Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) to make the necessary arrangements to have the Darwin Reconstruction Commission come within the terms of the proposed ombudsman Bill itself. It is hoped that, in due course, this Commission also will be subject to the provisions of the legislation relating to administrative tribunals. What has happened now is that there are provisions for appeals in the Bill. Previously these appeal provisions weretiedspecifically to regulations. Now they will be subject to all the provisions of the Act itself, including the regulations. As I say, the Government believes and agrees that there should be the right of appeal in appropriate cases. Therefore, I have moved accordingly. (5.26)-There should be arightof appeal. The people of Darwin have called for this. I am glad to see that the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) has recognised the need for this provision and it has been included in the legislation. The Minister mentioned that it was right that the Governor General should be able to make regulations. The Minister has in hand the preparation of theseregulations.I make the point that, whilst the centre of responsibility is in Canberra, by this provision a degree of responsibility is removed from the Northern Territory itself. I am thinking specifically of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. One sub-clause of this clause points very strongly to that end. It is a pity that the newly elected Legislative Assembly has not been granted more authority. If anyone is to make laws for the Northern Territory, I think that the members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly should be vitally concerned in the matter. Whilst not opposing the amendment, I make it clear that we in the Territory think that our Assembly should have been given more authority and more say in this whole matter. Amendment agreed to. Resolutions reported; report adopted. Motion (by Dr Patterson) agreed to: That Mr Luchetti, Mr Berinson and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to amendments Nos 5, 10, 14 and 18 to 33 of the Senate. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (5.28)-On behalf of the Committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to the amendments of the Senate, I bring up such reasons which are being circulated to honourable members. Those reasons are: Reasons for disagreeing to Senate Amendment No. 5. Because this Amendment substitutes for a Ministerial power of direction (formerly Clause9 of the Bill) over the Commission an archaic device with built in delay taken from the National Capital Development Commission Act 1957",53,Independent Supports Opposition Amendments To Darwin Bill
145,Mr Calder (Northern Territory) (5.22),I,54,Independent Supports Opposition Amendments To Darwin Bill
146,Mr Calder (Northern Territory),"whereby disputes between the Commission and the Minister may be determined by Order of the Governor General. The reconstruction of Darwin is a task of enormous magnitude involving tremendous Government expenditure and responsibility. It is only consistent with this that the Government through the Minister, has the right to intervene if necessary in the exercise of the grave responsibilities vested in the Commission The Amendment is not acceptable to the Government. It is the wish of the Government that Clause9 of the original Bill be restored. Reasons for disagreeing to Senate Amendments Nos 10 and 14. Because these Amendments were consequential upon acceptance of Senate Amendment No. 9 which has been disagreed to by the House and the Amendments are no longer relevant. Reasons for disagreeing to Senate Amendments Nos 18 to 33. Because these Amendments are relevant to whether or not the General Manager is a member of the Commission. If he is a member of the Commission as the Government insist, clearly then he should be appointed, as are the part time members of the Commission, by the Governor General. Clearly also those matters which are relevant to his terms and conditions of appointment should be within the purview of the Governor General, the Minister and the Remuneration Tribunal as the case may be. The Government does not agree to these Amendments. I move: That the Committee's reasons be adopted. (5.30)-Whil e not disagreeing with these reasons, I feel that I must speak once again on behalf of the people of the Northern Territory with regard to Senate Amendment No. 5. The legislation proposes to give the Minister an overall power over the Commission. There has been specific demand for this power not to be given. by Mr Enderby: Under pressure of numbers, we have bowed to what the Government proposes. The Senate's That the Bill be now read a second time. amendment seeks to substitute for a ministerial power of direction over the Commission-that is, siona device to delay which is taken from the National Capital Development Commission Act 1957. It is not really an archaic device; it is only would 18 years old. As I said earlier in the debate, the athestatement supreme control approach in the Bill is far more not be proceeded with forthwith. archaic than the provision now sought. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for bate today the Corporations and Securities Northern Development and Minister for the Industry BiU 1975 amounts in the view of the Northern Territory) (5.31)-in replyI again Opposition Parties to a complete contempt of emphasise the point that this Government and this Parliament. It represents a most disgraceful Liberal-Country Party governments on many indulgence by any government in the handling of occasions gave power of ministerial direction as a BUI which has such far reaching impUcations is proposed in this legislation. It would be unfor the AustraUan community. It is reflective of thinkable with respect to the emergency situation the extent of that indulgence that the Attorneyin Darwin if the Darwin Reconstruction ComGeneral( Mr Enderby) should have conveyed to mission Bill were to have provision for less power my office, only one hour ago or thereabouts, a of direction for the ParUament, the Government or the Minister than that found in other legislation. As I have said before, the power of ministerial direction does not mean that I wUl make unUateral decisions which wiU be contrary to the wishes of the Government or Government policy. Above all, I am subject to cross-examination . in this ParUament. I beUeve that there are plenty of safeguards in the legislation. Overall, the Government wants to get on with this job of rebuUdirig Darwin as quickly and as efficiently as possible, taking into account the wishes of the people of Darwin and sound common sense. It is quite clear to some of the people who knew Darwin that there wUl be differences with respect to where some housing settlements wUl be located. Obviously we will not build or rebuild houses in danger areas which are subject totidalwave or storm surge in the event of cyclonic disturbances. It is within the overall provisions with respect to good planning and good common sense that the Darwin Reconstruction Commission wiU operate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Motion (by Dr Patterson) agreed to: That in the message returning the Darwin Reconstruction Bill 1975 to the Senate, the Senate be requested to reconsider the Bill in respect of the amendment made by the House of Representatives to clause 61.

Orders should be suspended is so that the Opposition can complain that it is not ready to proceed, the opportunity for that is in the second reading debate. It is not a reason for raising the matter on a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. on that score. of the Chair, Mr Speaker. As I was endeavouring to make clear to the Attorney-General, the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges have indicated that their members are greatly concerned that the debate on this Bill has been brought forward to this week and indeed at very short notice. The organisation goes on in the telegram which I mentioned, to say this: We fear that neither members of your Government or of the Opposition, or even your new Attorney-General, can yet be in a position to take part in an informed debate on what is a major and complex piece of legislation. The Stock Exchanges late last week submitted lengthy comments on the Bill to the Attorney-General's Depanment but it would seem that neither the Departmental officers or the AttorneyHouse should now attend; it should look at its' General himself will have yet had time to consider our detailed proposals. We also understand that various other interested parties have not yet completed their submissions. Therefore, we earnestly request that debate be deferred until last week. The Orders of the Day provide for it to Parliament can be better informed. Otherwise attempts by your Government to improve business confidence can only be seriously damagedThe Institute of Directors has cogently and compellingly expressed the same view. It also has sought opportunity for consultation with the Attorney-General and with officers of his Department. The Australian Chamber of Manufactures said this to the Government: Deeply concernedMr BerinsonI rise on a point of order, Mr House because it would seem perfectly clear that Speaker. We are really reaching a stage of farce with the introduction of this matter. I think the best way of demonstrating it is to ask: What could possibly be left to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to say if the House did agree to the suspension of Standing Orders? He is saying everything now for which he is seeking an opportunity to speak later. I think that some semblance of moderation has to be shown on his part as well as that of other members of the House. of the Bill before me. It would be difficult for me to make a decision in regard to whether the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is touching the subject matter or is just reading out protests from some organisations. I ask the honourable gentleman to keep to the reason why Standing Orders should be suspended. that the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders has been moved, in order that the House should have an adequate opportunity to debate this vital legislation in a meaningful fashion. We do not seek undue delay. We would be happy to debate this legislation during thefirstweek after the forthcoming parliamentary recess. If the Attorney-General insists on pressuring the legislation through the HouseI believe he will do a grave disservice to the objectives of the Bill which he has introduced. time has expired. Is the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders seconded? motion. I say at once, Mr Speaker, that you have my firm assurance that in no way will I attempt either in substance or, indeed, in a peripheral fashion to deal with the merits of the legislation which is in contemplation before this House. It is not the merit of the legislation to which this own authority. The second reading speech on this Bill was given in this House on Thursday of pass through all stages by this evening. I repeat: The second reading speech on this Bill was given on Thursday of last week and the Orders of the Day provide for it to pass through all stages by today. Without doubt, this is the most substantial piece of legislation that has been introduced in a considerable period of time. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lynch) is thoroughly justified in seeking to make a statement to the some people in the House need informing of the immensity of the legislation in prospect, of the technicaUty of it, and of the refusal on the part of the Government to listen to and to analyse submissions made to it by people with interest in it. It has always been a great and traditional habit of this Parliament to seek to observe people who have a point of view on legislation. Of course, utlimately the responsibility of approving or disapproving of legislation rests upon those of us who sit in this chamber. To fail to listen to views is grievous enough, but to fail to listen to views after having given the most specific undertakings to listen to those views I can only describe as manifestly wicked.",56,Corporations And Securities Industry Bill 1975

160,Mr Killen (Moreton) (5.45),"I second theI move from that. The Prime Mmister( Mr AustraUa needs legislation of this sort to protect Whitlam) in this House today said-no t on a matter of legislation so I may advert to it-that governments are formed in this House. That is a proposition with which I find myself in wholehearted agreement. Governments are formed in this House. That is a stronger reason for this House to maintain its own authority. The whisperings of the Minister for Services and Property( Mr Daly) to the effect that this Bill has been before another place since September last year makes not the slightest impression upon me. Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) who interjects with such readiness: What if the other place, the Senate, had so amended a Bill as to make it completely and utterly different from a Bill that went through this House? I ask the honourable gentleman merely to reflect upon that circumstance. Over a long period oftimenow, I have seen the authority of this chamber being washed awaydrip by drip, the constant, continuing erosion. Yet today the Attorney-General-the parens pater of the country, the man who should stand and speak to defend the views, therightsand the liberties of every subject in this country without fear and without favour-lend s the weight of his eminent office and its authority to such a contemptible move as to expect this House of Parliament to deal with this measure in such a short time. It is a disgrace to Parliament and the sooner the people of the country get an understanding of that fact the better. General) (5.49)-Perhaps it was predictable that members of the Opposition would take such action as they have taken because we know they speak for their clients-w e know they speak for vested interests in this country. We know the social mischief that was revealed in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange-the Rae Committee. That report, which was presented towards the middle of last year, called for the situation to be put right, as soon as possible. In fact, a recommendation of the Rae Committee report was that a body with the powers of a securities and exchange Commission be set up immediately. It is now 9 months later. May I tell honourable members some aspects they may have overlooked. The proposal to have legislation of this sort can be traced back at least as far as the policy speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) in December 1972. It was repeated in the policy speech of March and April 1974. How much time does the Opposition need to reflect on the fact that Australian investors? There never has been a social situation in AustraUa crying out more for reform. Consequently it has been studied deeply with the idea of it being reformed and examined with an intensity rarely given to legislation. The Rae Committee report, presented last year, encompasses many volumes. On5 December, almost 3 months ago, the then Attorney-General introduced this measure into the Senate. Do we have to assume that members of the Liberal Party who are senators do not speak to members of the Liberal Party who are members of the House of Representatives? Are we asked to believe that honourable members opposite are not sufficiendy interested to go to the Senate side of this one buUding and get a copy of the BUI? It was a pubUc statement. Three months ago the BUI was in the Senate, so members opposite have had 3 months to study it. The explanatory memorandum, which they complain they have not had time to read, has been available for 3 months. Are they saying that they are too lazy or are lacking in interest in the social scandal that was revealed by the Rae Committee reporta committee chaired by a member of their own Party? Are they telling us that they are so lacking in interest and concern for Australia's welfareMr GarlandI rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. As you know, the motion calls for so much of the Standing Orders to be suspended as would permit the Deputy Leader of the Opposition making a statement. I submit that the Attorney-General is not actually speaking to the motion and has not done so since he rose. Attorney-General was wandering a httle from the motion before the Chair. I ask the Attorney General to confine his remarks to reasons why the Standing Orders should not be suspended. why Standing Orders should not be suspended. These reasons should be obvious to honourable members. Opposition members have had almost 3 years to think about this matter. They have had since the middle of last year to know that there has been a crying demand for the situation to be put right. They have known of this BUI as a concrete proposal since the then Attorney-General introduced the measure in the Senate on 5 December, nearly 3 months ago. How much time do they want? Are we driven to the view that their credibiUty is in issue?",57,Corporations And Securities Industry Bill 1975

The opportunity has been given over move the motion for the suspension of Standing and over again to Liberal Party and Country Orders.

I am right. Their own colleagues in the Senate said so, questioning their credibility. In other words, the and said so with a clear and loud voice. Now point that I am trying to make is that when one yielding to pressure, predictably as I said, memlistens to the arguments put forward by the 2 bers opposite say: 'No, this in not thetime;give speakers from the Liberal Party one also has to us moretime;slow down; stop; do not effect this have regard to their motives.

One looks for Moreton( Mr Kilien) made which can be also at the way in which honourable members misleading. He referred to Orders of the Day. He opposite have behaved, ever since this Governsaid that all the stages of this Bill are listed.

They claim that this Bill should not be proceeded with now. That is the question at issue. Yet they oppose everything. If the inference to be drawn is that they oppose measures because they protect people, vested interests, then this House is certainly entitled to take that into account when it considers why they choose now to move for the suspension of Standing Orders and not have this Bill come on for debate. I shall just go over some of the outstanding points. This Bill was referred to in the policy speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) in December 1972-h e said that the Government would be introducing legislation of this sort-and it was repeated in his poucy speech of March 1974. The social mischief which exists and which has to be put right has been considered by many of the State governments, which have set up corporate affairs commissions. They were aware of the situation.

177,Mr Lynch (Flinders) (8.10),"The CorporAustralian capital market. It has not avoided the mistakes of similar legislation such as that in the United States of America-in spite of some 40 years experience to draw on. To give but one example, the Commission proposed by this Bill must take at least 44 days from the recognition of a need to make a rule until that rule becomes effective. Bearing in mind the speed with which the 'corporate crooks' can and do operate, 44 days is time enough for these people to clean up and reach the beaches of Rio de Janeiro. The Bill, in respect of the authority it provides to the Commission, falls effectively between 2 stools. It would prevent the Commission from acting quickly and decisively when that is required, and permits the Commission to act without any opportunity for review by an aggrieved party. This Bill fails to achieve what had previously appeared to be, to parties on all sides, an agreed objective. It gives relatively novel and relatively unbridled power to an Attorney-General to change, by regulation, the whole economic and social structure of corporations. But it does little to provide for the objective of the fair and efficient operation of the capital markets and the protection of Australian investors. The Opposition believes that this Bill must be given further consideration, that it must be made to achieve those objectives which are surely in this House beyond dispute. In its present form it is not atypical of the previous legislative reforms attempted by the former Attorney-General. The House willrecallthe 109 amendments moved by that gendeman in his third attempt to introduce the Trade Practices Act. There is a further matter of major concern to the Opposition Parties. This Bill of 284 clauses and 8 schedules is, without question, complex and far reaching. As I indicated during the procedural motion in the House late this afternoon, the passage of this Bill through the House at this time is an abuse of Parliament. The decision to bring the Bill on for debate today is simply a political manoeuvre on the part of the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam). Because no effective opportunity has been provided to the Opposition Parties to examine the Bill, to undertake consultations with the many industry groups who are the subject of its impact, and to examine the suf> missions which the Opposition Parties and the Government are now receiving, we are not in a position to move amendments during the Committee stage of the debate. It is therefore our intention to use the debate in Committee and at the second reading stage to outline our general attitude towards the regulation of the securities industry and to indicate our broad reservations of this far reaching legislation. I take this opportunity, however, to foreshadow our intention to put down a detailed view during the Senate's consideration of the Bill. While we support the general objectives of this legislation it will not be accepted by the Opposition Parties in its present form. As previously mentioned, the principal factor leading up to this Bill was undoubtedly the work of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, appointed on 19 March 1970 and which reported on 18 July 1974. The Committee's report made it clear that legislation was required 'on the grounds of fairness and commercial morality, and in the interests of economic efficiency.' That view was fully substantiated by the evidence contained in the report. It is a matter of the utmost concern that the abuses, examples of which were clearly set out in the report, should have taken place. It demonstrates that no government can presume that a satisfactory standard of commercial conduct will take place in the absence of some form of government supervision to support the existing, but necessarily limited, operation of self-regulation. The report highlighted a totally unacceptable level of commercial acquisitiveness combined with an indefensible abrogation of ethical and moral responsibility. The Committee did not equivocate in stating its view that exploitation of the investor would continue in the absence of effective regulatory organisation. In this regard the Committee concluded as follows: Government in Australia would be irresponsible if it were not to up-grade substantially regulatory procedures so as to guard against repetition of fraud, abuse and incompetence on the scale of recent years. I believe that there is no disagreement between the Parties within this House, or within the AustraUan security industry, as to the need for effective Federal legislation in thisfield.Legislation designed to control the industry must be assiduous in 2 important respects. First, it must prevent the exploitation of the individual investor. In so doing it must enable speedy action to investigate, reveal and outlaw the everchanging forms of abuse and manipulation. Second, it must improve rather than impede the efficient functioning of AustraUa's capital market. AustraUa's long-term economic growth depends significantly on increasing the amount and the efficiency of capital-in other words, on increasing the efficiency of investment. The important function of any stock market is to mobUise capital for investment.

Part II of the Bill The Committee rejected also the concept of a 'ever changing circumstances and standards'. Clause 284 of the Bill authorises the to make regulations governsuch as a dealer's to his held by dealer's directors and so on. Under clause 36 (2) and (3), the general policy and this, when combined with the paramountcy of regulations over rules, raises the question where power really lies under this Bill. Henry VIII provision. In fact, clause 59 (4) enables the Governor General to make regulations covering a stock exchange which are to have effect 'notwithstanding anything contained in the constituent documents of the registered stock exchange or in the rules of the Commission itself. Regulations may be made in relation to any matter relating to the constitution of a registered stock exchange or of its members or of other persons who are permitted to trade in securities or the stock market. The Bill provides effectively that a stock exchange can be closed down by the Commission for 21 days, and by the Governor General indefinitely. Particular securities can also have deahngs in those securities suspended. The Governor General's power is exercisable where 'he considers it necessary or desirable to do so for the protection of persons buying or selling securities or in the interests of the pubhc'. To reiterate, it seems quite unreasonable that the Governor General-in effect, the Attorney General-woul d be provided with a basic power of this type. The Government should confine itself to exercising its power over the industry through the Commission, members of which are to be accepted as those with expertise in the area, and not directly as also evidenced in clause 284. Tbe Commission is to be authorised to make rules in respect of any matter where the Governor General may make regulations. But, as clause 59 (3) makes clear, there is no substantive restriction to the ambit of the Commission's rule-making capacity. Clause 59 (3) states that the Commission may make rules: 'in relation to any matter relating to the constitution of the stock exchange or the activities or conduct of the stock exchange or of its members or of other persons who are permitted to trade in securities on the stock market. . . .' Whilst recognising that a rule-making authority must be given power to ensure effective and speedy regulatory action by a Commission, there is no justification in our view for such powers to be unlimited in duration; not subject to appeal; and given also to the executive Government upon an equally unhmited basis as to duration and ambit. and typical of this Government. They should be essentially emergency powers to ensure that obvious or reasonably suspected abuses and malpractices can be immediately prevented whilst the matter is further considered, debated and, if then desired, provided for by way of legislative amendment or statutory regulation. The Bill is seriously deficient in this regard. The Commission should also, after special study and hearings, be able to make recommendations for government action. The Commission's power should be to close the gate before the horses get out. Whether they should be allowed out is then a matter for full consideration and, if necessary a matter for legislation. The Bill draws heavily upon American experience in legislation of similar character. But, although the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States is provided with wide rule-making power, in practice almost all its powers, other than those relating to agency organisation procedure or practice, are subject to pubhc hearings. The Australian Commission is to be empowered to obtain information, documents and evidence without any limitation. This is made clear by clauses 263 and 281. Notwithstanding the Commission's virtually unhmited powers to make rules and to obtain information the Government has provided a quite unsatisfactory opportunity for appeals against its decisions. In this regard I quote clause 279: Except as provided by this Act. . . a decision of the Commission shall not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called into question, or be subject to prohibition, mandamus, certiorari or injunction, in any court on any account whatever. This Clause would make decisions of the Commission closed to judicial appeal except according to the original jurisdiction of the High Court which is inviolate, in the absence of a referendum, because of section 75 of the Constitution. In contrast, allfinalorders of the American Securities and Exchange Commission are subject to judicial review on petition of an aggrieved party in an appropriate United States Court of Appeal. The exceptions provided by the Act are minimal. Sub-clauses (7) and (8) of clause 65 permit an appeal to the proposed Administrative Appeals Tribunal in respect of the suspension of a stock exchange by the Commission. Clause 81 provides a similarrightin respect of a refusal by the Commission to grant a licence. But, no information about the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has been foreshadowed or provided by the Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) or by this Government. Apparently, that tribunal is to be subject of enactment by separate legislation. The question must therefore be asked why the Bill is",61,Pairs

It is the Opposition'sfirmview that the degree and form of discretion to be conferred on the Commission, combined with an almost complete absence of any appeal mechanism, is unacceptable. I want to make it perfectly clear that we hold no objection to the vesting of strong powers in the Commission. We on this side of the House would not agree with legislation which might prove to be ineffectual or open to avoidance as is this Bill which the Attorney-General has brought down. For example, it is open to doubt-and I shall invite the Attorney-General's view on this severe penalties, which are imposed in the exduring the Committee debate-that it could be tremely rare cases of someone being convicted of held to apply, as drawn, to mineral exploration corporate or securities industry crime have not companies, so heavily involved in past abuses.

We do not support the field. For years the stock exchanges, accounting, re-introduction of the procedure of a Comlegal and other associated bodies have expressed mission having the sole and unappealable right their concern over the multiplicity of duplication to conduct its hearings behind closed doors of against the will of the person concerned in the Australia. inquiry. Clause 59 would enable a government to multiplicity and duplication. Rather than simdirect the Commission in turn to direct the stock plify and reduce the costs on capital formation exchanges to take particular regulatory action. A rule so made is then not subject to disallowance by Parliament which it would be if made by way of normal regulation. This clause would allow the total negation of the normal democratic process. This appears to us to open the door to unreviewable despotism in relation to the whole role and structure of the Corporation in society and I personally regard that clause as unacceptable. There is power, unappealable and of unlimited duration for the Government to suspend, for any reason of alleged public interest, all the stock exchanges of Australia. The Bill does nothing to ensure that disclosure by corporations and disclosures of malpractices and abuses identified by the Commission are the paramount protection of the Australian investor. It is surely preferable for abuses to be prevented through proper disclosure provisions rather than for actions to be initiated after those abuses have taken place. The existing approach of penalties, even succeeded. This Bill does little more than stiffen Clause 267 provides the Commission with to formal directors' meetings the real discussion will take place at informal meetings of the board. Finally, I point out that the Government's apnothing to obviate the burden of the great inefficiencies of a multiplicity activities covering this legislation regulating public companies in This complaint was endorsed by the Senate Committee yet this Bill will add to that and corporate operation it will seriously increase the burden. AustraUa wiU then have 9 Acts or ordinances providing company law and 5 Acts providing securities industries law, together with numerous other pieces of legislation such as the Companies (Foreign Takeovers) Act which all affect corporate and capital activity. It is for this reason that I move the amendment which has been foreshadowed in my name on behalf of the Opposition Parties and with the leave of the Attorney-General, who is at the table, I seek leave to have the amendment incorporated in the Hansard record. no objection, leave is granted. (The amendment read as follows)That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'While strongly supporting the creation of a national regulatory authority to supervise the functioning of the securities industry with a view to increasyear which suggested that such an argument ing efficiency and avoiding abuses in that industry, the House (1) deplores the failure of the Government to consider the views of the States, company organisations and the securities industry and the decision to force the Bill through the House contrary to previous assurances, and (2) is of the opinion that the BUI: (a) will not permit the speedy and effective prevention of malpractices within the securities industry; (b) will involve confusion, increased costs and the creation of a massive administrative bureaucracy; (c) will not lead to an improved functioning of Australia's securities markets necessary to increase real capital formation and to allocate resources efficiently among competing demands for capital; and (d) relies too heavily on discretionary powers, rules and regulations and denies effective rights of appeal.' Mr GarlandI second the amendment and reserve my right to speak. pliment Mr Justice Murphy, the Attorney General, and the Government for the introduction of this comprehensive Corporations and Securities Industry BiU. This BUI, as it stands, has the effect of bringing under one jurisdictionhonourable member should use the term 'Senator Murphy' when he was the Attorney-General and not Mr Justice Murphy. effect of bringing under one jurisdiction control of stock markets and stock exchanges, dealers in securities, accounts and audit of accounts of registered companies, raising of moneys from the pubUc involving scrutiny of prospectuses and trust deeds as regards the issue of shares, debentures and units in unit trust funds, and the disclosure of substantial shareholdings and takeovers of registered corporations. Surely there is not one member of this House who would question the need for this BUI. The need for this type of comprehensive legislation has been deeply considered and amply demonstrated, not only by the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange but also by British governments of both Tory and Labour persuasions and by the Government of the United States as far back as 1930. They, like us, were faced with individuals who literally made themselves millionaires through insider trading and have now taken or are taking the appropriate steps to stop such noxious practices. If any honourable member desires to oppose this BUI on the grounds of Statesrightsthen I refer that member to the leading article in the 'Financial Review' in July last would be 'the last refuge of scoundrels'. Indeed, the question of leaving regulatory machinery to the States appears to have been dealt a death blow since the Senate Select Committee demonstrated the possibility of setting up a brokers head office in one State with a branch office in another whereby the activities of the branch office would faU outside the jurisdiction of the State in which it operated and be unknown to the State authorities to which it was legally answerable. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lynch) referred to an authoritarian structure in the BUI. Where authoritative control is in fact fragmented, thieves can have a picnic. They have had a harvest for 23 years. It is essential that the Corporations and Exchange Commission which this BUI seeks to set up shall have the powers to function in the manner intended, both as to efficiency and speed. The penalties provided in the BiU are considerable but there are stUl a large number of offences involving companies and officers of companies which are outside the ambit of the present BUI. Some of these, however, are currently found in the existing provisions of the State company and crirrunal law legislation. As the BUI now stands there wUl be considerable overlapping of functions. In particular, there will be some overlapping of the existing State criminal laws relating to offences by directors and officers of companies. For example, I refer to the South Australian Criminal Law Consolidation Act.

The stock exchanges had drawn up and supposedly were working to their own rules and regulations which, if they had been adhered to, would at least have pre-empted some of the shocks that their members received from the Senate Committee report on the industry, but they faded to do so. Not only in one telling incident was the desire to poUce themselves apparently absent, but also they had neither the time nor the powers necessary to perform such a function. Where deficiencies were suspected explanations were called for but books unfortunately were not examined. Nor are the powers avaUable to the stock exchange committees to examine the records of persons and companies who are not members. The Companies Act, under Part 6A, enables an officer to be appointed to a company to inspect its books, correspondence and documents where fraud or misdemeanour are suspected. This authority was instrumental in bringing to Ught the activities of the Korman group of companies. The Commission to be set up under this legislation wUl have those powers under clauses 63 (2), 263 and 100. Does anybody suggest that if they are authoritarian they are not justified? There is no other method by which the job required can be done. There is no other way, for instance, to ascertain that a client's money is paid into a dealer's trust account on the next day after receipt that the banks are open for business if on that date securities owing to that cUent are not deUverable. Even though the stock exchange Committees must now abdicate their roles asfinalarbiters in their industry, they should remain the immediate watch-dogs who bark on suspicion. The Senate Select Committee has performed a service in outlining an almost hour by hour account on insider trading in the Poseidon affair. We ought to have a look at that shocking scandal. Mr Burrill, senior consulting geologist for Poseidon, informed the Senate Select Committee that on 24 September 1969 shortly after 9 a.m. he saw a change of coloration coming out of the P.H.2 drill-hole. This is what he said: I am almost certain I could see nickel sulphides in it. I Poseidon's directors received $4,000 to apcould see copper sulphides very clearly. That same afternoon Mr BurriU's associate, Jones,flewto Adelaide and saw Shierlaw. On 25 September Shierlaw bought approximately 29 000 Poseidon shares for companies in which he had a major interest, for BurriU's similar interests and for Jones. In respose to a query from the Adelaide Stock Exchange on 25 September at I p.m. the Poseidon directors informed that exchange: 'No assay results are avaUable. The Board is unable to explain the sharp increases in the price of shares.' After this cynical announcement and throughout the following day Shierlaw and the geologists continued to buy Poseidon shares. Both the gains and the losses involved by buyers and sellers on those 2 days were substantial. An inspection of the books of companies simUiary situated after the event would betimeconsuming and expensive and an attempt to right any wrongs corrunitted even more so. The Commission to be set up under this Bill wUl be given the power to establish stock exchange rules. I commend to the Attorney General( Mr Enderby) the functions of the New York Stock Exchange to establish a set of norms both as to price and volumefluctuationsin each listed security and to suspend trading in any shares for 24 hours at any time that either of those norms are exceeded or until explanatory information is received and published. Let us have a look at how such a rule would have operated had it in fact been in operation at the time of the Poseidon incident. The closing price on 24 September 1969 for Poseidon shares was $1.12. On 25 September, under the influence of Shierlaw's heavy purchasing, the closing price was $1.65, a rise of 47 per cent. On Friday, 26 September, and with Shierlaw a purchaser throughout the day, the shares rose to $1.94, 73 per cent above the previous Wednesday's price. Had the New York rule which I am advocating been operative and had the trip-point to activate the rule been set at a generous 15 per cent there would have been no sales of Poseidon shares above $1.29 on 25 September. Assuming that an unsuspecting stock exchange had accepted the directors' statement and reUsted the shares on 26 September the trip-point would again have been activated at $1.48. The sins of Poseidon were essentially insider trading carried on by servants of the company and the public investor on the basis of knowledge that was almost exclusively theirs and was not avaUable to sellers. The directors were being paid by the company, that is, by the shareholders, for their services as also were the geologists. In the year to 30 June 1969 portion between themselves. I wrote on 7 February to the State Attorney General foUowing a declaration by the Adelaide Stock Exchange that Poseidon-jus t look at the load of conspiracy in Poseidon-accumulate d about $1.4m. They were fined $2,000 by the Adelaide Stock Echange and suspended for 6 months. Yet a girl from my area who took a record from a music shop spent a month in the Windanna remand home. Now, where is the sense of justice? I asked that question of the Attorney-General in South AustraUa. I quote from the letter that I sent to him. I wrote: As you would have noted, the Adelaide Stock Exchange School. One must have that piece of sheepskin to issued a Press statement on 14 December claiming that action had been taken but did not indicate the person hang up; it gives one a sense of credibility. charged. However, on 24 December this was revealed as being Shierlaw.

Perhaps that is of no interest to the Government and its backbench supporters but it is of interest to an important part of the financial world which is engaged direcdy in the productive capacity of Australiathe people who actually earn money and make things rather than those who spend money and buy things. If that assumption is correct the Bill could well mean the end of that system. If that is the intention, let the Government say so. I turn now to the strange provision about attendance by a representative of the Commission at meetings of the stock exchange committee. I do not know anyone who would want to object greatly to that provision though it does strike me as being rather an odd situation if the committee were engaged in some sort of decision making about legal action against the Commission. But more importantly the Bill provides for attendance of a Commission representative at company directors' meetings. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, that will result in real decisions being made elsewhere and being ratified at formal meetings. I am interested in that aspect which arises in clause 267. One wonders whether it is envisaged that attendance at directors' meetings will be regular or irregular, whether the Commission will take a judicious view of things and what its attitude will be. I can well imagine that if the Government chooses to appoint zealots to the office of Chairman or as members of the Commission they could deliberately harass and damage confidence and interfere with the decision making process to an extent far outside the purpose of what generally would be accepted as an objective of this Bill. Let us have that spelled out. What exactly is the power of the representatives and what is thenpurpose in being at the meetings? At this stage this must surely be noted as a pretty wild provision. I must emphasise in passing that the present Labor Government has never really understood what business confidence is about. I beUeve-thi s is very important-that it is the Government's belief that it can do anything to business in any measure and it wUl not disrupt the productive capacity of this country though that is our real wealth and we all live on it. It can do anything to damage that by legislation and other acts and it wUl still go on in the same way. 2 years of government what Government supExchange in particular, work in this country.

Unclear proposed laws do a lot interest but only to his Party's interest. The BUI towards damaging that confidence. These are measures which need examination-the y have not yet been given it-by this House and by the Government. They need justification, and without that justification we, as members of this House, are entitled to object. That is not obstructionism. It is our duty to examine proposed legislation and if we do not agree with it to say so and why. The Government has provided a matter of a few hours for debate on this most complex piece of legislation. It tries to say we have had plenty of time. No doubt it wUl move the gag. I wiU be interested to see whether the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Kerin), who is seeking to interject, is prepared to vote with the Opposition if the gag is moved. We say we are entitled totimeto debate this legislation. Hundreds of questions have been raised by others. I have raised a few tonight. I look forward to answers, but I am not confident of getting them. from the Attorney-General who interjects, though I cannot hear him, will be a 100 per cent party political reply. This was what we got when he spoke for 10 minutes earlier this evening. He does not understand the provisions of this BUI and actuaUy he does not want to understand them. He does not want to puttimeinto understanding them. He wants to take a party poUtical approach. What he said earlier most likely wUl be what he will say at Press conferences and later this evening unless I can jolly him out of it. He wUl say that the opponents of this BUI have made milUons from the Stock Exchange. Apart from the fact that that is the highly hysterical statement he made earlier this evening I want to tell him one small point that may have escaped his attention: Most people involved in Stock Exchange activities in the last few years have not gained mUUons of profits but have made substantial losses. There are reasons for that situation that we can understand if we understand how a free market operates. This BUI, and any BUI Uke it, wUl not take away that excessive optimism and pessimism which come fromtimeto time and create fluctuations in a free market. I put to the Attorney-General the question: Are we to have a free market? That really is the question to answer. What he has shown so far-",70,Pairs

196,Mr Garlandi Think What We Will Hear,"goes much further than almost anybody anticipated. I believe it true to say that that is fairly common criticism that one can make of pieces of legislation proposed by this Government. The Government often has gone too far. Its legislation often has been shown to have many flaws. I instance the trade practices legislation which required more than 100 amendments. The Government's legislation goes too far and is over-simplified. Much of its legislation has come to grief for that reason. The Goverament oversimplifies because it does not recognise how complex Ufe reaUy is. It is always looking for the glib solution. It always wants its legislation put into effect by next Tuesday morning at 9 o 'clock. This BUI contains whole pages of a rehash of State companies Acts. Questions of powers are involved, whether the 'Financial Review' or the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hawker( Mr Jacobi), like it or not. I question the value of having pages of rehash in this BUI because we have been promised a national companies Act. I do not argue whether it is good or bad to have a national companies ActI am personally rather attracted to the notionbut if we are to have such an Act why do we require such provisions in this BUI? We have not been told and their inclusion does not seem to advance the situation any further. I do not suggest the provisions are any harsher; they have just been picked up. It seems to me, therefore, that the legislation is in a rather funny form. It is incomplete for a national companies Act yet provisions up to a point are included in this BUI. This is an aspect that also needs close examination because if this BUI is passed that is the situation that wiU obtain. The honourable member for Hawker and I and I beUeve in this direction, have been shown and no doubt other speakers on this subject have to be impractical, Ul-considered and wasteful. given much attention to talking about the The Government often has been forced to cease offences and crimes of various rogues involved in them or modify them because reality does have a Stock Exchange activities and on the periphery. way of asserting itself.

This honourable member for Macarthur, by his smUe, BUI shows, as we have seen, that in so many agrees with me. However, there has been confields the Goverament has learned nothing and, siderable concentration on this aspect. I think worse, it does not want to know. that the danger is that people wUl feel that all that is involved in this legislation is related to -overwhelmingly indebted to the Senate Select crimes and offences, but that is not so. What is inCommittee on Securities and Exchange-the Rae volved is having a Stock Exchangea finance Committee-for creating a situation in which the system-whic h allows us to get the great benefits Opposition can no more oppose regulation of the from it without allowing people to be able to manoeuvre themselves into positions of getting great sums for very Uttie work. Let us not get too carried away with our consideration of offences and crimes because one thing must be perfectly obvious to everyone and that is that the stock market is not in the same position today as it was in 1970. We are really deaUng with a different situation. My plea in these few remarks is: Let us not in legislation in this ParUament ruin the financial system and the avaUabUity of capital and the facility of being able to get that capital quickly into trade and securities for the sake of trying to meet a situation which has never occurred to that extent before and probably will not happen for sometime.Let us have a system that prevents excesses if such is possible and let us have a BUI that we can examine clause by clause. Let those few of us here who are interested in this matter have confidence in what we are passing because, party poUtical warfare aside, this must be our common objective. The honourable member for Hawker made a jibeI suppose it is fair enough-abou t reform and said that the Opposition is in favour of reform so long as it changes nothing. However one can turn that comment around and say that his attitude is that reform is necessary to change everything. He believes that change itself is improvement. According to the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam), his Ministers and supporters, change equals reform. That, of course, is absurd. The honourable member for Hawker took one small example out of the operations of the New York Stock Exchange but I point out that the United States Stock Exchange system is very different from that proposed by this Bill.

We can say with complete report of the Senate Select Committee on Securiassurance that if honourable gentlemen opposite ties and Exchange-commonl y known as the Rae had earlier acted on the pieties about the need Committee.

198,Deputy Leader Of The Opposition ( Mr Lynch),"years of meticulous investigation of the matters surrounding the Poseidon boom? I find that the memory of the Rae Committee grows cold; people are forgetting what it was all about and the details that it gave. Lest people think that I am partisan in this matter, I shall refer to the description of the Rae Committee report and its contents which was put forward at the time of its release by an independent commentator, Mr nate his official obUgations. Creighton Burns of the Melbourne 'Age'. He wrote: That report, in case you haveforgotten,catalogued conThat is a masterly understatement. It is one of the spiracy, fraud, deception, insider trading, share price rigging many masterly understatements that characterand sustained malpractice by some stock brokers and investment companies, during the last mineral boom. It demonise the Rae report. Where are these people now? strated that committee membersI ask honourable members to note that; not the stock brokers themselves alone, but members of the committees of the exchangeshad been deeply involved in improper practices including the manipulation of share pnces, and that the stock exchanges had done virtually nothing to discipline their members or to prevent a recurrence of the abuses. That was what Mr Creighton Burns wrote in the Melbourne 'Age' of 21 August 1974, at the time of the release of the Rae Committee report and some years after the collapse of the Poseidon boom. He wrote that the stock exchanges had done virtually nothing to disripline their members or, more significandy, to prevent a recurrence of the abuses. It is worth reminding honourable members of some-onl y a few-of the case histories which are set out in such detail in the Rae report. For instance, I mention again briefly, because it is so pre-eminently the great example thrown up by the Poseidon boom, the matter of Poseidon itself and the great beneficiary of Poseidon, Mr Norman Shierlaw. The Committee's concluding remarks in relating to Poseidon and to Mr Shierlaw are as follows: During the period leading up to the announcement of the discovery of nickel and copper sulphides the consulting geologists and one of the directors used their official and fiduciary positions to buy Poseidon shares for private profit. Mr Shierlaw went further in facilitating what we beUeve was a persistent abuse of confidential knowledge by executfact that at the same time as you were apparently receiving ing a substantial part of the geologists' buying orders encouraging information from Patricks, Patricks were also through his own stockbroking firm. Reports and statements by the directors and geologists The transcript of the Committee's proceeaings were evasive, distorted, exaggerated and simply untrue in goes on: important respects. He( Mr Shierlaw) abused his responsibilities both as a member of the stock exchange and as a director. There was another gentleman involved in the party to anything ofBecause Poseidon affair. I refer to Mr Hynam. Mr Hynam was not simply aran-of-the-millstockbroker; he youSenator was the Chairman of the Perth Stock Exchange. really massive way in the market, that you were being set up The Rae report said of Mr Hynam: The chairman of the Perth Stock Exchange( Mr G. I . Hynam) resisted requests to carry out investigation into Poseidon and took no steps to refer the complaints to the Registrar of Companies. He was nevertheless prepared to support the actions of the Poseidon directors and geologists throughout this period. In Mr Hynam's case, we have expressed our concern that his immense personal and family gains from investments in Poseidon, and his close associauon with that company's geologists and with Mr Shierlaw, may have led him to subordiMr Hynam's general assertion about the efficiency of the stock exchange's 'police force' were, in our view, unjustified. Mr Hynam may have been among the stockbrokers the Perth Stock Exchange announced last October it had fined severely. We do not know what 'severely' means because the Perth Stock Exchange has never told us the extent of thefines.As of last October the exchange had not taken the Australian people into its confidence. As the honourable member for Hawker has pointed out already, we do know the penalty imposed by the Adelaide Stock Exchange on Mr Shierlaw. He was suspended for 3 months and fined $2,100. Compare the gain; contrast the penalties. But Mr Shierlaw and Mr Hynam, while perhaps the best known beneficiaries of the Poseidon boom, were by no means the only beneficiaries. The report literally crawls with them. The House will recall that Patrick Partners made a great deal of money by selling shares in a firm called Barrier Exploration which was owned by an associated company called, curiously enough, Patrick Corporation, and operated at the time as Mining Traders. A Major Douglas of the Melbourne-based Australian Investment Counsellors Pty Ltd was recruited to start a run on the stock. I will quote a revealing exchange on this matter which took plate during the proceedings of the Rae Committee. Senator Rae asked Major Douglas: I just wondered whether there was any coincidence in the dealing in a gigantic way on the market in these shares. Major Douglas: I would be very sorry to hear that. Senator Rae: Why is that? Major Douglas: I hope that I have never been that type in my life. Rae: In that respect do you think it is possible, if accept from me as a fact that they were dealing in a to assist? Major Douglas: I would hope to heaven that I was not. not .beUeve in mentioning names and accusing Even at this distance in time, how thin and unconvincing those words fall on our ears? Where are these gentlemen? Where are the principals of Patrick Partners? They may or may not have been among the stockbrokers who were fined some $67,000 by the Sydney Stock Exchange. Again the exchange has not seen fit to take the AustraUan people, the victims, into its confidence. But, of course, we do know one thing about Patrick Partners; we know that if the Liberal Party has its way, one of the members of that firm wUl be joining us in this House.

Anybody studying this BUI would appreciate accused of being influenced by that country and that it is a complex BUI. The explanatory memorof adopting its ideas, and was asked why it did andum prepared by the Attorney-General( Mr not have any ideas of its own. Enderby) covers 91 pages.

219,Mr Lucock (Lyne) (9.42),"I am reminded state Corporate Affairs Agreement to which Newagain to the Minister's second reading speech. Later on in the speech he said: During the recess, my Department has received a number of representations and submissions. These are now being given close consideration. When amendments appear to be desirable I shall move them in due course. Our aim is to get the best possible legislation-legislatio n which will provide deal of interest from honourable members opprotection for the interests of investors and restore confidence in the capital markets in this country. Do those remarks of the Attorney-General not further justify the motion moved this afternoon by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for the suspension of Standing Orders to delay this legislation? It does not appear to me to be logical. Surely if we are to discuss something in a legal sense is should be discussed logically. If we are to discuss this legislation surely we should at least have all the amendments and all the information that is possible before the House. Quite frankly I feel that there was complete and absolute justification on the part of the Opposition when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition moved a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders this afternoon. I think that the stock exchange management itself has set up a committee to investigate some of the problems and difficulties confronting exchange and investment. I think that committee could make a valuable contribution. I understand that it is making suggestions to the Attorney-General. I am not quite sure whether some of the amendments that have been presented to us this afternoon have come as a result of those discussions or as a result of information presented by the Stock Exchange management. I would sincerely hope that at least due consideration would be given to the suggestions and to the recommendations made by the stock exchange. Surely if legislation is to be brought into this House and agreed to by this House at least consideration should be given to those people who have a great deal of experience in this sphere. Sometimes it is said that companies do not give full and detailed information. I believe there are circumstances when a company is justified in not revealing at a particulartimeall the information that is at its disposal. If a company did, the danger existsI think this should be given consideration-that the information could be valuable to its competitors. The company could be placed at a disadvantage. One of the major factors, I believe, in this matter is the power that is given to the Commission. I think this reveals the difference between the philosophy of members of the Opposition and the philosophy of members of the Government. "" Mr O'Keefe-Members of the Government are not interested. As my friend, the honourable member for Paterson, mentions, there does not seem to be a great posite. Clause 279 of the Bill states: Except as provided by this Act and subject to the jurisdiction of the High Coun under paragraph 75 (v) of the Constitution, a decision of the Commission shall not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in question, or be subject to prohibition, mandamus, certiorari or injunction, in any court on any account whatever. I think when one reads that clause the danger of this legislation becomes paramount. Complete power is. given to the Commission. There is no check on the Commission. I think there should be therightof appeal. We spoke earlier about the right of appeal in relation to criminal offences. Even the Australian pubhc has the right of appeal against the policies of this Government. In 1974 the Australian people were not wise enough to use thatrightof appeal in therightdirection. We hope that very soon they will be able at least to exercise thatrightin therightdirection once again. Under the provisions of this Bill there is no right of appeal against the Commission. I think this is dangerous. It is further evidence of the philosophy of the Government as against the philosophy of the Opposition. I believe that the view of those who are closely related to this industry should be given full consideration. Quite frankly I feel that one detrimental feature of reports relating to the stock exchange has been an inference which, intended or otherwise, has been that the stock exchanges are comprised of rogues and thieves. The stock exchanges have been prepared to accept criticism and, where possible, have taken steps to correct the situation. In my opinion not sufficient credit has been given to the stock exchange when it has beenright.I do not think anyone would deny that the stock exchanges have played a very important part in the development and progress of this country. I think in general that the stock exchanges have a fairly high ethical standard. There has been a far higher degree of control than might be surmised if one looked at only one side of the report. Earlier Ireferredto the comment that assistance had been given from people overseas. I said then that I am afraid there is the danger of our society being over-regulated because there has been a degree of over-acting in this situation in which we have found ourselves, one might say, in recent years.

If the legislation were fair and reasonable it would' be accepted by all. The members of the Government have said that the only reason the Opposition is opposing this Bill is because we are trying to give further support to what it calls our big business friends. But all that camouflage does not hide the fact that it is not a good piece of legislation. It is a dangerous piece of legislation because of what it leaves out as well as what it puts in. It expresses again the continuing philosophy of this Government, which is a philosophy of control and regulation in every possible aspect. It is for this reason that my Party, of any alleged breach of the rules and regulatogether with members of the Liberal Party, are completely and absolutely opposed to this legislation in its present form. members of the Opposition who have spoken in appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. this debate have so far wasted considerable time In other words, as I see it, the situation under this saying that they do not have enough time to disBUI is very generous indeed and in its safeguards cuss the Bill.

There were some phrases in the the position at present a prospectus can be issued honourable member's speech that led me to befor 6 months duration and there is nothing to Ueve that the AustraUan Country Party might be stop securities being sold in terms of that opposed to the BUI as a whole. There seems to be prospectus during the 6 months, even though confusion on the part of the Opposition as to evidence might come to the fore that the whether it is merely opposed to the principle of prospectus is false or misleading. So that is why the BUI, some clauses of the BUI or the BiU as a the Commission has the powers vested in it to cut whole. I hope that the attitude of members of the off the prospectuses immediately. As I said, I Opposition wUl become clearer. My colleague, the honourable member for am able to do. But I do not accept that this body Casey( Mr Mathews), made some mention of the has enormous powers that go beyond the powers name of the employers of my Liberal opponent of other parliamentary bodies or commissions in the seat of Macarthur.

As I understand it the ParUament is paramount. Opposition speakers have said also that there is no review or appeal procedure. Again, as I understand it, the Commission is required to give a pubUc hearing tions as set down. The Commission has to abide by rules of natural justice.

221,Mr Kerin (Macarthur) (9.57),"Many of the is taking any action and, even then, there is thefully on matters, particularly in respect of the Rae report. I have tried to read the report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange but Ifindit hard to take in at one sitting. SoI share these misgivings. However, the report itself does indicate the breadth and depth of consideration given to the securities industry by members of this Parliament and previous parliaments. No one can seriously say that the matter has not been seriously discussed. It was about 4 years in gestation and it seems to me that there has been very adequate discussion on many aspects of the securities industry. So long as this Bill follows on pretty clearly from thefindingsof the Rae Committee, as I believe it does, it would seem to me that-there is ample room for discussion in dealing with it. I would like to address my comments to those people who perhaps are hstening in and those people who will read the speeches because I share what is probably common community prejudices about the Stock Exchange. Many people seem to think that the Stock Exchanges are magic. Many people think that the stock exchanges are dominated by fear and greed, that there are only two kinds of operators in the exchanges-mug s and speculators. This is why I think it is essential that this sort of legislation is put forward to give the public confidence. We have heard a lot about business confidence. We hear a lot about private enterprise. I believe this Bill is a chance to put free enterprise into practice, to allow a free market to operatea free market, albiet a regulated one. If we are to talk about business confidence, if we are to talk about free markets, I think the private sector must be able to beUeve in its own propaganda. Part of the reason for this BUI is the need to reassure the pubUc that theirrightsare being protected. An editorial which appeared in the 2 January 1975 edition of the 'AustraUan Financial Review', under the heading of 'Public's Right to Know about Stock Exchanges', stated: legislation. People buying shares in Brisbane on The Australian stockbroking industry learns nothing, be the Perth Exchange need to know exactly what haves with breathtaking arrogance and deserves much of the situation is. Apart from some of the prejuwhat it is now receiving at the hands of the investing pubhc. dices that I think the pubUc shares and the prejuLast year saw the publication of the Rae Committee dices I probably have, Ifindthat I am tempted to report, which outlined some of the abuses by stockbrokers sort out some names in the Rae report where during the course of the mining boom. In their typical closed shop, old boy fashion, the various always dangerous to take some particular cases exchanges dealt with those who had been discovered breakand to generalise. I think that if we look at the ing the rules. In every case the treatment handed out was pitifully small to say that many people in stock exchanges have, considering the magnitude of the breaches in professional and always have, acted admirably. I think it is ethics. In most cases the stock exchanges pursued their secretive report became investigatory and rogues were ways of declining even to name those who had been penalised for breaking the rules. Financial Review' of 2 January 1975. I do not beUeve that the 'Australian Financial Review' is unsympathetic with the business community or the stock exchanges. In fact, I think all commentators have said in the Press, in academic circles and elsewhere that there is an overwhelming need for this sort of legislation. If there are to be racecourses of the kind involving stock exchanges, there need to be a few stewards around. In fact the racecourse analogy is not too bad a one to use. One writer has written that few solutions to the problems of the securities markets have been proposed, and left to manipulation and the laws of the market place the stock markets in Australia have described a series of 'boom and bust' cycles. In the absence of proper regulation, such cycles may reasonably be expected to repeat themselves. Unfortunately, each cycle is costly in terms of efficient capital allocation, industrial development, and above all, investor confidence. There is an almost palpable tendency among AustraUans to view the stock market as a place to gamble freely, not merely spare funds, but as much as can be obtained from any source. It is true that stock market investors all over the world speculate at one time or another or in one stock or another. However, it is important to understand that attitudes now, and in 1969 in Sydney, are sinular to those held in New York in 1929. The stock market is equated with the race track by most small traders, commonly referred to as 'punters' by the newspapers, and a quick lolling is a predominant goal of even the well-educated. As was said by my friend the honourable member for Casey, the New York situation in 1929 was acted on some 40 years ago and this legislation does not go as far as the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States of America. As I said, I think there is a need for national misconduct has been shown. But I think it is Rae report in a balanced fashion it is fair enough also fair enough to say that the Rae Committee flushed out by it. It is a pity that the report is not",78,Pairs
222,Mr Lusher,Whom are you quoting?,79,Pairs
223,Mr Kerin,"That is from the 'Australianmore widely disseminated. I have found that even the chapter headings provide gems. All sorts of images are conjured up by them. Although it is a pity that we get the idea that all people in the industry are rogues, I think some of theromantictides to the chapters reveal a fair amount of a serious nature behind the report. For example, in Chapter2 we have: ' Mr Biggs' Punt'I do not think that is Ronald Biggs; 'Share Placements made with Inside Information'; 'Issuing New Shares to Directors' Associates'; 'The Misleading ""Letter to Shareholders"" '; 'FiringThe Boom'; and 'Fuelling the Boom: Realising Profits'. Some of the headings to Chapter4 of the report state: 'Share-trading Practices Leading to the Collapse'; 'Employees' Trading in Shares'; 'The Principals' Last Gamble'; and 'Failure to Fulfil the Prospectus' Objectives'. Other headings included:' Use of the Financial Press' and 'Brokers as Privileged Speculators'. One can go on and on. As a layman I must confess also that I do not understand the way the stock exchange works. But I think I can express my own thoughts on the necessity of the legislation before the House. I think the legislation before House is going to weld in very acceptably and successfully with the national companies legislation yet to be brought So what this quote is saying is simply that the down. I think there is a fair sort of relationship function of the stock exchanges as raisers of capibetween the Rae Committee report and the tal is probably diminishing and probably needs Fitzgerald report with respect to taxation abuses to be re-evaluated. that occurred, again during the mining boom, and the way certain mining companies were set up purely and simply to exploit provisions within the law. What worries me when members of the things which are needed for the market to act in a Opposition put forward objections to this legisfree manner. We need to have an infinite number lation is that it would seem to me that they are of buyers; we need to have an infinite number of exactly the same sort of objections that were put sellers and we need to have a situation where the forward when Senator Murphyfirstraised the buyer and the seller have perfect knowledge parwhole problem of the abuses that were alleged to ticularly in respect of price and quaUty.

I think that is aU weU and good. At the. sametimeit is essential that we do have one national securities Act just as we have one truly national Companies Act. A whUe ago I referred to free enterprise and market economics. AlthoughI might not be quite competent to speak on the stock exchange I think I do understand a Uttle about markets. If we are talking about a fully competitive capital market the first thing that we have to reaUse is that at least 80 per cent of capital in AustraUa is gained by companies from depreciation and retained earnings and that in fact only some 20 per cent is raised in other ways. To take a quote from the Melbourne 'Age' of 20 July 1974 the writer of the article, Kenneth Davidson, says: Fortunately about 80 per cent of the funds for investment in Australia are generated from depreciation allowances and retained earnings. However, the remaining 20 per cent must be raised on Australian capital markets as the basis for funding new companies and to provide for the growth of companies beyond that made possible by the generation of internal cash flows. As the report shows, in the two years of the boom following Poseidon, more than $300m in risk capital was raised for around 200 companiesfloatedat the dme. Nearly all these ventures have proved failures or at best marginal propositions, and only a fraction of the money raised actually went into exploration and development activity. When we are talking about a fully competitive market in respect of shares there are certain an opportunity for cartels or monopolies or, in the language of the stock exchange, 'rings'. If we paid wUl be a function of the bidding process and bidders operate in the market and by indepenregulation of the securities market rests with the stock dent I mean knowledge is shared but there is no exchanges knowledge of the other's intention.

One of the faults of this House is that people never know what too many people are speaking about.

In deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will not describe any other of the errors which have taken place other than to mention one matter relevant to conventions. I believe that the abuse of parliamentary conventions and the Standing Orders particularly by the Prime Minister, when it suits him, who preaches in the tongue of the clothe and uses the tactics of a loquacious, rude, unthinkin g and personally offensive demagoguethat the right honourable member may debate the Bill. The matters he has debated so far have no relevance whatsoever to the Bill.

But if you wish to deprive me of the opportunity of presentinghonourable gendman is as aware, or is more aware most likely of the Standing Orders of this House as is anyone else. I would also point out that the Standing Orders do provideenough. I have listened to you. I will now do what you ask. Regrettably, let me turn now to the Bill before the House, the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill 1975. The Attorney General in one of the shoddiest, scimpiest and poorly informed second reading speeches that I have ever read said that the objective of the Bill is to provide for the securities industry in Australia to operate on a sound basis with an effective system of controls administered nationally by a Corporations and Exchange Commission. He said more specifically that the Bill aims to maintain, facilitate and improve the performance of the capital market in the interests of development, efficiency and stability. Somewhere towards the end of the speech he perfunctorily mentioned the need to ensure that the investor has access to information which is both relevant and up to date. I beUeve we need in Australia an effective securities commission-no t a companies and securities commission, but a commission independent in status, with adequate but no more than adequate functions and powers. I publicly advocated such a poUcy during thetimeI was the Treasurer. I believe these goals should be achieved by a step by step approach and, so far as Part V, Divisions III and IV, are concerned after hearings, reports and recommendations by a permanent second Eggleston type committee divorced from the Commission itself. I now turn to the Part II of the BiU. The Corporations and Exchange Commission is given extremely wide powers and functions including powers of an apparently judicial kind under proposed sub-clause (2) (c) of clause 20 to: take such action (including the making of rules under section 283) as is necessary to enforce or give effect to the provision of this Act. And under proposed sections 40, 41 and 43 it is given power to hold what seem to be judicial hearings and proceedings for any of the purposes of the Act, including to summon witnesses, to force them to answer questions, and adjudicate on matters involving contempt. This raises the most crucially important question and constitutional issue of the separation of powers between legislatures Executive and judiciary. Rightly the judicial power of the Commonwealth must be exercised under section 71 of the Commonwealth Constitution by the High Court",81,Pairs

233,Mr Mcmahon,"Al l so right, Sir. I have had'of Australia and not by an administrative tribunal. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the Taxation Boards of Review are examples of adrninistrative tribunals without judicial power, particularly power to fine. In my opinion a new Bill should be drafted to fit in with the constitutional trichotomy. As well there must be both an administrative and judicial appeal and this would be provided in the new legislation. I have said that I agree with the principles beand consequently in the allocation of our econhind Part V, Divisions III and IV, of the Bill. But the Bill in its entirety is conceptually faulty beboth sale and purchase of securities and other cause company and exchanges legislation should be separate. In my opinion the detailed attempt to control the exchanges will make it impossible for them to operate under normal market conditions. The Bill cannot be satisfactorily amended. Nor can I say that I approve in detail with each of the clauses of the Bill for these reasons. We in the House have not had the opportunity to debate the provisions of clauses 105 to 126 or any other clauses. Even today, the Attorney-General presented advance notice of 19 Committee stage amendments to the Bill. We have not been able to test the effectiveness or resand proper functioning of the exchanges will be trictive and damaging effect of the workings of the Bill in the market place. We have not had the opportunity fully to discuss the reactions with market interests which will be smothered by bureaucrats and bureaucratic actions. In particular I agree with the basic concepts behind Part V, Divisions III and IV, that is disclosure of personal interests of dealers and others in certain types of written communication to clients; dealings by holders of a dealer license as a principal; the priority to be given by a dealer to clients' orders; dealers who carry on business of specified kinds not to be directors of listed corporations; dealers not to act as underwriters in certain cases; provision relating to emticular case. This power is not necessary because ployees of dealers or investment advisors; manipulation of markets; wash sales and matched orders; fraudulently inducing persons to deal in securities; dissemination of information about illegal transactions; and dealings in securities by insiders. I emphasise that I do not know how the Bill would work out in practice, even in the cases where I accept and endorse the principles. There is no one in this House with a detailed working knowledge and operational experience in the securities market; and we should be able to educate ourselves as to the dangers before this Bill is passed into law. Let me turn to some of the proposals about which doubts remain and about which I have personal reservations. I express these doubts and the Prime Ministers' two intrusions into the day reservations because of the authoritarian tendencies in so much of the legislation introduced by the Government and the vanity and omniscient streak in the characters of so many Ministers. The stock exchanges are important, probably vital elements, of a free enterprise economy. They assist, greatly assist, in the mobility and marketing of securities, in the mobilisation of finance for business activities and are the medium for purchase and sale of assets and shares omic resources. They advise their clients as to investments. They have been the backbone of investment banking in this country. They perform many other tasks on behalf of the public. As I have said, the ostensible objective of this legislation is to facilitate and improve the performance of the capital market not to obstruct or restrict it. The Terrigal Conference of the Labor Party accepted in a practical way that in a mixed economy the institutions of a free enterprise economy should be strengthened. The exchanges were not excluded. I repeat that the free, effective obstructed, not assisted, by the passage of this Bill. The exchanges will be immersed in red tape, hindered in their day to day operations and smothered by the bureaucrats-the very opposite of the proclaimed intention. Under clause 36 (2) of the Bill the Attorney General may give directions to the Commission on matters of general policy in connection with the performance of its functions or the exercise of its powers. But nothing in this provision entitles the Attorney-General to give a direction to the Commission in relation to the performance of its functions, or the exercise of its powers in a parclause 284 confers on the Governor General power to make regulations in general terms prescribing all matters that are required or permitted to be prescribed or necessary or convenient to the carrying out or giving effect to the Bill. With knowledge of the unlawful, intemperate and arbitrary acts of the former Attorney-General it would not be wise to confer powers on the incumbent uninformed and inexperienced Attorney-General when there are more effective methods of achieving the same goals through regulations that may be disallowed by either House. On parity of thinking and with knowledge of to day operation of the Prices Justification Triability, do they not?

Mr Speaker, you haverighdyand frequently ruled that you have no control over the way in which Ministers answer questions, the length oftimethey take or even whether they answer them and you haverightlyruled that in making personal explanations there can be no debate or counter charge. Nor is it possible for the Opposition to receive leave to make statements or to table statutory declarations when the Government determines that leave wUl not be granted. Knowing this, knowing that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) had no opportunity to defend himself under the Standing Orders, the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam), boots and all, kicked out in a savage attack because he could not and would not answer a question which exposed the depths of confusion and disgrace to which this Government has fallen. He ignored the question and from his lofty perch he lashed out at a man who has discomfitted and exposed him, first making sure that the Leader of the Opposition could not answer back. If he did try to answer, the Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron), as is his wont, would run back and forth to the table raising points of order. The Prime Minister knew full well that the media representatives, who seem to attend in any numbers only at question time, would almost unanimously haU this as a splendid victory. Those lofty immortal phrases he uses such as 'Ga ga', 'boo', 'moo', and I think even 'hoo-ha' show his remarkable articulate heard in this nation he cried: 'Give us a go'. What tremendous justification he of all men has to ask for fair play. There is hardly a convention-as k any State one likes-whic h this Government has not broken. Yet the Prime Minister attacked the Premier of New South Wales for not holding sacred what the Prime Minister regards as a convention. The engineer of the grubbiest political trick in history-the Gair incident-the man who himself created the present Senate vacancy and the problem, on a Sunday night telecast to Australia knowing full well that Mr Lewis would not have the faculties to reply nationaUy on television. Yet the Prime Minister has the temerity to accuse Mr Lewis of questionable tactics. Our Prime Minister appeals for a fair goa fair go for himself-bu t he does not consider that he should give everybody else a fair go, or even our nation. Let the Prime Minister's own leadership be examined because, after all, he criticises the leadership of others. Take the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation raids, the midnight intrusions into the homes in Sydney with Commonwealth police everywhere. The Prime Minister led by diving under the first table he could find when the pressure was on. There is the Morossi affair, on which I do not want to make any comment. The Prime Ministerridiculedthe Leader of the Opposition as having no control over his organisation. He himself says that he cannot interfere with the actions of his Ministers in staff appointments. When the members of his Cabinet disgracefully attacked the United States and the President of the United States the Prime Minister said that he alone in future would make statements on foreign affairs. But his Ministers gave him the great raspberry and in effect they said they would say what they like when they Uke. So again he dived under the first table he couldfind.That is splendid leadership. Then on his great white horse he went to Queensland to demonstrate his superiority and righteousness over the Premier of Queensland. What a remarkable display of leadership this was. When he went to Queensland the Australian Labor Party had 36 members in the Queensland ParUament. When he left it had 11 and some of those were successful by a mere whisker.

As honourable members are aware, the seasonally adjusted rate at the presenttimeis 4 per cent. Therefore the exaggeration was about 100-fold. that many industries and businesses in the Dandenong area are suffering serious difficulties. ThisI do not dispute. It is true also that many of the leaders of these businesses and factories, and the leaders of unions involved as well, have made representations to me as their local member. Whenever this has occurred I have made personal representations to the appropriate Minister and or his Department. ThisI will continue to do, ofcourse. There are other business leaders with serious problems who have not contacted me and I issue an invitation to them to do so in order that I , as their local member, can try to assist them. It can only do injury to the country's economy when groups such as SOB act in an irresponsible, destructive and divisive way as they have done in my electorate in the last couple of weeks. Mr O'KEEFE (Paterson) (10:48)I want to bring to the notice of the House tonight the plight of an industry with which we people living in the country areas are vitally concerned. It is the avithe existing unemploymentfigures.Surely it wUl ation industry which operates in the distribution of superphosphate on our agricultural lands. This matter was brought to my attention at the end of last week by a firm in my electorate, Pays Ah Services Pty Ltd, which operates at Scone. For some 26 years it has employed a number of pilots. They now have been notified by the principal of the firm that their employment will be terminated on and from 14 March. This profession is in a very critical state. In New South Wales 41 pilots have been dismissed so far by employers whose businesses have almost ceased to exist as a result of the collapse of the beef industry, the Federal Government's decision regarding the superphosphate subsidy, a general lack of confidence and the uncertain future for the man on the land. I suppose that if we could count the number of pilots throughout AustraUa who wiU lose their jobs in this industry for the reasons that I have given we would find that it would run into many hundreds. This professionrequiresimmense training, experience and skUl not only for the pUots but also Apart from the pUots, the people involved in the industry are the carriers who cart ther superphosphate from the railheads to the various properties and the mechanical loader operators who load the superphosphate into the planes. Many thousands of people who are involved in this industry throughout AustraUa wUl be thrown out of work. The industry cannot stand the loss that no doubt it wUl suffer as a result of the presentfinancialand economic circumstances over which the pUots and their employers have no control. Most of these pUots would have to rely on social service assistance whUe they seek alternative employment or retrain for some other profession. The financial loss to the pUots will be considerable, not to mention the costs that will be involved inretrainingpersonnel to replace those who have been forced into other fields when the industry recovers from its present disastrous position. These pUots are very skUfuL The spreading of superphosphate in mountainous country is a very skilful operation. The pUots in this industry have tremendous experience, and that is essential. Apparently the present Government has stated that it would cost too much to retrain the pUots displaced in other areas of the air industry. There is no doubt that the talents of these experienced pUots would be wasted if they were retrained to be truck drivers, clerks, storemen, etc., as has been suggested. Surely this Government wUl not allow these skilled pUots, their famUies and other members of their specialised industry to add to make an effort to salvage this industry before it disintegrates and is beyond assistance and recovery. I commend the position of this important industry to the Government for investigation, with a view to assistance being given to preserve the great expertise and know how which has been developed over many years and which is in danger of being lost. It wUl be a national loss if this takes place. Once again I ask the Government and the Ministers concerned to look at this question because if the industry folds it wUl be very difficult to re-establish it, and this wUl mean a great loss to the primary industries and to the export income of AustraUa. a campaign of fear surrounding the question of pensions and the means test which is being deUberately engendered by certain anti-Labor elements within the community.

I refer particularly to the undertaking given by this Government that the means test would be abolished over the term of a ParUament. The Government, in its 1973 Budget, carried out the first leg of that transaction by aboUshing the means test for people aged 75 years and over. It has announced quite clearly on a number of occasions that it wUl abolish the means test as from 1 April this year for people 70 years of age and over. Yet there has been a studied and very deUberate campaign to try to confuse the pubUc, particularly those people who are 70 years of age and over, by statements that the Government would not abide by that pledge. We were sitting here in this chamber when the Minister for Social Security( Mr Hayden) made the position quite clear. Yet in the Press in the following days there were deUberate attempts to imply that the Minister had not been definite on the subject. Of course the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) in our pledge. Nothing is further from the truth. It is answer to a question in this House only last week the intention of the Government to honour its made it very clear that without doubt the means pledge.

The last adjustment was an extraordinary adjustment in itself. It was something which had never been seen in the whole history of this ParUament. There was an increase of $5 a week for aU pensioners. That brought the pension up to 24.8 per cent of average weekly earnings. There has never been any suggestion from this Government that it would not honour its pledge to continue to adjust the pension until such time as it reaches 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Yet the radio, the Melbourne 'Herald', the Queensland Press and various other newspapers throughout this country have been carrying stories along the line that this Government wUl not abide by and honour that pledge. The result is that every member in this House-particularl y honourable members on the Government sidehas received continual questions and correspondence asking why it is that we wUl not honour sion to bring it up to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.

(5) What is the list of the main contractual relationship embodied in his announcement that 4:7 million tons would be sold to China. member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) On 11 October 1973 the then Minister for Overseas Trade, Dr Cairns, issued a pubUc statement concerning the negotiation of a Long-Term Wheat Agreement between the Australian Wheat Board and the China National Cereals Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation. In addition to announcing that the Agreement is for a period of three years commencing 1 January 1974 and provides for the sale of up to 4.7 million tonnes, Dr Cairns drew particular attention to the fact that the LongTerm Agreement had been negotiated specifically in accordance with the Trade Agreement between Australia and China which had been signed in July 1973. As foreshadowed by the Minister, the AustraUan Wheat Board issued a statement containing further details. The Board, in line with established commercial practice, has made pubUc certain details of a non-confidential nature concerning individual sales contracts it has subsequently entered into with the China National Cereals Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation.

(4) Is the Postmaster-General's Department required to make a contribution to the Superannuation Fund on account amount of the contribution. (5) Are any other Depanments required to make a similar contribution; if so, which Departments and what contribution do they make. Dr. J. F. Cairns-The answer to the honourable member's quesdon is as follows: (1) The balance in the Superannuation Fund as at 30 June 1974 was $739,294,744. (2) Under the existing superannuation scheme, a contributor who has attained the age of 60, or a contributor, the age for whose retirement isfixedby law at an earlier age than 65 and who retires on attaining that age, is entitled as from the date of his retirement to receive a pension. Under the new superannuation scheme for AustraUan Government employees approved by the Government for introduction on 1 July 1975, a contributor mayreceivea pension based on his actual contributory service and reduced in accordance with the number of years by which his age at retirement falls short of age 60, provided the conditions of service applying to him permit voluntary early retirement before age 60 or he isretiredinvoluntarily before age 60. (3) The retiring ages for officers of the Public Service are prescribed in section 85 of the Public Service Act, the lowest age at present being age 60. The PubUc Service Board has indicated that it favours amendment of the PubUc Service Act to permit voluntary retirement at age 55 and is initiating consultation with departments as an initial step in examining the question of the desirability of having additional compulsory early retirement provisions. There has been no decision by the Government to introduce legislation to amend section 85 (4) The Postmaster-General's Department does not make employer contributions to the Superannuation Fund. Under section 96F(1) of the Post and Telegraph Act 1901-1973, however, the Post Office is required to meet, by payments to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the employer superannuation liability in respect of its employees, who are contributors under the Superannuation Act 1922-1974. During the financial year 1973-74, the amount paid by the Post Office in discharging this liability was $ 103,820,000.

Cairns-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am not aware of such action by the major trading banks and enquiries I have made have not produced any evidence to support it. Bank liquidity has risen strongly since September partly reflecting steps taken by the authorities over recent months to add to the liquid assets of banks. Banks have been assured by the Reserve Bank that banking policy will be administered so that bank liquidity will be adequate to support current policy which is aimed at providing appreciably more finance by way of new lending towards meeting the basic immediate needs of the economy for finance should be readily available to meet all demands arising from inflation. The major trading banks have responded one-third higher than in November and more than Vh times the rate in the three months to 8 October.

Since that drain abated, funds released' have added to the level of liquidity.

Such an increase in liquidity of banks enhances their ability to undertake increased lending. (See answer to Part (1)).

Ravensthorpe: Television Reception (Question No. 1928) Mr Bungey asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Media, upon notice: Withreferenceto the answer to Question No. 947 (Hansard, 27 November, 1974, page 4216), how is the number of people in the Ravensthorpe area calculated as 225. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Australian Broadcasting Control Board advises me that the figure of 225 population of Ravensthorpe was obtained from the latestfiguresprovided by the Bureau of Census and Statistics. It is acknowledged that the Ravensthorpe Shire population includes an additional population of about 900, but it must be pointed out that these people are dispersed throughout a total Shire area of some 5000 square miles. In examining the possibilities for the provision of television to Ravensthorpe, the Board is, of course, obliged to take into account only the population of the Ravensthorpe town, since the very high costs which would be involved in providing a service throughout the Shire would make any such project quite impracticable from the economic point of view.
