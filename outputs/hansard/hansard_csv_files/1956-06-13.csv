For the information of honourable gentlemen opposite, and in particular the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I might mention that the bill is merely consequential upon the arbitration legislation that we have already debated, but that I had to defer action upon it until the consent of tbe Government of! New South Wales came to hand. WAR. as Acting Prime Minister, whether he has received any recent reports on the second payment of compensation moneys to former Australian prisoners of war of Japan. Could the right honourable gentleman ask the Prime Minister to arrange, while he is in London, for an investigation of appropriate methods of expediting the conclusion of this most unfortunately prolonged business ? Sir ARTHU R FADDEN"" I have been waiting an opportunity to make a statement on this matter, and I shall make it now. I assure the honourable member that the Prime Minister intends to look into this matter while he is in London. As to the general question of prisoner of war payments, I would like to state that last March the Prime Minister indicated to the House that a distribution of money for ex-prisoners of war wonld not be made by the International Red Cross before mid-1956 at tbe earliest. Tbe Prime Minister also pointed out that last year the Japanese Government had paid. £4,500,000 sterling to the International Committee of the Red Cross in full settlement of its obligations under Article 16 of the Japanese Peace Treaty. In addition to this sum, the Red Cross also holds 2,500,000 United States dollars which were paid to it by Thailand under an agreement on Japanese assets in ThaiStates of America and the United Kingdom. The Red Cross cannot distribute these moneys to national agencies, as it has not yet completed its check of the lists of former prisoners of war submitted to it by the countries concerned. Australia, in common with other nations, is rendering the Red Cross all possible assistance to ensure that there is no avoidable delay. The Government has no later advice which would pin-point the possible time of distribution, but I assure honourable members that tbere will be no avoidable delay on this Government's part. Treasurer a question that I wish to divorce entirely from politics. I can only assure the right honourable gentleman that under similar circumstances I would feel it incumbent upon myself to direct such a question to whoever was the responsible Minister of the government of the day. South Australia, like the rest of the Commonwealth, is experiencing an unprecedently cold and wet winter, and in the City of Port Pirie at the present time the lady members of benevolent societies are distributing warm clothing among the unfortunate ones. In view of the forthcoming recess, and the time that it takes to get the necessary machinery working after the House meets once more, will the right honourable gentleman ask his Cabinet to consider the immediate need to _ increase social service payments ? Will he also instruct the departments affected of the advisability of eradicating the repulsive term "" oensioner"" and of using in lieu thereof a more acceptable definition such as "" retiring allowance "" ? ject-matter of the honourable member's question will obviously receive consideration during the course of the preparation of the next budget. turned down. anything like your record, it would be.",6,Setup

7,Sir Arthur Fadden,"If it weirSupply seen a report of the British Government's Medical Research Council on the question of genetic dangers from radiation, arising from nuclear tests? If so, what is the purport of the report and to what extent does it support, or otherwise, the views of other scientists which he has quoted in this House? released in London very recently. It is the result of an entirely independent study by eminent British scientists, and is very reassuring indeed on the genetic effects of fall-out from nuclear explosions. It therefore adds great weight to the views of Sir John Cockcroft and others whom I have quoted in this House. The report says, in effect, that the risk of genetic harm to future generations from nuclear weapons tests is negligible. It says that, even if these tests were to connature of the action taken to date and tinue indefinitely at the present rate, an individual would, over a period of 30 years, receive only 1 per cent, of what he would, in any case, receive by way of radiation from natural sources. Indeed, the report makes some recommendation about dealing with every-day radiation from such sources as X-rays and radio therapy. The report does issue a warning of some possible health risks, nothing to do with genetics, which could arise from repeated hydrogen bomb explosions resulting in the release of radio active strontium. It says, "" At its present level no detectable increase in the instances of ill effects is to be expected "". But it says further that at the present rate of firing, "" We could within the lifetime of some now living be approaching levels at which ill effects might be produced in a small number of the population"". I think I should point out that only a few days ago. in the House of Commons, Sir Anthony Eden reaffirmed the British Government's willingness to discuss methods of limiting test explosions and he said, "" This remains the policy of Her Ma jesty's Government, and we would seek every opportunity to put it into effect"". Needless to say, this is also the policy of the Australian Government. AIR POLLUTION . of the Minister for Health been directed to reports of intense air pollution in some areas of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla arising from various industrial manufacturing processes? If so, is it a fact that the density of pollution from the smog fall is, by test, claimed to average 25 tons monthly per square mile in central Sydney, 20 to 30 tons in parts of Newcastle; and 60 tons at Port Kembla? Is it also a fact that the highest reading at Port Kembla compares with 160 tons in some districts of Pittsburgh. United States of America? Has the Government, of which the Minister is a distinguished member, taken action or incurred direct expense in investigating this major problem and serious health hazard to both the workers within most of the industries and the residents of the areas mentioned? If so, what is the what amount of money has been expended by the Government on this problem ? seen, in general terms, reports similar to those mentioned by the honourable member. Whilst, of course, the Government would be able and willing to make available all the information and assistance it has available for the purposes of meeting this difficulty, 1 should point out to the honourable member that this is primarily a responsibility of the New South Wales Government and that no approaches have yet been made by that Government to the Commonwealth. WOOL. directed to the Acting Prime Minister.

Air. GRIFFITHS -Will the Minister for Social Services inform me whether it is the intention of the Department of Social Services to proceed with the plan, previously approved by his predecessor, to build premises at Newcastle for a new regional office of the department? If so, is it proposed to extend the duties of the officer in charge of that office by keeping records in, and making the payment of pensions from, that office? Is the Minister aware that, by having such an office in Newcastle, reviews of pensions, answers to the inquiries of pensioners, and many other social services matters, will be able to be expedited considerably? Tf it is proposed to erect a new building, what progress has been made with the plan to do so? Has land been acquired, have plans been prepared, and have renders been called ? If not, is the Minister able to inform me when it is expected that a new building will be proceeded with and social services facilities at Newwhich is addressed to the Postmastercastle be thereby improved? that I know that the offices of the Departbeen heightened by recent happenings in ment of Social Services in Newcastle are by the Postal Department in this city of at the moment unsatisfactory, that the youths aged fifteen and sixteen who come department is functioning in two buildhere many miles from their homes, and ings, and that the arrangements do not who, I believe, are subjected perhaps in lend tliemselves to either the quantity or their boarding establishments, to inquality of service that we believe the fluences which would be absent in their people deserve.

WAR. the Acting Prime Minister whether he will make an approach to the Prime Minister, who is at present overseas, on the basis of a question asked by the honourable member for St. George about payments to ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese.

I realize that it is a subject to which more attention could probably be given, particularly with, the object of providing recreation facilities in tbe hostels where youths, who, of course, are employed not only by the Postmaster-General's Department but also hy other departments, are accommodated. As a matter of fact, there is in existence already a scheme designed to provide facilities for directing their activities along beneficial lines outside working hours, but, sometimes, the arrangements made have not been followed. The department finds it difficult to obtain sufficient adult staff for the essential work of letter delivery and similar duties, and it is necessary to -employ youths. It is not desirable to -employ lads of fifteen years of age at any great distance from their homes, and that is not common practice, although I know it has prevailed in the Australian Capital Territory. The wages paid to junior postal officers are determined, first of all. by the Commonwealth Court of -Conciliation and Arbitration, and these officers are paid under the relevant scale -of the Public Service Board in accordance with the award. Therefore, that matter is not really within my field pf administration. However, I assure the honourable member that, in the last day or so, I have given some attention to the problem he has mentioned, and that, if I can improve conditions, I shall do so. Minister for External Affairs a question. How many countries have ratified the agreement for the proposed Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization? If something like the requisite number, which, I think, was fixed at 21, have ratified the agreement, will the Minister consult with the Minister for ""Shipping and Transport on the possibility, of obtaining some modification of the present International Load Line Convention as it affects the port of Albany iu Western Australia? able gentleman is concerned about this matter because of the very great importance it has for the port of Albany. I think it is at least five years since he brought the problem to my notice first, but, unfortunately, although we have done all we could do in the years since in an effort to stimulate other countries to join the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultive Organization, only seventeen of the required number of 21 nations have yet ratified the agreement. Until the organization comes into existence, the International Load Line Convention cannot be brought into international operation. We shall continue to do what we can to influence individual countries to join the organization, and, when it becomes effective, I shall most certainly cooperate with the Minister for Shipping and Transport in an endeavour to have the present international load line arrangements altered, technically and generally, as we believe they should be altered. This would be very largely to the advantage of the port of Albany. THE RIGHT Honorable J. B. directed to the Acting Prime Minister. It is five years to-day since my predecessor, the late J . B. Chifley, who was the war-time Prime Minister of Australia, passed away. I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, as Leader of the Government, he will consider taking steps to honour the memory of this great Australian who served Australia so diligently, faithfully and well in war and in peace. The people of Australia will remember him gratefully, and it would be their wish that something of the nature that I have put to the House to-day be accomplished.

Those arrears are caused by tention to co-operate in the scheme bottlenecks and delays in the handling of initiated by this Government to provide these claims by other departments that free immunization against poliomyelitis are concerned, and departments that are to the Australian people by the use of the -only too happy to pass the buck and the Salk vaccine?

The Australian Government has asked the State governments to administer the inoculation campaigns within their own borders. All the States have agreed to give free treatment, with the exception of New South Wales, where a small charge will be made to all recipients of the vaccine. PAY-ROLL TAX . Mr L. R. JOHNSON -Will the Treasurer consider alleviating the difficulties experienced by the States in mainraining transport services, by exempting such services from their heavy commitments to the Commonwealth in the payment of pay-roll tax? I point out to the right honourable gentleman that New South Wales transport services, for example, last year contributed £1,100,000 in pay-roll tax, and Victorian services contributed £700,000, while Commonwealth transport services were entirely free of this imposition. Does the Treasurer agree that relief from this extortionate tax would assist the States to continue to provide adequate transport services, in the face of the upward spiralling of costs and the general inflationary situation that has developed during this Government's period of office? out to the honourable member that this Government, during its term of office, has assisted the States to an unprecedented extent, on a completely honorary and voluntary basis. The fact that the States pay pay-roll tax must be considered in com'unction with the fact that the States receive very generous reimbursement grants from this Government under the uniform income tax legislation. On every occasion since this Government has been in office those grants have exceeded the legal entitlements of the States under the agreement entered into between the States and a former Commonwealth Labour government. inflation. paid with the same £1 notes as we receive. NEW SOUTH WALES Treasurer's attention been drawn to the recent announcements that the accounts of the New South Wales Department of Railways in this financial year will show a deficit, and that great hardship has been caused to the people by consequent increases in fares and freights? Does the Treasurer realize that the adverse balances in the New South Wales Government railways' finances will affect this Government, which will have to provide the money to make good the deficit? Is he aware that that deficit would largely have been avoided if , since the war, the New South Wales Government had used the moneys that it has spent on obsolete steam engines for the purchase of economic diesel-electric locomotives? Is he also aware that if, in addition, loan moneys that have been made available to that State since the war had been suitably allocated, the New South Wales railways would now be out of the red? If he is aware of these things, will he, at the forthcoming meeting of the Australian Loan Council, bring this matter to the attention of the Treasurer of New South Wales and perhaps discuss with him and the Treasurers of the other States a proposal to use part of their loan moneys for the purchase of diesel-electric locomotives? The purchase of these locomotives, which save up to 40 per cent, of their capital cost every year, would enable the aggregate loan moneys made available by the Commonwealth to the States to be kept within reasonable bounds if, particularly in New South Wales, there were some sanity in railway administration. little doubt that the obsolescence of locomotives and the run-down condition of the State transport system, particularly the railways, have been a contributing factor in the financial difficulties experienced by the New South Wales Government, which has been assisted to a all due to very generous degree by this Government. I have little doubt also that the State governments will have to give very serious consideration to railway deficits,",15,Arthur Eadden My Such Information I N General We Ar< Poliomyelitis

We did -gather from the Minister that a shipping stoppage would be regarded as an emer.gency, at which point the Minister could issue a direction to the authority. would be regarded as an emergency; T say it could be so regarded. -could be. I do not put it any higher than that. Let us look at the situation where a stoppage occurs somewhere and the authority, in the words of the Minister, could be put completely in control. Au order then made by the authority under those special powers might well cut across or affect matters already contained in an award of the commission. We have directed attention consistently to the dual -control over this industry. We now come to the crux of the situation. Will the Minister or those persons in authority later decide which course to follow? The authority may move in, and, because an order is not obeyed, impose a penalty of £250 on an organization, or the other course may be followed under the new industrial arbitration legislation and a fine of £500 may be imposed by the Industrial Court. Before the Minister asks the committee to adopt this clause, will he give us a clear line of demarcation and show us where we are going in matters of that description? We are entitled to know, and the committee as a whole is entitled to know, where the line of demarcation is to be drawn between these two authorities and by whom judgment is to be passed for the imposition of penalties. I ask the Minister quite frankly whether -sub-clause 6 of elause 21 wrote down the power of the authority to the point where it could not cut across an award of the -arbitration commission. He would not indicate clearly yesterday that that was 30, and preferred to say that if there were -a strike there might be a situation where the authority would be given the power as a result of the ministerial declaration. Who will decide whether it is a matter that should rightly be dealt with by the authority under this provision, or whether it is a matter that contravenes the award and falls within the penal provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration BiU? This throws into light very clearly the situation that must arise when we have two authorities which can deal with the one matter. If the Minister would only look for a moment at the definitions of the two powers he would be more enlightened. We have, for instance, the I do not say it presidential commission with powers to deal with all matters or things affecting, or relating to, work done or to be done. This is set out in paragraph (a) of the definition of "" industrial matters in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. If we look at the functions of the stevedoring authority as set out in clause 17 of this measure, and relate paragraph (a) to paragraph (jf), we learn that the authority may regulate the performance of stevedoring operations andmake arrangements for allotting waterside workers to stevedoring operations so as tn ensure, as far as practicable, a fair distribution of work in stevedoring operations amongst registered waterside workers This must affect the provisions of paragraph (o) of the definition of "" industrial matters "" in section BS of the arbitration act. Paragraphs ( i ) , (;) and (k) of that definition"" set out further powers of the commission. Paragraph ( i ) empowers the commission to deal with the ""mode, terms and conditions of employment"". Then paragraph (k) readsThe preferential employment or the non employment of any particular waterside worker or class of waterside workers. We can put that beside paragraph (d) of clause 17, which readsTo ensure that sufficient waterside workers are available for stevedoring operations at each port and that their labour is used to the best advantage. If a dispute arises in respect of either one of these matters-say , in respect of ensuring that sufficient waterside workers are available for stevedoring operationssome one must decide whether or not it is affected by paragraph ( j ) of the definition of "" industrial matters "" in the arbitration act, which statesThe employment of any waterside workers or class of waterside workers.

Jamns Harrison). I -desire to put some of the views of the Opposition in respect of this clause. First of all, let me stress once again that overlapping is admitted so f a r as this legislation is concerned. The difficulty, of course, is that this amending bill does not remove the overlapping but, if anything, makes it more pronounced and more certain. T think that the suggestion that I made last evening is the only way in which this difficulty can be overcome. That suggestion was to leave to the presidential commission the quesmum penalties. tion of fixing hours, the minimum or basic wage, and long service leave, and honourable member for Blaxland has to leave all other questions to the Stevealready pointed out, the contempt prodoring Industry Authority. As it is, the visions of the Conciliation and Arbilegislation provides that both the comtration Act must be taken into consideramission, in the arbitration sphere, and tion in addition to the penalties imposed the Stevedoring Industry Authority, in in clause 20 of this bill. But what I find its sphere, can make awards. awards could clash and, as the bill shows, 20 the maximum penalties are £25 and where they do clash, the authority £250; but in the very next clause, which remains predominant, and even the comdeals with a state of emergency that mission cannot change any decisions of can be declared by the Minister and the authority witbout consultation with it . which one would assume would be declared I fear that as the consequence of this only under the most extraordinary cirbill there will be compl cated legislation cumstances, the fines are £10 in the case : that will be difficult to interpret both on of a waterside worker and £100 in any the part of the stevedoring companies other case. The Opposition fails to see and the Waterside Wo-kers Federation, why there should be a differentiation in apart from the difficulties which tbe bill, the penalties with respect to offences of in turn, will cause to the Australian Couna similar character. The first penalty is cil of Trades Unions, which is invariably to be imposed under clause 20 in conbrought into these disputes. So, although nexion with the disobeying of an order [ appreciate the fact that the amendand the second penalty, provided in ment which the Ministerf o r Labour clause 21, is to be imposed also for disand National Service( Mr HaroldH o l t ) obeying an order, on this occasion an has moved is an attempt to make this order given under the authority of the clause a little clearer and that it makes Minister. it clear that the provisions of clause 20 will only operate after a bearing carried out-in accordance with clause 18 of the bill, it still does not make this clause a good clause f r om the stand-point of either the trade union movement or the Opposition. Let me point this out: Notwithstanding the amendment which the Minister has moved and which, no doubt, will be carried, there still remains clause 5f> of the bill which, as the Minister knows and I think the committee now knows, means that whether the authority carries out the provisions of clause IS or not, to the extent that it omits to carry out those provisions, everything that i i does is still legal and enforceable. So the persons who are covered by clause 20 and upon whom penalties can be imposed can have the penalties imposed upon them notwithstanding the fact thai clause 18 ( 2 A . ) has not been carried out in its entirety. I further point out thai we are up against this difficulty: In this particular elause the penalty is £2fin the case of a. waterside worker and £250 in the case of anybody else.

There are one or two other factors S'o one sees that we need to be very clear that could well be pointed out in respect in regard to this legislation, particularly of this clause. This clause makes the in view of the very high penalties that authority, from the stand-point of any may be imposed. Erom every standorder made by the authority, equivalent point the Opposition feels that this clause to the conciliation and arbitration comis not a good clause and, because it is not mission. Whether the wording of the a good clause, it should be opposed and: amendment, or the wording of the clause, should be rejected. is intended to imply that the equivalent of the commission is a commissioner or the commission as defined in the interpretations of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is not clear. If the equivalent is the commission, then the commission consists of one presidential member plus two other persons.

For the benefit of the committee, I point out that the clause deals with something that is entirely new in industrial legislation in Australia. The clause will permit the Minister to make a declaration that a state of emergency exists in respect of a port, whereupon the authority mayfor tbe purpose of tbe performance of its function under paragraph (6) of sub-section (1.) of section seventeen of this Act, give such directions as it thinks fit. So, for the first time in Australian industrial legislation, we have a power conferred on a Minister to declare a state of emergency. Under this legislation one can naturally expect that there will be such trouble industrially that the declaration of a state of emergency will probably be necessary. The point is, I repeat, that here is power, for the first time granted under industrial legislation in Australia, which can have far-reaching consequences. I reiterate that I know of nothing in Australian industrial legislation that permits the making of such a declaration by a Minister. The bill does not state the grounds upon which such a declaration may be made. One does not know whether the declaration would be made in the event of a strike at one r«It. or a strike at more than one port, or whether it would come as a Johnson, L . R. consequence of storm, flood, tempest or something else. The position is that a Makin, N . J. O. declaration of emergency can be made,, Mclvor, H . J. and that immediately it is made thePeters, E.

The declaration can have effect for a week, six months, twelve monthsindefinitely. It can remain in force for any time that the Minister deems necessary. The rights of the parties are not safeguarded in any direction. Whatever order is given by the authority must be obeyed, and obeyed immediately. The parties will have no legal power to protest, no power to advance a case for the withdrawal of the declaration of emergency, or for the moderating of the declaration in any way. In other words, it will be possible, under this clause, to establish, a dictatorship on the waterfronta dictatorship that can giveorders and, if those orders are not complied with immediately, either the waterside worker or the organization or other body concerned is subject to very severe penalties. In addition to the penaltiesimposed in clause 21, the matter could go before the proposed Commonwealth In dustrial Court for an order to be madtby the court, and, if the order was not observed, the contempt provisions could be put into operation. Here we see again the effect of double-barrelled penalties in respect of an offence. The remarkable thing about this clause is the silence of the Minister for Labour and National Service.

That makes us feel that this clause must be regarded with more than ordinary suspicion, and, therefore, I put the views of the Opposition on this matter before the Minister. The clause is a bad one, and there is no justification for it. The Minister has given us no indication why it should be included in the bill, and he has not given us any illustrations of things that have happened in the past that have made it necessary to provide for. a declaration that an emergency exists. As I have stated, for those reasons we think the clause is a bad one, and it should be omitted from the bill. The Opposition will oopose it. ter for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [3.471 -It is extremely interesting to hear these emotional protestations about the provisions in this bill from Opposition members who, apparently, have forgotten that the Labour Government introduced in this Parliament legislation dealing with the same subject-matters as those with which this bill deals. Anything the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) has said in criticism of the provisions of this bill could have been said with much greater force against the very much wider and more sweeping provisions included in the Stevedoring Industry Act which the party to which he belongs fathered in 1949. All that the present Government has done in this bill is to trim down very considerably the wide powers which the Labour Government conferred on the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board in 1949, and to make it clear that these wide powers are to be used only in an emergency. So far as Labour was concerned, it was an open go, and the powers could be used at any time without anybody being bothered about the matter. Let us have a look at the provisions of the 1949 act, which apparently commended itself to the present Opposition members who were then in the Parliament. The most sweeping functions were given to the Stevedoring Industry Board by section 13 of that act. I do not need to go beyond the functions set out in paragraph (a) of the section, which gave the board a general power to regulate and control the performance of stevedoring operations. for the declaration of a state of emergency. not. There is no need for it. Under the Labour act, any state is good enough for action against any one in respect of whom the Labour government may have wanted to take action. Paragraph (a) of section 13 of the 1949 act gave the board the wide power of regulation and control, and, following on that powei-. all the other functions are set out in the section. Section 16 of the 1949 ad readsFor the purpose of the exercise of l t powers and the performance of its function*under this Part, the Board may make sucli orders, give such directions and do all such other things as it thinks f it . That gave the board an open go in the exercise of the most sweeping function? conferred upon it. Section 17 of the 1949 act gave the board power to make orders, and provided that any person who contravened, or failed to comply with, any provision of an order made by the board was guilty of an offence. Sub-section (1.) of section IS statesA direction given by the Board may be given orally or in writing. I ask the committee to contrast the mo9i sweeping powers that one can conceive which were conferred on the board by the 1949 act with what this Government has done in the present biil. Eirst of all, as to functions, we have trimmed down the regulation and control function so as to make it clear that control can be exercised only in an emergencv. Opposition members say, in effect, "" You could declare martial law. Define what you mean by ' an emergency'."" I shall not attempt to define an emergency at this point of time. That will be a matter for the Minister of the day to determine at the appropriate time.

We provide that a copy of a direction given in writing shall be served personally or by post on the person to whom the direction is given. clause 21 statesA direction given orally shall be given to the person required to comply wifch the direction and thereupon that person shall comply with the direction. clause (4.) readsWhere a direction is given orally, the Authority shall, witliin twenty-four hours thereafter, record the direction in writing and, as soon as practicable, serve personally or by post a copy of the record on the person to whom the direction was given.

H is first reason is that, according to his own reasoning, similar provisions were included in an earlier measure, and his second reason is that, for unspecified reasons which he Secondly, we bave is not prepared to state at this moment, he deems it desirable that the clause be included in this b ill . H is first reason would not be valid, no matter which side of the committee supported it . It does not matter very much whether a mistake has been made once in the past, assuming that it was a mistake. MrE . W. HOLT No . time members of the present Opposition (3.) of have criticized what was done by thi* Labour government, if it was a mistake, although, since 194.9, they have had ample opportunity to do so. MrE , W . HOLT -The Minister's argument is faulty so f a r as he comes to a conclusion by criticizing section 13 and section 16 of the Stevedoring Industry Act 1949. If I may use his own argument in reverse, his criticisms apply with equal force to clause 17, clause 22, and other clauses of this bill . The powers conferred on the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board by section 13 and section 16 of the 1949 act are proscribed by the provisions of tlie act as a whole. I am quite happy tc concede to the Minister that the same argument applies to this clause and that the exlsnt of the powers which he seeks to include in the bill in this clause are, or should be, proscribed by the other provisions of the bill. It is just one of those things on which we may choose to disagree. The Opposition believes that the powers contained in this b ill are too wide. We believe the provisions control power. MrE , W.

I think.the Minister must admit in all fairness that the power contained in clause 21 is far wider, if exercised, than any power contained in the 1949 legislation. not. Mr R. W. HOLT -""What I have said is fair comment. When we were considering clause 18 and the amendment to it, I pointed out that it was affected by the emergency power in clauso 21, taken in conjunction with clause 17 (1.) (6), and clause 55 of the bill. The very safeguards that the Minister sought to insist upon by his amendment to rdause 18 are eliminated by clause 55. There was no such removal of the safeguards in the 1949 act. The result is that to-day the Minister says that he is not prepared to explain the circumstances in which clause 25 will be brought into operation. Subclause (6.) of clause 21 readsA direction under this section, to tlie extent that it is inconsistent with an order of the Authority or an award ot the Commission, is of no effect. I should like to know just what interpretation the Minister places on that subclause. There again, the authority has power to override its own decisions. If an order of the authority made under the emergency powers conflicted with a previous decision of the authority, the authority would be supreme in any cast. Any purported safeguard, which is supposed to be included in sub-clause (6.) of clause 21, is taken right out of the bili. It means nothing, unless the Minister can explain why sub-clause (6.) is included in clause 21. Previous clauses give priority to the decisions of the authority over those of the commission, and I cannot see why sub-clause (6.) is included unless it has some application to which the Minister has not yet referred. enough, is it not ? Mr R. W. HOLT -It is obvious to Minister for Immigration) [4.2] -The me, but if I draw the obvious conclusion, purpose of sub-clause (6.) of clause 21 is the Minister accuses me of being partisan to ensure that in the exercise of the and of reading something sinister into emergency powers the authority does not the bill that is not there, though it is there all the time. To me, that provision gives no safeguard at all. The authority is supreme, especially in an emergency when it is not required to consult with anybody nor to refer any of its decisions to anybody else. That clause is nugatory; it has no effect whatever. In the face of is the Minister's adamant refusal to explain the circumstances in which clause 21 would become operative, we are forced to the conclusion, for instance, that had the Minister had this power, he would have invoked it in January last. It is because of that very circumstance that we are jealous of the executive, whether in the form of the Minister or the Governor General-in-Council-in this case, the Minister-takin g powers that are absolute and that could be used arbitrarily. I am not suggesting that the Minister would necessarily use them arbitrarily, but somebody else may in the future use them in that way. They could be used arbitrarily, and couid have been so used last January, had they existed then. For that reason, clause 21 is repugnant and objectionable and we reject it. It is useless for the Minister to say that a similar power existed in the 1949 legislation. similar; it was much stronger and wider. Mr R. W. HOLT -Though sub-clause (6.) purports to provide some safeguard, by interpretation no safeguard exists. Where one clause qualifies another clause, for the sake of clarity and for the sake of the people who will interpret the bill when it becomes an act, these qualifications on the various sections should have been included when the ""bill was drafted. I do not blame the Parliamentary Draftsman. It is a matter that should be insisted upon by the Minister. For those reasons we cannot accept the amendment.

The tariff proposals I have just presented to the committee will operate as from 9 a.m. to-morrow morning. These proposals have a dual purpose. In the first instance, they propose to implement, insofar as variations to the Customs Tariff schedule are concerned, those tariff concessions undertaken by Australia during the negotiations at Geneva earlier this year under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I desire to make it clear to honourable members that the amendments effected by these proposals are not the only action required to implement fully the tariff concessions granted by Australia at Geneva. In addition, reductions of primage duty, the hringing into operation of existing intermediate tariff rates of duty, or the binding of existing duties and margins of preference, are involved in some cases. However, other action is being taken to give effect to these changes, which will operate concurrently with the related variations made in the Customs Tariff proposals. Secondly, these proposals give effect to recommendations made by the Tariff Board in respect of certain products to which I shall refer at a later stage. These particular tariff variations are not, of course, associated in any way with those arising from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations at Geneva. At a later stage, I shall table the Tariff given by Australia, in broad terms, Board reports to which effect is now -riven. At the same time, I shall table four other reports of the Tariff Board which the Government does not consider it desirable to implement. One of these four reports relates to coated paper, and one to agricultural tractors up to and including 10 belt-pulley-horse-power. These will be inquired into by the Tariff Roard again. reports cover toys and record changing devices. I also propose to table a report of the Tariff Board nn artificial silk piece goods. Tbis report recommends variations in the by-law admission of artificial silk piece goods, and the recommendation is being carried out. As is customary in matters of this kind, I have circulated to honourable members a memorandum which sets out in detail the extent of the tariff and primage variations accorded by Australia at Geneva. It also shows the extent of the tariff changes based on Tariff Board recommendations. I hope the memorandum will be helpful to honourable members in gaining a clear understanding of the proposed tariff and primage changes. At the Geneva negotiations Australia exchanged concessions with Germany, the United States of America and Austria. As was anticipated when Australia decided to take part in the 1956 conference, the scope for negotiation was not comparable with that of previous occasions. Australia's export trade should, however, benefit from the following tariff concessions:-Germany Fresh apples, meat extracts, frozen rabbits, lead ore and eucalyptus tanning extracts; the United States-Eucalyptu s tanning extracts, frozen rabbits, eucalyptus oil and catgut; Austria-Honey, meat extract and eucalyptus tanning extracts. It is. I might say, a principle of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that a concession granted by any contracting party also applies to all other members. Apart from direct concessions, Australian export trade will, therefore, benefit from the negotiations concluded between other contracting parties at Geneva. Tariff and primage concessions involve duty reductions on textile bleaching and dyeing machinery, battery eliminating devices and choke coils for wireless receivers, spectacle frames and beer. The Australian brewing industry is not likely to suffer very gravely as a result of those concessions. The concescessions also involve a binding of the duties at the existing most-favouredThe remaining two nation level on embroideries in the piece, gold leaf, microscopes, and rubber, canvas and composition belting (other than conveyor belting) ; and the removal of primage duty on gold leaf, various mining and metallurgical machinery, weighing machines, various road-making machinery, textile-bleaching and dyeing machines, machines and machinery not elsewhere included, battery eliminating devices and chokes for wireless receivers, various gas appliances, rubber, canvas and composition belting (other than conveyor belting), various fancy boxes, magic lanterns and mounted lenses and camera accessories. From Australia's point of view, the outcome of these negotiations is reasonably balanced. The negotiations cannot, of themselves, be regarded as of major significance to our export trade, but they will, nevertheless, improve the market prospects for a number of our primary products. Honourable members will readily appreciate that the state of Australia's balance of payments is now such that the Government cannot overlook any means of expanding exports or of raising the returns from exports. The concessions accorded by Australia are not likely to have any adverse effect on local industries which are conducted on an economic and efiicient basis. The proposed tariff variations associated with Tariff Board recommendations, to which I referred earlier, relate to electrically operated hand tools covered by tariff items 176 (u) (2) and 176 (u) (3), various dry colours, dyes and pigments covered by items 231 ( A ) and 231 ( E ) (2), synthetic oils and preparations containing synthetic resins covered by item 232 ( E ) , and synthetic resins used in the paint industry formerly included in item 232 ( E ) but now covered by item 369 (c). As will be seen from part "" B "" of the memorandum already in the hands of honourable members, some increases in the duties on these goods are proposed, and on thc remainder the duties either remain unchanged or have been reduced. These variations give full effect to Tariff Board recommendations. An opportunity to debate these proposals will be given to honourable members at a more convenient time. that an opportunity to debate the proposals will be given to honourable members at a more convenient time. That is very vague. I have heard many such promises in regard to tariff proposals. What does the honourable gentleman mean by "" a more convenient time "" ? honourable member for Lalor( Mr by the board is that at which apparently Pollard) that the proposals that remain to be debated will be debated as soon as the business of the House permits, and as soon as I can arrange it . session ? so. going into recess? desire than has the honourable member that there should be a long list of undebated proposals.

Clause 22 (Orders and directions of Authority not to be challenged). should like to hear from the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr HaroldH o l t ) an explanation of clause 22, because it involves a principle vital to the democratic parliamentary system f , f government. The clause statesAn order or direction of the authority .shall not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called in question, or be subject to prohibition mandamus or injunction, in any court on any account whatever. That is a far-reaching power. functions of this authority are set out in clause 17. Then, in clause 18, the authority is given power to issue orders, but it is provided that, before it issues an order under the provisions of that other British countries have consistently gone clause, it shall consult with the approabout circumscribing and undermining the priate people-the representatives of the determine what he shall do and what he shall union or of the employers' organization not do.

Perhaps it is the fault of the curious system, which we have adopted in our drafting, of excluding some of those provisions which",33,Stevedoring Industry
79,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"-Minisoperate as a matter of course under the Constitution. The provision to which the honourable gentleman refers does not exclude the normal constitutional right to take proceedings in the High Court for mandamus or prohibition where there has been action in excess of jurisdiction or something of that kind. Although clause 22 states that an order of the authority cannot be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called into question, and so on, that exclusion is subject to the provisions of the Constitution which enable the taking in the High Court of action of the kind I have mentioned. Occasionally clauses of this kind do include the words "" subject to the Constitution "", but I gather that in modern drafting practice it is not considered necessary to include those words, because it follows as a matter of course that the constitutional right prevails. The sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Moore would commend themselves to as all, but here we are dealing first with a practical situation. Orders will be made by an authority, which will be the statutory authority of the Parliament. It will not be an irresponsible body. Similar provisions have appeared, not only in the earlier legislation affecting the stevedoring industry, in tbe acts of 1947 and 1949, and in this bill, but also in the curParliament proposes, by means of this rent conciliation and arbitration legislation and the amending bill recently approved in this chamber. I can give the honourable gentleman the assurance that nothing which appears in the provision takes away from the rights which exist under the Constitution to take proceedings in the High Court. Tf this bill does not take away the right of appeal to the High Court, that is not the fault of the measure. The reason is that this Parliament cannot make an enactment which takes away the right of appeal to the High Oourt. I am well aware that this provision is a verbal repetition of section 52 of the Stevedoring Industry Act 1949, but I should like the Minister to explain a point, if he would be so kind. What he has indicated, I think, in his reply to the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) is, very simply, that if the Parliament sets up an authority which issues orders, obviously the Parliament cannot confer on the authority powers which it does not itself possess. But while the bill eannot prevent a man from appealing against the constitutionality of actions, if they are constitutional, we seem to be trying to prevent appeals on the question of their justice or rightness in themselves, and even whether they conform with the law. I should like the Minister, if he would be so kind, to explain this clause. honoiable member propose that questions of substance should be determined? the Minister to explain that in connection with another clause of the bill. Clause 20 ( 1 . ) statesOrders made by the Autliority(«) sball be' in writing; (ni shall not be deemed to be Statutory Rules within the meaning of the Rules Publication Act 11)03-1030; and That provision, I take it, means that they will not be reviewed, like ordinary statutory regulations, by the Parliament. The sub-clause continues(e) shall have the force of law. provision, to enact laws about which the Parliament knows nothing. We do not know what orders this authority will issue. We do know that we cannot confer upon it any powers higher than those which the Parliament itself possesses. Therefore, all its powers are subject to the Constitution. But it seems to me that in relation to clause 20 a question of justice is raised within the framework of the orders issued by this rule-making authority. The rather fearsome provision that an order of the authority shall not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called in question, or be subject to prohibition, mandamus or injunction, in any court on any count whatever, seems to me to be a gage thrown down to the courts. While I recognize that a gage has been thrown down before, I wonder whether the Minister would be prepared to express an opinion on the fate of such a provision if it were challenged in the High Court.",34,Stevedoring Industry

He has his normal constitutional rights, but I should hardly expect that issue to be raised in connection with the point I make, which is that the element of simple justice might enter into the matter. It is not a question of whether the Parliament has power to make a law on any matter, and therefore whether the authority has power to issue a direction. The Parliament's powers are limited in that connection. It is a question of pure, simple justice-the rights of the individual and the justice of not perish in the process. I am fearful the case. Clause 21, by its very nature, would be applied more to the employer than to the employee.

The authority's power is unlimited. I have no objection to it exercising that power, but I do object to its decisions being removed from the field of challenge. Of course, they can be challenged on constitutional grounds, just as could the decisions of this Parliament. That is fundamental, and I am clause precisely as it stood in the previous aware of it, but I am concerned that act. ordinary, common justice should be preserved. In the past we have, unfortunately, been too prone to hand over our powers to other bodies. The report of the Department of Civil Aviation has just been presented to the Parliament. That department has statutory power to make laws in accordance with the power of the Parliament itself. The department can go ahead and do what it likes. That, of course, is the easiest possible way out for the Parliament. It is much easier than sitting down and working out for ourselves what should be done. It is quite possible that the stevedoring authority, in time of emergency, may do what it considers desirable; but it is what this Parliament considers desirable and just tliat should be done. I cannot see bow we can continue to agree to this sort of thing. We must not accept any provision which gives to an authority the power to take away from the individual his right to question its decision.

107,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),"a question at this point. He has raised the very question that we have been hammering for hours in order to try to get the Minister to say what was intended in -clause 21. Nobody in this committee yet knows the powers that are to be bestowed -on this authority under clause 21. That is the very thing about which the honorable member has complained in connection with clause 22. powers are unlimited. are they unlimited under clause 22 in relation to clause 21? I presume that -clause 22 can only mean that decisions given by the authority have this allpowerful application, provided they are not inconsistent with an award or decision that has been made by the commission. I think that the Minister would .agree with that statement. Sub-clause (6.) of clause 21 reads as follows:A direction under this section, to the extent that it is inconsistent with an order of the Authority or an award of the Conimission, is of no effect. -Clause 22 follows immediately upon that provision. I do not think that there can he any doubt upon one point made by the Minister, that this authority, as was the -case with the conciliation commissioners under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1947, has to have powers in relation to the settlement of problems that confront it against which there should be no appeal. I do not think that anybody -can disagree with me when I say that this is a power which, in some respects, -despite all that may be stated in another field, is essential if proper control of industry is desired. The honourable member for Moore, who is interjecting, should have come to that argument a long time ago, because that has been one of the problems in this bill. The Opposition would still like the Minister to say, insofar as it is physically possible for a Minister to say, what this provision -means, having regard to all the other provisions of the bill. Does it mean, in -effect, that in relation to those matters which are properly covered by the commission, this clause would not have effect, -even if the authority were to give a decision that was contrary to or inconsistent with an award decision already made by the commission in relation to matters on the waterfront? has been a great deal of confusion and bother about what is meant by a very simple clause, which relates to an order or direction of the authority. An order or direction of the authority must be an order or direction of the authority which is that? The is valid. If it is valid, it cannot be challenged in any court; if it is not a valid direction, of course it is open to challenge on the ground of invalidity. The position is very simple indeed, and I cannot understand at all why there is so much confusion and bother about it. As I understood from an interjection by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) when the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) was speaking, the Minister takes the same view-that this relates only to a valid order or direction of the authority.

111,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"Minisnothing more significant to the proposed amendment than I have put to the committee. Amendment agreed to. believe that inspectors should have greater on an average, three gangs throughout powers than are conferred in this clause. I express that view because it has been the practice in the past, and is still the practice, to blame on the watersiders all the difiiculties and problems on the waterfront, and this clause gives me an opportunity to point out that a good deal of time lost on the waterfront is lost because men working No. 2 hatch were ordered of faulty stevedoring operations. If the inspectors were given power to control operations less time would be lost, and the turn-round of ships would be quicker, aud the work of loading and unloading vessels would be done much more expeditiously than is the case to-day. I have here some examples given to me of recent occurrences on the waterfront during which a great deal of time was lost, and a great amount of trouble caused, because of faulty stevedoring operations and an obvious lack of knowledge in the persons in charge of such operations. Men were employed for a longer time than was necessary, or were employed on work that was completely unnecessary, so that there were delays in the movement of shipping. One such case concerned SS. Whahatane, at Sydney, on Monday, the 21st May, 1956. Four hundred and fifty cases of canned meats were stacked in the shed on the wharf. Instructions were given to the men to load this cargo into No. 5 hold. On the completion of loading, instructions were given for the cargo to be discharged. The work took approximately three hours. Inquiries established that the cargo was not for shipment overseas, but was consigned to a military depot at Marrickville, a suburb of Sydney. The cargo was later delivered by truck. Another case concerned the same ship. On the 24th May, 1956, thirteen kegs of a powder preparation were loaded into No. 3 hatch, but were later discharged and re-loaded into No. 2 hatch. Later in the day, wool was d'scharged from No. 3 hatch and stacked in the shed at the berth. This took approximately three hours. It is understood that it had been loaded in Melbourne and, due to some error, it was found necessary to discharge and stack it in the shed for future disposal. This vessel was approximately a week at the berth, employing, that period. The necessary work could have been easily done in three days. The vessel was loaded for America and east coast ports. Another case last month concerned the SS. Colundra. On the 10th May, 1956, to load a 15-ton lift, and stow it 'tween decks. After the l if t was slung and taken aboard, it was found it was too high for the deck. The company then ordered the men to put it back on the wharf, where it was left. The ship sailed that night leaving the l i ft behind. Another case concerned the SS. Eastern Star, which was berthed at 24 Pyrmont on the 23rd May, 1956. Two gangs and 22 extras were engaged. The gang in No. 3 hatch, which subsequently went to No. 2 hatch forward, spent from 5.30 p.m. to 8.15 p.m. awaiting the arrival of wool. The actual statement of the situation may be put as follows:Time lost2 hours 30 minutes. Man-hours lost (1 gang-1 1 extras)-B S man-hours. I could give many illustrations of men having been called upon to perform unnecessary work. Men have been picked up, but the cargo they were to handle has not been available, or a ship has not arrived, or something of that kind hae happened, so that money was paid out for no work, or for work that was unnecessary. I think that inspectors should have some authority in matters of that kind. SoI repeat to honourable members on the Government side of the chamber that the whole of the responsibility for difficulties and delays on the waterfront does not rest on the watersiders. Much of it rests on the persons in charge of stevedoring operations. The stevedoring employers have engaged labour without having made appropriate preparations, or have given wrong instructions so that cargoes have been loaded into the wrong holds, and have had to be transferred to other holds.",39,Stevedoring Industry
112,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [5.5],"II oan assure the committee that the three examples I have given are only a few of those that indicate the necessity for inspectors to have some control over these matters, and particularly the necessity to give the stevedoring authority power to control the operations of stevedoring companies. If my recollection of the Basten report is correct, one of the things it pointed out was that wool sometimes failed to arrive on time to he loaded on ships. Many examples were cited in the report of wool failing to arrive, and of ships being delayed as a result. Generally, the excuse given for the holding up of ships in such cases was that the waterside workers were not loading as much in the same time as they used to load fifteen or twenty years ago. It would be just as well for us to realize that there are two factors involved in the handling of cargo. One is the men who do the work; the other is the people who have the power of direction. If the employer falls down on the job, his failure to organize and manage things properly drives up costs, and it is not fair for people to say in this chamber that the whole of the responsibility for the chaos and confusion that at times exists on our wharfs lies with the waterside workers, who are said to be not playing the game.

We had a measure before us about two years ago, which was supposed to solve our problems in respect of waterfront quotas.

That legislation gave to the employers authority to nominate men to fill quotas not met by t.he Waterside Workers Federation in a particular port. I know that there have been difiiculties in relation to this matter, and I think that this is a most appropriate occasion, and this is the best place, for me to discuss how the new authority will act in relation to it. We remember that a great deal of bitterness was engendered as a consequence of this Government's legislative action two years ago over quotas. All sorts of threats were uttered by the waterside workers about what they would do to the shipowners, while the shipowners made threats about what they would do if the waterside workers did not meet their responsibilities. The upshot of it all was that, when both parties finally realized their great problem, conferences were held in an attempt to resolve the dimculty. The Australian Council of Trades Unions played a rather important part in those conferences. vides for consultations. know, but clause 25 provides for port quotas. I have finished with clause 26. Paragraph (d) of clause 25 provides that the proposed Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority shall from time to time determine, by instrument in writing, the quota of waterside workers at each port. I suggest that the sort of arrangements worked out between the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and the Australian Council of Trades Unions, on the one hand, and the shipowners, on the other hand, fifteen months ago, which resulted in a good deal of satisfaction, may well be favoured by the proposed authority. If , as the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) has suggested, the Government will appoint reasonable men to the authority, I am hopeful that, despite what some honourable members have said about the present leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation, we shall achieve more conciliation, particularly on this matter, because it involves a fundamental principle on which the waterside workers depend, and the problem is a very important one. I think I heard some one say in this chamber only last week that. 1,100 waterside workers at the port of Melbourne were paid attendance money in one day. That is the sort of situation that no nation can afford to allow to continue. I am hopeful that the proposed authority will forget some of the things that have been said in this chamber abou t",40,Stevedoring Industry

Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 30 (Registrations in excess of port quotas). Opposition opposes this elause and will certainly vote against it . It is one of the most controversial clauses in the bill, and, with the exception of one other, it is probably the most likely to cause conflict on the waterfront. It provides for registrations in excess of port quota's. Sub-clause (1.) states. . . the Authority shall not register a person as a waterside worker at a port-if, by so doing, the number of waterside workers registered at the port would be increased to a number in excess of the quota for the port. Sub-clause (2.) then providesWhere the Authority declares, in writing, r.hat, in the opinion of the Authority(o) the demands for the performance of stevedoring operations at a port specified in the declaration during a period specified in the declaration, being a period not exceeding six months, will not be met unless such number of waterside workers in excess of the quota for the port as is specified in the declaration if temporarily available at the port for the performance of those stevedoring operations; and (6) the circumstances are not such as to warrant that quota being increased, the authority may, . . . This provision authorizes an increase of a quota that has been fixed by the proposed Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. ' Apparently, the intention is that, for a period, which may be less than six months, but which certainly shall not exceed six months, that quota may be exceeded, and it is provided, also, that the persons registered in excess of the quota are to become members of the ""Waterside ""Workers Federation of Australia. For the time being, the ranks of the union are to be considered to include more than the number of waterside workers which past practice and experience have shown to be sufficient to meet the requirements of the port. The committee should realize that, when we are dealing with a casual industry that is so essential as is the stevedoring industry, and when we are endeavouring to fix a quota of workers for a port, whether there be a rush period or a slack period to be met, we must give the workers concerned greater security than this clause w ill give them if we want to keep them on the waterfront as skilled and competent waterside workers. Remarkable statements are made now and again about the earnings of men on the waterfront. If the actual records could be secured, it would be shown that the turnover of labour on the waterfront is greater than the tnrnover in any other industry in Australia. The number of persons who work on the waterfront because they believe they will get good wages and constant work-s of a r as work of a casual nature can be constant-is remarkable. Many people, who have become members of the ""Waterside Workers Federation, find in a very short time that the employment is not as constant and the earnings not by any means as great as they believed.

The labour turnover means that persons who are trained to do a certain class of work and have become valuable in that industry because of tbeir particular skill and "" know-how"", leave the industry and go somewhere else, and the process has to be repeated. That has been pointed out as one of the causes of increased costs of production and of some of the frustration that industry is experiencing because labour is constantly changing. This proposal will aggravate those difficulties in industry. It will not only aggravate them but will add to what can be shown very clearly to be a good deal of mismanagement in the stevedoring industry. I shall take this opportunity to give some further illustrations of how the labour force is mismanaged at present. These are cases that have happened recently. honourable member's word that he can justify these instances. .some idea of the tremendous number of hours that are lost. The first instance relates to the ship Circus, in Sydney. It was loading at No. 21 wharf, Pyrmont, on behalf of the Darling Island Oompany. These facts were given to mt . At 4.4.5 p.m. the foreman ordered the truckers to bring in five bales of chemically treated and highly inflammable wool, which should have been deck cargo. The truckers, who told the foreman that they had finished the wool for that particular port, obeyed the foreman's instructions and put the wool into No. 2 hold. The company then loaded wool on top of it on Saturday morning and until 11.30 a.m. on Monday, when the company discovered that the bales were missing. The company, having no record of the bales, assumed that they were in No. 5 hatch and discharged 200 bales from No. 5 hatch before it discovered that they had been placed in No. 2 hatch. The loss of time discharging and loading in No. 5 hatch was six hours. At 11.30 a.m. on Monday the company commenced discharging No. 2 hatch in order to find the five bales, and found them at 3.40 p.m. after 251 bales had been discharged. The loss of time in No. 2 hatch was approximately eight hours. The total loss of hours was fourteen. The total man hours lost for 23 men-fiftee n in the gang, six truckers and 2 loading upwas 322 man hours; that is, 23 multiplied by 14. I do not propose to give any other illustrations, but many examples of this sort of thing can be cited. I want to stress, and stress as strongly as I possibly can, that if labour is to be made available in any quantity that may be deemed necessary by those employing the labour because a number of ships have entered port and they feel they will not have sufficient men, then mistakes of that description, which are being made by the stevedoring companies, will increase instead of diminish. I am sorry that provisions for control of the industry have not been included in this bill, because we must ensure not only that sufficient the men are available, but also that tbose men are used to the best possible advantage, so that thc best possible return is gained from their labour during thoir hours of employment, and that the organization of thc industry is such that every moment of a man's time that is paid for gives a productive result. My experience of people being brought into tbe 1 industry in circumstances sucb as are envisaged in the bill leads rne to the firm conviction that these provisions can result only in an aggravation of the troubles that already exist. These provisions will not be conducive to peace on the waterfront. They will be strongly resisted by the Waterside Workers Fedei ation, and instead of bringing about the better conditions that the Minister hopes for, they are more likely to aggravate the present problems, and to cause a good deal of hostility and antagonism. [5.37] I agree witb tlie honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey), that this clause will increase our industrial difficulties. I was interested to note the illustration given by the honoraMe member of loss of time resulting from bad administrative practices. It is obvious that if those who conduct stevedoring",44,Stevedoring Industry

128,Mr Thompson (Port Adelaide),"activities run tlieir businesses in sucb ii way, a mucb larger number of men will be used on tbe waterfront than is actually required. I sball give honourable members another illustration of inefficient organization of stevedoring activities. On the 5th June last, at Port Adelaide, the vessel Fort Phillip commenced discharging at 9 a.m. Gang No. ±4 started at No. 5 hatch discharging a deck cargo consisting of bags of asbestos. This operation was completed by 4 p.m. The gang then proceeded to -discharge bags of asbestos from the """"tween-decks, working until 5 p.m. The gang resumed work at S a.m. on Wednesday, the Gth June, and worked until 5 p.m. on the asbestos cargo. It resumed work at 8 a.m. on Thursday, the 7th June, and worked until 11 a.m., when the discharging of asbestos was completed at this hatch. The gangs at other hatches were also discharging asbestos. It was a cargo consigned to Melbourne and Devonport, but it had to be discharged to enable the cargo for Adelaide to be removed. At 11 a.m. on Thursday, the 7th June, nearly two and a half days after the job commenced, gang No. 44 -commenced discharging general cargo for Port Adelaide. This was completed by 5 p.m. on Eriday, the Sth June. The asbestos cargo then had to be reloaded on the vessel, and this work was not completed until 12 noon on Tuesday, the 12th -June. The operation of discharging and reloading the asbestos required 34 hours' working time, whilst the unloading of the Port Adelaide cargo occupied only thirteen hours. The Goverament complains about the slow turn-round of ships, while that sort of mismanagement is allowed to occur. If the Government intends to provide that the authority may register extra men if it is of the opinion that more men will be required than are provided by the port quota, the waterside workers already registered at that port must feel resentment. I have been told by waterside workers themselves, not by oflicials of the union, that some of the men who are admitted to the federation do not last a day in it. After a short experience of working conditions on the wharfs, they say, "" If this is waterside work I will have no more of it "" , and they walk off the job. The Government is mistaken if it thinks that it can build a bigger labour force on the waterfront simply by increasing the port quota. I do not want to labour the question, but I did wish to put on record the faets that I have just cited to the committee. loaded in the first place? whore it was loaded.

This is the sort of inefficiency that we see every week in our ports. authority. authority. I do not know which authority is responsible. The honourable member for Bendigo has just given the committee particulars of another such case, when if was necessary to remove a feAv bales of wool that had been Avrongly stowed, and the stevedoring company did not knoiv in which hatch the AVOOI had been loaded.

I agree entirely with the attitude taken by the Opposition in regard to this clause. ihe 1949 legislation, section 27 gave very wide powers regarding the employment of persons as waterside workers at a port at which a sufficient number of registered workers was not available. The provision that the committee is now debating is part of an attempt by the -Government to provide, in certain circumstanoes, that an additional labour force shall be available. There are other -clauses in the bill which are designed for tbe same purpose. These provisions are very precisely limited. They are not in the general form of the provisions in the 1949 legislation. The section that was inserted in the 1949 act for this purpose has been a failure. Enforcement of its provisions has not been possible. The Tait committee's report states definitely that a supplementary labour force could not be obtained under the 1949 legislation. The report of the Tait committee makes it clear that, as a result of the threats of larly when it com.e3 from a lawyer. the federation to bring about strikes and stoppages of work, it was not possible to -enforce the provisions of the 1949 act. That committee said that the federation has enjoyed what is in effect a monopoly of the right to supply labour in the industry. What the Opposition is really fighting against in regard to these clauses that deal with the supplementary labour force is the fact that its own provision was unworkable and that it suited the Waterside Workers Federation. fighting the battle for the federation, the Opposition is fighting for that organization to have a monopoly of the right to supply labour so that it may have supreme -control of the waterfront. That is what the Government is endeavouring to prevent.

148,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"Minis-whether the previous section authorized the practice that has been in vogue up to the present. The same explanation is true of clause 35. Sub-clause (1.) reads in partthe court may order the Authority to cancel the registration of the employer, or to suspend his registration lor such period, or at such times, as the Court directs, and thereupon the Authority shall cancel or suspend the registration of the employer accordingly. The amendment strikes out the words for such period, or at such times "", and -substitutes the words, "" until the expiration of such period"". I wish to oppose the amendment because I oppose the clause in either its early tform or its amended form . This clause is a distinct change from the corresponding section of the 1949 act. It is .also at variance with the recommendations of the Tait committee. Honourable members w ill recall that the 1949 legislation provided that waterside workers .and stevedoring companies should be disciplined in a similar manner for inefficiencies or breaches of their duties Hinder the act. Section 23 reads(1.) Where, after such inquiry as it thinks 'fit, the Board is satisfied that an employer(a) is unfit to continue to he registered as an employer; the Board may cancel his registration, or may -suspend his registration for such period as it thinks fit. Section 24 reads(1.) Where, after such inquiry as it thinks -fit, the Board is satisfied that a waterside worker(a) is unfit to continue to be registered as a waterside worker; the Board may cancel his registration, or may suspend his registration for such period as it thinks fit. Honourable members w ill notice that the method of dealing with the faults, 'breaches of duties and inefficiencies of the -employer and the waterside worker is the same in each case. I turn now to the Tait report. A t paragraph 83 the committee points outunanimously, as the Minister would saythat it is necessary to have discipline in the hands of the authority for employers as well as employees. I shall read the sentences upon which I rely. It statesThe Committee finds that it is necessary that the Statutory Authority should have power both to discipline registered workers and to discipline registered employers. In the case of employers, this sliould extend to such matters as failures on the part of supervisor and foremen, properly and adequately AndI emphasize the next phrasein the opinion of the Statutory Authority, to control and supervise the men allotted to them. In addition to deregistration of em plovers which is a power which obviously should be retained, a power to suspend or to fine would be proper to be included as part ol the system and would make for efficiency. The Government proposes, under this bill, that the method of dealing with waterside workers who f a l l down on the job, or breach their duties, shall be the same as it was under the 1949 act; that is, they are to be deregistered by the authority just as, under that act, they were deregistered by the board. If they are dissatisfied w it h that decision, they can appeal to the Commonwealth Industrial Court, but it is up to them to decide whether they will appeal. In the meantime, of course, they w ill be without their jobs and will have been dealt with summarily and, if you like, clandestinely, by the authority. Honourable members should note the different treatment which will.be accorded the stevedoring companies. It displays quite markedly the tender treatment which the Government seeks to give to the one side, and the unmitigated rigours of the treatment which it preserves for the other side. inember has a suspicious mind. been confirmed by the bill. member should look at the fines that are to be imposed upon offending employers. quite well that the clause does not follow the recommendations of the Tait committee. Further, it departs quite notably, significantly, and tenderly from the provisions of the 1949 act.",50,Tempobaby Chaibman Mb Tion To He Submitted Through Union

154,Mr Hakold Holt,"T h a t is not so.shake his head if he wishes, but let him compare clause 36, which sets out the summary treatment to be given the waterside worker by the authority, and the proceedings that have to be taken under clauses 34 and 35 for the disciplining of a stevedoring company. Under clause 34 the stevedoring company is only to be fined by the court. That may be fair enough and I do not cavil at it. sponding system employee. all, it is surely the comparison between the talent and the widow's mite. A fine of £100 and not more than £1,000 might well be a bagatelle to a stevedoring company, but utterly ruinous to a waterside worker. The Minister has not mentioned at any time during the second reading or committee stages, the fact that the Waterside Workers Federation imposes consistent and rigorous discipline upon its members a practice that the stevedoring companies have notoriously failed to adopt with employees and officers who have failed to carry out their duties. To return to clause 35: If the authority is of the opinion that a company should be deregistered it cannot act on its own motion, as it can in the case of a stevedoring worker. It must bring the matter to the court. The clause states thatIf the Court, on the application of the Authority, is satisfied that an employer regisdecision, despite tbe comment made and tered at a port is inefficient, it may deregister that employer. That is not carrying out the Tait committee's report which, of course, stated that it was necessary that employers who, in the opinion of the statutory authority had, through their supervisors and foremen, failed, should be deregistered. Here the Government is not permitting the opinion of the statutory authority to take effect, but is leaving it to the court to decide whether the statutory authority's opinion is satisfactory. That is a most marked, unjust and uniustifiable departure from the practice followed after the 1949 aet. and from the recommendation of the Tait committee. Let me point out that the Government has, for over three years, allowed the Stevedoring Industry Board to remain powerless to deal with employers. The powers to deal with employees have, of course, never been challenged. They have been effective, but in the case of The Queen versus the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board, ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Company Proprietary Limited-probabl y the most notoriously inefficient of the vast number of inefficient stevedoring companies in Australia-it of fines for the was held by the High Court that the word "" unfit "" did not apply to the company where only its stevedoring foremen had I agree, but, after been inefficient. The Minister will remember that, as a result of that decision, which was given on the 30th April, 1953 -mor e than three years ago-the board was deprived of its power to discipline the stevedoring companies. It was a notorious case. The stevedoring company did not know that some of its employees had gone off to an hotel and had been arrested before they could get back to the ship. The company did not know of the condition of the men or even of their absence. The board, because this was only the culmination of a series of inefficiencies and irresponsibilities on the part of theMelbourne Stevedoring Company Proprietary Limited, deregistered that company. The company went to the High Court, as it was entitled to do. The High Court said in effect, "" The sectionas at present phrased does not enable the board to do this thing"". Despite that the impotence revealed in the board'? fourth report for the year ended the 30th June, 1953, the Government did not amend the section for over three years. It has perpetuated this one-sided form of discipline on the wharfs. For the last three years, the board has been able to discipline employees and has been unable to discipline employers. Hereafter, the authority will still be able to discipline the waterside workers, and still be unable to discipline the waterside companies. All that it will be able to do will be to go to the Commonwealth Industrial Court and ask the court to discipline the companies. The clause changes the intention of the 1949 act. It leaves the authority",51,Tempobaby Chaibman Mb Tion To He Submitted Through Union

158,T H A T The Amendment ( Mr Harold Holt's),"ter for Labour and National Service and Ministerf or Immigration) [ 8 . 3 2 ] move That sub-clause (2.) be omitted with a view to inserting the following sub-clauses in place thereof:"" (2.) The suspension of the registration of a waterside worker at a port under the last preceding sub-section has effect until the expiration of such period, or of such number of working days at the port, as the Authority directs. "" (2A.) For the purposes of the last preceding sub-section, ' working day ', in relation to a which go round Parliament House, port, does not include a day declared by thc Authority, in writing, to be a day on which there has been a concerted failure by all or any of the waterside workers registered at the port to comply with a provision of this Act, an order or direction of the Authority under this? Act or an award of the Commission."". As I indicated during tbe debate on clause 35, my amendment to this clause follows the same general pattern as the amendment to clause 35. I take the opportunity to reply to what the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) had to say regarding the excess of tenderuess which, according to him, members of tlie Government have displayed in this measure towards the shipowners and the stevedoring companies. Of course, that is a statement easy enough to make, but very much more difficult to prove; and [ think the best answer that I can give to that charge is that had the Government wished to show any special tenderness to shipowners and stevedoring companies we should not have, at this time, a measure of this sort before the Parliament. My reason for saying that is that here we are setting about constituting, in a permanent sense, a waterfront authority, a government authority, when it is well and widely known that at all times the shipowners have been opposed to the existence or the continuance of any authority of this sort. ilfr. Ward able member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) may be sceptical about that statement, but I can assure him, as the Minister who has to weigh representations which come from a variety of quarters, that there has been very strong and consistent pressure, for years now, in favour of the abolition of any government authority to deal with stevedoring operaI tions. the pay-off. what the honourable member for Werriwa means. I gather that the phrase that he has used has rather more currency in New South Wales than in my own State of Victoria, if some of the revelations Sydney, are any guide. Here we have,, weighing the matter quite objectively and fairly, gone ahead to institute a waterfront authority under government auspices. The second comment I wish to make is that it is true that we have not followed precisely, in this matter, the recommendations of the Tait committee of inquiry. But that has not worked to the disadvantage of the employees in this industry, because the Tait committee recommended a system of fines to be applied to waterside workers. We found, on examining: the matter, that it was not practicable to institute a system of fines, imposable on employees, which would work satisfactorily ; but that has not inhibited us from instituting provisions for substantial fines ranging from £100 to £l,00f> which may be imposed on employers. do not mean anything to the employers. Iionorable member's view of the matter, but, when we included in another measure, in the pa3t, a provision that a union could be fined, an amount rangingfro m £100 to £500 for contempt of court,, we were not told by honourable gentlemen opposite that that was nothing to moan about-w e were told that it was the end interjecting, of the world. pass the cost of such a fine on to the public in charges. can collect it in fees.

There are other circumstances which, I suggest, indicate that what has been done here is the proper way to go about meeting the practical problems that we have had to face. First, the very fact of instision of the registration of employerstuting proceedings against a stevedoring company is itself damaging to the reputation and the commercial goodwill of that company. It is an important decision for the authority to make and, even if proceedings were unsuccessful, they could hardly fail to be damaging to the company or the employer concerned. The next point is that the act of susmust be taken to court, and that guaranpension of a stevedoring company, if it were to run over any period of days or weeks, would not have a direct effect only on the company concerned, and be damaging to it. We are not so much worried about that, but we are concerned about employees of that employer who might be quite guiltless in the commission of the offence. However, it would be hard to imagine a situation in which most of the employees were not entirely guiltless of the alleged offence. Yet, if an employer were suspended for a period of days, in all probability the employees in turn would be suspended by him, and so lose their employment. So we say that, whilst an argument can be based on the way in which these clauses appear in the bill, if the practical test be applied of what is a satisfactory way to go about dealing with the problems which have been posed for the authority, I think that most sensible people will say that this is about the best working result that could be produced in the situation. I have no hesitation in recommending the amendment to the committee. that the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) has moved his amendment and has entered into a general discussion of the clause, I think that the general debate on the clause might well take place on the amendment. The question of the adoption of the amendment can then be put to the committee, and the clause then be dealt with as a whole. The Opposition strongly objects to the differential treatment meted out under this bill, particularly through clause 36, to watersideworkers as compared with employers. Clause 33 dealt with the obligations of registered employers, clause 34 with thepunishment of offences by employers, and. elause 35 with the cancellation or suspenClause 36 deals with the cancellation or suspension of the registration of waterside workers. A comparison of the wording of this clause with that of clause 34 and clause 35 makes it very clear indeed that much more regard is had for the ordinary practices in these matters indealing with employers than in dealing with. waterside workers. The employer tees him a hearing of the whole of the facts in relation to the offence he is alleged to have committed. If the court recommends to the proposed Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority that his registration should be cancelled, theauthority can act on that recommendation. But, first, a charge must be made. Secondly, a hearing must take place and a court must be convinced that an offence has been committed. Thirdly, if the employer is convicted, a penalty is then, imposed upon him. His rights as an employer and as an individual are safeguarded by the court proceedings. However, in relation to waterside workers, the whole of this machinery is eliminated. It is not necessary that a charge should be laid against him, or that a court hearing should take place before a decision on the suspension or cancellation of his registration is made. Sub-clause (1.) of clause 36 merely statesWhore, after such inquiry as it thinks f it , the Autliority is satisfied"" . . The inquiry is limited to what the authority thinks fit. It has been found in the past that when, for some reason, a dispute has occurred on the waterfront, almost as soon as the men have ceased work they have been suspended. It is apparent that their side of the case has not been heard. In fact, in sub-clause (3.), the power to suspend before inquiry is conferred upon the authority.

But subclause (3.) providesThe Authority may, before holding an inquiry under this section in respect of a waterdual employer or of £1,000 imposed upon side worker, suspend tlie registration of the waterside worker and may at any time revoke that suspension. The suspension can take place before an inquiry has been held, and the right of the waterside worker concerned to earn his livelihood at his accustomed employment will be taken from him. It is true that a fine may be imposed upon an employer, but the waterside worker may suffer the worse punishment of being deprived of his right to continue his occupation. Until such time as the suspension is lifted, he will have no right to work upon the waterfront and will not be entitled to a call-up, to a pick-up, or to attendance money. In effect, he will be punished by the loss of his wages throughout the entire period of suspension, and this could be a very serious matter for him. sion was embodied in a Lahour measure. employer under the Labour act. I want to drive home is that, here, again, we have a division of power between a court and the proposed authority, which will make the position more confusing than ever. Because the employer must be taken before a court, he will have a protection not afforded to the employee. The employee can be suspended without an inouiry, and immediately he will lose his livelihood, whereas the employer, on. the other hand, must first be charged and taken before a court for a hearing. The court must convict him before a penalty can be imposed. But the penalty would not mean the loss of his business as a stevedore, because he may be fined and mav continue his business, whereas the waterside worker will suffer immediate cancellation of his right to employment upon the waterfront. While his suspension continues, he will not be able to earn a livelihood. The point raised .by my friend the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) is quite correct. The loss of the right to pursue his livelihood is a much more severe punishment than a fine of £100 imposed on an indivia stevedoring company. Such a fine would be neither here nor there to the employer. I repeat that we have thi division of authority which provides one form of trial for the waterside worker and an entirely different form for the employer. It confuses every one and will prevent the authority itself from exercising the control it ought to have. If provision is to be made for the suspension of persons engaged in stevedoring work, suspensions should be imposed in like manner, and with like force, upon both employer and employee by the proposed authority. For the reasons that I have stated, the Opposition proposes to vote against the clause. It is a bad one, and it should not have been included in tlv bill. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) made a very impassioned plea on behalf of the waterside workers. He said that this is an iniquitous clause which will deny the worker the right to work by depriving him of the right to a trial before a court.. I cannot see why the honourable gentleman objects to the clause, because it accords with union practice. When unionists declare a man a scab, they debar him from his work for life. I have mentioned this matteT several times in this chamber. Unionists at the present time are declaring shearers who are willing to shear at the award rates scabs, and denying them the right to work at their calling for the rest of their lives merely because they are willing to observe the terms of a legally ma dp award. Time and again, Opposition members have been told in this Parliament that their union practices do not stand examination in the lieht of day. Opposition members make a plea now on behalf of a man who may be suspended by the proposed Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, although his case wil] be tried by the authority. But they would force workers to join unions, and would then deny them, for the rest of their lives, the right to work at their",55,Pairs

Again the Minister says, "" If we took action to suspend the licence of the stevedoring company to operate on the waterfront, it would mean the loss of employment for some waterside workers"". Everybody knows full well that a waterside worker is not always employed by the same company. There is a rotation system operating on the waterfront. If it were possible to suspend the licence of a stevedoring company, it would not necessarily mean that the waterside worker would be out of work for any period. He could transfer to another stevedoring operator, as would be It is rather interesting to note that doring operator is not the real employer Everybody knows that the profits that",57,Pairs

Another point is that no individual person connected with a stevedoring company, or dependants of such a person, will suffer as a result of the imposition of a fine upon the company. If , however, a waterside worker is penalized, his family immediately suffers. immediately against his suspension. can appeal immediately. What happens if he does? The Minister has said that if the court upholds the appeal he w ill be paid for the period of his suspension. [ ask the Minister whether it is not a fact that if a waterside worker has been suspended for a period, and his appeal is then upheld, he w ill be paid only the attendance money for the days on which he was suspended, being equivalent to payment for two and a half hours work each. day. Does the Minister regard that as just and f a i r treatment? If a man's licence to work is suspended, which is really what w ill happen under the provisions of this legislation, and if the court subsequently upholds his appeal, then in order to do justice to that man he should be recompensed for any pay that he may have lost during the suspension period. know what we are arguing about.

For a start, he measure and the Minister is merely the did not say with any certainty that that agent of the shipowners in this Parlia7!: -[122 ] is the position. He said that it is what he believes to be the position. Furthermore, does the Minister suggest that the court works so rapidly in these matters that a man can appeal immediately? To whom does he appeal? He would even have to lose time in order to lodge his appeal. He would not be able to lodge it at his place of employment, where he is suspended from work. No matter how expeditiously the appeal is dealt with, he must suffer some loss of time. SoI say that if his appeal is upheld subsequently by the court, he should be recompensed so that for the whole period of his suspension he is paid at the rate at which waterside workers in employment are normally paid. That is the only just and f a i r way of dealing with the situation. He can appeal To show that it is no exaggeration to suggest that the stevedoring companies are agents of the shipping companies, we have only to refer to an address given on the 29th January last by MrA .

182,That The Amendment ( Mr Habold Holt's),"do not suggest that the Ministerf o r Labour and National Service( Mr HaroldH o l t ) has deliberately misled the committee, but if he cares to look at clause 37 he w i ll find that it is not in conformity with the information lhat he furnished to me when discussing an earlier clause. The Minister said that, if a worker were suspended, he could appeal immediately. The suggestion was that his case could be determined immediately and that he would be paid attendance money. Clause 37 (1.) readsWhere the registration of a person as a waterside worker is cancelled or suspended under the last preceding section, that person may, within fourteen days after the date of the cancellation nr suspension nr witliin such further period as the Court allows, appeal to the Court, by filing a notice of appeal in the prescribed form with the prescribed officer of tbe Court, against the cancellation or suspension and, upon consideration of any such appeal, the Court may confirm, vary or set aside the cancellation or suspension. In the first place, the appeal must be made on a prescribed form , and I assume that the form must be obtained at the court. Theni t must be filed with the prescribed officer. That all takes time.

I assume that he and his Whether or not the suspension is postcolleagues had the same considerations in poned is at the w ill of the authority, so mind then as we had in framing this prothat, if the authority does not feel disvision. We can conceive of cases where an posed to postpone the suspension of the appeal would be of suoh a frivolous and registration, it still operates and some vexatious character, designed to interfere days may elapse before the appeal is heard by the court. Even some weeks may elapse, because there is nothing to suggest that the court will set aside other matters with which it may be dealing so that these appeals may be dealt with to the good sense of those who w ill handle expeditiously. The worker may lose weeks of work as continued. The honourable gentleman has a result of the suspension of his registrachallenged my statement in that connection tion.

Eveni f the Minister is able to show that, under the terms of this measure or some other legislation, the worker may be recompensed by the payment of attendance money, I still say that he is not being given just and f a i r treatment. Before1 conclude, let me say that the Minister implied that, if the man appealed, the authority would automatically suspend the cancellation of the registration; but the bill now before us does not say anything of the sort. The word used is "" m a y "" . If the Minister wants to make it clear that the operation of the cancellation of registration shall be postponed automatically, he ought to substitute the word "" shall "" for "" may "".

184,Mr Haeold Holt (Higgins,"If I find that I am wrong in that understanding, I shall try to have the matter corrected hy this committee or in another place. My understanding is that, provided a genuine appeal is lodged, the practice is to defer forthwith the operation of the suspension, and then to deal with the appeal. If , when the appeal is heard, it is found that the suspension was improperly awarded, there is no question of any loss hy the appellant, unless he has delayed the lodging of his appeal. While I am on my feet, I should like to mention another provision, for the information of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam). When we were talking a little earlier about the question of differential treatment-it could be argued that that is continued in this provisionI stressed that, in the case of the suspension of a stevedoring company, there is involved, not only the company, but also the employees-perhap s entirely guiltless employees. But I did not stress that the people whose goods were being handled by the stevedoring company might be put to quite serious loss if , as a result of action taken against the company, the despatch of their goods were delayed for any length of time. SoI take the liberty to mention that fact now in passing, because I think it shows that although, on the surface, there may appear to be differential treatment and a lack of balance of justice, what has been done provides a practical answer to the kind of questions with which the authority will have to deal. We object to clause 37, despite the fact been taken in the budget session of 195S that the Minister for Labour and or in any session after that.

The Government has known remain in the hands of the authority. But the point is that section 25 of the 1949 act applied alike to employer and employee, whilst clause 37 of this bill applies to employees only. In case you have not the 1949 act before you, Mr Temporary Chairman, let me remind you that it provided that a person aggrieved by a decision of the board could appeal against the decision. Sub-section (2.) statedWhere a person appeals to the Court against the suspension of his registration as an. employer of waterside workers or as a water side worker, the suspension shall, subject to the next succeeding sub-section, continue in. operation. Sub-section (3.) provided that the board eould postpone the operation of the suspension. The word "" person"" in the section thus applied to both employer and employee.

The honourable gentleman knowsthat that is so. that the provision was unworkable.

Sir Eric Harrison what I have said, even for the benefit of the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison), who has just come out of his torpor. He comes into the chamber only to sleep. His slumbers will reverberate more resoundingly through Whitehall shortly. The Government cannot take refuge in the fact that the provision was unworkable. The High Court said that it was unworkable insofar as it did not make it specific that a company could be disciplined, deregistered, fined, or whatever you like, because of its failure to supervise employees. The High Court said that the word "" unfit"" as applied by the 1949 act to a company applied to the company's financial capacity, not to its managerial responsibility. So, as I have said, the Government cannot take refuge in the fact that the provision was unworkable, because it could have been made workable at any time during the last three years. Now we point out that the Government, in the first action that it has taken to make the provision workable as regards discipline for employers, has differentiated between employers and employees. In clause 37, it has retained those provisions of section 25 of the 1949 act which applied to employees and it has disregarded those which applied to employers. As the honourable member for Darebin( Mr R. W. Holt) argued so convincingly, there will be no equality before the law in the stevedoring industry. Employers and employees will not come before the new Commonwealth Industrial Court in equal positions. If the registration of an employee is cancelled or suspended by the authority, he may then appeal to the court. If he appeals, the authority may suspend, but is not obliged to suspend, the operation of the cancellation or suspension of the registration. If the court decides that the registration has been improperly suspended or cancelled, the employee may go back to work on the waterfront. But the Minister has not yet succeeded in pointing to any provision for the payment of compensation to the employee in respect of the period of wrongful suspension. On the other hand, under clause 35, interjecting, the employer may be brought before the court, but until and unless the IndusI shall not repeat trial court says that the employer shall be de-registered, he suffers no penalty whatsoever. The Minister has now suggested that it will be unfair to penalize or suspend an employer because of the hardship imposed on other people. He does not suggest that there will be any hardship to the shareholders, because, after all, they are shipping companies; he does not suggest that there will be any hardship to the waterside workers, because, after all, they are allotted by the authority to the stevedoring companies, and if the number of those companies is reduced, there are still other companies available. And surely it is not necessary to give immunity to the stevedoring companies in order to protect the rights of consignors and consignees. They have their remedies, and the stevedoring companies would not be precluded, by de-registration, from delivering goods which have already been delivered into their hands. They would be precluded only from continuing stevedoring operations, from putting things into ships and taking things out of ships, but if goods are already in their warehouses they can and should, of course, complete the delivery of them. Therefore, we point out that clause 37 continues this differentiation which was introduced in clauses 35 and 36. It will ensure that there is a penalty on the employees pending the hearing of an appeal against a suspension. No penalty or handicap will be imposed on employers pending proceedings by the authority before the court. Accordingly, we cannot support such differential proceedings as regards the two sides of this particular industry, and differential treatment of them before the court.

189,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),"would be lifted until the deterrnination of the appeal. It seems to me that this is a question upon which we should be clear. While the debate was continuing, I examined the amendment to the industrial arbitration legislation, which was mentioned this evening, and it does not touch upon this question at all. That amendment provides that the commission sball determine the attendance money. The authority may suspend it. Application for lifting of the suspension may be dealt with by the court, but the court maj not then make retrospective its decision on attendance money beyond the date of the lodging of the application for its restoration. That is quite a different matter altogether. If the Minister says that he will deal witli this matter in another place in such a fashion as to give effect to the point of view which he has put to the committee, I think that that will meet our objections. not proposing to make it mandatory upon the authority, because there may be what I would call vexatious or frivolous appeals. authority? the registration. powers nearly as extensive as those that the Government of which the honourable member was a member was prepared to entrust to a board.

It will be quite apparent from the discussion which has taken place earlier that this is one of the key I said that we are provisions in the legislation. It provides for the engagement in special circumstances of unregistered waterside workers, and it raises what we have come to describe as the supplementary labour provisions. The first amendment which I shall propose is in the nature of a rather pleasant surprise packet to honourable gentlemen opposite. Strong criticisms have been voiced by them of the supplementary labour provisions. When I met in Melbourne recently the representatives of the interstate executive of the Australian Council of Trades Unions and of the Waterside Workers Federation, great emphasis was placed upon this clause as one of the objectionable provisions in the bill. I pointed out at the time that what we propose in relation to supplementary labour follows closely the recommendations of the Tait committee of inquiry and includes, so far as we have been able to contrive, the safeguards which that committee suggested should a system of supplementary labour be introduced. It was put to me that two principal objections to these provisions are held by the trade union movement. The first is that they appear to violate the strongly held Labour principle of one-man-one-job. An objective examination of the provisions in the a measure and a consideration of their intention, should quickly dispose of any",63,Temporary Chairman Mb Majority 19

That is the second barrel of objection. Having regard to the fact that we propose to provide specifically that this work force may be used only at week-ends and after five o'clock in the evening, its use can hardly be said to violate the principle of one-man-onejob. Certainly more casual employment would be available to persons in other jobs, but I should be surprised to learn that there is any serious trade union objection to that, because it is common knowledge that tens of thousands, and perhaps hundreds of thousands, of trade unionists take casual work of one kind or another, either at week-ends or in the evening. order to survive under this Government. lot of poppycock. The honourable member knows that there has never been a higher average of weekly earnings in the history of this country than applies under this Government. The second objection is the one to which the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has given voice. It is the fear that this supplementary work force will be used as a strikebreaking force or, as he puts it, as a scab force. There are two quick answers to that proposition. One is that, by statute, these persons will be precluded from working other than at the times I have mentioned, so they could hardly be an effective substitute work force. Thc other is that we shall make provision in the legislation for the Waterside Workers Federation-to take these persons in as members of the union. So, on the one hand, there will be a lack of capacity to use them during regular working for the union to include them amongst its members if it so wishes. I shall not elaborate those answers, because I have given them to those persons who put to me the other point of view. However, it is at the moment quite apparent that whatever might be the logical strength of the answers to the fears that are held, concern is felt outside the Waterside Workers Federation itself. On Monday, I had a further conference-thoug h I suppose it was really in the form of a deputation-wit h representatives of the Australian Council of Trades Unions, led by the President, the Senior Vice President and Mr Gil Hayes. I was informed that they had been in touch, on this particular point, with a number of other members of the interstate executive. pretty well, as the honourable gentleman will find out if he has the patience to bear me. These gentlemen proposed that the Government defer the operation of this supplementary labour provision until such time as the Minister shall declare, but not earlier than the beginning of next year. The reason given was that the trade union movement was concerned about these unusual provisions; that we were setting up a new authority which would not become familiar with the conditions in the industry until some time had passed; and that we were taking power in other parts of the bill to do various things in relation to waterfront operations which might have the effect of reducing the need for a supplementary work force, or at least reducing its size. Moreover, it was submitted tht.l there were very good reasons for marking time on the implementation of this particular provision until the authority had a clearer and more realistic picture of the problems ahead. Frankly, I do not believe that the authority would have rushed in with any impracticable proposals, or in such a manner as to damage the interests of members of tbe federation, but I said that if it would ease the concern expressed by responsible representatives of the trade",64,Temporary Chairman Mb Majority 19

210,Mr E. James Haeeison (Blaxland),"employment in another industry on Saturday and Sunday, and to go back to their own job on the Monday is to destroy efficiency. It is all very well for Government supporters to say that it is done extensively to-day. I do not agree with that statement. There are great government authorities in this country which will dismiss a man who engages in any industry other than that in which he is employed by the government. Let honourable members make no mistake about that. Can a man be expected to work efficiently on Saturday and Sunday if he has worked efficiently from Monday to Friday in some other job? Government supporters have spoken in favour of efficiency in industry. If there is one way of killing efficiency, it is by inviting men to come into the waterside industry under the conditions set out in this bill. Under this bill the waterside worker will be required to work from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; somebody else will come in and do his job from 5 p.m. to 12 midnight; then the waterside worker will be expected to go back for the dog watch. 1 do not know anything that is calculated to upset the industry more than is this provision. If we are to adopt this sort of arrangement to meet spasmodic conditions prevailing in this industry, it is time for the remainder of Australian industry to examine carefully what is to be done. Honourable members may have read in this afternoon's issue of the Melbourne Herald of the labour situation in the port of Melbourne to-day. According to the report, the number of men in receipt of attendance money was the greatest in the last two years. In fact, 2,035 waterside workers received attendance money at the rate of 24s. a day because work was not available for them. The representatives of the shipping companies explained that the situation was due to the mid-winter slump in trade together with the effects of the import restrictions. More than 1,700 waterside workers were in receipt of attendance money in Melbourne yesterday. As against that, the number of waterside workers who offered for emmanian apple crop is frequently menployment in Sydney to-day was 363 less tioned in this chamber. Could not labour than the requirement. Does any honorto load the apple crop be organized in able membpr suggest that 363 additional the same wav as the shearing industry men should have heen engaged in Sydney is organized? Could not facilities be at 5 o'clock this afternoon to work the ships, when more than 2,000 men were paid attendance money in another port? I hear a Government supporter say that it does not work out that way. Of course, it does! I invite the honourable member to examine the report upon which this bill is based. Obviously he has not read it. The Tait committee made ita investigations and found that the question of transfer of labour had been before the court since 1950. An application had been made by both the employers and the Waterside Workers Federation. The committee found that the court had not done anything in the matter since 1950 and stated that for seven years the question of transfer had never been looked at. For many years, I was a leading member of an organization whose members were required to handle seasonal production. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Anderson) knows something about this matter. He is aware that in the wheat season, we had to provide an additional 300 men in the southern districts. We had also to provide an additional 500 men in the northern districts when the transport of wheat began. What was done? We had the central force from which we drew our men on transfer. It was a wonderful provision. The department met the situation, and provided accommodation at the various points so that the casual labour could be handled at the required centres and shifted from the north to the west, to the south, as required. No one will convince me that we shall get peace in the waterfront industry or satisfactory control of man-power in it until the court lavs down a set nf conditions that will result from the application of employers and employees in relation to transfer conditions and transfer allowances. I put it to the representatives of the graziers that they would not get their shearing done if it were not for the organized labour of shearers moving from the north to the south. The problem of handling the Tasprovided for waterside workers who were prepared to transfer in the peak season honourable member for Blaxland( Mr to the Tasmanian apple ports? If the E.

But until the court lays bill, that the honourable gentleman is wide down a code for conditions of transfer, the of the mark. He referred to a report in labour difficulty will not be solved. The this afternoon's issue of the Melbourne union and the employers must have their Herald to the effect that many waterside award in this field.

The amendment proposed by the Minister provides that this clause shall not come into operation until the 1st January next. ""Why did he not adopt the recommendation of the Tait committee in this respect? Why did he not set this part of the bill aside until the court has There is not now an unusually heavy determined the claim before it?

When that is done, we shall have no trouble in obtaining labour for Tasmanian ports in the apple season or for Queensland ports in the sugar season. The waterside workers, like railwaymen and everybody else, will meet the labour requirements, provided transport is offered and accommodation is available on their arrival. The waterside workers are human beings like other workers. I am convinced that this provision should not operate until the court has given its decision on conditions of transfer in accordance with the claim before it. have listened carefully to the speech of the section. be engaged.

211,Mr Turnbull (Mallee) [9.58],"IThat means that the circumstances referred to would probably be of short duration only. It is only in such emergencies that the extra work force would be employed. It certainly could not be employed, under this measure, when there was a surplus of waterside workers, as instanced by the honourable member for Blaxland in submitting his case. It has always appeared to me that the honourable meniber is tremendously fair in the attitude that he evinces in debates in this chamber, and I have appreciated hearing him on various occasions; but on this point he is very wide of the mark. As a person who has nothing to do with watersiders or the waterfront, I think it is only right that I should direct attention to his error. [10.1] I am amazed that such a provision as this should be included in the bill. The honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) a moment ago pointed out what a foolish thing this is. The provision is to operate only when there is an unusual volume of shipping in a port, and when tliere is an insufficiency of waterside workers to do the necessary work, thus necessitating the employment of extra men. The important point I want to put to the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) is that this provision is the very thing which will lead to waterfront stoppages. My reason for making that statement is that no waterside worker, any more than a coal miner or any other trade unionist, will concur in a system which means that he will work at ordinary rates of pay during the day whilst men from outside the industry are brought in to do night shifts and week-end work at higher rates of pay. Al l I can say is that whoever was responsible for this clause has a very poor knowledge of the trade union movement and of the psychology of the workers in industry. As I pointed out during the second reading debate, this provision postulates that when a port is busy, when there are more ships than can be handled by the normal pool of waterside workers, the waterside workers will work from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at ordinary rates of pay and outside workers will take over the night shifts and week-end work at penalty rates. The men who will be brought on as the extra work force will obviously be men who are not accustomed to doing the work of waterside workers, because otherwise they would not offer for such work. vision operates in England and New Zealand, and the Labour government which the honourable gentleman supported operated the same kind of provision during World War II . New Zealand, but that does not mean that it is a suitable provision for the Australian waterfront, or that it will do the job that the Government thinks it will do. In any event I am not talking about New Zealand, I am talking about the Australian waterfront. A few years ago a contractor was speaking to me about men engaged in the building industry. He said that they worked a five-day week and on Saturdays and Sundays did other jobs at high rates of pay, with the result that when they came back to their normal jobs on Monday they were not able to do them efficiently. And these men were men accustomed to doing the kind of work that they engaged in as an extra source of income on Saturdays and Sundays! But, in this instance, that will not be the position. The men who will be employed to do the night shifts and the week-end work on the waterfront will not be men who are used to waterside work. They will be outsiders. I can tell the Minister that at least 100 men will be needed to work on the hatches of any fair-sized ship, and I believe that the Minister has another think coming if he thinks for a moment that it will be possible to get sufficient men from outside the industry to handle the work on night shifts efficiently.",68,Temporary Chairman Mb Majority 19

214,Mr Thompson,"It may operate inThere is another objection to the provision. The Minister has said that this provision is to operate only in respect of work to be done between 5 p.m. and midnight on a working day. That is to say, the outside workers will not be allowed to work on ordinary shifts. The Minister knows very well that work after 5 p.m. attracts higher rates of pay than the normal, and that work on Saturdays and Sundays attracts still higher rates of pay. So the waterside workers are to be asked to work for the ordinary daily or hourly rates of pay, and, after they have knocked off at 5 o'clock, Monday to Eriday, or at noon on Saturday, outsiders are to come in and get the cream in the way of higher wages. effect of the provision, and the honourable to this provision. member knows it. The extra men are to be engaged only when waterside workers are not available in adequate numbers. numbers! And what does the Minister call adequate numbers? If he knows anything of work on the waterfront, or looks at the newspapers, he will know that on occasions there are not sufficient men for night shifts. Does the Minister mean to tell me that if there are not sufficient men to handle the night shifts the employers will have a ship standing idle during the day, when pay rates are normal, and work it at night when pay rates are high? to apply only where there is a bank-up lasting beyond five days. that. Iionorable gentleman's answer to the problem ? that this provision will make the position worse, not better. I quite appreciate the problem that the Minister faces, but I appreciate also that it is necessary for the as the men have to take it in the slump quota of watersiders in a port to be such as will ensure that each of them will get a reasonable amount of work, and also that when a big bank-up of shipping occurs extra work will be necessary. But waterside workers will not relish having to work at ordinary rates of pay during the day, when there is a bank-up of shipping, while outside workers receive high rates of pay for extra work outside normal hours. Tf the Minister think e that this provision is the only way in which to overcome the problem, I tell him very definitely that this is one of the things that the waterside workers will object to more than anything else. In saying that, I point out to the committee that I am not, and never have been, one of those who advocate stoppages of work. But I know the feeling of the men in relation to such matters as this, and I tion about what should be done. shipowners of this country cannot justly expect men to do the work wanted for the greater part of the year and then, when things are busy for a week or two. when there is a rush of shipping, agree to the employment of outside men at high rates of pay. The waterside workers would not agree to sueh a situation. We all know that there is a big rush of shipping into Australian ports, with goods from overseas, at times when there are big seasonal cargoes to be lifted for the return voyage. That occurs, for instance, after wool sales and during the wheat export season. But there are periods of the year when there is not a big flow of shipping. In fact, the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) told us of the position in Melbourne, where a seasonal slump was the reason why the men were getting only attendance money. These waterside workers are very human persons, and they hold that if they have to suffer during the seasonal slumps, and get attendance money only, when there is no slump the shipowner* should be prepared to take a bit of a kick periods. The waterside workers do not want the kicks.",69,Temporary Chairman Mb Majority 19

It is an outrageous situation when the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) continues to gag the discussion on important provisions in this legislation in order to prevent honourable members on this side fully stating tlieir case in opposition to what the Government is doing.

An invidious position would then be created. The Minister seems to think that as long as a man is a member of the union, he ought to be permitted to the union, in the eyes of the Minister he does not become a scab worker.

Therefore, I say to the Minister that, in preventing us from having a full discussion on the preceding clauses of the bill dealing with supplementary labour, he did not give the Opposition and other honourable members an opportunity to examine this clause thoroughly and to show exactly how vicious it is to provide for a supplementary labour force on the waterfront. The Minister knows full well that the reason the employers want a register of supplementary labour is because they want to hold that over the ""Waterside ""Workers Federation as a threat. In the event of the union striking or holding up shipping, because it has what it regards as a justifiable grievance that has not been rectified, this supplementary labour force will be ready to take over the work. That is the idea of the Government, of the Minister and of the authority. To show how much reliance can be placed on the word of thc Government and the Minister in regard to protecting the interests of the waterside workers, why does not the Minister admit that, whilst there is a provision in the bill that for 28 days after the use of supplementary labour, the waterside, workers honourable member is not speaking to clause 43 at all; he is speaking to a clause that has already been considered. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member is in order. It is fair comment. Mr ""WAED I was pointing out under clause 43, which we are now discussing, that where the supplementary labour is used on the waterfront, thc Minister believes that the Government has done sufficient by giving to the waterside workers, whose employment may be affected by the use of this force, a guaranteed wage for the following 28 days. But what is the guaranteed wage? It is ten times the daily appearance money for four periods of seven days. That means that for four weeks after the use of supplementary labour, the waterside workers will be guaranteed £12 a week. That is 13s. a week less than the prevailing basic wage. Does the Minister regard that as just and fair? Anybody who considered the idiotic proposals put forward by this Government could only come to the conclusion that it was doing so deliberately to cause a head-on collision with the waterside workers and the trade union movement. Anybody who has had any experience in industry would know that the supplementary labour force will never operate efficiently on the waterfront in this country nor will the trade union movement permit it to function. To suggest that the Government can put people on a register, and by putting them on a register the ""Waterside ""Workers Federation has to admit them to membership The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order!

I am interested to hear him say that, and I should be even more interested to learn that that was a point of view held generally by Opposition menibers, because, unless I am very much mistaken, what this bill provides is precisely what the Cahill Labour Government of New South Wales provided when it introduced the compulsory unionism legislation in that State. It forced unions to take into membership people who were subject to the compulsory unionism legislation. Therefore, whatever gloss honourable gentlemen opposite may care to put upon it, the principle has been established-and Opposition members have not merely accepted it ; they have propounded it. The honourable member fov East Sydney has suggested that the men who are thus admitted to membership of a union might have a right to vote at union meetings, nnd might have the same rights as other union members, even though they are casual employees, temporarily or even rarely engaged. Nothing that this Government has proposed would prevent fhe union from promulgating its own rules in relation to persons who came into the union as a result of the provisions of the legislation covering the supplemenUnions to disagree with the Waterside tary labour scheme. Such rules as might lxdm Ided upon specifically for supplementary workers could be challenged before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission only on the ground that they were unreasonable, or on some similar ground. There is nothing to prevent the union accepting persons engaged as union and prescribing reasonable rules as to the rights, privileges, opportunities and responsibilities that the supplementary worker should enjoy or accept. The honourable member for East Sydney took the opportunity provided by his line of argument on this clause to make a general attack on the supplementary labour provisions. I have indicated earlier the reasons why we believe such a scheme to be both practicable and desirable. I have already pointed out that this scheme is operating, without causing any upset to trade union thinking, in New Zealand, and in the TJnited Kingdom. It operated here, under the blessing of a Labour government, during the war years, when it was felt necessary to supplement the work force on the waterfront. Quite apart from its merits, which need not be argued further at this stage, I have already proposed an amendment to the bill which has the effect of deferring the operation of the provisions until the 1st January, 1957, at the earliest, which will leave an interval during which the authority may consider fully any possible alternatives which may provide a solution to the problem that the supplementary labour scheme is designed to solve. [10.34] -If the Government wished to see the Australian Council of Trades Unions ranged behind the Waterside Workers Federation, it could not have done anything more calculated to achieve that end than introduce a bill containing a clause such as the one that we are now debating. Tho Australian Council of Trades Unions represents every union in Australia, with the exception of the Australian Workers 'Union, to which I shall refer in a moment.

Minister going to tell the Australian Workers Union that because a shearer works for only three or four months of the year he cannot be charged the full annual subscription laid down by that union? There is no provision in the union rules for any subscription but an annual one. If the Australian Council of Trades Unions allows this kind of legislation to be accepted without demur, it will not be long before the meat workers union, some members of which are casual workers in a seasonal occupation, will be told by this Government, with the present legislation as a precedent, that it has no right to fix subscription rates which the Government believes are not reasonable. What right has the Government to tell a union what fees it shall charge? What right has it to say what persons a union will admit to membership? I say, therefore, that the congress of the Australian Council of Trades Unions, which will meet next week, should take heed of the threat to the whole strucplace, having been chosen to support the ture of trade unionism in this country that lies behind this legislation, and should rally its members to the aid of the Waterside Workers Pederation in order to prevent this kind of legislation being put on the statute-book. very fact that when such a reference is made, the Minister, sitting at the other side of the table, attempts to intimidate me and to prevent me from saying what he knows is true is indicative of his intenreversing it, if it is the popular will that tions in relation to the Waterside Workers Federation. If he is prepared to come here and to attempt to intimidate an elected representative of the people of Australia, we have a fair idea of his real intentions towards the people outside the Parliament who have not the protection of parliamentary privilege.

We come to this institution to which we have been elected. The purpose of a parliament is to prescribe, by a majority decision, the laws that shall govern a democratic society. Of course, not every decision will be The acceptable to every member of that parliament, but it will be acceptable to a majority of members. Those members who do not like a certain decision may avail themselves of democratic methods of it should be reversed. They may campaign against the decision and seek a vote of the people so that they in turn may be in a position of authority and may repeal or amend the legislation in the manner that seems to them to be proper under the circumstances. Buti f a parliament passes certain legislation, it is a bad thing for one of its members to go out and to incite and inflame people who live in that democracy and encourage them wilfully to disobey what the parliament has, by majority decision, determined.",75,Paibs

275,"""Motion (By Mr Harold Holt ) Put;","Clause 44 workers, & c ) . Opposition opposes this clause for somewhat similar reasons to those on which it based its opposition to clause 43. This elause co%ers the boycott of waterside 7 workers, and makes prohibitions in respect of certain matters, and also makes it an offence for any person to prevent, hinder, or dissuade persons from doing things which are specified in the clause in paragraphs (a) to ( A ) . Sub-clause (2.) provides :A registered waterside worker shall not, without reasonable cause or excuse, refuse to nccept employment or perform work in -stevedoring operations with another person who is a registered waterside worker or is employed as a waterside worker by virtue of section forty of this Act. Apart from any other considerations, subclause (3.) would have received very strong opposition from both the Opposition and the trade union movement. It readsTn proceedings for an offence arising under either of thc last two preceding sub-sections, proof of reasonable cause or excuse lies upon tlie person charged. Therein we have, unmistakably and clearly, a proposed application of the averment clause to persons who are accused of dointr, any of the things which the clause prohibits. The Opposition says, first, thpt tbe elause is intimidatory and coercive in character. The committee has accepted the provisions contained in clause 40 for the creation of a supplementary labour force. It was obvious to those persons who drafted the bill that, clause 40 was bound to cause the eravest discontent on the waterfront and that it would be strongly resisted by t""p watprfront un'om. particularly the ""Waterside Workers Federation. So, in order tn overcome the expected strong opposition of the Waterside Workers Federation, two clauses have been inserted with the object of coercing and forcing the federation into accepting the supplementary labour force. The first such provision is contained in clause 43, the object of which is to compel the union to accept persons as members at (Boycott of waterside a lower fee than would be ordinarily charged to a member. An attempt having been made to tie up the matter of compulsory membership of the union, nomatter how the union may object, the next step is to prevent any action being taken by the union or any of its members to defeat the organization and employment of a supplementary labour force. Finally, there is to be placed upon the person who is charged with an offence arising under the provisions of the clause the onus of proving reasonable cause or excuse. So, there is to be brought into operation a species of law that one finds generally being applied to workers under conditions that are operating to-day. Such a provision is contained in theCrimes Act and elsewhere. Where there is expected to be difficulty in proving a charge against a person, the easy way of overcoming the difficulty and ensuring the greatest possible measure of either persecution or prosecution, is to bring into operation an averment provision, whicb throws upon the accused the responsibility of proving himself innocent of the charge. The honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) this afternoon made a very impassioned speech on liberty and protection of a person's rights to British insfice. It w ill be interesting to see how the honourable member reacts to this proposal that persons, who are charged under clause 44, will have to prove their innocence instead of the persons charging them having to prove their guilt. To introduce such a provision into legislation of this description is only to add to the provocation which the legislation is bound to cause. Obviously if the Waterside Workers Federation considers that the creation of a supplementary labour force is detrimental to its economic interest and the maintenance of the livin g standards and livelihood of its members, it w ill resist the creation of that force. Because of its resistance it w ill be prosecuted under clause 44, which provides a penalty, for a body corporate, of £500 -whic h presumably would be the penalty imposed on the union-and £50 for individual workers. If anything is more likely to create complete disruption of work on the waterfront, I should like to know of it . Clauses of this description",79,Pairs
276,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [11.2],"Th eare designed to coerce, blackmail or force tbe Waterside Workers Federation into .accepting legislation wbicb is inimical to the federation's interests. Had the gag not been applied to the discussion on -clause 40, we could have said further things on this matter. If one had the -opportunity, one could explain very fully how the operation of this clause will disrupt the waterfront. This clause is designed to coerce a worker into a position where anything he does to protect his livelihood and the interests of his organization places him in danger of being charged with an offence, which need not be proved against him. He must prove his innocence. If that sort of condition is to be imposed upon a very difficult and turbulent industry it will result, not in a greater amount of work being done, but in a stoppage at the port where it is applied, and if it is applied at We have been cursed by a bad waterfront more than one port, a general stoppage throughout Australia. Once again, I feel obliged to remind the committee that coercive legislation cannot harmony between employer and employee. Coercion on the part of either the employer or the employee has never improved industrial relations. To use the law to penalize those who resist something that they believe to be an economic evil, and likely to affect their livelihood, merely brings about a condition of affairs that will become more and more inflammatory and, in the end, result not in more expeditious handling of shipping, and a better feeling on the waterfront, but in no ships being handled at all. 1 conclude by warning the committee of the consequences that are bound to flow from the application of clause 44' to the waterside industry. As a trade union official, I would urge niy members to fight against such a clause if it were directed at my organization, and therefore I oppose the clause. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bowden) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr were used during the two wars, and have Clarey), indeed almost every Opposition member who has spoken, has said thnt the bill is likely to foment trouble on the waterfront. As clause after clause is discussed we hear exactly the same thing. Honourable members opposite insist upon forgetting that this country is plagued with the worse waterfront industry in the world, and it is high time that it had a better one. That is why the Government has taken this action. AVe have plenty of time in which to see whether the proposal will work. It is important that it should work satisfactorily, because every home in this country is affected by conditions on the waterfront-and 95 per cent, of homes are those of workers. The Australian waterfront has held us to ransom for 50 years, but not once have Opposition members had a word to say about the unfortunate individual who owns the goods that are being shipped from this country. Their whole interest is centred on the union, but I remind them that the union is not above the law. performance from both sides of the industry. For heavens' sake, let us look at the matter in a new light. Surely the unproduce fortunate individual who sends goods overseas, or imports them, has some rights in this matter. It is time that they were protected in this Parliament. We do noi know what will happen when the bill becomes law, but we should try to achieve some form of control because so far not one government has succeeded in giving us an efiicient waterfront industry. Every paragraph of this clause is designed to force men to refrain from taking action to protect their working conditions. Many people believe that waterside work is confined to that which one sees on the surface, but I remind honourable members that those who work below need years of training, because their work involves a great deal of danger. For that reason, if the men on the job believe that the equipment should be repaired before they use it, they should be able to insist upon it. Under the bill, they would be liable to a penalty for doing so. All honourable members are aware that a number of old ships, which been registered in Panama by American and British companies, have such rotten rigging that its use would endanger the lives of waterside workers. In a case",80,Pairs
277,Mr Andebsoct (Hume) [11.12],,81,Pairs
278,Mr Bbuce (Leichhardt) [11.14],"which I recall recently the men said that they would not begin work until repairs were effected. Under this clause such action would bring forth a penalty. The clause mentions "" a person "" so that the individual waterside worker is to be affected. On the other hand, there is not a word about the shortcomings of the shipping companies. One cannot blame the Minister, who was too young at the time, for not remembering what happened in the great maritime strike earlier in our history. However, one can blame the Minister for not studying, before bringing forward this legislation, what has happened in the past. The maritime strike was brought about because the employers of the day tried to impose on the waterside workers the conditions that this bill tries to impose upon tliem now. The whole of tlie Australian maritime industry was thrown into idleness, because the men would not stand for that sort of thing. F thought that we had become better educated, and more broad minded, than we were in those days. I did not expect that any government would introduce a clause such as this which will render every waterside worker who stands up for his rights liable to a penalty. After all, a man who is not game to stand up for his rights is not worthy of his name. Like the Erench kings, the Government has never learned the lessons of history. Among Government supporters are a great many whose ancestors landed in this country in the early days and "" squatted"" so that they might get a title to land. Subsequently they were granted a licence for about 6s. 8d. and eventually founded a wealthy aristocracy, which believed that the workers should have no rights at all. Many first-class citizens were sent out here as convicts because of the surplus population in Great Britain. Later, free men came out to this country to work under the new conditions and get away from those that existed in the Old Country. Employers of the same type also came here. Those people developed and opened up our country, and the ruling class that emerged then is still with us. I have in mind the old school-tie type, who think that the workers have no rights at all. Good heavens, I have lived amongst them! They are, in the main, men of excellent character. Many of them have families and, because of the interest that they have displayed in their children's education, many of their children have entered the professions. This legislation, will cause people outside the WatersideWorkers Federation to think that the members of that organization belong to the criminal class. The restrictions placed on them by this clause will, if they stand up for their rights, make them criminals. Mr Temporary ChairmanT h a t t l ie question he n o w p u t . The committee divided.

282,"Chambers, O. Mr Ward (East Sydney) [11.34]","Harold Holt) cannot say has appeared in earlier legislation. It is an entirely new provision. It is an escape clause which permits the authority to avoid all of the responsibilities that it. has in the terms of the earlier sections of the legislation. If this clause were carried, even in its amended form, it would still mean that the authority need not consult the parties. It could make orders without consultation and those whom the orders would affect could be heavily penalized without their having any consultations with the authority at all. I do not know how the Minister can argue that this is a reasonable provision to put into the legislation. The bill is bad There is no doubt that the amendment, enough, surely, as it is. The bill, in the preceding . clauses, provides for at least some consultation-limite d to people whom the authority thinks fit. I take it that the purpose of the amendment is at. least to give the union an opportunity of uominating a representative with whom the authority may confer. Of course, the authority may not deem it necessary to confer. Therefore, it could avoid the provision for consultation. When I refer to this as an escape clause I mean that all the earlier provisions of the bill which have been represented by the Minister as protections for the trade unions viewpoint, being designed to ensure that the union will be consulted, cau be torn up as far as the authority itself is concerned. The Opposition can see no merit in this provision at all. As[ have said, we think that this is an entirely bad piece of legislation from cover to cover, and this particular provision makes a bad bill even worse because the trade union representatives, if given the right to consult or confer with the authority, may have been able to influence the authority on occasion. The union representatives may have been able to 3how the authority that some of its orders were ridiculous. But now the authority ueed not worry about the viewpiont of the organization at all. The members of the Waterside Workers Federation are the men who will have to work under this legislation. At least, that is the intention of the Government but, in my opinion, there will be a cessation of work should the Government attempt to apply this legislation. The aim of the Government is to compel the waterside workers to work under this legislation. All of its provisions refer to waterside workers, yet their organization or their officials who are elected to represent them can be completely disregarded by the authority. I think that this is an entirely bad provision. It is a new provision, which has been introduced by this Government and it does not appear in any earlier legislation. Therefore, I believe that the Opposition is adopting the right attitude in opposing the clause entirely, even with the amendment submitted by the Minister. that the Minister has put forward represents a sort of sugar-coating for the pill. It might appear that the union had some rights-that it could select representatives to confer with the authority. The unioncan select its representatives in accordance with the amendment carried by the committee but that amendment will only give the union the right to select representatives. The amendment will not give the union the right to see that it is consulted on any orders made by theauthority. I support the attitude of the Opposition in strongly opposing the provision. clause after clause, hour after hour, and day after day, we have heard the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) give reasonable explanations for unreasonable actions. That is the keynote of this whole exercise in parliamentary debate. The Minister has taken what we have offered from this side of the chamber in a very commendable spirit, considering the position in which he has been placed by the drafting of this legislation and the little support that he has received from his cohorts on the back benches. I listened to the view that he put, and it sounded reasonable. But I should again like to make the point that I made yesterday, whicb is that the Minister cannot expect always to be the Minister for Labour and National Service. At some time, certain of the other people who have expressed sentiments such as those expressed last night by honourable members during the",83,Bowden May Be R E A D I L Y Communicated W I T H By The

Here, at the tail end of the bill, we see, finally, the duties and responsibilities that lie on the 26,000 waterside workers who have to face up to their duties to the country by continuing to work on all and every occasion demanded of them; whose union's rights are to be taken away on all and every possible occasion; who w ill be expected to sacrifice themselves to the community; who will be paid attendance money only when there is a surplus of labour and there is no work for them to do; to whom the community as a whole accepts no responsibility; and to whom, finally, the authority to control their destiny accepts no responsibility. I heard the Minister address to the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) a criticism that he was being irresponsible in putting the viewpoint of the Labour movement. House Avill continue to put that point of view; and if the Government continues to produce pieces of legislation like this measure, which contains 34 page3, of challenge to the trade union movementthe movement which has a record of 60 years of comradeship and constructive developments of the nation-it will be looking for real trouble. word.

This is the sort of sensible and reasonable provision made in a bill to avoid any omission made in good faith from invalidating orders which might have important consequences for persons affected by the legislation. It is also designed to meet the situation which, as [ said earlier, could arise if one party remarks he has addressed to this clause or the other refused to consult, or deliberately withheld himself from a position of consultation with the authority. That could make the work of the authority completely impracticable. going to act in regard to persons who have Parliament for discussion of the legislabeen prosecuted and fined and the action of the authority is afterwards found not to have been carried out in accordance with the act? able gentleman will see, it relates to the requirement of consultation in the making of an order, not consultation so far as a penalty is concerned. make an order. Somebody might disobey that order and be prosecuted and suffer a penalty. Then it is discovered that the authority has not carried out the requirement of consultation. Would the person concerned be refunded his fine? that in those circumstances the authority would take that into account as one of the important factors bearing on the course it should follow. If it came to the conclusion that had -it gone through the process of consultation it would not have made the order which led to a penalty, then it might very well withdraw the prosecution or remit the penalty, as the case might be. If it found on examination that that was not really relevant to the course which it had followed or had no material bearing on it, then I imagine it would allow the* position to remain unchanged. This prodeliberately to insert into the legislation. I consulted the draftsman in relation to came to the conclusion that it was desirable to have a saving provision of this kind in the bill. For that reason I am not prepared to accept the request that has been put forward by the Opposition that the clause be deleted. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) in the few implied that the legislation had received the approval of some trade union leaders.. at all. Do not misinterpret me. I said; they had expressed appreciation of the time the Government had allowed to thetion. That does not commit them to supporting or opposing the bill. teresting to know when they expressed that opinion, if it was expressed at alllike to know. I venture the opinion that the Minister only threw that in to bolster up a very weak bill and a very weak argument. How would the trade union leaders know what time was to be allowed for the discussion of any section of this bill? The Minister has gagged half of the debates that have taken place. Did he tell the trade union leaders that he was going to gag the debate on important provisions of the bill ? member ever heard of the guillotine ? used the guillotine.",85,Bowden May Be R E A D I L Y Communicated W I T H By The

301,Mr Ward,"The Minister has notmember's government did more than onee on a measure of this kind. this Government's action in connection with this measure. Now, let us turn to what the Minister referred to as a protection for trade unionists. He said that if one of the parties will not confer, or if one of the persons who are nominated as a representative will not confer, this clause gives the authority the opportunity to proceed. But does not the Minister recognize that no trade union whose members are affected, or are likely to be affected, by an order of the authority, would refuse to confer? That is a ridiculous argument to advance. No responsible trade union would refuse to confer on the making of an order that is going to affect its own members. Therefore, it must be obvious that the intention of the particular clause is not for tlie purpose of meeting a situation sucb as that outlined by the Minister, but to give an opportunity to the authority to refuse to confer with the trade union representatives whenever it might desire to do so. Now. the Minister says that there is no danger to the trade union movement because it will have a representative on the authority. He has not told us who has been selected. I understand from my reading of the reports that the Government does not propose to eive the Waterside Workers Federation the opportunity to select a representative nn the authority, although they are the men who will be directly affected. Why was that decision made by the Government? Has the Government already selected somebody who is ready to move in as the employees' representative on the authority? Surely the. trade union concerned ought to be consulted on the matter of who the representative of the waterside workers on the authoritv is to be! appointed to the authority is supposed to protect the interests of the workers. According to the Minister that is the reason for having him there-so that he can protect the interests of fhe employees. If it is the real intention of the Governthat Mr Haddy and' the shipowners want ment that this representative is torepresent the employees and to protect their interests, then the trade union movement is the right body to make theselection, especially the trade union whose members are affected. But the Government has no intention of consulting the trade unions. It wants to disregard the trade union movement completely. How will the Minister proceed to make the selection of the gentleman to represent the trade union concerned, with the knowledge that he has in a very limited field ? How will heselect a man, outside the union, who will be qualified to occupy the position of representative of the employees? The men able to judge matters that affect the employees are the men who actually work in the industry, who know conditions in the industry. These men know who isqualified to represent them. Why does the Government specifically exclude from membership of theauthority, as the representative of theemployees, any member of the Waterside Workers Federation? It is obvious that the Government has already selected, the members of the authority, and that it is waiting for this legislation to be passed, when it will let us know whom it has selected. The Minister should get right out of his head any idea that the trade lurion movement will be satisfied that because some person has held a position in the trade union movement, or has had some association with the movement, and may be personally approved of by the Minister, he will be acceptable to thetrade union movement. SoI say, even at this late stage, that the Government has shown clearly that its intention is not to do anything for the protection of theworkers in the industry. The Minister said, referring to this clause"" This is not the provision I wanted in the legislation."" But he is the Minister who introduced the legislation! When we were in office we went through uvery clause of bills that were to be brought before the Parliament, and we did not have provisions forced on us, as this provision hasobviously been forced on the Minister.. If he did not want clause 55 in the legislation, who wants it included? I suggest",86,Bowden May Be R E A D I L Y Communicated W I T H By The

C. That the bill be now read a second time. This measure is designed to give further assistance to the cellulose acetate flake industry. This industry was established in Australia very largely as a result of the encouragement given to the company concerned by the Chifley Labour Administration, which helped very considerably in the initial stages of the establishment of the industry. The company has been helped substantially since by acts of the Parliament. Honourable members on both sides of the Parliament support the payment of a bounty to enable this product to be produced in Australia at a price that will allow it to compete with similar products sold in this country and produced by big combinations of capital in other parts of the world. Cellulose acetate flake is the material from which another company manufactures rayon yarn. Both the rayon yarn manufacturing company, which depends on the Australian-made cellulose acetate flake, if its price is less than that of the imported product, and the company which manufactures the flake, naturally favour the payment of the bounty. Both companies approached the Tariff Board with a request for assistance to their industries. They, have received it in the past. They have now made a further request for help, and the Tariff Board has recommended that it be given by means of bounties. The Opposition supports the measure. Nevertheless, 1 think we should criticize the frequency",89,Adebmann

In other words, they say to the Australian taxpayers, en masse, "" Every one of you is expected to pay us something to ensure that our industry will show a profit at the end of the year "". investigated by the Tariff Board. the honourable member says, that we have a Tariff Board to investigate all these applications. I may say that I am an admirer of the chairman of the board, who has great capacity and great industry. We are lucky to have a man of such outstanding qualities as chairman of the board. We are fortunate, also, that we have a reasonably good board under such a chairman. But, just because we have a very capable Tariff Board to which the captains of very large aggregations of capital can come and state the reasons why the people of Australia should pay them a bounty, it does not necessarily follow that this Parliament should always, meekly and without criticism, either acquiesce in the recommendations of the Tariff Board or accept, willy-nilly, that my remarks have some significance. the blandishments and the requests of these concerns. I know that, if Australian industry is to be adequately protected and enabled to help build this great Commonwealth into the powerful nation it is capable of becoming, bounties and duties are, in many instances, inevitable, as they have been in the past. No party has been more generous in providing that assistance than has the Labour party. However, I utter a word of caution and point out that there are in this country many small people who from time to time enter industry and take up all sorts of businesses, but, because in the initial stages of their enterprises they cannot make pronts and because the banking institutions controlled by the States and the Commonwealth, as well as private banks, do not see fit to give them the essential nnanciai assistance in the early years of their existence, they topple over by the hundred. R -[123 ] Every year hundreds of them go out of business, but their passing is hardly noticed. Yet those who occupy the treasury bench in this House are continually prating about the success of private enterprise. If they were to make an assessment of the number of small people who go into business every year and fail, thereby losing their life's savings, they would be staggered at the result. Such people have no means of obtaining assistance, financial or otherwise. They take risks in entering business and fail. They have faith in their own capacity and they give of their best; but because of the unplanned economy which is part of our system of society, they are forced out of business. They do not go insolvent or bankrupt, but they lose their life's savings, and they generally lose the savings of some of their friends who have advanced money to them without security. No assessment of such people is ever made by Ministers, and yet they continually prate about the failure of socialism and so forth. able member going to take ? as I can get away with, and I suggest member desire to be stopped? I believe that at present I am making a very pertinent point in this debate. There are not only thousands of individuals who have the experience of having to relinquish their enterprises every year and go right to the wall; there are also thousands of small concerns which, over long periods of years, operate with no margin of profit at all and their net income in many cases is substantially less than that of basic-wage earners. They live in the expectation that some day the fairies will be good to them and they will become financially successful. Great companies, such as the company concerned in this measure, which I believe is the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, have plenty of assets and can raise capital on the security of those assets.

A man running a small furniture factory, for example, and employing himself and two or three other men, might go to the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Allan, I a n Osborne) and say, "" Look here, my boy, I Anderson.

I say that too little consideration has been given to them in the past by any government, and no consideration at all has been given to them by the present Government. In those circumstances, my warning is issued for the reason that I think that not Bryant. G.

326,Mr Casey,"On the 30th May, thea position in favour of, or critical of, these policies, which cover a vast range processors of political, economic and social affairs, because we consider that the United Nations do not have the competence to their needs during these seasons? discuss such domestic matters of member States. I u 1953 and in 1954, the Assembly honourable member's questions are a?decided to extend the life of the comf ollows:mission for another year, and called for further reports. The commission's third report was before the Tenth Session of tomato paste was approved iu both years. the Assembly. Discussion in committee culminated in the adoption, despite the tomato-growers varied as between States and opposition of Australia, Belgium, Canada, were as follows in the main growing States:the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom, of a recommendation that the life of the commission be extended for a further year. After the adoption of this resolution in the committee, the South African Government withdrew its delegation from the Assembly. When -he committee's resolution was considered m plenary, the paragraphs of the resolution dealing with the continuation of the committee did not receive the necessary two-thirds majority and were therefore not adopted. Hence, the commission .mat out of existence. The other paragraphs of the resolution were adopted. As the resolution adopted did not decide that this question should be discussed at a subsequent session of the Assembly, there will not be any discussion at the next session of the racial policies of the Union Government unless a member State so requests and the Assembly agrees. I would hope that no member would so request, as further discussion of this matter in the Assembly would not only be contrary to the Charter, but also could not be expected to contribute to a solution of the problem. Australia will continue to oppose such discussion.
