I will refer again to the subject of the dividing line. between the Labour party and the Ministerialists. On the one side are the friends of private enterprise, and on the other the persons who, according to the right honourable member for East Sydney, believe in State monopoly, which, however, I define as State regulation. Yesterday I dealt with some of the phases of private enterprise in its successful forms. I may add a little to what I said last night before altogether dismissing the subject. I was asked what the Ministry were to infer from some remarks which I made-meanin g whether it was to be inferred that every member of the Labour party, or the party as an organization, was opposed to private enterprise. I have never heard a member of the Labour party offer any objection to legitimate private enterprise! I have never heard any objection raised to the ordinary trader. heard members of the honourable member's party describe private enterprise as private robbery. some of its successful forms-rings , trusts, combines, ""honourable understandings,"" rebates, and such like-is robbery. the honourable member. gentleman who interjects helps them all the time. that agreement. I come back again to the remark I was making, that the particular interjection which I quoted tended to give some members of the Labour party say dial private enterprise generally is private robbery. Now, that statement, without qualification or without explanation, is not justified. mark made, the interjection ' was quite justified. sure that the remark has never beerc made without some kind of explanation. I say again, from an inside knowledge of the Labour party-and it is peculiar that persons outside our ranks profess to know have been inside. feature to those outside is the way in which the members of that party keep running away from their programme since they became politicians. member ought not to lead me to make remarks in a direction that I do not desire to pursue; but he ought to be the last to talk about running away from programmes or parties. I say again that I have never heard a member of the Labour party raise the slightest objection to legitimate private enterprise. I have never heard them raise objection to private enterprise as portrayed by the farming community, for instance. On the contrary, we stand to-day. as the one party, with a definite proposal by which this country could be peopled by primary producers, by which the number of our producers could be materially and successfully increased. We stand as the one party in that direction; and consequently there is no objection on our part to private enterprise of that description. Neither is there the slightest objection toprivate enterprise as pursued by the ordinary trader, the shopkeeper, and others who facilitate the general working of the business of our nation. But there is, and I hope there always will be, an objection on the part of our party to that form of private enterprise which even the Minister himself, by means of a catechism, has been obliged to admit is robbery of the people. But there was no definition yesterday.

47,Mr Roberts,"Really, the honorableterial side of the House; and the policy of State regulation is represented by the party to which I belong. May I give emphasis to our view of private enterprise, by quoting a statement made by Sir -William Crookes, one of the leading scientists in England? He gave an address before one of the learned societies some time ago, in which he exposed gambling on the wheat exchanges, which, as we know, portrays private enterprise in its most successful aspect. Sir William Crookes described the wheat exchanges of the United Kingdom and of the world as gambling dens. He said, in effect, that the world's wheat crop was gambled for in the form of "" futures "" and "" options,"" and he deplored the fact that the food of the world should be made the subject of this kind of excessive gambling. He pointed out that it was to the interests of the gamblers that the market should be depressed at. one time and inflated at another. He went on to sayI f this gambling element could be eliminated the risks of the trade would n'ot be nearly so great. What did this gambling spirit spring from? Not from a desire to render service to the people, but to obtain something for nothing. Just as parasitism was dangerous to physical health, so parasitism was dangerous to social health. If a cancer grew it was at the expense -of the organism in which it was incorporated. If a gambler succeeded it was at the expense of some one else. If a farmer succeeded it was because he exploited Nature; if a wheat farmer in ordinary competition succeeded it was because we had assisted the farmer to exploit Nature; but if a gambler succeeded it was not because he had assisted somebody else to ex. ploit Nature, but because he had exploited somebody else. Gambling in wheat is one form of private enterprise, indulged in to an extent that is positively appalling. Will the Minister of Defence favour me with an interjection as to his opinion about the delicate way in which private enterprise was exemplified only a few weeks ago in America, where the leaders who are concerned with this kind of speculation were gambling with the foodstuffs of the people? Although here and there a farmer occasionally received a slight increase as the result of that gambling, the great body of the consumers were robbed in a shameful and shameless manner. What have we already in Australia in this direction? We have a salt ring. Honourable members on the -Ministerial side claim to be the especial friends of the farmers. The farmers are particularly interested in this phase of private enterprise. An unfortunate farmer who kills a pig must, before he can salt it down, buy his salt at a price determined by the ring. Private enterprise represented by residents in the cities, takes from him a share of his earnings included in the price of the little bit of salt that he requires for that operation. We have a timber ring operating very cruelly, at any rate, in South Australia, with the result that prices are 30 per cent, higher than they would be under honest trading. We have a banking ring. I do not wish to deal with that just now. One phase' of its operations was exposed yesterday by the honourable member for Balaclava, in a manner that reflected the greatest possible credit upon him. We have an insurance ring, fortunately broken through' by the Government in New Zealand, but not elsewhere. We have a coa] vend. We have a flour combine, a sugar combine, a tobacco combine, a shipping combine, a cable combine. All these things represent private enterprise in its successful phases; and I say now, that unless we have State regulation of some description it is inevitable that here, as in America, every form of private enterprise will be concentrated in the grasp of a few manipulators who wiil continue to filch from the people of Australia at large, as they have been filching from the farmers and the general workers. The Ministerialists are welcome indeed to the fact that they have been dubbed as the protectors of private enterprise in that respect. I am sometimes amazed that ordinary traders, shopkeepers, and especially the farming community, should be found supporting what are now known as Ministerialists, whose policy is to uphold combines which would squeeze from them the cream of everything which they possess. Let me touch upon another point in the remarks of the right honourable member for East Sydney. I had not time to deal with them last night. The right honourable gentleman said that the management of the Post and Telegraph Department had been a lamentable failure under Federat on. If that be the case, : and no member of the Ministry ventured to deny the statement, who is responsible? None but Ministerialists of to-day. Except during two brief periods totalling something like ten months, when the Watson and Fisher Ministres had control, the present Prime Minister has either himself been in office, or had in office a Ministry of his own creation-the Reid-McLean Ministry. Honourable members now congregated on the Ministerial side have at one time or another been directly responsible for the lamentable failure in the management of the Postal Department, to which the right honourable member for East Sydney referred. I am given to understand, however, that, despite the fact that tQ the order of the newspapers huge concessions have been granted in the carriage of newspapers, and that, to the order of Chambers of Commerce, reductions, to a large extent, have been made in telegraphic and cable cbarges, the Postal and Telegraphic services are revenue-producing. But the telephonic service is not revenue-producing. Immediately the Fisher Ministry took office, they endeavoured to put that branch of the Department on a business basis. Their proposals in this connection met with the strong disapproval of the Chambers of Commerce, and of the Employers' Federation. Possibly those proposals assisted them in the work of fusing the various parties represented on the other side, so that they might have to deal with a Government over which they could exercise greater control than they could possibly exercise over a Labour Government. proved by a statement which recently appeared in the press. I find in the Age of 14th July, a reference to a progress report of the Executive Committee of the Council of the Victorian Employers' Federation, from which I quote the following:The report noted the success achieved by the cast a reflection upon the whole of deputation from the Employers' Federation to the Postmaster-General, protesting against the extreme telephone charges imposed by the La<bour Government, and which resulted in the apHouse and not denied; it seems but pointment of two expert accountants to go into the financial side of the question; while, for the present, subscribers remain under the old terms and conditions. This is some indication that the Employers' Federation exercise a control over the present Ministry. They saw that as soon as the present Ministry came into office, they would be likely to continue the deplorable management of the Post and Telegraph Department, and they were able to destroy the business-like basis on which the Labour Ministry proposed to place the Department. They were able to force the present Administration to so use their power that the members of the Employers' Federation should receive a monetary benefit, and that at the expense of the general community. They were able to so exert their influence as to give the right honourable member for East Sydney a further opportunity to assert emphatically that the administration Mr Roberts. of the Post and Telegraph Department is lamentable, and has been a distinct failure. I feel it my duty to point out that that failure is entirely due to honourable members of the Ministerial party, as it is now constituted. In the present Ministry, and behind them, are the persons who are directly and indirectly responsible for all the failures which have occurred in the management of the Postal Department. I point out also that there can be no real desire on the part of the Employers' Federation and the Chambers of Commerce to establish the Department on a practical working basis which would be satisfactory to the people generally, or they would not have sought an alteration of the telephone rates proposed by the Fisher Ministry, which, if adopted, would have had that effect. The right honourable member for East Sydney included the Defence Department as one of the great Departments of the State which had been a' failure under Federation. Here, again, the Ministry and their supporters must, of necessity, take the whole blame They must now accept added I think"" this is responsibility for having placed in charge of the Department a gentleman who has shown bitter antagonism towards anything in the shape of a reasonable Australian defence, and a life-long antagonism to any reasonable working scheme of defence. By placing that honourable gentleman in charge of the Department, they have, I think, the Military Forces, that is, if we are to accept statements made in this yesterday since the present Minister of Defence was a red-hot Republican, shouting, "" Down with the Monarchy! "" Now we find him in charge of the Military and Naval Forces of Australia. But yesterday, in the political life of the Commonwealth, the present Minister of Defence as a Republican, was altogether opposed to our present form of Government, and we know that during his career in the Federal Parliament the honourable gentleman has always been found in bitter opposition to the adoption of anything' like a reasonable scheme of defence. The Prime Minister has to-day shown a disregard for an Australian defence of a reasonable character, by placing that honourable gentleman in charge of the Defence Department. This shows that the Ministry have no wish that a reasonable scheme of defence should be adopted, that no attempt will be made to place this important Department on a basis which will meet, with the approval of Australia, and that it will continue to remain in the deplorable condition in which it is found today, and which has justly met with the severe condemnation of the right honourable member for East Sydney. able member will sketch his scheme of defence. I shall listen most attentively. the honourable gentleman might listen, he would not approve, because none of the various schemes put forward up to the present time have met with his approval. We find the honourable gentleman in the position of Minister of Defence without so far having suggested any scheme which meets with his approval. We shall wait eagerly for such a scheme. I noted in the press a little while ago, a statement made, that be-I never heardof any objection to the mancause of the debate which is now proceeding, great national questions are being delayed. What are these great national questions? The great national question of defence, so far as the present Ministry is concerned, is the raising of the age .at which boys shall be drilled, from eighteen to nineteen years. lieve two of the daily newspapers, according to theagreement signed and sealed, I hope, as otherwise its permanency must be doubtful-the present Minister of Defence has barely conceded that there shall be some increase in the age at which cadets shall be drilled. The honourable gentleman has conceded so much from his previous opposition. When I look back to the alleged superb scheme put forward by the Deakin Ministry a little time ago, under which we were to advance from a force of about 30,000 troops, including volunteers, to a force of 800,000, although the expenditure was to be increased only from ^800,000 to ;£i,2oo,ooo, that is to say, that for an increased expenditure of ^400.000 a year we were to increase the effective Defence Force of Australia from 30,000 to 800,000, and when I remember the speech with which the then Minister of Defence, the honourable member for Richmond, introduced his Defence Bill, and find that all his grandiloquent proposals are now watered down to increasing the age at which cadets should be drilled from eighteen to nineteen years, I am justified in saying that the Ministerial party have no intention to place the Defence Department on a reasonable basis. I am justified also in saying that the published statement that the great national scheme of defence is being delayed by the debate at present proceeding, is merely an endeavour to mislead the public in a manner discreditable to those who are responsible for it. I look forward with some degree of interest to what the present Minister of Defence will propose. I hope it will be shown that his present views differ materially from those which he held when, as a railing Republican, he was shouting ""Down with the Monarchy !"" all forces, military and naval, and everything else that would restrict his liberty and freedom to do and to dare. I should like here to say that during the six and a-half months that Senator Pearce occupied the position of Minister of Defence, his administration of the Department met with the unqualified approval of every military man in Australia. ner in which the honourable senator conducted that Department; but, on the contrary, I heard expressions of approval on every side, not merely of his administration, but of his practical proposals for the fulure. Having taken a somewhat active interest in military matters, I beg leave to say that never previously in the history of If we are to be the Commonwealth has any Minister met with the approval of the Military Forces to the extent that SenatoPearce did, and, with all due respect to the present Minister, that honourable gentleman must understand that the Military Forces cannot view with any degree of confidence his acceptance or retention of the office of Minister of De fence. did Senator Pearce do? ing work is concerned, I may tell the honourable member for Wimmera that the policv submitted with respect to our Military Forces by the Fisher Government, although not quite what I would personally approve of, was nevertheless of a decidedly practical character, and met with the approval of the military men qualified to express an opinion on the subject. There is another matter which shows how curious must be the mental condition of a man who supports the present Ministry, while denouncing all their leading proposals. On the question of immigration, the right honourable member for East Sydney deprecated the present method of decoying immigrants to Australia. He himself repudiated any responsibility, and would not endorse the policy;",17,Motion Of Want Of Confidence

The right honourable member castigated the Ministry for the manner in which they are leaving the question to the States. Some of us had fondly hoped that the Federal Parliament would control immigration, being given that power by the Constitution; but, apparently, the control is to be left still with the States; and if there is one State more than another that 'is guilty of deception in their methods those statements, and deceptive advertiseof obtaining immigrants, it is the State of New South Wales. In that State, immigrants, when they land, are left without much means of support, and without too great a prospect of obtaining work, although they had believed the flowery advertisements and plausible sophistries of immigration agents, to the effect that if they went up country they would receive work at the splendid remuneration of 5s. per week, with board and lodging thrown in, I presume, as a little gift. member suggest that that is a description of the general method adopted in New South Wales?

103,Mr Roberts,"That is a matter of the point to his entire satisfaction. The position now is changed. The Labour party are in the majority, and it seems to be reasonable that we should say to the Liberal element, "" You do now that which we have done since 1891. You find yourselves in a minority, therefore support Labour. The Labour party supported you when the positions were reversed. Our policy may not be all that you like, but your policy was not all that we liked. We might desire to go a little further than you think necessary, but you certainly lagged much further behind than we considered desirable when we were supporting you.'' The positions are entirely reversed, and I think that we take a reasonable stand when we say to the Liberal element, "" Do to us as we have done to you."" I wish for no bargain or compact; I ask for no fusion, alliance or coalition. I do not even ask that the Liberal party should support any proposal of the Labour party with which they do not agree. I simply suggest that in general they could have left the Labour party on the Ministerial benches, just as the Labour party left them there for this, series of years that! stand on record. We :ire assured by no less an authority than the Age, the newspaper mouthpiece of the Liberal party, that there is little difference his work, and his proposals should be of in essential principles. Is then a Ministry to be turned out upon the minor matters? ciples, but on the practical part of the programme. the difference between the practical side and the essential part of a programme. We are told then that there is little difference between, the policies. In such circumstances, why should we not be supported as we supported others when the positions were reversed? If there happens to be any proposal of the Labour party that does not meet with the full approval of the Liberal party, they are af perfect liberty to oppose it, to seek to alter Liberals in fusing as they have done, for it, or even to join with the Conservatives t'o defeat it. But surely, when there is no essential difference, according .to some authorities, between two parties, it would be better that the Liberals should support Labour in office than that they should sink every Liberal principle, and throw themselves into the arms of the Conservatives, as they have done, merely for the sake of putting out of office men whose_ principles they aver largely agree with their own. It has been brazenly put forward that the one reason for which this has been done -polic y does not come into the question -is that the seats of certain Liberals were in danger. If the principles held by any individual are not sufficiently strong to retain for him his seat, he ought to lose it. If the opinions that he holds, the work that he has done in the past, and his proposals for the future, do not meet' with the approval of a majority of the electors in his district member does not suggest that he should lose his seat to a minority ? been the result in this instance. to admit that there should be some system of majority rule. There may be some Labour members who are present as the result of a minority vote. I am not certain upon that' point, but I have been informed that there are gentlemen on the Liberal side who certainly are here as the result of such a vote. While I do not ask that any man should lose his seat on a minority vote, nevertheless his principles, a character to commend liim to a majority, or otherwise he ought to lose his seat. If honourable members are prepared to sink their principles', to be on one day active co-operators with the Labour party in the essential principles of that party's programme, and the next day-merely , in order to retain their seats-to fuse with a section of the community that they have openly admitted to be in bitter antagonism to them for years past, it portrays a feature of politics which is not overedifying, and which certainly ought' not, and I believe will not, commend itself to the electors when they have the opportunity of considering it in the immediate future. The course I have indicated would have been preferable to the action of the up to the present the one excuse put forward is the possibility of losing their seats. The Labour party or any other party have a perfect right tb contest whatever seats are vacant. It rests with the electors whom they shall elect, and it ought not t'o lie in the hands of honourable members here to be able to make compacts with their fellow members in order to gain support, irrespective of political principles",24,Motion Of Want Of Confidence

109,Mr Roberts,"I am quite preparedor of their previous professions. If that is permitted, if it is endorsed by the electors, we shall find politics degenerating into a positively appalling condition, for the electhe programme put forward in such granditorates will be controlled from inside the Legislative Chambers, and instead of Parliament being a reflex of public opinion and an institution to do the will of the people, it will become an institution for the safeguarding of the personal interests of particular individuals, who are so devoid of principle as to form a compact merely to retain their seats, and the emoluments pertaining thereto, in Parliament. That is a feature of politics which I sincerely hope will not find approval in the electorates, but will be met in such a manner that one party or the other, because of its principles, body knows that the Prime Minister cannot will be returned with sufficient numbers to carry on the affairs of the country. straight-out fight. must admit that up to the present there is no indication of a straight-out fight, so far as that side of the house is concerned. The Liberals, fearing a straight-out fight on the principles that they have hitherto professed to love, have modified themI will go further, and say that they have formed a compact with some honourable members, not to put into effect any particular proposals, but simply to save themselves from defeat at the hands of the electors. There are in the camp of the Minister of Defence a sufficient number of electors who, finding that he now has practical control of the Ministry, will give their support to certain members who have hitherto been regarded as Liberals, in the hope that they, will assist to keep the honourable gentleman in office, knowing that his retention in that position will be favorable and profitable to their views of political life. 1 wish to go back now to some references to this no confidence motion. I. believe that the motion should have been moved. Because certain honourable members were prepared to put the Labour Ministry out it does not follow that they are still prepared to support tbe present Ministry after seeing what it proposes. Between the elaborate programme put forward in the public press and the little affair read by the Prime Minister a few days ago there is a wide difference, and one that ought to be, and I hope will be, noted. Minister as announced in the Melbourne Town Hall on 25th May appear to have been subjected to what might be called peristaltic action-ther e has been a contraction on all sides, until it now appears in the form of this printed statement. From loquent terms as the great national policy that was to save the country, it has shrunk to this thing of mere promises. I am reminded of the old coupletPromise, pause, prepare, postpone, And end by letting things alone. When the Prime Minister read the statement there was a jocular interjection to the effect that he should speak rather than read the intentions of the Ministry, and quickly and pertly there came from the Minister of Defence an interjection, that he intended should be satirical,, that "" Everyspeak for himself."" Everybody, of course, knows that the Prime Minister can speak for himself. He is silvery of voice and glib of tongue; sometimes eloquent, fluent always, but at the same time everybody must know that he cannot now speak for the Ministry, and that the Ministry were not prepared to allow him to speak for them, notwithstanding his agreement-is it a signed and sealed one?-wit h them. When it comes to anything of a critical character, he has to read it from a printed statement. In some of his remarks in this debate, I noted several similes from the Prime Minter. They are dangerous things to usea sort of two-edged sword. ber is beginning again after two hours and a half. for that length of time. We were prepared to let the deb&te go yesterday, but the Ministry put up the honourable member -for Barker to talk about horse-breeding in Central Australia. I -should like to place it upon record that not a member rose in his place, and you, sir, were on your feet to put the motion, whereupon the Ministry and the Ministerialists with one accord said, "" Save us, Livingston, save us,"" and ""Livingston"" arose in all his might and majesty to begin an eloquent classical discourse upon the breeding of horses in the centre of this great continent. good, strong, horse-sense, too. from the honourable member, there appeared The proposals of the Prime to be a different stamp of quadruped prompting him.

115,Mr Roberts,"If it was horse-sensewere responsible for delaying the business of derelict upon the troubled political sea, a the House, for wilfully blocking the putting of the motion, and raising up one of their own members positively to ""stone-wall."" During the course of his remarks he never once touched the subject of no-confidence or of the policy of either party. It was a most shocking display, a lamentable attempt at "" stone-walling,"" a deplorable exhibition of the condition in which the Ministerial party find themselves, and a lasting, standing proof that they do not want this debate to end. They are as anxious as it is possible for human beings to be that it should continue, because presumably they are not yet prepared to bring down those proposals which they and-every one who supports them fear will, when submitted, cause a bursting up of the fusion. I have already said that similes are dangerous things to play with. For example, only a little time ago the Prime Minister told us that we ought not to be surprised at the fusion which has taken place, because he had been playing "" with all the cards on the table."" His statement, however, was not correct, because he had had behind him the knaves of another pack, and it was not until he produced those knaves, and played them contrary to all rules of fair card-playing, that he succeeded in displacing the Fisher Government. aces cn the other side. keep the aces, and the honourable member is welcome to his association with the knaves. I repeat that it was not until the knaves of another pack of cards were produced that the present Prime Minister was able to remove the Labour Government from the Treasury benches. Personally, I was not surprised at his action. The cards were not all on the table, and I regret very much that he should have found it necessary to take the picture cards, not merely from two, but from three packs, before he could succeed in his game of bluff. Another dangerous simile was used by him, when he likened the Minister of Defence, the Postmaster-General, the Minister"" of Home Affairs, the right honourable member for East Sydney, and others to the wreckage of all the lost causes. To-day the Prime Minister finds himself amongst that wreckage, and I wonder what portion of it he represents. To me it seems strange that he should steer the barque of Liberalism amongst it, that he should leave it a danger to the successful navigation of progressive parties, and that he should class himself under the heading of "" wreckage."" I can imagine the honourable gentleman amongst that wreckage, with one hand convulsively grasping an old hen-coop, as he is being washed upon an inhospitable shore, and with the other waving spasmodicallv in the air, whilst he shouts "" Protection, Protection !"" He will, of course, get Protection from the honourable member for Parkes, the right honourable member for East Sydney, and the other Free Traders. They have forced him into their net to such an extent that he has absolutely sold the Protectionist cause. Still another dangerous sim'le was employed by the Prime Minister, when he declared that the right honourable member for East Sydney resembled an aboriginal who had clubbed a sylph in the person of the right honourable member for Swan, in order to force him into matrimony. I should like to ask him who is the sylph today? Who has been successfully pursued, and who was the pursuer? The pr'ncipals have changed, it is true, so that, instead of the right honourable member for East Sydney, the Minister ot Defence did the chasing, effectively clubbed the sylph into submission, and took her into his aboriginal lairI might almost say his harem. That, in itself, would not be so bad, but for the fact that the Prime Minister has taken five or six others with him. I think it was Lizzie Stofel, in "" Struck Oil,"" who, whilst protesting that she was going away because her face was turned from her lover continued to walk backwards. That circumstance irresistibly reminds me that the Prime Minister was careful to walk backwards, so that he might receive the club upon his head, and be subjected to the embraces of the Minister of Defence. I repeat that that would not beso bad, but for the circumstances that he has taken seven or eight other sylphs with him into the harem. The honourable member for Maribyrnong is one of them. There is no honourable member in this House who is more uncomfortable than he is, and tbe five or six others who have been taken into the aboriginal harem. And, although they mav protest that they were taken there against their will, it is well known that escapees from a barem are never received' into respectable society. The honorahlemember for Maribyrnong is welcome to his laugh in such circumstances, because I feel convinced that the laugh will be in another",26,Motion Of Want Of Confidence

They would lead us to believe that some of the leading opponents of labour, who hitherto have worked in conjunction things political that is outside their fiscal beliefs-d o not now approve of the fusion which took place-that outsiders were brought in to an extent which is deplorable, and that that does not reflect creditably, upon the persons chiefly responsible; that they, with all their knowledge of politics, could not bring about a fusion of tbe parties until certain persons-no t the electors their ordinary electoral committees, but the officials of different organizations and other outsiders-cam e in and directed them what to do. Presumably the discussion proceeded somewhat in this fashion : that they were assured that so far as the influence of Mr Beale, Mr Joshua, and the other gentlemen were concerned, no matter what the outcome of the fusion might be in matters vided, of course, that it was suitable to them, the persons taking part therein would It was a case of buving for different sections of this House the support of persons who previously had not given their countenance to those sections. It was literally a buving of support not to put in effect any proposals, not to legislate, but to save their opseats. I regret very much that the -fusion came about in such circumstances; but I am not surprised, at any rate, so far as the Prime Minister is concerned, though some members of the public may be. At the last general election he entered into a compact to do what he has done, and therefore, there is no occasion for surprise, and those who express surprise cannot have followed as keenly as some have done the trend of political events. I noticed that when at the last general election the honourable member for Ballarat was confronted with the opposition of a Reidite candidate, he entered into a compact-which , it seems to me, was dangerously near to an interference with the electoral law-to permit of that candidate being withdrawn from the field, and which bound him to do all in his power, as soon as the Tariff was out of the way, to",28,Motion Of Want Of Confidence

It will be remembered that at that time the National Political League was brought into existence by the honourable gentleman to check the honourable member for Parramatta and his party. It was reported in a Melbourne newspaperthe Age, I think-that at a joint meeting of that League and the Women's National League, the following resolution was carriedThat in view of the assurances of Mr Deakin of his f u l l acceptance of the platform of the National Political League, and that he will use every effort after the fiscal question is settled to bring about a fusion of the parties in the Federal Parliament opposed to Socialism, Mr cepted in full the national proposals of Kirton's candidature should be withdrawn. solution carried? .prior to the last general election. nied that. denial. able member that he did. and know that Mr Kirton was withdrawn, and that the Reidite or Women's National League support was given to Mr Deakin, and that the events of the last two or three weeks have brought the arrangement to fruition. What the honourable gentleman then guaranteed to do he has done so far as the fusion is concerned, and if he has denied it all the facts are against him. We have it on record that according to these two Leagues he gave assurances and entered into a compact. Now we know that the fusion has been formed, and in circumstances which justify us in saying that he has thrown to the four winds of the earth every shred of political principle that he previously held dear. I now want to deal briefly with what, led up to the reading of a statement' to the Souse by the Ministry. We were given no less than three different versions of the agreement. I will not read what appeared in the Argus, because it was practically the same as the other version. On the 25th May the honourable member for Ballarat put into writing his views respecting effective Protection, and they were discussed by the conferences. of the various parties. Referring in general terms to the agreement, the Age of the 26th May saidIt has been definitely ascertained, however, not been accepted-that its leading features that it embodies practically the whole of have been rejected, or, at all events, that the Deakin Liberal policy. Practically the whole of the principles of the Liberal party's solution of the financial difficulty were embodied in the finance plank. Let me now quote from the Argus, to show how the two newspapers agreed or disagreed. This is what it said in its issue of 31st MayThe most difficult question of all to settle was that relating to the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. In that vital matter the simple and common-sense plan has been adopted, deferring a final settlement until experience has provided further information to guide Parliament. The Age assured us that the fusion acthe Liberal party, and practically at the same time the Argus assured us that that difficulty was easily got over by deferring it for five years. Suppose that the time for holding an examination at a school had arrived, and the father of a student said, "" Do you think you will be able to pass the examination, my boy;"" and the reply was, ""Oh, yes, da'd. There is a simple ancl effective method of passing the examination by putting it off for five years until I have had more experience."" That illustrates the situation so far as this Ministry is concerned. The Argus was right. I would not like to believe the Age was correct when it said that the putting off of the question for five years was the policy of the Liberal party with respect to the financial situation. The Age of the 26th May went on to sayThe fiscal plank is very specific-for it accepts Protection as the settled policy of Australia, and makes it clear that the work of the rectification of anomalies in the Tariff is to be attacked by the future Government in accordance with that settled policy. In short, it is no exaggeration to say that the major portion of the Liberal programme was adopted. This is what was put out to the public. That presumably is what captivated the honorable member for Wimmera. ment itself say? committal. It does not say anvthing, but that is what the Age put forward on the26th May, and what I presume induced certain honourable members in the Protectionist camp to merge themselves into the fusion, namely that the policy of the Liberal party was accepted.

He rebuked the old Conservative party for accepting the leadership of a man who had so cruelly denounced it in the immediate past. The right honourable member for East Sydney seems to think that the Conservatives can congratulate themselves upon having caught the Liberal flies in their web. The report from which I am reading says furtherEvery Free Trader in the fusion is left at liberty to fight for his convictions if auy proposal is brought forward which he thinks will raise the fiscal controversy. Surely that is clear enough for the honourable member for Wimmera? trust to the Ministerial policy. Free Traders* and Protectionists have perfect liberty of action in regard to the Tariff. they are elected as Labourites, not because of their fiscal views. The report continuesThis is a great climb-down for those who talked of admitting us into the ranks of the Liberal party. He makes it clear that the Liberal party had to climb down to meet the Conservatives.

They assert that in the fusion, Protection is safe; while the ex-Leader of the Free Trade party asserts unmistakably that the agreement, so far as it refers to Protection, is a great ""climb down "" for the Liberal party. No more effectively could the fusion party be denounced than out of the mouth of one of its present supporters; and when he asserts that the Liberals have been guilty of a great ""climb down,"" we can count it as a gain for the Conservative or Free Trade section. world outside Australia,"" the Conservative party is the High Tariff party. with parts of the world outside Australia at If that is safeguarding Protection, I present. When it is represented by the one should like to understand what the result section that Protection is provided for and safeguarded, and when it is asserted openlv by the other side that there has been a great "" climb down "" on {he part of the Protectionist party, we on this side of the House naturally ask: Which of the two is correct? Who is making the true statement ? Both cannot possibly be true. What is more, I attach exceptional importance to the words of the right honourable member for East Sydney, because I remember that only a few days ago, speaking at Ballarat, and giving advice to vQimg men, and I believe young women also, he said that it was not sufficient for a person to be able to use words; but that he should understand the meaning of every word that he used. Every word, according to the right honourable member, should speak for itself. It was not good enough to repeat them parrot-like. Each word should have a definite meaning. And so, when he says that the Liberals have been guilty of a great ""climb-down."" we must assume that there is a special meaning attaching to hislanguage ; and to the extent to which we attach meaning to it, we must refrain from, at any rate-to put the matter mildly-believin g the repeated assertions of the members of the Liberal party that they have safeguarded their Protectionist policy, or, in fact, any portion of it. The meaning of the situation has been very clearly explained to mean that the fusion involves nothing less than a complete suppression of Liberal principles, stand to-day triumphant. Evidently there is a fear in the minds of some in Victoria who previously were looked upon as the fathers of Protection, for the Age of 1st June, in a leading article, refers thus to the subjectThe free utterances on the fiscal question of the two Sydney Free Traders, Messrs. Cook and Reid, are not such as will inspire comfort in Protectionist minds. They have given their own version of the agreement, which has been come to touching Protection. And certainly those versions do not agree with what has previously been put forth-that all necessary corrections of the Tariff have to be made from a Protectionist stand-point. Mr Cook says, and Mr Reid agrees with him, that every Free Trader, and what amounts practically to the same thing, every Protectionist of the ""corner"" stamp is to have an entirely free hand to deal with Tariff amendments, by raising or lowering the protective duty, as they think fit.",31,Carty Salmon Wha T Memhers Of Legislation Or Administration And Pro

All these things I find to be true. The Minister of Defence has admitted that we are confronted by a difficult financial situation. But instead of meeting it as men should meet a difficulty that presents itself, there is to be a term of yearsa sort of interregnum during which nothing of a decisive character shall be done. The Government are going to wait for more experience. We have had sufficient experience during the past eight years. The Government ""are going to relegate the question of new Protection to an Inter-State Commission, which is now to be brought intp existence. establish that Commission ever since Federation nothing venture to sav that the Commission to be established will not touch the subject of new Protection for many years to come. Consequently, every proposal which the Prime Minister put forward at the Town Hall, Melbourne, in such terms that he captured the Liberal element of Victoria for his policy, has been whittled away to mere nothingness, whilst everything which the Conservative party said should be done is about to be done. We find the Victorian Conservatives leagued with the Victorian Liberals, and it is only by such means that they have been able to consummate a union which in itself involves the sinking of every principle. This has been done merely to put another section on those benches without desiring to achieve anything of a character which will be beneficial to Australia.

My honourable friends opposite may think that we have not the numbers in the House at present to enable us to go to a vote; but I shall not pass any opinion on that. I listened to the commencement of this debate with a considerable amount of amusement. I think that the Labour party, in taking the stand that they have taken, have convicted themselves of the basest ingratitude. The object aimed at in placing them in the position which they now occupy was the fusion of certain parties in this House. Honourable members who comprised the Corner party before the fusion took place were returned solely to bring about a fusion of parties, in order that in the Federal Parliament we might establish the twoparty system of government in the interests of the whole of the people, and not of a section only.

' I say that the Labour party have shown ingratitude. They knew that they had no right to be seated on the Treasury benches, because they number only one-third of the members of this House, and represent only one-third of the electors of the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, they had no right to expect that they should be allowed to control the Government of the country. Mr J. H .

We have heard that Labour and not Conservatism is the natural ally of Liberalism. We have no such thing in Australia as Conservatism in the sense in which the word is used elsewhere. Most sensible men recognise that Conservatism so called in Australia is Liberalism tempered by caution and experience. We study Liberal schemes, and if satisfied that they are in the interests of the country, and that effect, we are prepared to approve of them. Honourable members opposite have said all through that they desired that the Labour party should be isolated. They say that they do not want the members who are described as"" as good as Labour members""-that they must be prehave they done since their isolation?

It is a just cause, and must eventually win. That is a message to the Labour party. It is something more. dying words of a man who did much for the Labour party in Australia and much for the cause of humanity. I say that the party -and I do not care what party it may be that can produce such men must influence the life of the Commonwealth and live in the history of politics in Australia. The words I have quoted were sent as his dying message to the members of his own party, and through them to the members of the Commonwealth Labour party by the late Premier of South Australia, Mr Tom Price, and I am proud to belong to the party to which that gentleman belonged. I am proud to stand in this chamber and support a party and objects which called forth such words from a man like Tom Price. During his political fight he had to meet the same kind of criticisms and .imputations on his honour and integrity that are cast on the Labour party in this cham!""*r-the kind of criticism and imputation given expression to a few moments ago by the honourable member who preceded me. In days gone by, when the fight between those who have and those who have not was waged in such bitterness and intensity, misrepresentation did not end with the grave. Men who fought for their principles and for humanity, not only had a terrible up-hill battle during .life, but had their honour besmirched after they had descended into the grave. I am glad, however, that we have advanced beyond that stage, and, that, while adverse criticism and misrepresentation may be hurled against us in the arena of active politics, the fight practically ends when the grave claims its own. The justice which was denied to Tom Price when in the heatof the fight is done to him now; and I rejoice to realize that the contest' we are the now engaged in is gradually being lifted to a higher level, and that the injustices of the past are no longer possible in the dawn of the twentieth century. I am living in the hope that, where men are animated by a true desire to forward the best interests of their fellow men, and prepared to sacrifice their time, and, it may be, their lives to that end, the kind of criticism which has in the past prevented the full fruition of their work, and sometimes embittered their lives and intensified their You will difficulties will disappear, and that men will be ready to treat their opponents justly and fairly, and give all due credit to them, no matter on which side of the political fight tliey may be. I said a few moments ago I have quoted the that I am very proud to belong to a party which produced a man like Tom Price. member think that there are men like Tom Price in the Labour party now? While we regret the loss of Tom Price, and owe much to him, I believe there are in the ranks of the Labour party, both inside and outside Parliament, men who take no second place to that very eminent man. The Labour party has been subject to considerable criticism in reference to their actions during the present debate. The honourable member for Grampians told us that our party had no right to govern, because they represented merely a minority in the House. But, up to a very recent period, the Labour party represented a majority of the parties, while the present Government can get a majority only by the combination of minorities. To what extent that combination is substantial, and how long the present fusion, or confusion, will continue, is a problematical matter, in regard to which even the honourable member himselfdoes not seem to be very sure. Why is there all this hostility towards the Labour party ? A number of honourable members opposite came here pledged to their electors on matters which were regarded as of vital and basic importance; and yet, without any appeal to the electors, those gentlemen are prepared to sink principles and overcome the many personal and political differences which, in years gone by, have divided them from their present colleagues.

I fear that when Parliament is invited to deal with anomalies, this difference of emphasized. The point that T wish ro make, however, is that the Labour party, as a party, has not sacrificed its principles. It has stood by and fought for its programme. Despite the lightning changes that have taken place from time to time, and which have culminated in the fusion a majority obtained by the amalgamation of minority parties in this House-the Labour party has stood firmly by the first principles that underlie its programme, and has remained true to the pledges that it gave to the electors. The Government and their supporters, however, cannot claim to have stood loyally by the pledges that they have given the electors from time to time. The electors feel that before entering into a coalition, the parties to it ought to have; consulted them, and that some honourable members under the fusion agreement are not carrying out the pledges that they gave at the last general election. I do not cavil at the change which has taken place. Men. as individuals, are at liberty to change their views if they think fit to do so. It is only a fool who, believing that he has been on the wrong track, refuses to retrace his steps, and to seek the right one. Apparently, honourable members opposite, however, have come to the conclusion that throughout their political lives they have been on the wrong track, and, as fusionists, they propose to join hands and follow what they believe to be the right path. Whilst no exception can be taken to an individual change of opinion, there is something more than a change of personal opinion involved in the fusion that has taken place, and the members of it owe it to the electors to consult them. If they felt that such a radical change as has been brought about was necessary, they should have taken the electors into their confidence, ancl have given them an opportunity to say whether or not they consider' themselves to be properly represented under the new arrangement. AH that the Labour party asks in submitting this motion is that the rights of the electors in this regard shall be honorably recognised and honestly respected. How is it that honourable members opposite, whose political opinions are as far apart as the poles, forces? Not long ago, the parties to the fusion hurled at each other uncomplimentary epithets, which they now unite in applying to the Labour party. How is it that' they have suddenly discovered that opinion will be still further their political career has been one gigantic mistake: that they have been fighting friends, believing them to be enemies; that they have wasted a great deal of time, energy, and intelligence in fighting those with whom they ought to have been associated? Not long ago, the right honourable member for East Sydney, then Leader of the Opposition, and the present Minister of Defence were engaged in keen political warfare against some of the members of the present Ministry. They were opposed to the party with which they have now joined forces, and their remarks with respect to their political opponents then were far from complimentary. Those statements were replied to fr«m the other side with equal force and vehemence, and in equally strong and defiant language. The honourable member who now leads the fusion referred to the members who were then over here as a conglomeration of the wreckage of all the parties of the Commonwealth. Now, under the fusion arrangement he has, .in the persons of his own small numbers, added another wreckage to them, and has blossomed forth as the leader of the wreckage of wreckages. Surely this condition of affairs, which was not the result of a gradual re-approachment between members, but which arose out of a suddenunderstanding, was not brought! about without some strong compelling force.

To-day, after the lapse of less than eight years, that small, insignificant body which sat in the first Parliament has become a great power, which has compelled the two large parties that then existed to sink their individualities and their politics, and to endeavour to erect a last barrier against our progress by the fusion of their numerous elements. The issues at stake are so momentous, the interests involved are so large, that the fusion which has come about, despite the great difference of individual opinions and the apparent diversity of interests among its component parts, is going to stand. The only thing that could, resolve it into its original elements would be the disappearance of the; Labour party from its present position of power. As far as I can judge, the Labour party has sufficiently established itself in the affections of a large number of' electors to insure that it shall occupy a permanent place in this House. The Opposition are perfectly prepared to appeal to the electors now, and to abide by their verdict. As far as the Labour party are concerned, its members cannot be charged with having been false to their principles. They _will not face the electors with the knowledge that they have broken the pledges which they gave to their constituents at the last general election. members opposite do not occupy a similar position, and in the interests of political integrity, we hold that they should afford the electors an opportunity of endorsing the great changes which have been effected since the last appeal was made to them. The Labour party representing His Majesty's Opposition would be unfaithful to itself and to the people if it did not challenge the position of the Government, and give them the opportunity of saying whether they are prepared to face their masters at the present time. I wish now to say a word or two in reference to the party to which I belong, for the purpose of clearing away the misrepresentation which has been indulged in by honourable members opposite and by the press. One objection which has been urged to the Labour party is that it is unpatriotic and disloyal-that it is animated by a number of principles which are detrimental to the best interests of the community. not a bad lot if they would not talk so market, our party also seeks to insure that much. [47] dertake to say that we would be a very much better lot in the opinion of the honourable member and of his friends if we did nothing. It is not so much the talking as the doing to which they object. The Labour party is here to take advantage of all the legitimate means at its disposal to give effect to its principles and its programme. Honourable members opposite fear that if the Labour party becomes a little stronger, it will be able to give effect to that programme, and that is the compelling force which has caused the honourable member for Franklin to find a seat alongside the honourable member for Brisbane and the honourable member for Maribyrnong. The objective of the fusion party is the annihilation of the Labour party in Australian politics. The objective of the Labour party is^ (1) The cultivation of an Australian sentiment based upon the maintenance of racial purity, and the development in Australia of an enlightened and self-reliant community. (2) The securing of the f u l l results of their industry to all producers by the collective ownership of monopolies and the extension of the industrial and economic functions of the State and municipalities. The fighting platform which will be submitted to the electors at the next election embraces the following nine primary planks:We maintain that honourable (1) Maintenance of white Australia. (2) The new Protection. (3) Nationalization of monopolies. (4) Graduated tax on unimproved land values. (5) Citizen Defence Force. (6) Commonwealth bank. (7) Restriction of public borrowing. (8) Navigation laws. (9) Arbitration Act amendment. New Protection is explained as meaning ""!the amendment of the Constitution to insure effective Federal legislation for new Protection and Arbitration."" In other words, it seeks to insure that those manufacturers who receive the benefits of Protection shall be required to carry on their industries under conditions which make it possible to build up a patriotic and self reliant young Australia. Instead of their factories being dens of sweating, they are to be so conducted that their employed shall receive a fair remuneration, arid shall be required to work only fair hours and under proper conditions.

The Age newspaper took him to task with reference to what he did towards the officers of the House. Formerly they were allowed a glass of beer, or a cup of tea or coffee, or anything they wished to have, when the House sat after midnight.

There are only two things in regard to the honourable member's statement on that subject which are incorrect.

But as I was not present on the occasion referred to, he will see that he has been misinformed. Now, as to the third matter, which is, perhaps, the most important of the three, with respect to the suppers and courtesies extended to honourable members on occasions when the House sits after midnight, I have to say that the courtesies referred to have been hitherto extended by various Governments to all members of the House.

Believing that the division would be taken some time after 4 o'clock, I made my preparations accordingly. I found that the division was taken before that hour, and consequently I missed the opportunity to record my vote for the Government.

If Ministers think that by methods of that kind they will force this party to conduct business as they desire, they will find that they are making a great mistake. Honourable members are returned to this Parliament to conduct the business of the country. I know that for years past honourable members on this side have assisted to keep a quorum day after day and week after week whilst other honourable members were away. The people do not expect honourable members to take advantage of the pairing system to shirk their responsibilities, as has been done in the past. Men who have private business to which they attach more importance than they do to the business of the people have no right to be representatives, especially in view of the fact that they are now, in my opinion, handsomely paid for their services. There was a time when, perhaps, in this connection, some excuse might have been offered, but now it is only right that honourable members should be compelled to attend in their places. Quite apart from any party tactics, we on this side are doing the country a great service when we place a mark on those who do not attend to their duties. have declared war; and, so far as I am concerned, there will be no quarterI do not mean war to the knife at a supper table, but war to the political end of honourable members opposite, if possible.

As a member of this House, I have no desire to be classed with the free supper brigade; and I do not see why this Cabinet, or any other Cabinet, should supply refreshments for members, whether supthe custom, but I have always regarded I cannot believe that the honorit as a cruel charge to be placed on any Ministry. It is well that the public should understand that, in the State Parliaments, charges of the kind are paid' for by the number of years, late trains and trams were run for the convenience of honourable members, at the country's expense, on occasions when there were late sittings; and I do not see why any Cabinet should be called upon to provide the conveyances out of the party funds. The only good that may arise out of this discussion is that we may get our work over by, perhaps, the reasonable hour of eleven o'clock, and that, if necessity should arise, and we are detained to a late hour,_ say, at the end of the, session, honourable members may be conveyed to their homes, not at the charge of the Ministry, but at the charge of the country.

It must be remembered that members of the Federal Parliament have, some of them, to come The Government from the other end of the continent, and that their position, and that of others who have to travel great distances, is not on all fours with that of a. member of a State Parliament. Many honourable members, like myself, have their private business to attend to; and, in many instances, attenddo not think that the people expect honourable members to be constantly in attendance, to the utter neglect of their own affairs and prospects, so long as their votes count, and the business of the country is not neglected by them.

In the matter of pairs, I shall always act on my own judgment, in the interests of those who have sent me here. As to the new departure in regard to suppers, I have always considered that it was not right for members of an Opposition to partake of the hospitality of those they were opposing. But the provision of suppers by the Government has been the custom, and it should not have been departed from without careful consideration. I suppose, however, the action was taken in the heat of the moment, and, I think, very unwisely taken. One step that was taken, however, I consider altogether beyond reason. If , when a supporter of the Government and a member of the Opposition living at a considerable distance from the city, and in the same neighbourhood, desired to go home after the late sitting, the member of the Opposition has been refused a seat in the cab occupied by the Government supporter, that is surely contrary to all the courtesies of either political or private life; even a tired dog would be given a ride home, and the position I have indicated is one that ought not to be tolerated for a moment amongst Federal members. hope that the outcome of this discussion I got a pair, without any will be that we shall return to the old way of doing business in previous sessions. concessions! to please the honourable member for Hume every time. The honourable member has had a good many ""goes"" at me, and I"" have never said a single word. I sincerely hope that we shall not carry these feelings into private life. to an understanding it is never a good thing to ask, ""Who started it?"" It reminds me of a story of two shepherds, who had been very good friends, but who had a .fight. A year afterwards they met at the fair, and agreed to "" make it up,"" but, unfortunately, one of them said, ""Sandy, mon, ye were wrang that time!"" with the result that the quarrel was resumed, and they had a worse fight than before. And so I say that if -honourable members wish to make good their differences in regard to this matter the least said about it the better. The work of Parliament is carried on far more satisfactorily if honourable members extend to each other a certain amount of courtesy in the affairs of private life, and if parties occasionally grant one another pairs. It is a reasonable course to adopt. member is not a party. He stands by himself, at last, and does not seem to relish his position. It would seem that he has not even a woman's following. I hope that the outcome of this debate will be that we shall agree to revert to the old order of affairs. Surely it is not necessary to carry party warfare to the lengths that it has been carried of late; surely it is not necessary to party warfare that honourable members should be denied cabs and made as uncomfortable as possible on the occasions of late sittings.

I was alluding to two special cases of members, one of whom has since appeared, and explained that he was absent from the division because the door was closed on him. will admit that notice was. given. though I did not know it, but a mere casual allusion to my knowledge that two honourable members were at the door, or on their way, expressing regret in regard to them, was not an allusion to whicb any other member can take exception. It indicated nothing except that it was through no fault of their own that those two honourable .members were, not present. For the rest. I have nothing to do, and no concern, nor do I desire to say anything about other 'regrettable incidents just alluded to. But I speak within the knowledge of all here when I say that the feeling displayed to-day has ""been chiefly generated by obvious attempts of a tactical character to take advantage, of the state of the House during the last two or three days, not only in countings out, but in the apparent intention to take divisions at particular moments which must have involved considerable inconvenience to many members That has produced a good deal of irritability. On the evening to which allusion has been made, the Government Whip, than whom I am sure no more courteous or considerate Whip has ever been in this House, was acting for Ministers. He was placed under conditions of special exasperation, when honourable members on this side were suffering from comments, charges, and epithets, which we should all have done better to "" ignore, but which, for the time, were rankling. When all these circumstances are taken into account, it will be seen that this was no wanton or unconsidered action. Far from it.
