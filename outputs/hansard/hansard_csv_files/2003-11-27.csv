We all appreciate the importance of education to the life opportunities of the youth of Australia. It is significant that this week in the parliament we have had the youth of Australia debating issues that are important to them. Their schooling is very important to their life opportunities, and it is most important that the Commonwealth government involve itself at the national level on a strategic basis in the education of every Australian child. That has been given expression through the bills that come through this parliament allocating funds for educational purposes. I want to raise a matter today which is of deep concern to me, and it relates to a school in my electorate. Some time ago, the principal of Corio Bay Senior College came to me seeking support for a program to encourage young mothers to return to school to complete their education. The principal was successful in rallying the community behind this proposal and day care facilities were established at the school which have enabled these young mothers to return to school. The school is in the process of setting up a permanent child-care facility. This year eight places were secured. In 2004 the school aimed to have 12 to 15 places. Eventually 30 places would be offered. The school employs a support worker for the young women to ensure their transition back to school is a smooth one. The support worker runs additional programs which develop parenting skills and assist with the organisational aspects of having a family and studying at school. The students and the mothers appreciate the child-care facilities being on-site and in a secure location. The program is linked to the Best Start program, which is about breaking the cycle of disadvantage for these young women. It is disturbing that two weeks ago the principal, Stephen Boyle, received a letter from Senator Patterson saying that the funding application for this program had been rejected-even though this program has been highly recommended, it has been through the evaluative procedures for 15 months and a similar program in Western Australia seems to have received funding. The government can spend a billion dollars on a war in Iraq and it can spend $100 million on useless advertising, yet it cannot find the dollars to fund a worthwhile program for young mothers seeking to go back to school. (Time expired) Paterson Electorate: Austeel tory proposed for Tomago in the Hunter area. On 14 February 2001 the New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, stood on the stage of the Newcastle Workers Club with Mr Clive Palmer of the Austeel consortium and announced that a $2.8 billion plant would be installed, a plant which would create some 20,000 jobs. There was a lot of fanfare because up until that point in time Bob Carr had been accused of junketing around the world on a vacation paid for by the taxpayers. But Mr Clive Palmer stood up and said that that was wrong. He said that Mr Carr had been to Italy and London and secured the deal so that the steelworks could go ahead.

There were the promises; there were the commitments: ‘We will do whatever we need to do to make sure it goes ahead’. In fact I quote from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald where Bob Carr said he would do ‘everything appropriate’ to clear the way for the project. They have been in court, because the New South Wales government will not deliver on its commitment to get rid of the obstacles in the way of the installation of this steelworks. In fact, Austeel had to take the state government to court to clear 11 matters, citing failures by the government to rezone the steel mill site, pay for electrical studies, provide information and provide infrastructure and security of tenure, amongst other things. So here we have the Premier of New South Wales grandstanding-and there is no other word for it-as he would do, making these fanfare announcements; but when it comes time to put the shoulder against the wheel to make things happen, where is he? He has got his people in the courts trying to weasel his way out of it. This site at Tomago, which the state government refuses to rezone, is in Port Stephens Council. Such is the style of the government in New South Wales that they decided to make the announcement without even consulting Port Stephens Council. We had that laid upon us, without any support or infrastructure, but we accepted it because we knew that 20,000 jobs would come with it and we knew how good that would be for our region. On 14 February 2004, it will be three years. Let us hope that what we do not see is another St Valentine’s Day massacre of 20,000 jobs in the Hunter that should be up and running by now. We have seen nothing but delays, nothing but obstacles put in the way of a company willing to invest and create opportunities for people in the Hunter, and I call on Bob Carr to do something appropriate to get this project under way-or at least say that he was never sincere about creating jobs in the Hunter to start with. Pink, Mr Kerry memory of a dear friend, Mr Kerry Pink. Kerry died on Saturday, 15 November, after battling cancer. Kerry was a highly respected, long-serving journalist with my local daily newspaper, the Advocate, a noted historian on the north-west and west coasts of Tasmania, and author of 15 books. In fact, I had the privilege of publishing Kerry’s book on the life and times of Edward Braddon, to celebrate the Centenary of Federation. Ironically, Kerry only recently gave his permission to reprint a limited number of this popular book to commemorate the centenary of the death of Edward Braddon. This reprint will be dedicated to Kerry in gratitude. It has been said that Kerry never missed a deadline, and this was demonstrated during his serious illness. For example, Kerry sent me a neat, typed copy of changes he wanted made in the reprint of the Edward Braddon book. More significantly, only eight days before his death, Kerry completed and launched what has become his last work, a 248-page history: Winds of Change: A History of Woolnorth. If Kerry started something, he always completed it and he did so wholeheartedly. What you saw with Kerry was what you got-a quality that was certain and respected. His knowledge of events, people and places was enormous. He was a natural storyteller and never stopped inquiring. Indeed, this was his strength and joy-and also his Achilles heel. You see, once Kerry started to follow a line of inquiry, it became a story and the story had to be told in its entirety. A short historical piece for a newspaper ended up becoming a thoroughly researched book. Winds of Change is such an example. MAIN COMMITTEE",118,Statements By Members

He was born in Burnie in 1931 and became one of its most prolific scribes. His work with the Advocate allowed him to travel the coast widely, to meet its people and appreciate its history. What he discovered he wrote about, and this is his lasting legacy to his community. He was one of our very best storytellers, and our community was blessed to have him. A storyteller has a special quality, much like a gifted musician or painter; fortunately for us, Kerry pursued it with a love and a passion. The storyteller and master journalist was a proud family man, and his greatest loves were his wife, Colleen; his children-Virginia, Michelle, Nicki and Stephen-and their partners; and, of course, his lovely grandchildren. He also had hundreds of admiring friends, and I am proud to count myself amongst them. Kerry used to pop into my office to have a chat, and he was a good mate of my staffer, Sally Young. He always encouraged me in my work and was always supportive. Most times he would tell me stories about this or that and, in doing so, pass on a point of view-just as a good storyteller does. I will miss these chats and, of course, I will miss seeing Kerry. But he will live on in his writings and in his loving and loved family. (Time expired) Tourism: Overseas Visitors Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs at the eighth annual Adventure and Backpacker Industry Conference in Sydney. This was a very important event, as the contribution this group of tourists makes to Australia is significant. Backpackers are an important group of tourists to Australia who contribute a great deal to this country in a variety of ways. Not only are they important to tourism but they also contribute to a number of other industries, as well as to international relations, as they come here to experience the Australian way of life. Backpacking and working holiday visas have grown from humble beginnings in 1975, when they were first introduced. Then, 1,855 backpackers and working holiday makers visited Australia from just three countries-the UK, Ireland and Canada-with whom we had reciprocal rights arrangements. The reciprocal program was designed to allow young travellers from overseas to have an extended stay in Australia while providing similar opportunities for young Australians to go overseas. In 2003 this number has grown to 88,700 visitors from 16 countries with whom we have reciprocal arrangements. Backpackers are a resilient group of travellers who are not easily intimidated. They have not let the atrocities of September 11 and Bali or the SARS outbreak stop them from pursuing the adventure and freedom of travelling and working in foreign countries. They continue to arrive in record numbers, with a commitment and a desire to explore. Most importantly, tracking the records of these people shows that they return in increasing numbers to Australia, often with their families. It is important that we encourage them to do so: it is estimated that international backpackers contribute over $2.5 billion to the Australian economy. This is a group of tourists that we need to keep on encouraging to come here, as it has been found that working holiday makers who stay for extended periods of time spend most, if not all, of their travel funds and salaries in Australia. The program eventuated to encourage potential migrants by giving them a first-hand chance to see what life down-under was really like. The government have been working hard to ensure Australia remains a desirable and attractive destination. One of the ways we have achieved this is through the visa system which came into effect on 1 July last year.

In the first month of operation 1,300 visa applications, or 19 per cent of visa applications, were lodged on the Internet. By September this year a staggering 93 per cent of all working holiday visa applications were made online. It is great to be able to speak about the support of this government to the backpacker community through the introduction of the eVisa and electronic lodgement, and the ever-increasing number of nations with whom we have reciprocal rights. These arrangements will only increase the numbers coming to Australia. It is a great initiative and it has been very successful-$2.5 billion. Family Services: Child Care an issue that has been of increasing concern to young families in my electorate of late; as such, it is something that I have spoken about several times in this place. I was pleased to see that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs seems to have finally succumbed to pressure from families’ outside school hour care centres and family day care services, both in my electorate of Bowman and around Australia, and announced last week that the government intends to lift the cap on places provided by these centres, creating more flexible care options for parents. It has been a long time coming, but, as the minister finally seems to be in action mode, I thought I would seize the opportunity to bring to his attention a matter that was reported to me by a child-care operator based on Brisbane’s south side. The operator has asked not to be named, and I respect those wishes. It relates to a family that is getting full fee relief for the child-care services they use. This is in spite of the fact that the parents in question are bringing in sizeable incomes-one is a significant shareholder in a successful IT company and the other is a barrister. This family has money to expend on the costly weekend pastime of racing Porsches, yet they have been able to successfully minimise their taxable incomes to make sure they get the maximum assistance available through the child-care benefit. Everyone at the centre knows about it because they openly boast about it to other parents. This alarms my constituent, and it is of great concern to me for two reasons. Firstly, it is grossly unfair that a scheme intended to help working families access appropriate child care is being manipulated to help those who need it the least. There are many young families in our community who cannot even get a child-care place. Of those who are fortunate enough to find suitable care for their children, there are many families with substantially lower earnings who struggle to find the extra cash to pay their child-care fees. The last thing they need is to be forced to listen to this particular couple, who can afford the clever accountants with the know how to find the loopholes in the tax system and who gloat about their ability to rort the system. But what is worse is how the situation exposes the hypocrisy of this government in its treatment of Centrelink clients. This family is allowed to go on its merry way-laughing all the way to the bank in its brand new Porsche-while pensioners are threatened that Centrelink will sell their homes out from under them if they do not pay up thousands of dollars for a debt incurred through no fault of their own. And students, who are struggling to meet the demands of their studies, are forced to work excruciatingly long hours just to be able to afford to live because of Centrelink’s out of touch views of when young adults are independent of their parents. It is nothing short of appalling. My constituent has reported this information to CentreMAIN COMMITTEE",120,Statements By Members

New South Wales: Poker Machine Tax New South Wales government’s proposed poker machine taxes is about keeping important community assets in business. It is not about a failure to acknowledge the problem that currently faces some people who are addicted to gambling. I acknowledge that this problem exists and I support and encourage clubs to put in systems to help people fight this addiction. I am not here today to score cheap political points on what is a state issue. However, local residents have requested my help on this matter because both local state members are silent on the issue. I wrote to the New South Wales Treasurer, Michael Egan, in July this year with a sincere and urgent request that he contact me to discuss the proposed tax. I included my mobile phone number and office details, but Mr Egan did not even have the courtesy to acknowledge my letter. Let me tell you what the real motive is behind resistance to the proposed poker machine tax. It is about pensioners having a hot meal at home because of club support for Meals on Wheels. It is about kids waiting in excited anticipation of an end of year football trophy because a club endorses a junior sports team. Recently, a very talented 16-year-old student in my electorate approached me. He was concerned that the implementation of this tax would mean the loss of his $120 a month swimming scholarship from Mingara Recreation Club. This young sporting ambassador, who has already won three national medals and aims to compete in the next Olympic Games, is one of the many talented athletes nurtured and supported by Mingara. I only wish that I could reassure this young sportsman, and others like him, that Mingara will still be there to help him achieve his dream in the new year. Community events on the Central Coast are already starting to feel the sting of this tax. Peninsula Carols has announced it will have to cancel this year’s event because its major contributors-the registered clubs-can no longer guarantee financial support. Both local councils in my electorate have publicly stated that it will be the ratepayers who will be forced to make up any community funding shortfalls. With Central Coast clubs spending around $25 million a year on consumables-mostly purchased from coast businesses-local businesses and their capacity to provide jobs will also be hit by this insidious tax. Ironically, in my electorate of Dobell-where the gaming minister and state member for The Entrance, Grant McBride, is based-opposition to the New South Wales proposed poker machine tax is strongest. Like his party leaders, the state member for The Entrance is clearly not in touch with the concerns of his constituents. The member for The Entrance is following in the footsteps of Carr and Egan. They have both chosen to mislead by launching personal attacks on club figures and ignoring the facts. Egan grabbed headlines recently by saying that the Panthers Leagues Club made a profit of $91 million, of which only two per cent was returned to the community. According to a recent editorial from the Daily Telegraph on 2 October, after wages of $50 million and taxes, mortgages and other expenditures, the final profit was $7 million, of which $2½ million went to the community and $2½ million went to the MAIN COMMITTEE",121,Statements By Members

Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Amendment Bill 2003. It is a pleasure for me because, as shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, I see this as a small but positive step for an Indigenous community. It is doubly a pleasure for me because it is about an Indigenous community in my own constituency, and a group of people and an area of land which I know very well. I have been representing it, with only a slight hiatus, for the last 15 years. There has been a lot of progress made in those 15 years and this is another step that will be of value to them. The legislation that is before us represents a modest set of amendments to the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act. It deals with three issues. As I say, they are modest amendments, but in two instances they are useful in making more efficient the activities of the Wreck Bay council, which is the council of the Indigenous community who are the owners of the Aboriginal land in the Jervis Bay territory. The third area involves a minor consequential amendment to the ATSIC-ATSIS split. The first of the amendments reduces the quorum required for reconvened general meetings to 40 members. The Wreck Bay council has advised that it has experienced difficulties in securing the required quorum at general meetings, through which the council elects its membership and executive, and sets the annual budget and transacts business. There are currently 257 members of the Wreck Bay council and, at the moment, under the act the quorum is 129, which has proved virtually impossible to meet. Section 26A provides for a diminished quorum of members in the case of a reconvened annual general meeting where the initial AGM has failed due to there being no quorum. The council has advised that these numbers are unworkable. It is rarely possible to achieve attendance of more than 50 to 60. There are three reasons why I support this proposition. Firstly, the council have requested it and, in my view, they are a legitimately representative body. Secondly, the 50 per cent attendance requirement, particularly at a reconvened meeting where adequate notice has been given, is much too high. I do not consider that the quorum being set at 40 out of 257 for a reconvened meeting is unreasonably low-every member of parliament is a member of organisations which have comparable quorums-provided adequate notice is given. It is a community in which the giving of notice is not complex and where the knowledge of such a meeting, particularly if there is anything controversial, spreads very quickly. The second amendment extends the period of receipt of council by-laws by the minister from seven to 21 days. Section 52A(10) of the land grant act provides the council with the power to make by-laws that govern matters of concern to the people of the Wreck Bay community such as cultural activities, management, access, development and use of Aboriginal MAIN COMMITTEE",122,Statements By Members

185,Mr Mcmullan (Fraser) (9.59 A.m.),"I have pleasure in rising to support the Aboriginalland, declaration of sacred or significant sites, control of visitors, and hunting, shooting and fishing on Aboriginal land. At the moment the section requires that the council provide the minister administering the land grant act with a copy of any by-law that it has made within seven days of making it. The proposed amendments will extend this period to 21 days, which is a more realistic timetable in which to comply with what is otherwise a reasonable requirement. The third amendment enables the registrar of the council to be an APS employee within an agency rather than an officer of ATSIC. It is merely a procedural point. I understand why the government requires it, but it is of no consequence to the local community which I represent. In my capacity as local member, I have consulted with the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council. I received a letter from its general manager, Reuben Ardler, on 17 September with the following comments. He said: The proposed changes to the Aboriginal Land Grant act relating to the Quorum and the presentation of By-Laws to the Minister were requested by the Council to allow effective management. In my discussions on previous visits to Wreck Bay the issue of the quorum was raised with me. The by-law issue had not previously been raised with me, but I can see the merit in it. It has the support of the community council, and I am pleased to support it. Not this particular amendment but the core which it is amending-the land grant at Jervis Bay-is quite an important initiative. For those who do not know, the Jervis Bay Territory is located near Nowra on the south-east coast of New South Wales. It is a Commonwealth territory. For the Jervis Bay Territory to be represented in the parliament, it needs to be a member of a seat of one of the territories. Since it was created it has always been in the seat of Fraser. I have had the honour of representing it as a senator and as a member of the House of Representatives, and I have visited the community on about 50 occasions over those 15 years. Approximately 92 per cent of the Jervis Bay Territory has already been granted as Aboriginal land under the land grant act, and the remaining eight per cent is currently the subject of a claim under the act. This granting of land was done in two stages. The first grant was in 1987 and commenced on 15 January 1987. This allowed for an initial grant of 403 hectares of the Jervis Bay Territory-including, most importantly then, the Wreck Bay village-to the local community. There was a further grant in 1995, which commenced on 29 September 1995. This allowed for the existing Jervis Bay National Park and the Jervis Bay Botanic Gardensnow known as the Booderee National Park and the Booderee Botanic Gardens-to be granted to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community. Those core changes, which I was proud to be associated with as a member of the previous government that made those decisions and as a representative of the community, have fundamentally changed the lives of people in Wreck Bay. These changes have opened up a lot of economic and employment opportunities, and have given a lot more pride to the community. The preservation of the effective Indigenous management of that land by the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council is something which I support strongly in principle as shadow minister and which, on the ground as a local member, I have found to be a very important issue on behalf of a small but significant constituency of mine. I am pleased, therefore, to support the legislation.

186,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton,"Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs andisters in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, to thank the member for Fraser for his and the opposition’s support for the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Amendment Bill 2003. This is part of an ongoing ambition of the government’s to keep the power to determine the destiny of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people firmly in their own hands. This form of empowerment means that these modifications to the act have been supported by the relevant community council-the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council. I think these three changes to the Aboriginal land grant act are very straightforward, and it is good that there is all-round support for them. An ongoing commitment of the government’s is to assist in the achievement of positive outcomes for the administration of legislation for the benefit of the Indigenous members-the original people-of our nation. It is important that they find the dignity that we seek to ensure through these sorts of measures. In fact, in a number of cases the council requested these particular amendments. The three changes, which were outlined in the member for Fraser’s contribution and in the second reading speech, seek to modify the quorum requirements for the meetings of the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council. They extend the period of time by which the by-laws are presented to the minister and allow the office of Registrar of the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council to be filled by an Australian Public Service officer within my portfolio. The original act was passed in 1986. It was to enable the small but nevertheless now very successful Aboriginal community in the Jervis Bay Territory near Nowra to hold freehold land. The act established the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council, which held title to the land. The council have passed on the opportunity-indeed, they have shown great gusto in seizing that opportunity-and a vibrant community now exists at Wreck Bay. They have established themselves in that area, which has also become a popular tourist attraction. This act requires a register of members to be established. At present, the council has some 257 members. General meetings are to be held on a regular basis. The need to modify the quorum is about ensuring the good flow of decision making. The present quorum levels are somewhat excessive in the practical running of this organisation, and we hope that this bill will rectify the problem to a large degree by allowing the quorum to be satisfied if 40 members are present. The community council have shown themselves to be capable and active. On that basis, we are happy to back their judgment through this legislation. By facilitating the holding of reconvened general meetings with less members, the bill will enhance the operation of the council. We believe important business will therefore be able to be transacted without the need to postpone meetings. It has been a cause of frustration when the larger quorum requirement has meant that important business has had to be put off. Because of the vibrant, popular tourist attraction situation that the community now enjoys, obviously we do not want to see decisions that could be made being put off to a later date. The bill also extends, from seven days to 21 days, the period in which by-laws made by the council have to be presented to the minister. This is designed to enhance the operations of the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council by giving them more time to prepare the documentation to the minister and to consult with any further interested parties to ensure the requirements of the legislation have been met. Finally, the registrar of the council, through the passing of this bill, will be appointed from any APS agency within the Indigenous Affairs MAIN COMMITTEE portfolio. This will accommodate the transfer of functions from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services. The bill reflects the government’s commitment to achieve positive outcomes in the administration of the land grant act, and it is all about benefit for Indigenous Australians within our community. It is to give them the strength and encouragement to feel confident and connected to the nation that they have nurtured for so many tens of thousands of years. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers Debate resumed from 26 November, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the following paper: Resolving Deadlocks: A discussion paper on section 57 of the Australian Constitution Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.12 a.m.)-Our Constitution is a living document. As a living document, it was designed to be amended at various times throughout the history of this country. As our culture, lifestyle and needs as a society change, our Constitution also needs to be changed. SoI support constitutional reform. It is interesting that this particular piece of constitutional reform has been put forward by a Prime Minister who has a history of obstructing constitutional reform, a person who I think would describe himself as a conservative person who generally does not embrace change but would rather see the status quo maintained. The last issue of constitutional reform that we looked at was appointing an Australian head of state. The Prime Minister was vehement in his opposition to that reform, a reform that I believe would have taken us into the 21st century as a nation that was prepared to look to the future and move forward. So it is interesting that, on this particular occasion, it is our Prime Minister who is embracing this reform. You have to question why, all of a sudden, a man who has made a profession out of not accepting reform, a man who has always opposed reform, is now prepared to push the reform of section 57 of the Constitution. I would argue strongly that this is happening for political reasons. I think the Prime Minister was quite honest in the speech he made to parliament, when he said that this was being done to push through those pieces of legislation that had been blocked in the Senate. This brings us to looking at the role of the Senate and its function. I have spoken to people in the community and the electorate I represent here in this parliament. They rather like the idea that the Senate has the ability to review legislation and, at times, step in and block legislation. We have provisions in section 57 for a double dissolution. It is important to note that over the years there has only ever been one joint sitting of parliament following a double dissolution. There have been six double dissolutions. The joint sitting was in 1974. In 1951 the legislation the government went to the people with was passed because the government had a majority in the Senate and were able to facilitate the passage of the legislation through the Senate. MAIN COMMITTEE The government, and the Prime Minister in particular, have put forward a proposal that would disenfranchise a number of people who voted for the Senate. It is common knowledge that there is a difference between the way people vote in the House of Representatives and the Senate. People do that because they look at the issues, think about the issues and use the Senate as a safeguard. The proposal put forward by the Prime Minister is that, once the House of Representatives has passed a bill, if the Senate rejects and fails to pass the bill or passes the bill with amendments which the House does not agree with, then at least three months after the date on which the Senate acted or failed to act the House of Representatives will again pass the bill. If the Senate then again rejects the bill, fails to pass the bill or passes the bill with amendments to which the House does not agree, the Prime Minister will ask the Governor General to convene a joint sitting of the houses of parliament. If an absolute majority of the members and senators agrees to that legislation, then it can receive royal assent. I oppose that particular option unconditionally because I believe that the people I represent in this parliament-and I do not say this lightly-do not support that position. To go to the Australian people with that proposal would not be the right action by the government, because they would not receive support. This would not be a successful referendum, and the people of Australia would certainly point out to the government that they do not agree with this option. The second option put forward by the government has more merit. It allows for a joint sitting of parliament after an ordinary election. That would work to ensure that the views of the Australian people were considered. The Australian people would know that, by voting in a certain way, they would in fact be facilitating legislation that had previously been rejected. We on this side of the House cannot agree to that particular proposal unless the government looks at including in it a mechanism that would prevent the blocking of supply in the Senate. I think that is very important for good government and very important for the way we function as a nation. It will deliver certainty to government and it will ensure that a government can actually facilitate its program. The other issue on this side of House is fixed four-year terms. We have a fixed four-year term in New South Wales-the state that I come from-and it works very well. Mrs Crosio-I was part of the cabinet that brought it in. livers certainty. It allows government to plan and it stops opportunism-the calling of opportunistic elections. I can understand why this Prime Minister would oppose that. He is probably the most opportunistic Prime Minister that we have ever had in this country-and one that seeks to divide our communities and use that division to promote his causes. If you are in a situation where you have a fixed four-year term, you cannot exploit situations to your benefit to the same extent. If a government has a fixed four-year term, it has the ability to go to the people with its policies. It then has time to implement those policies, and the people of Australia have time to consider the success of the government and the policies that it has implemented. Finally, in that last period of government, the government and the opposition can put their policies and proposals to the Australian people and they can give their vision of where they would like to see Australia go. It is a much sounder approach to government. It is an approach that is in place in New South Wales and Victoria. It is a system that I MAIN COMMITTEE",124,Aboriginal Land Grant Jervis Bay Territory Amendment Bill
187,Ms Hall,"Yes. We also have it at local government level, and it works very well. It debelieve would deliver good government to the people of Australia. It is a system which already delivers good government to the people of New South Wales and Victoria. The Leader of the Opposition put forward a proposal in the House that, if you are having constitutional reform, it should not stop with section 57; you need to consider all areas of the Constitution that need to be updated and you need to look at it holistically. His suggestion was that we have a joint parliamentary committee that would be involved in this process of constitutional review. I think that would have been a very good path for this parliament to go down. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister refused to allow that to happen-which once again puts in question his real commitment to constitutional reform, as opposed to political expediency. Any reform needs to be driven by the people. It should not be reform that is driven by a political party or the executive of the government, reform that is just about ensuring that they can have unlimited power and can force through reforms that suit their political agenda. Rather, reform to the Constitution should be about ensuring that the Constitution continues to be-as described in the executive summary, which I am sure that the Prime Minister had input into-the ‘bedrock of stable democratic government in this country’, as it has been for over 100 years. If that is to continue it has to be a document that is not a political document but, rather, a document that the political system is built on, a document that the Australian people can trust, a working document. The number of times that the Constitution has actually been amended is very small. Unless the government can come up with a proposal that will have bipartisan support then it has absolutely no way of getting this particular referendum supported by the Australian people. This government will not negotiate with people. It has shown that its approach to dealing with this side of the House is to ignore and refuse to discuss issues, and this is a prime example of it. If the Prime Minister were genuine about wanting to reform section 57 of the Constitution, he would be looking at setting up a joint parliamentary committee. He would recognise that the Senate is a place of checks and balances and that the people of Australia vote the way they do when it comes to the Senate because they see that the Senate operates in a way to ensure that the government cannot just push through legislation that they do not support. It is very important to note that the Prime Minister said that the legislative agenda of the government has been blocked. It is interesting to note that most pieces of legislation have passed-important legislation as well. The GST legislation was passed; the first two sales of parts of Telstra were passed. The government is getting through its agenda. The Labor government were in power for 13 years and at no stage did they have a majority in the Senate. What needs to happen is negotiation. We on this side of the House do embrace reform. We would look at reform of section 57, but we need to ensure that it is not done just for reasons of political expediency and that that reform is accompanied by a change to a fixed four-year term of parliament and includes the removal of the power of the Senate to block supply. before us, Resolving deadlocks: a discussion paper on section 57 of the Australian Constitution. I have to say at the outset that I am a little bit sad that we are having this debate so late in the parliamentary session because I feel sure that, if that had not occurred, there would have been more people speaking on it. But with the business arising in both houses at the end of a session it makes it more difficult for a lot of our speakers to come forward. I am sorry they have not because what they should be doing is having a good look at this paper, Resolving MAIN COMMITTEE",127,Ministerial Statements
188,Mrs Crosio (Prospect) (10.27 A.m.),"I too would like to make a comment on the paperdeadlocks. I know it is only a discussion paper but when you read it very thoroughly you come up with different interpretations of what the intention is truly about. We as a nation have come a long way since Federation. But after reading the Constitution I believe our founding fathers truly understood the nature of politicians. The Senate, as we are continually informed, was set up as a state house. It is important in the debate that we are having at the moment, I believe, to quote from a very important chapter of this paper-that is, chapter 3, on page 19. The discussion paper said, and I want to have this on the record: It was envisagedthat is, when the Constitution was first drawn upthat if the Senate was to use its authority to block legislation it would be doing so in its capacity as a states’ house, representing state interests. Indeed, it was particularly important to the larger colonies of New South Wales and Victoria that a deadlock provision be put in place to prevent the smaller states exercising disproportionate influence on issues that affected the population at large. It is very important to remember that, because some of the points that I am going to raise in this particular discussion in taking note of this paper refer to that. Section 57, we are told, was the most debated clause of the 1897 Sydney convention. Since 1901, a double dissolution election has under this particular section of our Constitution, section 57, been invoked six times. I know that previous speakers in this debate have referred to it, but only once-in 1974-was a joint sitting convened to pass bills blocked by the Senate. Of course, we all remember that refusal to pass supply. Section 57 itself was not capable of resolving any deadlocks at that time dealing with supply. So, if we are really looking for assistance in resolving disagreements between the House of Representatives and the Senate, let us look at fixed terms and the overall composition of the Senate. I will refer to the issue of fixed terms later. The previous speaker, my colleague the member for Shortland, referred to that as well, and I made a comment at the time that I was part of the New South Wales government when we looked at changing our terms so it became more definite for the public. Fixed four-year terms do work, and they work well. I want to refer to the composition of our Senate. I know that my colleague the whip, the member for Franklin, coming from Tasmania, may not agree with me, but I am afraid this is how I feel, and I believe these are comments that must be made. In 1901 we had six senators elected from our six states; in other words, we had 36 people in the Senate. In 1943 this was increased to 10 senators for each state; that is, 60 senators. In 1975 this increased to 64 senators because we added two each from the territories: the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. In 1984 we increased to 12 senators from each state plus the four from the territories; in other words, our present 76 senators. I personally believe-and I put this forward in the context of this debate-that it is section 24 of our Constitution that needs to be changed. That section requires the number of members in the House of Representatives to be, as nearly as practicable, twice the number of senators. We know and cherish the one vote, one value system. As that has been in place for many years now, we have seen that the House of Representatives does change in numbers. When the House of Representatives increases, it reaches the stage where the Senate must too. That is why I come back to that clause of our Constitution. That has to be looked at as well. MAIN COMMITTEE Our Senate will continue to increase in numbers and we will see a reduction of quotas required. This only stands to reason. Our present population is some 20 million. As the number of voters increases so our House of Representatives one vote, one value will increase and therefore-referring to that section of our Constitution I mentioned previously-we will see the number of senators increase. I want to talk about quotas and the Senate’s structure. You do not have to be a mathematician to realise that, if you have a smaller number of senators, you have a greater quota. From 1949 to 1983, 16.67 of the vote at a half Senate election was required to elect a senator, or if they had a double dissolution then 9.09 per cent of the vote was required. Now, with 12 senators, the quota is 14.29 per cent, or if it was a double dissolution then 7.69 per cent. I am emphasising those figures because, being a House of Representatives member, when I contest elections I have to get a majority from 80,000 to 90,000 voters to be elected. So it seems quite extraordinary to me that there are 12 senators being elected based on that particular quota. I, like many of my colleagues-and I mean this sincerely-have a great problem explaining to our new settlers who become Australians citizens and even to young people who come of age and are able to register to vote that the state of Tasmania has the same number of senators, 12, as the state of New South Wales. I acknowledge that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, are from the state of Tasmania, as is my whip the member for Franklin, who is in attendance. When you talk to students, as we all do when we go around to our schools, about the composition of parliaments-how they are made up and how they come together-it is difficult to answer someone who puts their hand up and says: ‘Miss, didn’t you tell us there are 12 senators in Tasmania? Well, why in New South Wales have we got 12 senators?’ Then you have got to go through what happened with the Constitution; how it was first formed and how the Senate was originally going to be the states’ house. We have come a long way from that. In fact, the ACT will probably say that, as a territory, it has a greater population than Tasmania-or nearly so-and yet it has two senators. The two senators from Canberra will probably tell you that they are representing their people very well indeed, but we do have that problem of all the states having 12 senators. I might add to my Tasmanian colleagues that New South Wales does have a population in excess of six million. I thought I would just throw that in. I acknowledge that we have to have a diversity of views, but to have it in such disproportion-as we do in this case-is very hard to understand. This discussion paper has stated that the proposals, or options 1 and 2, are: ‘not meant to replace but rather to supplement the existing mechanism’. I certainly believe that we can and should perhaps take action to bring our Constitution up to modern Australia’s way of thinking, but it must not be amended or changed just because the government of the day-of either political persuasion-believe they have a God given right to have all their bills agreed to. Governments of both political persuasions have had to work with a Senate that they did not control for nearly every election since 1961 bar two, and they of course were the 1975 election and the 1977 election. Out of 20 elections since 1961 there have been only two occasions when the government in the House of Representatives had the numbers to ‘control the Senate’. When you look back at our nation over the last 40 years, you realise that it did not come to a standstill. I have lived those 40 years well and truly and, believe it or not, the sun rose every morning and it set every night. We have continued to govern in this nation. But looking back at that part of history, it was a coalition MAIN COMMITTEE controlled Senate that rejected, between 1972 and 1975, 93 government bills of the then Whitlam government. I might add-and statistics will show you this-that those 93 rejected government bills amounted to 25 more rejections than the total number of rejections in the first 71 years of the Senate’s history. They are quite extraordinary figures; nevertheless they are fact. It is really only the Liberal coalition that has ever blocked supply. If, from this inquiry, a decision is taken to amend section 57 and steps are not taken to address the Senate’s power to block supply then what has really caused constitutional crisis in the past will repeat itself in the future. I would like to put on record-particularly for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the member for Lindsay, because I read her contribution to this debate as well and she omitted to touch once on the question of blocking supply-that I believe it is important to think about those points. I have never believed the cant coming from the coalition government that, by amending or rejecting a bill in the Senate, we are rejecting the Australian voters who have elected the government to office. We really have, as our head of government in this nation, a Prime Minister not a dictator. Even the minor parties elected to the Senate under our current system-and changing or amending section 57 will not change this-are elected, as is the opposition of either political persuasion, to represent a particular group of Australians. In representing that particular group of Australians, they believe that when they are rejecting or amending a bill they are doing it truthfully and honestly. They are not doing it ‘to go against the voters of Australia’. Our Prime Minister Howard has stated more than once, particularly when he was sitting on the opposition benches, that the mandate view of politics is rubbish. He may not have it said it in those terms, but many a time he got up and said, ‘Don’t talk about mandate; it is a will we are representing here as well in being opposition’. So thinking you are elected with a mandate to govern is not always correct. I think the story has changed-and it has certainly changed with the then opposition shifting to the government benches. I can understand why. But I do not believe that we now should lie down to the whim of any particular group of people who feel that the time is right to keep the political pundits from focusing on a particular course of action and to turn a blind eye to everything else. I do agree that there are people of goodwill who sincerely believe that change eventually must come. I am probably one of those. We cannot forever stay in a vacuum; but, more importantly, we must never change for the sake of change. As the old cliché goes, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’. If we are going to look in one direction-I repeat in the limited time. I have left to me-we must look in more directions. I am particularly concerned that this discussion paper will be continually projected as the be-all and end-all. I do not believe it is. I do not believe, the way both models are being put together, that it is workable. We in the Labor Party have stated that we look favourably at reform, provided it is a very broad, conciliatory type of reform, and to working together to achieve that. I repeat: I do not believe that we can change section 57 of the Constitution without realistically looking at the numbers in the Senate. I am not one of those people who believe we should have a single house of parliament. I believe that the Senate does a very important job; but I do not believe that, because they have amended something or have not passed a particular bill, it is going to stop the world. As I have said, we have seen it happen in the last 40 MAIN COMMITTEE years when the people in the House of Representatives have not controlled the Senate, and we have seen that this nation has progressed forward. I say to those who have put this paper together: let us go one step further before we take that massive step-or even put this out as a referendum. AndI wish them well, because if we look at history we do not have much chance of getting a referendum up; therefore we may not have the opportunity of getting this up. Let us put it out wisely, let us give more consideration to it, and, more importantly, let us look at the long-term ramifications. If we were to amend one particular section of our Constitution without looking at the very pertinent topic of the Senate’s power to block supply, then we as legislators would be criticised for not taking that action. More importantly, we would be criticised for repeating the sins of the past. Let us look wisely, let us look well and let us have a lot more discussion about it. Bundaberg. I am sorry-the member for Hinkler. our. I would like to start where the previous speaker left off. I think that section 57 is a very important part of our Constitution. As the member for Prospect said, and as we all know, it was one of the most fiercely debated issues in the constitutional conventions leading up to Federation. The reason for that is that we had-as we still have today-three reasonably dominant states and three states of lesser population; so in a federation there would always be a danger that the three larger states could gang up on the three smaller ones. The composition of the Senate, which was originally six per state, later 10 per state and, more recently, 12 per state, was designed to keep that balance. I for one am offended; in fact, I am outraged that we pick on Tasmania every time and say that, because Tasmania is of a lesser population and the number of senators on a quota basis is infinitely fewer than that of New South Wales, somehow there is some fault there. I do not accept that proposition. I accept that Tasmania came into the federation on a very clear understanding, and the fact that we have moved on 102 years does not make the reality of that any less. If we want a precedent or a parallel, we only have to look at the American constitution. There has been no move in the American constitution to give more senators to the large states on the east or west coasts at the expense of the inland states. There are still two senators per state, regardless of population. Our Constitution, with the Senate and the House of Representatives, was modelled largely on that, albeit within our system of government we use the Westminster procedures. The Senate was put in place for two reasons. The first reason was for it to be a states house, a guarantee that the large states did not ever gang up on the small ones, and to be fair, as the previous speaker said, there were also checks and balances to ensure that the small states did not overexert their authority. The second purpose of setting up the Senate and the purpose it has exercised most, especially over the last 75 years or so, was for it to be a house of review-a check and balance on the House of Representatives. We should always remember that the House of Representatives is made up of single-constituency seats and members elected by the people. It is the people’s house. It is modelled on the House of Commons and on the American House of Representatives. It is modelled as being a people’s house-a oneMAIN COMMITTEE",128,Ministerial Statements

190,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (10.42 A.m.),"I accept the new electorate’s name with great honvote, one-value house. And it is the house that governs the country; in the Westminster system the government is chosen from the people’s house. The one thing the Senate was never meant to be was a parallel chamber to the House of Representatives. That was never intended by the founding fathers, but in reality that is what it has become, especially over the last decade or so. It has become a parallel chamber, exerting almost as much influence as the House of Representatives itself. I believe that it has gone from being a check-and-balance house, a house of review, to one that exercises its authorityfor example, by not accepting bills if they are not in by certain dates and refusing point-blank to accept certain budget bills. Previous speakers have said that the Senate has only ever blocked supply on a few occasions; I accept that. But, when a government goes to an election seeking a mandate and then tries to implement that, obviously the money measures in the budget bills are an integral part of that, so you are frustrating a government’s budget-and I am not talking about amending it here and there. I give the example of the PBS. No-one wants to see the cost of the PBS increase. I do not want to see the pensioners of my electorate pay another dollar for their medicines. I do not want to see the full-paying pharmacy customers paying another $6 or so for their prescriptions. None of us wants that. But we also know that we live in a world where new drugs are coming onto the market every day, that we want Australians to have the very best health care-we are amongst the best in the world and we want to retain that position-and that the cost of drugs is increasing by at least 14 per cent per year. As you can see, even without taking the compounding factor into account, that means that drugs are going to double in price every seven years or so. If that is the case then the Senate, in frustrating that for nearly a full term of the parliament, is putting that whole system in jeopardy. If a government is acting responsibly and keeping the various buckets of money for education, health, roads, foreign affairs, agriculture and so on in balance and the Senate frustrates money going into the health bucket, so to speak, then, if we cannot provide drugs to people who desperately need them, the Senate has a lot to answer for. I use that as only one illustration. What we also see is that, every time there is a crystal clear issue that we have debated in one form or another in both houses over a period of time, the Senate has an inquiry-they have a Friday inquiry, they have a full inquiry. We are talking today about an inquiry that all the commentators are saying may well be a total waste of money because the government’s negotiations with the Democrats over the MedicarePlus bill are not complete-yet the Senate has gone ahead with an inquiry. I think the Senate has shown that it wants to be a parallel house, but where it cannot get its own way it wants to be obstructionist. When that occurs, you have got to ask: is the original intent of the Senate being fulfilled? I do not think it is. I am quite comfortable with both propositions. I like the Prime Minister’s proposition, although I have reservations. After a bill has been rejected once and rejected again three months later, I would have a further cooling-off period of another six months. There should be about 12 months from the initiation of a bill to when a joint sitting is held so that there is absolute certainty that the public and both houses of the parliament have adequate time to debate, understand and review the issue. I cannot see why a joint sitting, after a period like this and a number of rejections, could not be put in place. The Lavarch model puts another covenant on that. The Lavarch model says that any bills that have met the double dissolution requirement as at the time of the dissolution of the previMAIN COMMITTEE ous parliament can be matters for consideration by a joint sitting of the new parliament. I am comfortable with that as well. That says to the public, ‘If you like what the previous government has done in policy terms and if you like the bills that have been racked up and haven’t been passed, then if you re-elect that government you give them the opportunity to have those bills passed by a joint sitting of both houses.’ That is a perfectly reasonable proposition; the public have the safety valve of an election to express their displeasure. Obviously if the public felt that the bills that were racked up for consideration after the election were in some way unfair, draconian or not in keeping with the government’s original mandate or the spirit of what they said, then they do not re-elect the government. It is pretty simple stuff. We Australians need to think of our country in a modern, electronic world. We have to be able to react quickly to changing events and circumstances and to changing social and economic matters. We need to have not only a framework of governance but also the mechanisms of governance in harmony with a modern electronic world. To have the double dissolution provision that we have today, which requires a long, drawn out period and then a special election purely to pass the government’s bills, is stretching the elastic a bit too far. The principles enunciated in the Howard and Lavarch suggestions are pretty good. In conclusion, I want to come back to where I started. I reiterate that I do not think Tasmania or the Northern Territory should be penalised because their quota divided by the number of senators is any different from the other states. If we have a genuine federation, we have to respect the smallest and the largest. Coming back to what the house of the people and the house of review is all about, let us take ourselves back to the early part of last century when the House of Lords was frustrating the House of Commons in Westminster. That was a very interesting scenario because obviously the House of Commons was the people’s house-it governed; the government was always formed from the House of Commons-but the Lords was, at this particular period, frustrating the will of the government. Of course the lords were not elected or even appointed in those days. As I understand it, King GeorgeV threatened to create sufficient lords to make sure it passed. Even the king, the head of state, recognised that the people’s house was being frustrated, and he was prepared to do something about it. We are in a different circumstance here and now. As I said, we have moved on to an electronic age in which our mechanisms of governance have to react quickly to world situations for the sake of Australia. We must have checks and balances, but I think section 57 does require greater attention. I would welcome it being put to the Australian people as a test of their view on whether we should have some more efficient way of breaking deadlocks between the House of Representatives and the Senate. Debate (on motion by Mr Quick) adjourned. Recent Australian Bushfires Committee Report Debate resumed from 5 November, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the paper. Committee on the Recent Australian Bushfires has been an interesting one. Being the deputy MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Ministerial Statements
191,Mr Adams (Lyons) (10.56 A.m.),"The inquiry of the House of Representatives Selectchair of this committee, which took evidence for seven months, was a very worthwhile exercise. The bushfire inquiry started in some hostile circumstances when the federal government was out to find scapegoats. During the launch of the inquiry, the chairman was pre-empting the findings with federal criticism of the capacities of the states. I believe it is not in the best interests of the country to assign blame for those fires, or any fires. Those fires could well have happened anyway and, although there can be changes in responses, it is doubtful whether-because of the drought conditions, the higher than average temperatures and the lower than average rainfall at that time-anything would have made any difference. We can add to that the work that had not been done by a whole host of bodies, including some individuals, to eliminate the fuel loads in the days before the fires. SoI do not think it serves any good purpose to try and lay blame in any one quarter, because we are all culpable in some way or another. I know the opposition has been pursuing the goal, since early 2002, of having a national strategy put in place using a lot of the knowledge gained from past fires. This had not been done, so the federal government had some liability there too after saying that they were going down that path. I believe that, from now on, we need to keep the response to the A nation charred: inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires report as bipartisan as possible so that many of the very good recommendations can be put in place. The COAG inquiry is starting, and hopefully that will pick up some of the recommendations. I believe that the members of the now disbanded committee which put out this report will be meeting with the officials of the COAG committee next week to pass on as much knowledge as possible, in the hope that we can assist in the ongoing development of a national strategy. Within this committee we had some excellent discussions. It was very tough at times. There were a lot of difficulties, but the chairman and I were able to keep the committee going forward and we achieved a very good report in the end. The paper presented to the committee by Nic Gellie was very helpful in pointing out some bottom line problems. One point is that the major fires come around every 10 or 15 years, meaning that few people get experience in developing skills of strategic and local fire assessment. This leaves gaps in local understanding of ecosystems, terrain, fire, fire weather and shortand long-term climate patterns. This knowledge is vital to fashion more appropriate fire strategies to cope with specific fires. Nic Gellie pointed out: ... decisions are now made in fire control centres, remote from the fireground, which often complicate, slow, and frustrate flexible and prompt decision-making. Groups of people isolated from the fire ground, and its myriad of small rapid changes brought about changes in fire weather, fuels, terrain, and success or failure of fire suppression crews, cannot respond effectively and efficiently to rapidly changing scenarios. Decision-making then becomes reactive and loses momentum in pre-emptive planning and creating opportunities to limit overall threats of a fire. Local people on the ground begin to lose confidence. People are pulled out of a fire because the imperative is that firefighter safety comes first and, without concrete knowledge, it is important to err on the side of caution. We must start looking at changes to how we deal with fire and land management, how we look at training and how we approach developing a national strategy that takes into account local knowledge. Tasmania is getting to the stage of having highly integrated public land management and fire management, and sophisticated planning is being employed in impleMAIN COMMITTEE menting strategic mosaic burns to meet both fuel reduction objectives and community expectations on the environment. One should remember that Hobart is one of the driest capitals in Australia, drier than Launceston in the north and also drier than Melbourne and Sydney; people do not always associate dryness with the wonderful city of Hobart. Because of the weather pattern in January and February, Hobart is very vulnerable to fire. Last season it was very vulnerable to a very large fire on the outskirts of my electorate, which could have quite easily entered the city and done some of the damage we saw occur in Canberra. It was probably a change of weather that saved us last year. Training goes on all the time at the local level, and equipment is being phased in that has multiple uses and is interchangeable within various services called on to fight fires. In Tasmania, national parks, the forestry commission and the fire service itself all are training management operators. Everyone is trained along the same lines and all the equipment is interchangeable. That is not the case in the rest of Australia. Regular audits of local equipment and ability are also part of our strategy, so that when it comes to an emergency we know what we have. You really need to have those audits in place. It must be known where assistance can be obtained and how long it will take to get it into the fight to suppress a fire. That is very important information. I think the telling points that need to be addressed are on land management. Over the last 50 years the management of land in Australia has been gradually changing. People’s aspirations are becoming greater and in the last 20 years or so this has developed into clashes between environmental views and traditional land management practices. Change has to occur, but what, how and at what level? What do we have to take into account in future fire periods, and what knowledge have we gained from the past? Evidence to the committee from the wider community proved that fuel reduction burning was a very contentious issue. Discussions even threw up a perception that people did not like so much smoke throughout the summer, and I heard that Government House here once asked that no burning off be done because they had several garden parties set up. Because of the need to reduce fuel-and that can only be done during certain times of year under certain conditions; as borne out by the evidence to the committee-it is impossible to fit fuel reduction burns around events. There are only so many days to do the burn-offs, only so many days to do that fire reduction, and those days will have to be used. Our community will have to come to the conclusion that those days will be the days on which that burning is undertaken. We may all have to put up with some smoke during our activities to ensure that our communities are safe. There can be no ifs or buts-smoke is a part of our summer nowadays. The argument is that hazard reduction burning is seen by some parts of the community as the main tool for fire prevention, whereas others have equally strong views that the practice ought to be either abandoned or severely restricted on environmental grounds because of the possibility of unwanted wildfires and urban sensitivities. We also have a situation where some communities’ attitudes have moved to accepting greater areas of our forests, bushlands and wilderness being set aside in national parks. These increased areas, along with members of the community stridently opposing broadscale hazard reduction burning, have made it extremely difficult for land managers, firefighters and the community to strike an appropriate balance between ensuring environmental outcomes that protect biodiversity and other environmental values and initiating measures to reduce loads on MAIN COMMITTEE a sustainable scale to protect property and life. So there is an underlying basic conflict that needs to be understood and resolved by those in local areas as well as those who tend to criticise from afar. Other issues come into the long-term planning for fire prevention. These include planning considerations in local government. Past planning practices have allowed housing developments in inappropriate areas with individual property owners being permitted poor choices in the design of buildings and materials used in the construction of those buildings. Even the legal system in some states has made it difficult for local government to refuse to allow developments in sensitive and fire prone areas at the urban-bush interface. Public education needs to be addressed too. Those seeking a rural lifestyle may be unfamiliar with the demands of living in a rural environment and the need to adequately prepare their properties for the eventuality of a bushfire. Many landowners are not doing enough to protect their properties at the urban interface, and this is putting others at risk. So crunch time is coming again, and recommendations raised in the report must be taken on board soon to prevent another tremendous fire season. Recommendation 25 seeks to have the Commonwealth ensure that the Council of Australian Governments seek the adoption by all states and territories of multi-agency protocols and agreements for fire management, similar to those that apply in Tasmania between the groups that I mentioned earlier. This is vital for the development of a national strategy. Recommendation 26 continues with this. It seeks to get the Emergency Management Australia group to initiate a process involving the Australasian Fire Authorities Council and the Australasian Assembly of Volunteer Fire Brigade Associations to review the coordination of cross-border firefighting arrangements and interstate deployment of firefighting resources. This has to be undertaken before the season gets under way. Recommendation 29 recommends that it is important that the Commonwealth commit funding for aerial firefighting beyond the 2003-04 season. We have to have greater flexibility with aerial firefighting equipment, and long-term contracts are necessary in this area to have the equipment on stand-by. Recommendations 13, 14 and 15 are also important to ensure that we get agreements from the states on burning targets to some benchmark level that is seen as adequate to protect property, life and the environment. These recommendations include a national database that identifies fuel reduction areas, along with a database to be developed by the CRC to reach a national standard of fire mapping to actively map the extent, intensity, spread and overall pattern of prescribed fires and wildfires in Australia. People will be able to pick up a map on the computer and look to see where fires and mosaic burns have occurred over the last 10 years and make judgments about those. Recommendation 16 talks of smoke modelling by the bushfire CRC to try to acknowledge community concern about smoke pollution so that we can do the best we can to keep smoke away from urban areas. That is not always possible, and I think education on why that smoke is there needs to be undertaken. There are many other recommendations in this report, and they all need consideration by the COAG and the federal government. The report needs to see the light of day very regularly over the next few months-and maybe over the next year or so-so that discussions can continue and the conclusions and recommendations of this report can fit into real policy decisions and basic changes to the Australian context. MAIN COMMITTEE aster relief arrangements, I had great pleasure in issuing the terms of reference and implementing a select committee of the House of Representatives, one that represented all the parties represented in that House. It is with great pleasure that I stand today to participate in this debate and to congratulate those who participated in the work of the Select Committee on the Recent Australian Bushfires to produce this very comprehensive report. There has been some comment, even from the member for Lyons, that there was some politics involved in this issue. The only politics that has arisen throughout this debate is from those who claim there was politics involved. The select committee was fully representative on a party political basis, and the politics came from those who wished to defend the mistakes they had made-particularly the premiers of Victoria and New South Wales, who forbade their agencies to attend. The excuse given was that they were all too busy, but they attended every public hearing of the committee. They were there, all dressed up in their suits or uniforms, listening in but not prepared to assist the committee with the expertise they might have brought to the inquiry. There are aspects of this matter that need to be identified. The fundamental issues come down to two words: suppression or prevention. What purpose should we follow? Where should the major expenditure of government be? Should it be putting out your house after it has burnt down, hosing down the ashes? Should it be trying to put helicopters in the air when there is so much smoke they cannot fly? Or should it be implementing policies, practised historically in Australia by the Aboriginal people, of keeping fuel loads down to a level below where wildfire of almost nuclear proportions can develop? I have heard many arguments over time. As soon as there is a fire somewhere, the media want to focus on who lit it. It might have been lit by natural causes, of course, such as lightning. But let us say it was lit by a careless smoker or-unfortunately, but frequently-by children who have a fascination with matches. It might have been lit by a careless worker using an angle grinder on a bad day. But the fact of life is that those fires would go nowhere if there were not adequate fuel to sustain them. I have said to many a journalist: ‘Go home tonight, put some 50 millimetre logs in your barbecue or lounge room fireplace and try to light them with a cigarette butt. If you like, go and get the angle grinder and try to light them. You can’t.’ We have to realise that there are no fires without fuel. Prevention is a better solution than burying four or six people around Australia and wiping out 400 houses in Canberra alone. Let us look to history to find out how this might be done. Deputy Speaker Adams might be interested in what Abel Janz Tasman wrote in his logbook in 1642 when he was at the north end of Storm Bay, Tasmania. He talked about massive trees and went on to say: ... the country was covered with trees; but so thinly scattered, that one might see everywhere to a great distance amongst them ... Several of the trees were much burnt at the foot ... That was the forest that people say we are supposed to protect. But it is not the forest today. I could go on. In Western Australia in January it gets a bit hot; it is not exactly the time you would light fires. But William de Vlamingh, commander of the Dutch ship Nijptang during January in 1697 at the Swan River recorded: MAIN COMMITTEE",134,Committees
192,Mr Tuckey (O’connor) (11.11 A.m.),"As the then minister responsible for national disNo men were seen but they observed many smokes ... The Aboriginals were burning in January with safety. Why? Because they burnt all the time, as recorded by Governor Phillip, when he wrote in 1788: ... and theythe Aboriginesare seldom seen without fire, or a piece of wood on fire, which they carry with them from place to place, and in their canoes. … … … The natives always make their fire, if not before their own huts, at the root of a gumtree, which burns very freely and they never put a fire out when they leave the place. That is the history of it. That is not criticism; that is the way they managed. And they never got killed in bushfires because the bushfires never had the fuel. This is interesting because it is a matter of history. I have an interesting extract of an article published on the American ABC News web site on 18 August 2000. It reads: With wildfires raging out of control in 13 Western states, Rex Wahl has seen enough. Like a peaceloving homesteader who finally reaches for his six-shooter, the influential environmentalist has unholstered his chain saw. Wahl is ready to cut down trees to save the forest. There is an environmentalist looking out for the environment. I could go on to explain that he saw massive destruction of 200 homes in a fire near his place. The article is interesting because it talks about history. It went on: A century ago ... healthy conifer forests sprouted 25 to 70 mature trees per acre. Lush meadows filled the gaps. … … … Today’s forests stand in cadaverous contrast. After a century of fire suppression, as many as 850 spindly trees per acre clog the same forests. More than half stand dead, starved for sunlight and strangled by insects that bore into them. I can take the member for Lyons to parts of the great forests of Tasmania where he will see that the dead trees are in predominance. Prevention requires us to go back to history. Four years ago I was the Minister for Forestry and Conservation. Back in 1988 I read of the devastation of Yellowstone National Park. It still has not recovered. The fires got so hot that they burnt a metre into the ground, as happened in the Snowy area. The trees in the Snowy area are not growing back; there is no soil there for them to grow on. It was burnt out. But I called a ministerial council-and for the information of members there were two Liberal ministers present, one representing the ACT. I had them briefed by Australian firefighters who had been to America and seen the devastation-the damage to the environment, private property and human life and the huge costs involved for the taxpayer. I got them briefed by one of the leading firefighters, who told them that it was all going to happen in Australia. When I asked them as federal minister-and there has been some reference to us taking the lead in a national strategy-what they thought they should do about it, they said, ‘We had better put out a press release.’ I said, ‘Is that press release going to have some reference to prevention?’ There was deathly silence around the table, then someone said, ‘Are you talking about cutting down the odd tree?’ I said, ‘That may be part of it.’ Their response was, ‘If we MAIN COMMITTEE have to touch one tree, we will not do it.’ There are an awful lot of dead trees now, and it was a deliberate decision by the state ministers at the time not to do anything. What was going on in New South Wales? The National Parks and Wildlife Service were taking over all of the declared national parks, immediately going in, as this report identifies, ripping up the old forestry roads, which were apparently a symbol of past decadence, pulling out the bridges and making it impossible to get the normal suppression measures of a water tanker and maybe a piece of earthmoving equipment in to address the fires when they started. Furthermore, they had an absolutely deliberate opposition to hazard reduction, which is highlighted as the first recommendation of the McLean committee and others that have been conducted in recent times. They deliberately opposed doing it. In their own report they identified that they were down to doing hazard reduction on 0.5 per cent of the area under management per annum, whilst in the remaining areas of New South Wales forest still under the management of state forests hazard reduction was being done on 15 per cent a year. We have people like Koperberg, who is put up as some sort of hero but is never seen near a fire-he is just a television man-getting up on the 7.30 Report with Kerry O’Brien, saying that it was impossible to do 85,000 hectares of hazard reduction a year and hinting that that was one per cent of New South Wales, as though there is no Sydney and all of New South Wales is covered in trees. That is blatant misrepresentation when you are talking about life and death and massive environmental destruction. In the last two fire years state forests have had negligible fires within their area of responsibility. The National Parks and Wildlife Service have had millions of hectares burnt. What does that tell us? You cannot say it is not a fact. It is a fact. Of course, notwithstanding the sneering at me and others for trying to raise these issues four years ago, I was consequently accused one day by the state minister-who for a change came out instead of leaving it, as usual, to his minions, Koperberg and, I think, Gilbert, who as public servants should be out there putting out or preventing fires, not being television identities-of wanting to bituminise the forests of New South Wales. What a load of silly rubbish, when I was standing up and warning all Australians that the tragedy that has now occurred was imminent. In frustration, I eventually put myself on the Laurie Oakes show one Sunday morning and I made these predictions-and I had a look at a copy of that particular interview just the other day. The next day I was attacked throughout Australia in the print media, and the Sydney Morning Herald went as far as to say-quoting, I think, the Australian Conservation Foundation, which is a great expert in all these matters, run by a guitar player who, I guess, has some connection with wood; he has it in his guitar-that Australian native trees were naturally fire retardant, to which I replied, ‘Does that mean we can spread woodchips on future fires to put them out?’ This raises another issue, about which I have corresponded with the Press Council. Does the Australian media have a duty of care? For that matter, did the National Parks and Wildlife Service have a duty of care? Why did Koperberg pull his barrister down in, I think it was, Batemans Bay during the recent coronial inquiry when his barrister started to get up national parks and wildlife witnesses as to what they had done? There is a duty of care, and it goes well beyond firefighters. It goes to the people who live reasonably close to forests, such as the people here in Canberra. Does the media have a responsibility not to be carried along by guiMAIN COMMITTEE tar playing greenies but to put some proper substance into these debates so that people know their homes and lives are at risk? I found it outrageous that I was attacked in that way-as I was attacked when I came out after the fires here and said that there should be an inquiry. I was told that I was insensitive, that I had made some insensitive remarks. That report was made on the ABC and, when we asked them to give us evidence, they apologised and withdrew the remark. But that did not stop every other journalist, or the Labor Party in the House of Representatives the other day, making this allegation. When I challenged the member for Canberra to produce evidence, she produced a couple of transcripts that had no such insensitive remarks in them. It is not an issue for politics; it is an issue of life and death. It is an issue of environmental destruction. This report and its recommendations, if followed, will assist considerably. It is just a pity that it was not seen as the penultimate document, with proper contribution from the state agencies in New South Wales and Victoria. More importantly, they have to work through the issues of prevention. You can have as many helicopters and as many firefighting appliances as you like but, if you have not reduced the fuel load, they will be ineffective when, as occurred in Canberra, the energy released by the fire is equivalent to one of the nuclear devices dropped on Japan. That is what it was. Those houses did not burn; they were blown up. Anyone who visited the area after the fire could see just that, particularly when you saw some houses left standing and others destroyed. They are the issues-and it is very important that the recommendations in this report be considered. recent Australian bushfires. The House of Representatives Select Committee inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires was one of a number of inquiries conducted by state and federal authorities into those devastating events. There was the ACT McLeod inquiry and also a coronial inquiry in the ACT. In Victoria, there was the Auditor-General’s inquiry and the Esplin inquiry. In New South Wales, there was a joint select committee on the 2001-02 bushfires, and a coronial inquiry has also been completed. At the national level, two inquiries have been conducted-the one we are debating today and the national inquiry on bushfire management, prevalence and mitigation being conducted in cooperation between the Commonwealth, states and territories through the Council of Australian Governments, COAG. If the member for O’Connor would like to stay, in a little while I intend to refer to the exminister and make some remarks about his involvement. I also want to refer to what I felt were the political implications of the inquiry. It is something that one felt. Not a lot had to be said, but you felt that there were some political implications. Previous members of the committee from the ALP side have already emphasised that, and I indicate that that was also my feeling. The member for Canberra has indicated that she was concerned about the minister arriving in Canberra on 19 January and making some statements relating to the bushfire at what was a very inappropriate time when there was a lot of tension and a lot of emotion and the people were feeling very vulnerable. At times such as those, it is a good idea for politicians to get out of the way and let the firefighters get on with the job. Another story that I picked up during the inquiry was that the minister’s plane, while in Jindabyne, actually blocked a fuel tanker and the firefighting plane could not be refuelled for over an hour. Obviously I do not blame the minister for that-he was not the pilot; he did not park the plane. But it shows us that in times of crisis when we cannot make a contributionMAIN COMMITTEE",138,Committees
193,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (11.26 A.m.),"I rise to speak in support of the report on thewe could have had a look too if we had wanted to get in the way-it is a good idea for us to stay out of the way until the firefighters have done their job and we can make an assessment. Other members of the committee have also indicated their concern. The member for Corio, Gavan O’Connor, said: Despite the overt political circumstance of this committee’s establishment and, on occasions, its overt political manipulation, Labor members stuck with the task in order to keep faith with the people and communities around Australia ... We did that in spite of some tension and in spite of some bullying tactics from the government side when we tried to raise particular issues. The member for Lyons also took the same view. He felt that there was an overly political tone because of the antics of the then minister. That was certainly the view we had, but we stuck with the job. In the long run, I think there were some people on the government side who helped very much to get the committee on track and made a good contribution. They took a moderate approach. We then felt we were able, with our additional comments, to support the recommendations. I recall quite clearly the first day of inspections of the damage caused by the Canberra fires. As one who had only seen the effects on TV, it was certainly an eye-opener. We were forewarned. The committee was advised that people giving evidence were very emotionally affected by the fires, because of their life-threatening experiences-which at that stage we were not aware of-the loss of their family homes and the devastation of the surrounding countryside with extensive damage to flora and fauna. Clear evidence was given to the committee by the local firefighters that, in their view, the fires should have been attacked earlier, before they got well established, and that the mechanical and aerial resources should have been brought into play a lot earlier than they were. As land management authorities did not give evidence to this inquiry, for various reasons, these genuine criticisms were not able to be fully tested. However, media reports indicated that the New South Wales Rural Fire Service had evidence that these fires had, within hours of ignition, on 8 January, become too dangerous to fight directly. I think it is significant that, in spite of the intensity of the fires-which are probably the worse we have seen in our lifetimes-there was no loss of life amongst the firefighters themselves. There was, unfortunately, loss of life, as we all know. This is in marked contrast to other fires around Australia, where there has been loss of life amongst the firefighters. Maybe the caution that was exhibited, and which has been criticised, was of some benefit in saving lives. Neither that evidence nor the media reports have been put to the inquiry, but they will be tested in the New South Wales Rural Fire Service evidence to the inquiry set up under the Council of Australian Governments. I believe that is in the process of commencing now, with appropriate people being appointed to that inquiry. To come to some broad conclusions about the Canberra fires, it may be useful to look at evidence presented by organisations that were not directly affected by the Canberra fires themselves but were very much involved in the bushfire scene. I think that is important, because you have people who know what they are talking about but who are removed from the emotion involved in what were obviously very devastating effects for the people directly involved. One submission I would like to refer to was made by the Blue Mountains Conservation Society. I would like to refer to two points made in that submission. It said: MAIN COMMITTEE Lightning and arson are the two main causes of wildfire. Fires arising from these causes can not be prevented, but watchfulness of all in areas of risk can reduce the severity. The submission also made the point: A major risk factor contributing to the impact on people and property is that of granting development consent in high and extreme bushfire risk areas. This could be addressed immediately, preventing further building in such areas. I think this is a very good point. Councils and other authorities have allowed residential developments in high-bushfire-risk areas. Another factor which has come though quite clearlyand which, I believe, was the major factor behind the fires-was the hotter, drier weather that we were experiencing at the time. Although this may be cyclical climate change due to global warming, leading to more frequent El Nino events, the federal and state governments share equal responsibility for not improving the control of these changes. As the submission says: This must be addressed urgently, and by all Australian governments as any change will be over the long term. Another important point made in this submission was about the lack of education and preparedness of the communities in general, which contributed to the severity of the impact. For example, in the Canberra fires, most residents were not adequately prepared to protect their homes or gardens and did not maintain them to reduce fire spread. Homes were not fitted with well-known and acceptable measures to assist in risk management. Furthermore, too many residents were not insured, contributing to financial impact. One of the issues with the fires was that most of the damage was done not by the fires moving past the buildings but, rather, from the embers getting into the buildings. In many cases the homes were destroyed after the fire had passed by. The argument was put that, had people been allowed to stay in their homes, most or many of the houses would have been saved. Where people did stay in their houses, they were able to fight the fires and no houses were actually lost. That is an interesting point that came out in this inquiry. The other point made in the Blue Mountains Conservation Society’s submission is based on a paper prepared by Stuart James for the rural fire service in the Blue Mountains district. The submission states that Stuart James found that hazard reduction burns are of limited effectiveness. I noticed the member for O’Connor previously speaking in this debate. He used the example of how the Aboriginals operated 100 years ago. I think we have to be prepared to recognise that things have changed since then and what may or may not have been effective in those days is not necessarily effective today. I think we have to be prepared to accept modern views and modern technology. Referring once again to Stuart James’s report, in relation to hazard reduction burns, the submission stated: The studies found that there was significant difference in results in dry and wet climatic cycles, with greater success in dry cycles. Effectiveness also depended on the aspect, and on the degree of shading of the ground and understorey. There is also a correlation between understorey heights and burn result ... The submission also says: Hazard reduction, other than by fire, eg slashing, mowing and thinning of vegetation, near the assets being protected will provide better protection for those assets than burning in remote areas. MAIN COMMITTEE They are just some of the conflicting issues that we were confronted with. I would like to refer, once again-to give a broad approach to this inquiry-to some comments made by the CSIRO, which we all accept as being an authority on this issue. The CSIRO submission said: The severity of the recent fires was related to a combination of factors including the generally high fuel loads, the prolonged drought, and the weather conditions experienced during and after the fire ignition events (mostly lightning strikes and ember spotting). CSIRO has no data to definitively attribute cause, or link effect, to the various individual factors. Further, the submission says: The combination of fuel loads, drought, daily weather and fire ignition conditions on the worse days were a 1-20 to 1-30 year event. Canberra was experiencing a 1-10 year drought, could expect lightning storms of this nature in about 1-20 years and experiences about 3 days per year of similar extreme weather conditions. The need to understand what happened and to plan for future events is thus an urgent priority. We have to learn something out of this; it is no good trying to apportion blame. A lot of good information has been provided. The Labor Party were happy, with some reservations, to support the conclusions of the report. We probably have to look at all of the reports that have come down. There is no doubt that those responsible for determining future policies on land management and fire prevention will have the benefit of evidence and conclusions presented to all these inquiries that I have mentioned and will not have to rely on any one particular inquiry which may have a political bent or may not have been able to hear all the participants in the bushfire field. Finally, I thank the committee secretariat and staff for their dedication and work in putting this report together. CanI also say how impressed I was, as I am sure we all were, by the residents of Canberra and the surrounding areas who made submissions to the inquiry. We were also impressed by their commitment to the environment and to fighting bushfires generally. of the hearings of the committee. But, having grown up on the lower Clarence River in northern New South Wales, I cut my teeth on bushfires and I think that, given my family background, I know quite a bit about the problems associated with bushfires, particularly in New South Wales. My family first went to the lower Clarence in 1889. My great-grandfather was involved in some of the very early management of the land in that area and probably some of the clearing, which is now criticised too, for farming. As I was growing up, my grandfather gave me a lot of advice on what needed to be done to manage the land, particularly the land we owned privately that was forested land. If you go back through the history of Australia, you will soon realise that fire has always been a part of our environment. The fact is that if you look at the diaries of the old explorers-which people tend not to do at the present time-you will find that most of the countryside was in fact open grazing country. That was what the explorers reported as they went across it. In hindsight, the reasons for that are quite clear-the regularity with which fires, including wildfires from lightning strikes, went through the landscape, and its management by the Aborigines. And then of course most of the young trees were killed off. There were not the great forests that we have in certain areas today. In fact, in many areas of my electorate, particularly above Grafton, when Europeans first settled that area-including the Baryulgil Station, which was the big grazing station of the upper Clarence-they did not settle it because MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Committees
194,Mr Causley (Page) (11.41 A.m.),"Unfortunately, with my duties, I did not get to a lotthere were trees to clear but because it was open grazing country. That same country today, because it has been locked up and is no longer grazing country, is forest. Those forests have grown in the last 30 years because of the changes to land management. So land management is at the core of this problem. I am disappointed that the states have played a game here, and the reason for it is quite clear. The fact is that they are the managers of the public land in their areas and they can clearly see that they have a problem, but they are not addressing it. The problem is that they have so much public land they cannot manage it. If they try to manage it in the way that is in the best interests of the whole landscape, it is going to cost them a lot of money-and that is the real reason why they will not participate in this debate. It is the real reason why they are not engaging with a problem that is a real problem for the whole community. My great-grandfather said that he learnt very quickly from the Aborigines, probably just from observing them, that the way to keep fuel under control was to use their method of management. Their method of management was not on par for the environment, by the way; it was for food. They used fire to get food, but in the process of course fires went right across the landscape. Much of our flora in particular has evolved through fire and would not exist if the landscape had not had fires through it. So it is something we have to come to terms with. During my youth, even though much of the land was what we call crown land, it was either forest land managed by Forestry or, in many instances, leasehold land. Even the forest land was given grazing rights. There were grazing rights given over the crown land as well. On a very cool, clear autumn or spring day, I would see, especially as a young person going to school, fires rising. We used to call them horseback fires-and that is exactly what they were, because the graziers who had the lease on this land would take that opportunity to reduce the fuel. They knew that, if they did not reduce the fuel, they would have trouble later on in the hotter months of the year when they could get wildfires running through those areas. I think it was Commissioner Koperberg who said, in an interview last year, ‘There’s only a short window of opportunity.’ That is absolutely right. There are very few days of the year when it is optimum to reduce this fuel. How was it done in the past? It was done in the past by the people on the ground. Hundreds of little lessees and property owners-and Forestry, and I will come back to that in a minute-took that opportunity to burn off little sections and keep the fuel down. It is only in recent years that that management has changed. I can recall the complaints, even in my area, by new settlers about the smoke in the springtime caused by these people reducing fuel. The new settlers said they came for the clear skies of the North Coast of New South Wales. Those clear skies can get awfully black at Christmas time if you do not have a bit of smoke in the autumn and the spring. You have to manage that properly. When I was minister for forests in New South Wales, there was a whole section of the Forestry Commission whose job it was to reduce fuel. The section was run by one of the deputy commissioners of forests, Mr Roy Free. They had two fixed-wing aircraft and two helicopters, and at the optimum time of the year they would drop incendiaries along the ridge lines to try and reduce some of this fuel, because that was in the best interests of the forests and of the flora and fauna of the forests. We have this argument at the present time which has developed over the last decade and a half or so from extreme environmentalist groups who say that the only way to manage the land is to lock it all up and make sure that it is not affected at all-just put a fence around it MAIN COMMITTEE and walk away from it. That is where we are getting into trouble. It does not matter whether you live in rural New South Wales or other parts of rural Australia or in the northern suburbs of Sydney-the risk is the same. When I fly over the northern suburbs of Sydney coming into the airport, I look down and say, ‘There is a disaster waiting to happen,’ because my knowledge of fire is that it does not matter which way the wind is blowing-fire always goes uphill. I can assure you that those people who are living on the edges of those gullies in northern Sydney are sitting on a tinder box that will erupt one day. It is just a matter of when it will happen. It used to be the role in life of the Forestry Commission to reduce the fuel, but many of these areas have now been turned over to National Parks, and National Parks has a different attitude to this. I think that it is fair to say that the Premier of New South Wales would like to see himself with a place in history. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that he has a bit of an ego, and he certainly has a panache, I suppose, in certain ways for history-and certainly American history. But, unfortunately and ironically, I think in many ways he will be remembered in history as the Premier who caused the problems in New South Wales with the management of public land. When I first went into the New South Wales house, Bob Carr was the Minister for the Environment and was responsible for national parks. He was in the Wran government in those days. Again, I do not think it is any exaggeration to say he is deep green. That is fine, but I think that the argument is flawed. I believe the argument is flawed because there is a report by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales which clearly shows that the majority of the fauna on the public land of New South Wales is in the forest areas that have been disturbed. Why is that? I think it is fairly obvious. It is because there is more food for the animals in a mixed growth forest. Koalas do not eat the leaves of old trees; they eat those of young trees. They eat young, nutrient-rich leaves. I have been in the bush all my life and I have seen them. They enjoy those. So the argument that you lock these areas up in the interests of flora and fauna is flawed. I think our grandchildren will judge us on that because, quite frankly, it is wrong. The other issue is that when you have reduction burns in autumn or spring they are slow, cool fires. The fire probably will get no more than a metre off the ground because of the time of year, especially if you keep the fuel down to a reasonable level. This allows the animals and birds to escape. How do koalas try to escape from fires? They go up trees. That is their escape mechanism. But when you get these extremely hot, savage fires in the summertime and koalas go up the trees the fire gets them because you have an explosion throughout a eucalypt forest. I do not know whether anyone has ever seen the crown fires that can happen in a eucalypt forest. They are frightening because on a very hot day, with temperatures around 42 or 43 degrees and humidity of 20 per cent, you get this big fire. The eucalyptus gases from the leaves explode and the fire just runs across the tops of the trees. It is a frightening sight-it travels at enormous speed. In that instance the birds and animals, and the trees for that matter, do not stand a chance. I can take you to areas on the North Coast where a very hot fire went through some 20 years ago. The trees still have not grown back because of the heat of the fire at the time, although they will eventually. MAIN COMMITTEE The argument that you lock these areas up and that somehow this enhances the environment is quite wrong. I think we have to look very closely at the way we have been managing our public lands. There is plenty of experience out there in the community if we are prepared to use it-if we are prepared to listen to how these people manage the land. I am sure there is plenty of evidence, if we are prepared to look at it in an objective way, to show the best way to manage the land. As far as the built environment and the horrific fires around Canberra which triggered this particular report are concerned-although they were not the first: there were horrific fires in Sydney in 1993-94-I believe there is an enormous problem with planning. If you are going to build close to bushland in Australia, you have to be aware of the risks. I know many people love to build a house in the middle of the bush and say: ‘Isn’t this a magnificent area to live in?’ It is, until it turns nasty. There is plenty of evidence around the edges of our cities, and in some instances in rural areas, where people have built in inappropriate areas. To take advantage of the environment, they have even built verandas and areas of their houses out into the trees. As I said, it is a wonderful aesthetic environment while the climate is benign but, as soon as the climate turns against you, you are in huge trouble. There are many issues with planning where the local governments in particular-in New South Wales they are charged with the responsibility of planning-need to look very closely at some of the planning issues associated with the risks from these horrific fires. Fire will always be with us. That is part of Australia. Even if we reduce the fuel, it does not completely eliminate the problem of fire. In the area where I live, on the North Coast of New South Wales-a relatively high rainfall area for a country like Australia which does not get a lot of rain-there are some years when the fuel cannot be reduced, because it is too wet. So we do get a build-up of fuel, even in the best managed areas, and in those circumstances there can be some fairly severe fires. Of course, the more years it is left, the greater the risk. If we have a look at the United States of America, in the last four or five years-I was there in recent times-they have changed their ideas dramatically. There were areas in California, in particular, that had not been burnt in 30 or 40 years; and, all of a sudden, they have got horrendous trouble on their hands and a tremendous loss of property and life. Australia really is in the same situation. As I have said, I did not get to a lot of the committee meetings, but I have read through the report and I think it is a comprehensive one. I just hope that people are prepared to look at it. I hope they put aside the politics involved and the fact that, in many instances, they have fenced themselves into a corner in the state scene. It is now going to be a very expensive exercise to try to manage public land, but that is absolutely no reason to ignore it. (Time expired) Ms PANOPOULOS (Indi) (11.56 a.m.)-One of the most incredible experiences, not just in my own electorate during last summer’s bushfires but during the extensive days of public hearings and going through the numerous written submissions-in fact, there were more than 200 submissions from my electorate-was seeing the usual, and justified, cynicism that so many Australian people have about government and reports actually dissipate. When I was travelling around my electorate during last summer’s bushfires, there was, admittedly, little I could do. I was not a volunteer firefighter. But what I could do was travel around the hundreds of burnt hectares in my electorate and speak to the people who were at MAIN COMMITTEE the coalface of the fires, fighting the fires and doing things like preparing meals for the firefighters. These volunteers left their businesses, their farms and their places. I spoke to these people because, at the end of the day, the people I trust the most are those ordinary Australians who live not just in my electorate but in other parts of the country. They may not say much, they may not be at the front of powerful lobby groups but, through their actions and their generosity with their time, they contribute so much to our communities, particularly in the country, and have a very positive benefit for our standard of living. As I travelled around the fire-affected areas, they said to me: ‘Sophie, we need an inquiry. We need the federal government to get involved. We are sick to death of being told that we do not have degrees and we cannot fight fires properly. We are sick to death of state departments not adequately managing the land next to our properties. We have to spend hundreds of hours and a significant amount of financial resources dealing with things like feral animals and noxious weeds, and yet we have seen, over years and over decades, the build-up of forest fuel. We have just had enough.’ Those of us who represent country electorates know that country people are used to adverse situations and natural disasters, and they are very patient. Sometimes I think they are too patient with respect to government action. And they have just had enough. Armed with that request and after consulting my other colleagues-including the member for Eden-Monaro, whose electorate was similarly affected through last summer’s bushfires-and once, eventually, after much discussion, the federal committee was announced and appointed, I was very honoured to serve on the House of Representative Select Committee into the Recent Australian Bushfires. Others who have been in this place longer than I have commented that this was one of the most difficult committees, if not the most difficult committee, they had served on in terms of the number of submissions, the hours of accepting evidence, the field trips and the general difficulty in reaching consensus on 59 very comprehensive recommendations. The difficulty, and let us not mince words about this, in reaching consensus on these 59 recommendations stemmed from the fact that state governments of all persuasions-but it just so happens that we currently have state governments who are all Labor governments-came under criticism. Much of the report was based on the evidence of volunteers-people who have had to deal on a day-to-day, season-to-season basis with these bureaucrats, people who have seen the systems of management of fires and crown land change and who were not afraid to speak. Unlike public servants in Victoria and New South Wales who were, disgracefully, gagged, these people owed nothing to anyone. I can understand some of my federal colleagues from the other side of the House not being prepared to be overtly critical of their state colleagues, even though they knew in their hearts that what these people were saying and what the recommendations have ended up saying was true. The over 500 pages of the report have said that it is pleasingMs Burke-Committees should not be used for party political processes. being upset. Ms Burke-I am not being upset.

It is very difficult at times for federal Labor members to be overtly critical of their state colleaguesMs Burke interjectingspite of some of the difficulties they may have had, particularly with the state minister, Mr Haermeyer-but everyone is having difficulty with him at the moment, including many of his own state colleagues-the federal Labor Party members on the committee supported the 59 recommendations. At this point, it is convenient that the member for Chisholm is deciding not to hear that her federal colleagues supported the 59 recommendations-which is of course at odds with the Victorian government, which very conveniently brushed aside the recommendations. The wonderful thing about this report is that everyone who sat on the committee, those who gave evidence and the thousands of people who have read it know that this is the voice of the people. IfI have to trust anyone at all, it is not going to be the bureaucrats in state or federal departments; it is going to be my people on the ground who know how to fight a fire, who have fought them for decades and who do it, quite thanklessly at times, in the face of the bureaucracy and without any financial reward. It is to those people I would particularly like to say thank you. Thank you for putting aside for a moment that well-earned cynicism about what governments can do and about whether governments will listen to you. It is particularly touching and very humbling for me that you trusted me to work in Canberra to produce something that gave you a voice and gave you an opportunity to finally be heard. The response to this very substantial inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires and the report, A nation charred: report on the inquiry into bushfires, has been absolutely tremendous. The report has already been read by a significant number of those who submitted their own thoughts to the committee and who gave oral evidence, and they are very pleased indeed. They share my concern, of course, to see that implementation of these recommendations is carried out as quickly as possible. Obviously these 59 recommendations will not be implemented overnight, but the onus is on all of us who understand that these things can easily be swept under the carpet and only brought to the fore with another major disaster, through our respective parliaments and political parties, to put party politics aside and do what the people of this nation have requested of us. You only need to look at the majority of the submissions to see that, from one end of the continent to the other, people were speaking with one voice. From one end of the continent to the other, we heard that there has been a change in fighting fires, that there is not as aggressive an attack when a fire begins. We saw some very tragic evidence here in Canberra that the fires could have been prevented had there been an aggressive attack in the first instance in the rural areas of the ACT. That not only saddens me but also angers me, because there are innocent citizens out there who have suffered economically and emotionally and many families right across my electorate of Indi, and over the border in Eden-Monaro, will never recover financially.

199,Ms Panopoulos,"but it was pleasing that, in spite of some of their reservations, inOf course we cannot control fires, but what we can control is the management of them. What we can control are the fuel loads. These people have suffered due to stupid and illconceived government policies-policies which parties on both sides have adopted from time to time. I feel very strongly and very passionately about our key responsibilities as legislators, members of parliament and representatives of the people to at least diminish the burden on those people of ill-conceived government policy. One of the most remarkable things I observed during the course of this very extensive inquiry was the guidance and chairmanship of the member for Eden-Monaro. I admired-and could only hope to emulate-his absolute patience and resilience through many meetings. I commented once before that, on one occasion, my patience was rather tried-and I suspect his was tried significantly more-when, for over 45 minutes, we debated the inclusion or exclusion of one word, and it was not one of those seminal words like ‘not’. At the end of the day, when looking at the final report, it was not a particularly seminal word, but I suppose we do need to go through a baptism of fire at times-and that was certainly mine. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his guidance in the lead-up to the committee actually being established, during the committee’s deliberations and afterwards. I know he is as passionate as I am about this over 400-page report, its recommendations and the obligations we have to the Australian people who took the time to speak to us and to write to us-particularly those who, after having gone through drought and fires, took time out from rebuilding their lives and their businesses to give us their very unique insights. There was also an extraordinary job done by the secretariat. The number of submissions that kept on flooding in was quite extraordinary. At one stage I did not believe that we would end up tabling the report by the allocated date, but the secretariat worked miracles. They worked wonders and they all worked extremely hard. The draft report that was produced was absolutely excellent and is a credit to them. I am sure I will sit on many inquiries over the course of this parliament-and perhaps, if the people of Indi decide to return me as their federal member, subsequent parliaments-but I doubt whether there will be too many other inquiries of the intensity of this inquiry or too many other inquiries which are as important to my electorate as this particular inquiry and report have been. I again thank those volunteers in my electorate who gave of their time during the fires and gave of their time to give us evidence in the inquiry. I will work with them and with my parliamentary colleagues to ensure that we reverse the trend of ill-conceived policy ideas that have resulted in the destruction of the environment and the economic devastation of so many rural areas. I thoroughly commend this report. For those members of parliament who dwell in the city and for whom bushfires are but a mere news clipping-and I am sure some of them would have gotten bored seeing bushfires raging in north-east Victoria for approximately 60 days last summer-I commend this to them. Perhaps they can understand the soul and the spirit of country Australia and country Victoria. It is not good enough just to pretend to latch on to our identity, which is so linked to the Australian bush, when it suits you politically. You actually have to help country people when it matters. length about the A nation charred: inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires report. As a MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Committees
200,Mr Organ (Cunningham) (12.10 P.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to speak at somenew member of this House, this was the first opportunity I had to sit on a committee and to find out about the committee process and how committees operate. I am sure there are many people out there in the community who really do not understand the importance of the committee process in the federal parliament. As a librarian archivist, I was aware of a lot of material produced by this parliament and a lot of reports. You see the end outcome, the 400 or 500 pages of the report, but you do not realise the amount of work that goes into producing such a report-over 500 submissions and thousands and thousands of pages that are a supplement to the report. As the previous speaker, the member for Indi, said, a lot of people-a lot of volunteers, a lot of ordinary Australians-have put a lot of effort into this report. I think it is quite unique. That is one of the most important values of this whole process, both in getting that information from the community and allowing the community the voice to put forward their views to the federal parliament. I think that was an important issue in regard to this bushfire report. The whole issue of bushfires is very hot, very heated, very emotional. We have seen with the previous speaker, the member for Indi, the emotion that surrounds this issue. This committee gave a lot of the people who had really been affected-who were scarred both physically and emotionally, and whose properties were affected by the recent bushfires that occurred earlier this year and the ones that occurred during the summer of 2001-02-the opportunity, where many of them had not had the opportunity, to present their views to politicians, to the parliament. That was the great thing about this committee-it was very open and gave the public the opportunity to present that information. We are all very aware that the inquiry was, unfortunately, politicised. Various state governments decided not to submit information to the committee. I was dismayed by that. It is unfortunate. As the Greens member on this committee, when I was selected for the committee I immediately visited the local rural fire service in my electorate and spoke to some of the people there. I was given a detailed briefing on how they deal with bushfires. It was very impressive. In my electorate covering the Illawarra, we have had to deal with bushfires for a long period now. We had disastrous bushfires back in 1968. A large number of houses were lost and property destroyed and damaged. Since 1968, there have been great efforts on the part of the firefighting authorities in the Illawarra, the various state government bureaucracies and-dare I say it-the federal government to come up with management plans which deal on an ongoing basis with bushfires, which put in place hazard reduction and which identify areas in our local area that should not be burned or should be burned or whatever. SoI was quite surprised when I spoke with the local firefighters and some of the local volunteers, that they were quite happy. They felt that they had in train a pretty good process. They were working at local, state and federal level with volunteers and they had a pretty good idea of the way forward for dealing with bushfires in the Illawarra area. As I said, we are used to bushfires. So when we did have bushfires in the summer of 2001-02, a lot of them were contained. Because there had been hazard reduction, there was in place a good network of volunteers and a good network of state government authorities working together to minimise the impact on the local environment. Having said that, I have realised from the many submissions I listened to regarding this report that we cannot really stop bushfires. Bushfires are horrendous and horrific, and they do run out of control despite all the best efforts by volunteers and by state and federal governMAIN COMMITTEE ment authorities to minimise the hazards. It is a very complicated issue. In urban areas such as my own electorate of Cunningham we need to deal with it environmentally, in management terms and financially. But in areas such as the Illawarra I saw that a good process had been put in place. Obviously that happened very early in the piece for me-within the first few weeks of my being on the committee. I, like many members of the committee, such as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, went out to various parts of Australia and looked at the situation beyond my own electorate. I went to places such as Tasmania, Western Australia, northern Victoria and western New South Wales, and the situation was very different. We found areas where there were no management structures really in place. There were old-fashioned ways of dealing with fires. Maybe there is a need for change there. There were not necessarily the resources there to back up and assist those volunteers or to give them clear direction so that they could identify areas which needed to be conserved, areas which could be subject to hazard reduction and areas which needed to be part of a more detailed hazard reduction zone management plan. We found that there were a lot of different ways of managing the bushfire hazard throughout Australia. I was most of all impressed with Tasmania and the way in which Tasmania has a very wellcoordinated way of dealing with bushfire hazards. What was most telling was what I saw on the front page of a Tasmanian paper which was issued the day before a massive fire event was due. That front page basically told people to stay at home and prepare for the fire. That is in stark contrast to the recent news we have had of the fires over in America, where I understand there are mandatory evacuations and we have seen thousands of properties destroyed. But in Tasmania we were taken into the bush and we saw houses on the sides of hills, surrounded by trees and bush, that had survived the fire. The reason they had survived was that the state had put in good plans and the volunteers and local residents were aware of how to deal with the bushfire hazard on a regular, almost daily, basis. They were prepared to defend their properties. They had in place water and knew the various procedures needed. They were supported by the volunteers, the state government authorities and the federal government when it was needed. In those instances they were able to defend their properties, whether there had been hazard reduction or not. That was a great example of the fact that bushfires can be managed-but they cannot be stopped. Bushfires and wildfires do run out of control, but they can be managed. Prevention is very important, and we all agree that we need to prevent major disasters. However, we cannot always do that. The other information we received, which was from meteorologists, was that global warming is occurring. They clearly said that the greenhouse effect is taking place, that the weather in Australia is getting hotter and that the fires are getting hotter and more frequent, so unfortunately in the future we can look forward to more disastrous bushfires. Having accepted that the weather is not getting any better we now realise, with reports such as this-with all the information that is coming in, with the reports that are being gathered and with the investigations throughout the country-that the way forward is to have more information, better planning, better maps, better scientific data and better coordination between all those firefighting authorities to better plan and manage bushfires when they come so that we can minimise the impact on local properties, minimise the loss of life and minimise the trauma and terror that people go through. MAIN COMMITTEE We had major bushfires in the Illawarra in 1968. I was only a young child then, so I did not really have any perception of the sheer horror of a bushfire. But during this year I was shown a videotape, taken by a local resident from Darkes Forest in my electorate, of the bushfires when they came through in Christmas of 2001. You saw the terror and horror of a bushfire coming through a property. In that instance, the man kept videotaping throughout the incident. You saw the flames coming. You saw all the people running around, getting the children, getting inside, preparing for the fire front and getting the hoses out. The volunteer firefighters were there helping them. There was a lot of screaming and shouting, a lot of smoke, a lot of ember attacks and a lot of fire around. All of a sudden the fire front came, and within a minute it was almost gone. It was very quick. Then there was the cleaning up afterwards-making sure that the ember attacks and the fires did not catch. Fifteen minutes after the fire had gone through, you saw the people finally saying, ‘We’ve survived. We’ve protected most of our property.’ They did their best with the help of the firefighters and with the help of knowing how to deal with fire on their property. Seeing that video was a very telling experience for me. I realised what a horror it was and the fact that, in many instances, we will not be able to stop bushfires. But we have to prepare. There is no doubt that we have to be better prepared. Within this report, a lot of the over 50 recommendations deal with the issue of better preparing for and managing the bushfire hazard that we face almost on an annual basis in this country. I really do commend and support a lot of those recommendations that go to the heart of things such as better communication, better assistance for our volunteer firefighters, more money to support their work and more money to support aerial firefighting. I fully support a lot of those issues. However, I did put in a dissenting report to this committee’s report. The dissent was mainly concerned with the need to consider the environmental impacts of what we are doing. At a late stage in the work of the committee we received a report from Nick Gellie on various aspects and the way forward in dealing with bushfires. I really welcomed that report because in that Mr Gellie, a fire ecologist, said that, basically, in any area of Australia-urban areas or whatever-you might have areas where you need to set up specific zones to protect property, and that might cover about 20 per cent of the land. Hazard protection zones need to be set up, and that is very evident in my electorate of Cunningham, which is an urban electorate. We need hazard reduction. We need fire prevention zones set up. That could cover up to 20 per cent of the land. Perhaps 20 to 30 per cent of any area has overwhelming environmental values which need to be protected and which may never be subject to burning. That is just the reality. The other 50 or 60 per cent of the land will most likely be subject to some sort of hazard reduction regime. I have said repeatedly to people that the Greens are not opposed to hazard reduction. What we want, and what this report really does reinforce and in many ways support, is a more scientific, coordinated approach. If that takes place, we will better serve the people of Australia. I could go on, but I will not. I welcome the report. I thank all my fellow members of the committee. We had a lot of good, heated discussions during the course of forming this report, and I found it very interesting to be a member of this committee. I learned a lot from being on the committee. I also thank the parliamentary staff who assisted us, who kept the show on the road and who put all the submissions together so that we were all given copies of all the subMAIN COMMITTEE missions. We were kept up to date and knew exactly what was happening, where we were going and what parts of Australia we were dealing with. The result of their hard work, and that of all the members of the committee, is seen in this report. Of course, you can also see it by going to the web site. There you can see the over 500 submissions by members of the public dealing with this issue. It is an important issue, and we all recognise that. It is an emotional issue, it is a hot issue, and it is something which I am sure we will be talking about in this place for many years to come. lect Committee on the Recent Australian Bushfires, I am pleased to be able to join in this debate and say that it really was one of the most extraordinary experiences that I have been through as a member of parliament. As my colleagues and I went around to various places for the hearings, there was only one reaction that we felt, and that was growing anger. The anger was because so many people who had given so much time, mainly as volunteers, and who were prepared to come to the inquiry were pouring out their hearts to us about the problems that they had had-and in many cases the devastation of their lives-and the fact that it appeared that we were the first people who were prepared to really listen to their point of view. It was most moving, and I think all members of the inquiry came away with a much better understanding of just what bushfires can do to people and, more importantly, how we might approach them better in the future. In the limited time. I have, I would like to give special credit to the chairman, the member for Eden-Monaro, Gary Nairn. I think he did an outstanding job in chairing this inquiry under a lot of pressure. He put a huge amount of work into it and, in a very short period of time, he has, with the committee’s support, produced an excellent report-A nation charred: inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires. I would suggest that it is probably the best reference there is in Australia right now on bushfires. It contains a lot of information and I think it has brought together all the relevant views of the best minds in Australia on what really happened in those devastating bushfires and how we might better manage in the future. SoI give full marks to the member for Eden-Monaro. I think it was one of those outstanding efforts that are never fully recognised, but I think it should be on the record. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, as you know, we had an amazing response to this inquiry wherever we went. I have said how angry I became listening to what people said. However, many people were prepared to come before the committee and tell it as they saw it. They brought forward their experience-in many cases decades of experience-on handling bushfires. As we know, fire is a natural part of the Australian landscape. It is something that has been around for many thousands of years, and there are records that show that Aboriginal communities knew how to manage it. In fact, I have read a local report which talks about the Grampians in my electorate. In that report an early European settler wrote that he came across Aborigines doing controlled burning in the 1840s. The words he used were that they displayed ‘astonishing skill’ in managing fire. I think that is something that people often overlook nowadays; but it is not something new as fire has been managed, and we still have to continue to do that. Two things came through very clearly. One is that there has been insufficient fuel reduction in recent times. That led to a build-up of combustible material which clearly made those fires far more intense. The second point is that the way the fighting of the fires was managed MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Committees
201,Mr Hawker (Wannon) (12.25 P.m.),"As a member of the House of Representatives Seshowed a very cautious approach, for want of a better term, which clearly allowed the fires to do a lot more damage than they otherwise might have. One illustration of the extent of that damage is that it was estimated that the amount of timber burned in the fires earlier this year is the equivalent of 40 years of logging. A lot of people in the community seem to be against logging on public land, but they were surprisingly silent when it came to talking about the fact that the equivalent of 40 years of logging just went up in smoke. I think that is a point that the wider community ought to be taking on board. I guess what it really shows is that there is a growing gap in the community-and that is the overriding message that comes through-between those who have had the practical experience and those with a theoretical approach; or, to put it another way, in many cases there is a gap between city and country thinking on the question of bushfires. My real concern is that, if we do not take note of the report, the recommendations and the findings, we will be destined to repeat this mistake when another serious bushfire season comes along, as it surely will. seek leave to continue his remarks at a later date? Leave granted; debate adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Blair, Ms Tracey Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.30 p.m.)-TodayI bring to this chamber a tale of courage, a tale of dedication, a tale of struggle and a tale of achievement. It is the story of Tracey Blair, a 32-year-old woman who had a brain tumour removed in 1991, a week before her 20th birthday. It was cancerous and she was required to spend four months in hospital undergoing radiotherapy treatment. Now she is permanently in a wheelchair and left with disabilities. Four years ago Tracey took up swimming. She has been invited overseas twice previously, to England and Korea, and now she has been chosen to represent Australia with the Excell squad in Argentina for the Pan Am Games in December this year. Her classification is S4, which makes her one of the more disabled members of the team, as the classifications run from S14 down to S1. You can see from that that she is quite a disabled young woman. Tracey has always enjoyed swimming, and she was not going to let something like a brain tumour stop her from swimming. So in 1999 she started a learn-to-swim program at Arnolds Swim Centre at The Junction, in Newcastle. Tracey’s original coach was a woman called Jenny Lambert, who encouraged her to get involved in competitive swimming. After Jenny left in 2001, Shane Arnold, at Arnolds Swim Centre, took over as Tracey’s coach. Tracey trains from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m., Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, and on Tuesdays she works out in a gym. Since being involved in swimming, Tracey has competed in many local, national and international events. She has competed in the following events: in 1999, the Southern Cross MultiDisability Games in Homebush in Sydney; in 2000, the BT swimming nationals, Sheffield, England; in 2002, the FESPIC Games, Busan, South Korea. Tracey has gained medals, cerMAIN COMMITTEE",154,Committees

204,Mr Hawker (Wannon) (12.30 P.m.),"I move:tificates and trophies. She has been inspired by this and she aims to be selected for the Paralympics in 2004. Tracey is involved in Sailability, which is conducted on Lake Macquarie, near the Belmont 16 footer sailing club and is sponsored by them. Tracey does volunteer work for Christo Road Private Hospital, is involved in Headstart, which is a program for people with acquired brain injury, and is part of the education team that talks to the community about brain injury and how to prevent it. Tracey is a young woman who has achieved a lot and has not allowed her disability to keep her down. Tracey received a letter from Senator Rod Kemp on 22 November last year, congratulating her on winning a silver medal in the women’s S4 50-metres freestyle race in 2002 at the Far East and South Pacific Games. Tracey is off to Argentina on 2 December, and I am sure she will succeed and perform very well. In the S4 division in the IPC swimming rankings, Tracey is currently ranked as 13th in the world for the 100-metres freestyle, 12th in the world for the 50-metres backstroke and 18th in the world for the 50-metres freestyle. Tracey is a young woman who has worked very hard to achieve what she has. She has the support of her family and the support of her community. Today in this HouseI would like to wish her all the best when she goes to Argentina. I pay testimony to the fact that Tracey has struggled and worked hard to achieve the success that she has. I congratulate her on her past achievements and wish her success for the future. Cowper Electorate: Macksville Gift wish Tracey well in her swimming efforts. She has certainly had some outstanding achievements. I thank the member for bringing Tracey’s achievements to our attention. On7 NovemberI had the honour of attending a dinner to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the running of the first Macksville Gift sprint race. As the name implies, the race is held in the town of Macksville in the Nambucca Valley. This anniversary dinner was extremely well attended with a large roll-up of former winners and community members such as Nambucca Shire Mayor George Hicks, Mrs Mary Hicks and local well-known community identities Michael and Judy Moran. A highlight of the event was the cutting of the 50th Macksville Gift anniversary cake by Margaret Brickley, the wife of the first gift winner, and the 2002 gift winner, Matthew Newton. The Macksville Gift started from humble beginnings to become one of the longestrunning professional sprint races in the country. The first race was held on 19 September 1953 and was run to raise funds for the construction of a Catholic church at nearby Nambucca Heads. Over the years that the race has been held, countless thousands of dollars have been raised for charity. I commend the work of the race committees, who have worked so hard to ensure the success of the race. I would particularly like to commend the 2003 executive and race committee. It comprises: Greg Wood; Maurie Lonnegan; Ken Capell; Eva Smith; Leslie Smith; Ron Brown; Alison McCullough; Allan Smith; Brian Smith; Bill Richardson; Barry Fuller; and the President of the Macksville Athletic Club, Robyn Marsay. To commemorate the 50th running of the gift, a book has been painstakingly compiled by Brian and Eva Smith, setting out in great detail the history of the event. The book, titled 50 Years and Still Running, provides a wealth of information on the running of an event which is so dear to the people of Macksville. Brian and Eva MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Adjournment
205,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (12.35 P.m.),"I am sure all members of the House wouldare to be commended on what is a very extensive piece of work, comprising some 250 pages of text and photographs detailing the history of the event. In the foreword to the book Mr Smith thanked a number of people from the Nambucca Valley. He thanked Nola Unterrheiner for her assistance with names and information concerning the early years of the race. She provided a great deal of information relating to the ladies gift committee. Special thanks was also given to the Brunsdon family for their permission to research the Elevator newspaper. The foreword to the book details the long association between the Macksville Gift and Dale Brunsdon, which began way back in 1953. Dale has printed almost every gift program over the years. Mr Brunsdon delayed his retirement to print the 2003 program and the history book to which I have referred. Mr Smith praised Mike O’Neil and the staff of the Guardian News for their assistance and also the generous donation by Mr Sam Martin which helped to cover the cost of research. The book was compiled from information contained in newspaper publications, minute books and interviews with runners, trainers and past officials. That really attests to the value of our local media. The wealth of history that is contained in countless local media offices around the country means we are able to compile valuable history books such as this. The cover of the book features a photograph of Darren Smith in action sprinting down the gift track at Macksville Park. Life member of the Macksville Athletics Club and local poet of some note, Barry Fuller, composed a poem to celebrate the anniversary. The poem was entitled The Macksville Gift and was read at the anniversary dinner. The 2003 gift was an outstanding success, with the race taken out by Thomas Scott of Newcastle. During a weekend of festivities, Maree Sanger was crowned Macksville Gift Queen, with Danielle Ainsworth the runner-up. Stephanie Spicer was crowned charity queen. All those associated with the 2003 Maxville Gift should be congratulated, particularly Robyn Marsay and her hard working committee. Chisholm Electorate: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (12.40 p.m.)-TodayI want to bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Ageing a serious matter of injustice and hardship facing residents in my electorate of Chisholm and its surrounds. Would you believe that across the entire eastern suburbs of Melbourne there is not one MRI unit which is eligible for a Medicare rebate? That means that more than 800,000 people across six local government areas face a hard choice when their health is under a cloud and their specialist recommends they be assessed by an MRI unit. They can put themselves at major inconvenience by travelling to a radiologist many kilometres away from their home to access a Medicare rebated MRI unit-for which, due to the theory of supply and demand, there is generally a sixto eight-week waiting time-or they need to somehow find $500 for a service for which many other Australians rightfully receive a rebate. What an appalling position to be placed in when you are already fearful for your health or that of your loved one! Being told you or a member of your family should have an MRI test is not a trivial matter. The test can only be ordered by specialists, and my understanding is that more than 80 per cent of tests show significant abnormalities. For those who may not be aware, MRImagnetic resonance imaging-scanning is an important advance in medical imaging technology. It relies on high-powered magnetic fields and their effect on certain molecules in the body to create high-resolution images of body structures and tissue. A relatively non-invasive MAIN COMMITTEE technology, MRI is seen as a particularly effective means of assessing the brain and spinal cords for tumours and specific neurological conditions. It is regarded as the best technique for examining vascular conditions and is extremely good for detailed examination of the internal structures of joints. Victoria is home to 16 Medicare rebated MRI units-which, based on the 2001 census data, equals out to about one machine per 290,000 people. By any standard of equality, at least three of these machines should then be located in Melbourne’s east. I would like the minister to explain why we do not have even one. I think it is appalling that the residents of Melbourne’s east are being made to pay for the scan scam fiasco-for that is what I suspect is at play here. It goes back to the current government’s bungled introduction of new arrangements for the payment of a Medicare benefit for MRI services as part of the 1998 budget. The defined provisions for an MRI unit to be eligible for a Medicare rebate were that the unit must have been installed, purchased or leased by a medical practice or hospital before 12 May 1998 or be replacement equipment for equipment installed, purchased or leased at that time. As we all recall, there was an outcry when radiologists purchased new MRI equipment immediately prior to that date. The former federal minister for health and my predecessor as the federal member for Chisholm, Dr Michael Wooldridge, failed dismally to take any responsibility for that fine mess. In relation to the radiologists, the Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to prosecute any radiologist because of insufficient evidence. However, many radiology practices have subsequently not been granted the rebate. Many radiologists are of the belief that eligibility for the rebate is being denied as a form of punishment of them as a group. However, the punishment is really bypassing them, as many of them still charge the full fee for the MRI scan. No, the victims of this fiasco are the mums and dads and the elderly of Melbourne’s east who are being forced to pay the entire costs of the test or to hunt down a Medicare rebated MRI scan elsewhere. Eastern Health has one of two MRI scanners in Melbourne’s east. Eastern Health very much wants to have the status of its machine changed to a Medicare eligible MRI unit, as it can see the strain placed on outpatients when they are effectively told that they have to open their wallets or go elsewhere. Eastern Health has made representations to the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing in a bid to gain eligibility for a Medicare rebate for its MRI machine. To date these requests have gone unheeded. I call on the minister to open his eyes to the stark injustice and hardship facing residents in Melbourne’s east. The minister’s first move should be to grant eligibility for Medicare rebates to the MRI unit at Eastern Health. He needs to assess the great need across the entire eastern suburbs of Melbourne. All my constituents are asking for is a fair go. A Medicare rebated MRI unit in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne is not too much to ask when we are in one of the growth corridors of the state, where most of the residents live. It is an injustice that we do not have even one. Farrer Electorate: Forestry Ms LEY (Farrer) (12.45 p.m.)-I wish to talk briefly in the Main Committee today about the timber industry and its importance to my electorate. Australia has over 1.5 million hectares of plantation forests. The south-west slopes of New South Wales and the upper Murray region of north-east Victoria are, at the moment, supporting the economic growth of a forest and timber industry that is steadily increasing in output to a target of $1 billion of value-added MAIN COMMITTEE product per annum. This means that forestry is the critically important industry and in fact the main driver of our regional economy. In the eastern shires of my electorate, namely the Tumut and Tumbarumba shires, it provides employment and enormous economic input. In fact, approximately 38 per cent of the people in the region between Gundagai and Albury in the Snowy Mountains depend upon the timber industry for their livelihoods. Plantation timber provides opportunities for farmers who wish to diversify and plant timber-producing trees as an additional crop-perhaps on higher ground or on less fertile slopes. Trees are an important component of environmental rehabilitation strategies and they have positive effects on salinity and land degradation. Of course it is good to plant trees native to the area for biodiversity reasons, but the lowering of water tables is just as effective with plantation softwood as it is with native hardwood. It has been anticipated that Australia’s net deficit in forest products trade will have increased from $2 billion a year in the year 2000 to an estimated $2½ billion by the year 2005. So the role of plantation forests in the Tumut and Tumbarumba area, and the other major production areas of Australia, is of vital importance to redressing this situation which has been brought about by the massive withdrawal of native forests from timber production. Major timber supplies come from forests managed by New South Wales State Forests, and there has been some recent speculation that these forests may be privatised. I suppose that may have merit in theory, but I would like to place on the record that I believe that New South Wales State Forests are a professional organisation and are doing a good job. In any possible privatisation two things are critical: who looks after the firefighting and who looks after the roads. State Forests currently maintain the roads in their areas. In the January bushfires these roads, together with the highly professional and proactive approach they took, meant that not one single plantation tree was lost. It just does not bear thinking about what could have happened if the fires had gotten into those plantations and the effect that would have had on the economies of those towns. But, as with all opportunities, there are threats-and it comes as no surprise to my constituents that the threats in this case come from the Greens movement. In the most recent draft management plan for Kosciusko National ParkI have been told that activities such as horse riding, fishing, bushwalking and other access may be closed down under the Wilderness Act in New South Wales. I am very pleased that a branch of the Bush Users Group is likely to start up in Tumut in the near future and I commend those involved for their initiative. I rode a horse through the Kosciusko National Park in the early 1980s on a four-month trek with a pack horse from Yass to Ninety Mile Beach, and I simply say this: being able to ride or walk across the high plains of Kosciusko and become a part of the alpine environment, even just for a short time, made me more aware than anything else of the importance of these areas. Yes, they must be properly managed and properly understood; but they must be visited, they must be able to be accessed by people-firefighters, school children and horse riders-under careful supervision. To prevent access in order to promote biodiversity is just a nonsense. There is precious little biodiversity at 1300 degrees Celsius. A similar madness is taking place in the Barmah Milawa forest and the Gunbower Perricoota state forest near the communities of Malthoura, Deniliquin, Wakool and Barham. These forests are managed by New South Wales State Forests, who supervise the removal of red gum in a sustainable way. The Greens are suggesting we stop this; that we close down the jobs of sleeper cutters, firewood collectors, furniture makers, tourist operators and all sorts of MAIN COMMITTEE other users because we just should not be there. Again the suggestion is that these areas need to be locked up. As we know, the Barmah Milawa been named an icon site on the Murray River and the government is recognising the importance of the area as a world-class wetland. In conjunction with that, we can manage a sustainable forest logging red gum industry. The Greens have come up with the alternative that we should use plastic railway sleepersnot perhaps understanding that if you alternate a plastic or a concrete railway sleeper with a timber one, you have a serious safety issue for any train driving along that track. I wonder whether they understand that plastics come from oil and that the manufacture of a moulded plastic product such as a railway sleeper is certainly not an environmentally friendly process in any way, shape or form. I commend again the timber communities in my electorate. Roads: Black Spot Program tion of the federal government in terms of black spot funding in my city of Ipswich. Ipswich, for many years, has been trying to improve its local council roads to give the people of Ipswich decent road infrastructure and safe services, making sure that it does its part in black spot programs. What the city council does is prioritise and list which of those roads and intersections are the most dangerous and the most vital and critical to fix. Unfortunately, we have found that the federal government just ignores those lists. The federal government refuses to fund those necessary black spot areas. It is not as if the Ipswich City Council have not made applications; it is not as if they have not done their part of the job, their end of the bargain. They have done that. They have done the work; they have done the research, the surveys. There would not be a person in Ipswich who would not tell you that the most dangerous intersection in Ipswich is at the corner of Cemetery Road and Whitehill Road at Raceview. This intersection has been the cause of many tragic deaths and many very serious accidents, and every time the council put up the priority list of roads they need black spot funding for the Commonwealth government ignores those pleas. The federal government has on other occasions provided funding for black spot programs, and certainly everybody does appreciate it, because black spot funding is an extremely important part of the federal government’s responsibility to look after people in our country areas and in the city as well. But in the case of this particular road I am at a loss as to why this government refuses to accept the local authority’s determination of it as the highest priority, as the most dangerous road. In the past we have had, as I said, other roads fixed. In fact, there have been a number of them in previous submissions for funding. Unfortunately in last year’s last round of funding there was no money given at all to Ipswich City Council for any black spot funding programs. There was one road in Ipswich for which funding was applied for by the state government and, quite happily, that road at Bundamba was fixed under the black spot funding program, for about $200,000. In the past, the federal government has given about $680,000 to upgrade other roads. But I have the list of roads here, and I make an absolutely desperate plea to the minister to go back and have a look at these roads on my list. At the top of that list is the intersection of Cemetery Road and Whitehill Road at Raceview. There is the Old Logan Road, which is Addison Road and Cairns Road, at Camira; Bertha Street and Mill Street at Goodna; Ripley Road and Reif Street at Flinders View; Smiths Road and William Street at Goodna; Darling Street MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Adjournment
206,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (12.50 P.m.),"I am completely outraged and disgusted at the inacand Waghorn Street in Ipswich; and Ripley Road, Raceview Street and Edwards Street at Flinders View. All of these are important but none more so than the intersection of Cemetery Road and Whitehill Road. This road, if you saw it, Mr Deputy Speaker, would make you cringe. When you see this road you can understand why it is so dangerous, why it is so desperately in need of funding. I would make the assessment that the reason the federal government is not funding this road is not that it is callous-some people might think that; I do not believe that. I think it is just a case of money, a simple formula of money, because this intersection, unlike others, would cost $2½ million to fix. It needs lights; it needs a fair bit of work to make it safe. We have had in the past budgets up to $680,000 in totality, but since 2000 Ipswich City Council has applied for this particular road and it has been ignored or overlooked, and I can only come up with two possible reasons: either the government completely believes that this is irrelevant and does not worry about the safety of people-and I do not believe that to be true-or it is about the money and the government cannot afford it. But how can this government not afford $2½ million when it has a $7½ billion surplus-and, as we know, Mr Deputy Speaker, next year it will be even bigger, because this is the highest-taxing government in our history? That is why it has such a big surplus. When you collect a lot of money and do not give it back by spending it on people you are going to have a lot of money in the bank. That is what effectively the federal government has. I have always had the view from a very early age that governments are not in the business of scrounging money and putting it away for a rainy day. The rainy day is today. The government collects taxes on behalf of the people to spend it back on them for their good, and there is no better good than to try under the black spot funding program to fix extremely dangerous intersections, such as the one at Cemetery Road and Whitehill Road. I am not a lone voice on this issue. The member for Blair has actually gone out there and said that this is important too. The Liberal member for Blair, Cameron Thompson, has said that this is really important and this road should be funded. But he sort of tries a bit of a cop-out: he says that these are council roads and there is no sign there that says this road should be fixed. Maybe he is blind, maybe there is no sign, but go and talk to anyone in his electorate in Ipswich and they will tell you what is important: that road needs to be fixed. I would say that the government needs to take action-(Time expired) Tourism: White Paper Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (12.55 p.m.)-I rise to speak about the importance of the tourism industry in electorates all around Australia, and particularly in my electorate of Petrie where some 40 per cent of tourism related businesses exist and almost four per cent of the work force is employed in the tourism industry. I particularly acknowledge the fine work done by the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, Joe Hockey, in delivering his policy and his white paper on tourism, which was launched last week, and the impact of that paper on the tourism industry, with the injection of $235 million over the next four years. This has been long awaited by the tourism industry and it will truly be a blueprint into the future for the industry. A number of things have occurred. A new body called Tourism Australia will be set up. It will be responsible for and incorporate a number of groups, including See Australia, and it will absorb forecasting associations as well. This means that now there will be a true direction MAIN COMMITTEE for tourism in this country. For far too long individual states have marketed their own particular tourism bodies overseas and now, with a more integrated approach, we can have Brand Australia, which is going to promote the whole of Australia as a desirable destination for international tourists to come and experience the wonders of this wonderful country. One of the main features of this marketing strategy is a huge emphasis on the international sector as well as the domestic sector. It will emphasise areas such as the food and wine sectors, and international students have also been heavily targeted. I was really pleased to learn recently that our Working Holiday Maker Program has been extended to include France. A number of young students come over here on working holiday programs and then stay on. They are a very valuable form of tourism for this country, as is the backpacker sector, which is also a huge revenue-earning area in this country. Nature tourism is also an area that has been targeted. More and more tourists are coming to our country to enjoy wonderful sights such as the Great Barrier Reef, outback Queensland and outback Australia as a whole. People are also experiencing these wonderful features in caravans. This is an area that has been targeted, as well as business tourism, cultural tourism, heritage tourism and sports tourism. One also cannot deny the incredible success of the Rugby World Cup tour recently, particularly when the revenue was close to $1 billion and something like three billion people world wide watched the coverage. But more important were the great opportunities for regional Australia from this incredible event. It meant that tourists who came out for the rugby also got to experience wonderful cities like Townsville and Wollongongplaces that they probably would never have visited had matches not been held in some of those regional centres. It has been a wonderful thing for the country generally. It is very important that we promote our country as a brand rather than individual states competing with each other. That has been the case far too often-people have thought about Australia in terms of the Sydney Harbour Bridge or Gold Coast beaches. But we have so much more to offer the international tourist who is visiting Australia. An important feature of this white paper has also been the intergovernmental agreement, and that will be discussed at COAG 2005. That includes all the states and territories coming together and working in unison to create a truly integrated policy in tourism so that the whole of Australia benefits. I congratulate the minister for the fine work that he is doing, particularly in ensuring that more events come to this country. A new body being set up as part of Tourism Australia is Events Australia. That body will work in a very coordinated way to ensure that the whole of Australia benefits from a program of events. It is also about teeing up tourism with wonderful sporting events like the rugby so you have a win-win situation from both the tourism aspect and the sporting aspect. The only winners from this are Australia and the wonderful industries and people who work in the tourism related industries that I spoke of when I started this speech. I congratulate everybody in the tourism area, and particularly the minister, for their work. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 1.01 p.m. MAIN COMMITTEE The following answers to questions were circulated: Education: Postgraduate Students (Question No. 2486) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: (1) Has the Minister seen a Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations report dated 24 March 2003 titled “The Social and Economic Impact of Student Debt 2003”. (2) Can he confirm the findings of international studies cited in the report which suggest that the increasing cost of education, combined with the reduction of government financial assistance, may prevent many students from continuing with postgraduate studies; if not, why not. (3) Has the Government’s reduction of support-services and structures for students in Australia contributed to (a) insurmountable financial pressure on Australian students, and (b) poor postgraduate student completion rates in Australia; if not, why not. Dr NelsonThe Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services has transferred this question to me. The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The Australian Government has increased financial assistance for postgraduate students through the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme (PELS) which was introduced in 2002. PELS provides a loan facility for eligible students who are enrolled in fee-paying, postgraduate non-research courses. The loan facility is similar to the deferred payment arrangements available under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS). In 2002, the Commonwealth paid a total of $115 million to institutions on behalf of students who had elected to take out a PELS loan for their tuition fees. This benefited 11,387 equivalent full-time student units (EFTSU) (or 25,213 students), which equates to 33% of the total EFTSU enrolled in domestic fee-paying postgraduate coursework courses. Over 25,000 students took out PELS loans in 2002 while enrolments in PELS eligible courses have also shown a 20 per cent increase in 2002 over 2001, compared to a 15 per cent increase in the previous year. The findings of research undertaken by Professor Bruce Chapman of the Australian National University show that income-contingent student loan schemes support enhance student participation in higher education, concluding that “the introduction of income-contingent charging systems for higher education has the potential to protect the access of the disadvantaged”. (3) (a) The Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations report does not state that the Government has reduced support services and structures in Australia. (b) Internal research from the Department of Education Science and Training has indicated that in Australia annual postgraduate completions increased from 39,733 in 1997 to 43,122 in 2001. No completions data is yet available for 2002. Health and Ageing: Home and Community Care Program (Question No. 2558) Mr Price asked the Minister for Ageing, upon notice, on 8 October 2003: What is the current (a) national, (b) State, and (c) regional waiting time under Home and Community Care programs for (i) lawns and gardening, (ii) podiatry, (iii) physiotherapy, and (iv) diversional therapy. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a), (b) and (c) State and Territory governments are responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Home and Community Care Program (HACC) and are the primary point of contact for HACC service providers and consumers. The Australian Government is not involved in maintaining waiting lists for HACC funded services. Foreign Affairs: Colombia (Question No. 2575) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 9 October 2003: (1) Is he aware of the Colombian Presidential Directive 07 issued on 9 September 1999 which requires all government officials, both civilian and military, to refrain from questioning the legitimacy of human rights organisations and their members; making statements that discredit, persecute, or incite persecution of said organisations; or making public or private declarations that stigmatise the work of these organisations.
