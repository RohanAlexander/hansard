A lot of government members took the stick to me. They said that that could not possibly be true. In fact, even some colleagues on my side said that I was overstating the problem a bit. I am grateful to Tim Colebatch, Economics Editor of the Age, for reporting the release of the Bureau of Statistics information yesterday in his column under the heading ‘Australians want work, more of it’. He confirmed my hypothesis and quantum guess of three years ago. As I suspected, I was essentially correct. I said that there were 700,000 unemployed. The Bureau of Statistics stated that in September 2001 the total number of unemployed was 509,700 full time and 162,800 part time, a total of 672,500-not far off 700,000. I said that there were 700,000 underemployed. Actually, the bureau’s figure was 592,400, made up of 355,500 full-time underemployed and 236,900 part-time underemployed. I said that 700,000 Australians were not counted in the labour force who should be. The bureau’s figure was in fact 816,500, made up of 212,400 full time and 483,200 part time. I said that, three years ago, the total number of Australians who were underemployed and who were locked out of employment was 2.1 million. The Bureau of Statistics figure released yesterday for September 2001 was 2,081,400. I was spot on; my claims were correct. As I did then, I now challenge members of the government and members of other parties in the Senate to deny the fact that 2.1 million Australians want more work. That is a sad indictment of government at all levels in this country-federal, state and local. In the main, they have not taken in these figures and realised the damage that unemployment and underemployment have done to this country. Government expenditure at all levels should have a job dividend. Infrastructure spending that increases the possibility of future investment should be supported, and those that do not should be deferred. A German study showed that if you spend $1 billion on roads you get 10,000 to 14,000 jobs. If you spend it on heavy rail you get 18,000 to 22,000 jobs. If you spend it on light rail you get 20,000 to 24,000 jobs. It is about time we looked at how we spend government money and thus get a job dividend. Rural and Regional Australia: Taxation Zone Rebate we are emptying out our populations in regional Australia. For four years in this federal parliament I have been promulgating the fact that we need to do more to get people back into the bush. One of the ways that we got people into remote areas a long time ago was by paying them more money in the form of a taxation zone rebate. That was worth about five weeks extra wages per year then.

280,Mr Haase (Kalgoorlie) (9.43 A.m.),"I rise today to bring further attention to the fact that8530 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 mately half a week’s wages per year. The whole issue of taxation zone rebates needs to be revisited. We are paying for a great number of programs to attract members of the medical profession to the bush. I put it to you that if we had a bigger population in the bush we would not have to artificially support doctors to go there. We have a catch-22 situation: if we cannot get the doctors we cannot get the people, and if we have not got the people we will not get the doctors. We should address that by increasing the taxation zone rebate payments to residents of rural and remote Australia so that they have a reason to visit. When people were paid extra money to go to remote areas, there was no compunction; people could say to their neighbours in the city, ‘I’m going bush to earn five weeks extra wages a year.’ Today, if they tell their neighbours in the city that they are going to the bush, the neighbours say they are crazy-that only missionaries, misfits and madmen go to the bush. It is not true. If we give people a financial incentive through their taxation to go to the bush, they will be able to proudly declare to their neighbours that this is their choice for economic reasons, and they will be considered as quite rational. There is a phobia in suburban and city Australia about going where there is no high density population. I would urge every member of this House to play down that phobia. Go out and see rural and remote Australia so you can speak to your constituency and further break down this fear. We need rural and remote Australia to feed the rest of Australia. Let us not collectively let it down; let us put the word out that the bush is safe and fine and many happy families and well-balanced children are brought up in the bush. Talk to your constituents in city and suburban areas and urge them to give the bush a go. So many successful families did their 10 or 12 years there before secondary schooling and then returned to the city and gave somebody else the opportunity. It is something that could still be in vogue if taxation zone rebates were revisited. (Time expired) Greater Building Society Ltd Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.46 a.m.)-TodayI wish to raise a constituent’s problem that was brought to me in my office last week. It is the case of Mr Ljubisa Ristisa of 37 Lindsay Avenue, Valentine, who is a disability support pensioner. In 1998 he built himself a house at that address. At the time he had all the money bar $20,000, which he borrowed from the Greater Building Society. Over the last two years, his pension had been going into his account on Thursdays, but his loan repayment had been coming out on Wednesdays. Every time that happened, he incurred a penalty of $50, which blew out to $1,742. The building society took him to court. His $20,000 mortgage has now blown out to $145,000 with costs. The building society is auctioning his house next weekend. They have changed the locks and locked him out. Here is a man with very poor English skills who owned a very valuable house, thought he was doing the right thing and all of a sudden finds that he is about to lose absolutely everything. He was a building worker before suffering a severe injury. He put his money into building that house, but he was $20,000 short. Part of that $20,000 was used for an operation on his mother, who was injured in Serbia in a bomb blast at an airport, to remove the shrapnel. Somebody who owes $1,742 is now going to lose his house because a lending institution has more money than he has. This is the kind of situation that we should all work together to ensure does not happen in a country like ours. He has been through the Supreme Court of New South Wales to the Court of Appeal. Maybe the technical aspects of the case mean that Wednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8531 this building society is legally within its rights, but morally I think we would all condemn its actions against Mr Ristisa. (Time expired) Canungra Light Horse Brigade: Peter Hilder Australian Fire and Rescue Service: Blue Reflector Hydrant Markers death of a very special man who played a very important role in our community. I would like to make special mention of him here today. Peter Hilder, of Tambourine Mountain, was the founding member of the Canungra Light Horse Brigade. He did a fantastic job of promoting the history of the Light Horse. Peter and his team would be seen at our local shows and local events, ANZAC Day and commemorative services. He made the trip by horse to parliament about two years ago, and we witnessed a wonderful gathering of the Australia’s Light Horse Brigades on our front lawns here. Peter and his team spent the weekend competing in many organised competitions, and they went home as major winners. Peter’s grandad was a Light Horse man in the Boer War. Dedicated to his grandfather’s memory, Peter wanted to make sure that our youth were aware of the Light Horse history and the courageous men who fought in that war. Peter spent many hours outfitting a caravan, a mobile museum, to take around to schools in Queensland. The many hundreds of displays, the authentic Light Horse memorabilia, and the video and computer presentations captured the schoolchildren’s imaginations. Peter was particularly delighted with the schoolchildren’s keen interest in all he had to tell them, and Peter proudly displayed in his caravan numerous letters from grateful teachers and students thanking him for his wonderful stories and for his free time. Peter is going to be greatly missed by us all, and I know the brigade will not only continue his good work but will respect his memory by living up to the high standards he set for himself. My deepest sympathy goes to his wife Kay and his family members. Peter’s passing has left a great void in our community and he will be sadly missed. I would also like to thank the Australian Fire and Rescue Service for their wonderful initiative with the blue reflector hydrant markers. As we travel our local streets we will see the blue markings, which indicate where our hydrants are. This saves many valuable moments when a house is burning and lives are at risk. I am absolutely amazed that our Brisbane City Council Labor Mayor, Jim Soorley, refuses to allow these blue reflector hydrants to be on the streets of Brisbane. I see them in Canberra, I see them in my area of the Gold Coast and all over Australia when travelling, but Jim Soorley has a beef with the fire brigade and he will not allow these reflectors to be put on Brisbane’s streets. How dare he put the lives and the property of the people of Brisbane at risk? Come on! Wake up to yourself, or I will push for national standards to be introduced to make sure that the people of Brisbane are protected. Immigration Detention Centres: Children Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (9.53 a.m.)-An unreleased ChilOut report, the Heart of the Nation’s Existence, shows clearly that children in Australia’s immigration detention centres are not being properly cared for. The report shows that Australasian Correctional Management, ACM, has not met the standards set by its contract with the government. There are 14 issues canvassed in the report: the direct abuse of children by ACM staff; pervasive and significant mental health problems in the children; detention itself being a detrimental environment for children; disintegration of families because of detention; children in detention not",131,Representatives Main Committee
281,Mrs Elson (Forde) (9.50 A.m.),"The constituents of Ford were saddened to hear of the8532 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 being given the same rights or level of care to which any other Australian child is entitled; children in detention having a limited and inequitable education compared with Australian children; high school age children being given no education; food for children being inadequate and unsuitable, especially for very young children; inadequate health care and developmental care for children; the inadequate hygiene and clothing provided for children; lack of family and individual privacy; religious discrimination; and conditions being harmful for unaccompanied minors. The final area of criticism is the lack of sport, creative and hobby activities. I believe that ACM have proven that they are unable to fulfil the terms of the contract they have signed with the government. I know that the reports are coming up for reallocation at the end of this year and I do not believe that ACM nor their sister company, Group 4, have proved that they are able to meet even the standards that are in place at the moment. I do not see how they will be able to meet the tighter standards that the government have claimed they are about to put in place. I think that the only solution is to return the management of the private centres to public hands and to ensure that the staff employed at those centres are not ex-prison guards but people who are experienced in dealing with traumatised people. Certainly I think that children in the detention centres should immediately be put into community care and that unaccompanied children should be in foster care right now. I know that there are some children who have, fortunately, been placed into foster care. I think this is a very important first step in making sure that these children do not continue to suffer. Families that have children should be allowed to live in accommodation in the community like the Woomera alternative detention trial, which has been very successful. It is worth remembering that there are currently 309 children in detention: 149 in Nauru and 38 on Manus Island. Both of those groups have been there for over a year already. Many of the children in other detention centres have been there for periods as long as three years, I believe. The idea that these children grow up in environments in the desert in the middle of nowhere seems to me to be a disgrace. Rural and Regional Australia: Internet Connection situation where people who live outside capital cities are considered to be second-class citizens. I intend to fight that notion with all of the resources available to me. As a matter of government policy, we should not allow it to continue. You are in that situation, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, as is the member for Gilmore and perhaps even the member for Forde. I have seen this happen most recently with the new digital age. Between the capital cities of this country, the bandwidth that is available is just light speed compared with the connection speeds available at a research institution like the James Cook University of North Queensland. If we do not hurry up and do something about it, our major tropical university-the major tropical university in the world-is going to be left far behind. I will not tolerate that. I want money allocated from the national communications fund in order to put a one gigabit per second link up the Queensland coast so that all of the universities in Queensland can enjoy the same connection speeds to the electronic world that the universities in the capital cities do. James Cook University, the CSIRO and the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville are all world-leading research institutions. It is unfair that they do not have the",133,Representatives Main Committee
282,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (9.55 A.m.),"I am angry that this country continues to tolerate theWednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8533 same Internet connection speeds that are available to the major Australian universities. It is going to hold us back. I note that one of the recent Prime Minister’s fellowships was awarded to a Townsville scientist. In the last three weeks or so I was able to announce $2.6 million in new research funding for James Cook University. Our university, outside the sandstone universities or the Group of Eight, leads the country in the research it does, particularly in areas such as marine science. Those sorts of areas are going to be severely restrained, as are areas such as our latest addition in human genome research at the medical school. I will not stand for that. I want to see all of Australia’s universities having access to the same bandwidth as the capital city universities. I want to see that leading research continue in the regions of Australia. I want to make sure that we, in regional Australia, are not second-class citizens. 275A, the time for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 October, on motion by Mr Andrews: That this bill be now read a second time. 2002 proposes to amend the Health Care Appropriation Act 1998. The good news is that this amendment is designed to facilitate the paying of a greater amount of funds to the states and territories for their public hospitals. The act provides the legislative basis for those Commonwealth grants under the financial assistance package negotiated as part of the 1998-2003 Australian health care agreements. That health care agreement processes the main way in which Commonwealth funds are funnelled to the states and territories for the provision of health care for all of our constituents, for all of our communities. Primarily, funding through this agreement from the federal government goes to funding public hospitals. It is important to note that what has given rise to the need for this amendment is the fact that the Commonwealth is being exceptionally generous in not exercising some of the mechanisms within that agreement-mechanisms agreed to by the states and territories-that would have seen some downward pressure on those grants paid to the states and territories. Those particular measures relate to the private health insurance system and how, within those agreements, the public hospital system, with the agreement of the states and territories, would have seen an acknowledgment of an increased uptake in private health insurance by a reduction in some of the funding going to the public health system. The Commonwealth has decided not to exercise those provisions. That decision, along with the increased funding and some of the other indexation issues that are part of that agreement, has given rise to the amount included in subsection 4(3) being increased from $29,655,056,000 to $31,800,000,000. They are huge sums of money and they reflect the Commonwealth’s commitment to the public health system and, more specifically, hospitals managed by the states and territories. What we are talking about today is amending that provision in the bill so that the Commonwealth can pay up to that amount. As I mentioned earlier, there were issues around the government’s decision to forgo the right to clawback any funding from the states in recogni-",134,Representatives Main Committee
283,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley),In accordance with standing order,135,Representatives Main Committee
284,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (9.58 A.m.),"The Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill8534 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 tion of increased private health insurance coverage. There was also a decision by the government in August 1998 to offer the states and territories more funding under the 1998-2003 health care agreement. There was also a decision in December 1999 to recognise the importance of wages and salaries in the provision of health care. It is a labour intensive industry, and we have incorporated in the indexation mechanism for the grants a wage cost index to take account of how important wage movements are. There are also other routine indexation issues. The net result of this is that the Commonwealth can provide more money to the states and territories at a time when we are seeing remarkable increases and sustained growth in private health insurance coverage-something I think all of us who like that choice and recognise that the health system works best when the private and the public system complement one another would appreciate. Changes that the Commonwealth has introduced have transformed the private hospital system from what Russell Schneider at the Australian Health Insurance Association described as a ‘cottage industry’ into a growing sector. In the principal city of Frankston in my electorate of Dunkley there is plenty of interest in co-locating a private hospital to the site of the Frankston Public Hospital and relocating the Frankston Tennis Club to another area of public open space and recreational facilities that was part of the old golf course. In our community, in particular, where we have strong private health insurance coverage, we are seeing that reflected in new investment with Peninsula Private Hospital. We are also seeing Beleura travelling well and the Bays Hospital Group have also been expanding to take up the extra demand. We are seeing more Commonwealth funding to the states and territories primarily going into the public hospital system at a time when we are also seeing a significant proportion of communities in all electorates across Australia with private health insurance. We are getting a growth in resources in the health care sector from both a public and private hospital perspective. That is something worth celebrating and it is why I think everyone would support the bill today. I cannot imagine too many people being unhappy with a bill that proposes to give more money to the states and territories for hospitals. The key thing is that it is not the only area in which increased resources are showing the Commonwealth’s leadership in making sure that Australian citizens have the health care that they seek and that they rightly deserve. The increase in private health insurance take-up means a decrease in pressure on public hospitals. Minister Andrews, who has joined us in the chamber, is doing a remarkably good job in his portfolio. Hopefully I will be able to say he is doing an even more remarkable job if the aged care bed outcomes are attractive for my electorate-so there is some encouragement for you, Minister. Minister Andrews explained in his second reading speech how these changed amounts play out in the amendment to the upper level-the high watermark-of the funds that the Commonwealth can make available. If you look through the budget estimates, you see that there is population data factored into these estimates which the minister needs to take into account and there are some changes and finetuning in the appropriate distribution of funding responsibilities. In May 2003 we will know the precise make-up of the state and territory share of that growth in funding and we will see to what extent that increased upper limit is reached once those negotiations have proceeded. It gives rise to something I would like to spend some time talking about. All federal members know of a concerned constituent seeking an earlier entrance into a public hospital for an operation or something like that. It is a long road to hoe as a federal member: our mechanisms Wednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8535 and our capacity to influence those decisions at a hospital level are fairly circuitous. As was mentioned earlier, the Commonwealth does provide a huge amount of funding to the states and territories. The states and territories supplement that from their own resources and then that goes to individual hospitals and health care systems. That is apportioned and management arrangements are made about how their facilities will operate. Then the patients come in and the facilities have to work through those decisions about priorities, about resourcing and about the pace with which non-elective and elective surgery is carried out. Where we have a constituent who is not happy with the elective surgery waiting timesand in Victoria we have seen a lot of public discussion about how those elective surgery waiting times are stretching out more and more-that causes concern for them, particularly if they need a hip replacement operation. That is not viewed by the health system as the highest priority procedure, but for the person suffering the great deal of pain, discomfort and loss of mobility it is a vitally important procedure. As federal members we can seek to advocate our views to our hospitals; but at the end of the day it is a medical decision, it is a balancing of competing medical demands and a medical case needs to be made for an increase in the urgency of that procedure. The Frankston Hospital in my electorate of Dunkley has been quite open to representations along those lines, focusing on the issue of the medical urgency. That often involves providing advice to the patient that they really need to see their doctor and have their doctor argue the case to the registrars about the urgency of their procedure. That is one issue, but the issue I wish to talk about today deals with accident and emergency departments. Much of the funding that goes through from the bill we are discussing today finds its way into the hospitals and then finds its way to provide that first response for people when they are feeling they need instant emergency medical attention. Frankston Hospital is a remarkable place. We had the good fortune and the misfortune of being in the location of the supplementary election that decided the fate of the government at the last state election. Besides the travelling circus of ministers, aspirant ministers, and promises, pledges and all those sorts of things, there was quite a deal of attention given to the Frankston Hospital. The then Labor opposition made a mountain of promises about that. I support the state member for Frankston, Andrea McCall, in seeking to make sure that those promises are kept. It is a little hard to know which ones were kept as there were so many. But, in fairness to the state government, there has been a lot going on at the Frankston Hospital and I will leave it to Ms McCall to work out whether it was everything that was promised. Frankston Hospital has been a perpetual building site. It has been a place of ongoing redevelopment and expansion, much welcomed by the local community. Whether it is all that was promised is something that state political players can sort out, but it has been a place of great change and a very dynamic place. I would like to pay tribute to the board, the management and the staff at Frankston Hospital for maintaining and improving service levels at a time when their workplace has been a building site. The place looks like a war zone at some stages: there are bits of building hanging out in some places and in some corridors you walk through there are wooden panels to guide your way through. We went to some functions there for the Centenary of Federation because funding was allocated for a religious sanctuary within the hospital for all denominations, as people look to their faith to give them strength at a time when they are looking for healing and support. To get there, we had this rat run through the hospital. Why? Because there was so much work going on. But over that time the emergency department has continued to be, I think, the most remarkable performing emergency depart8536 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 ment of the hospitals throughout Victoria. It has continued to soldier on, catering for an ever increasing population in our region. Home and community care is the great bane of many outer metropolitan members’ lives, and it may be that the minister at the table, the Minister for Ageing, would know this too. Why is it? It is because the Commonwealth hands over the money and then the states allocate it. In the past there has been a remarkable bias and higher per capita funding for home and community care services to the inner metropolitan areas, so they are luxuriating in resources for home and community care. But, if you happen to be a frail aged person eligible for home care assistance and living in an outer metropolitan area, you have got a real raffle on your hands. You have got a lot of work to do to get access to services that are not anywhere near the level or the duration that you would get in inner Melbourne. You may have exactly the same condition, and there may be exactly the same justification for services, but, purely because you are in an outer metropolitan area and there has been a historical bias towards higher funding levels in inner metro, you get reduced levels of service. That is unsatisfactory and successive state governments have wimped it; they have wimped reallocating and redistributing those funds more equitably across all of the community. Why have they done that? Obviously, if you are luxuriating in services in inner metro, you do not want the money to disappear. You do not want a reduction in the name of equity just because some of your fellow Australians in outer metropolitan areas, who are in exactly the same condition as you are, are not getting anywhere near the same level of service. What has been the solution? The states, particularly Victoria, have constantly demanded growth funding. Why is this? That papers over the inequity in the way the current funding is allocated. They say, ‘Give us more growth funding’ so that they can play catch-up footy for the outer metropolitan and rural areas because they are not prepared to bite the bullet on the funding outcomes. It is the same issue when it comes to the funding of emergency departments. The inner metropolitan areas in Melbourne have traditionally had a seven-layered arrangement for funding emergency departments. If you happened to be one of the big inner metro hospitals you had money; you had substantial funds. If you happened to be in an outer metropolitan community, such as the one I represent in Frankston, you had to make do with far fewer resources to begin with, a growing demand from a population that is ever-expanding in your catchment, and an expectation from the local community that all cases, irrespective of their complexity, can be accommodated. Gone are the days when the accident and emergency department could handle a nick or a cut. Critical rescue, emergency and urgent cases are all expected to be catered for in these outer metropolitan areas such as the one I represent. To the credit of the state government, I think they have recognised the nonsense in the old funding model and they are moving to a different arrangement. That different arrangement will now provide other signals as to how funding will be provided. The changes have gone from the old ED categories, E1 to E7-I will not go into all the gory details-to what is essentially a two-tiered model. A two-tiered model should go some way towards addressing this inequity, but again they have failed to bite the bullet. In the case of the Frankston Hospital, the accident and emergency department is located, quite wisely, near the entrance; and just across the hall is a medi-clinic which is operated by local GPs and is funded through Medicare; you just swipe your card. So, if you have got a low-order GP kind of condition that needs to be attended to-it might be after hours or you might be having difficulty getting into a hospital; Wednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8537 we know about the shortage of GPs in the region that my friend the member for Flinders, Greg Hunt, and I represent-you go to the hospital and they say, ‘Right. Triage. Yes, you’ve got a GP thing. Off you go to the medi-clinic.’ You get attention, you get treatment, it is clocked up on Medicare, and the bill is sent to the Commonwealth. The consequence of that is that higher order, higher complexity cases end up going, as they should, to the accident and emergency department. I have a slide here that is very hard to read into Hansard, but I will try to explain it. In the case of the Frankston Hospital, the number of rescue and emergency patients who are seen in that hospital actually amounts to the total number of cases seen in other hospitals. The average of patients in category 1, 2 and 3 funding, which is rescue, emergency and urgent, is actually greater than it is for some of the inner metropolitan hospitals. I wish to explore this issue further but today I simply want to highlight the fact that the funding level for one of the inner metro hospitals starts at about $9 million. For an outer metropolitan hospital it is about $5½ million. That is the starting position, and then there are some changes made in terms of throughput and the like. What is missed is the complexity. What is missed are the actual demands placed on those professionals who, in the case of the Frankston Hospital in the accident and emergency department, do a remarkable job. I am calling for the Commonwealth, with the $30 billion funding allocation, to use those resources to give leverage to the states and territories to make sure that the accident and emergency services provided in outer metropolitan communities, like the community in the Greater Frankston-Mornington Peninsular area, are more responsive to the actual demands they face. It is a terrific hospital that is doing a terrific job under difficult circumstances. It deserves our support and it has a right to expect a proper level of resourcing-and whatever I can do to support that, I will. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.15 a.m.)-The Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2002 amends the Health Care (Appropriation) Act 1998 and allows the Commonwealth to discharge its financial responsibilities under the 1998-2003 Australian health care agreement. Under the Australian health care agreement, the Commonwealth provides financial assistance to the states and territories for the provision of hospital services-hospital services that are very important in all communities, which we represent in this parliament. Under section 4, this amendment will increase the maximum amount that the minister may grant by way of financial assistance to the states and territories, or to a hospital, or to a person from $29,655,056,000 to $31,800,000,000. Also it requires the Minister for Health and Ageing to present to each house of the parliament, as soon as practicable after 2003, a statement of the total amount of financial assistance paid under section 4. As you can see, this is a very important piece of legislation because it ensures the operation of our hospitals in the states and territories which we represent. I must say that, while this increase in funding is welcome, it is nowhere near enough. In looking at funding to hospitals, you need to look at a number of different issues, such as the changing demographics of the population. As everyone in this House would be aware, the Treasurer spoke at great lengthand in a moment the Minister for Health and Ageing will be in the chamber-about the Intergenerational Report and the impact that the ageing population is having on our society. I happen to represent one of the older electorates and I see first-hand how the ageing of the population is impacting on the health services and hospitals within our area. So there is a need 8538 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 for increased funding to the states for hospitals, based on the age of the population and the ageing population, and the associated complicated medical needs. There is also a need for increased funding to hospitals because there have been technological advancements and there are new medicines and new equipment-these are all very expensive. If you speak to any health economist or anyone who is familiar with the health industry or involved in health administration, they will tell you just how technology and advances in that area are increasing the costs of health to our community. There is a dilemma for government in the amount of money it wants to place in health. I see health as being one the most vitally important areas of government, and I have to say that people within the electorate that I represent also see health as one of the most vitally important areas of government. RecentlyI conducted a survey in my electorate; to date, there have been just under 2,000 responses, which is a significant number of the population of my electorate. That survey identifies that health is, by far, the most pressing priority for people living in the electorate of Shortland. Forty three per cent of those who responded to the survey identified health as being the most important issue. That was followed by employment and job creation of 19 per cent and education of 14 per cent. So you can see that, within this community-and I believe that my community is no different from any of the communities that other members of parliament represent-health is indeed seen as being vitally important. Because many people have contacted my office about health issues over the last four years, I also included in that survey a section that related to health. The questions that I included on that survey related to doctors and bulk-billing; being able to see doctors locally when you are sick-and I will talk a little more about that and how this relates to funding of hospitals-the retention of Medicare; the increase in the price, as we all know, of scheduled drugs under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; the increased costs of prescriptions; whether or not we need a Commonwealth dental health scheme; being able to see medical specialists in your area; affordable private health; and the importance of paying the gap when you are in a private hospital. Overwhelmingly, people put within the top three: having a doctor that bulk-bills, being able to see a doctor locally when you are sick and retaining Medicare. Within the Shortland electorate, there is a shortage of doctors and there is a shortage of doctors who bulk-bill. That is forcing residents of the area to go to hospital, to sit in the accident and emergency department of hospitals and to wait an inordinate amount of time to see the doctors. There is one general practitioner per 2,500 people on the Central Coast in my electorate. The national average, and the desirable average, is one per 1,000 people. So if you come from an electorate where there is not one doctor per 1,000 people, you need to be making a noise about it, because it means that the people of your electorate are missing out. Because there are so few doctors to service so many elderly people, people are waiting between seven and 14 days to see their local doctor. This is unacceptable if you are really ill. That is why these people are going to the hospitals and waiting to see doctors. This situation transfers the cost of providing that service from the Commonwealth to the states. I see this as another factor in arguing for more money to be given to the states rather than less. It is also an argument for saying, ‘This money that has been given, whilst an increase is always welcome, it is insufficient.’ The Shortland electorate is the 12th oldest electorate within the country and it has the 10th lowest median income. Together these create a situation where people do not have a lot of Wednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8539 money and are unable to afford to pay for medical services up front. It is one of the lowest bulk-billing electorates within the country-only 60.5 per cent of the doctors bulk-bill. If you look at the services that are bulk-billed and break them up a little more, you will find that very few doctors actually bulk-bill. Just using a page in the phone book I did a survey of doctors in the northern part of the Shortland electorate. We contacted 24 doctors, and out of those 24 doctors only 17 bulk-billed pensioners. That is quite a serious situation. We have elderly people, we have doctors who do not bulk-bill and we have people having to wait a long time to see doctors. What does this result in? It results in people going to the public hospital system, increased costs for the states and a shortfall in funding to the states. I thought I would quickly share with the House another survey that I conducted within my electorate with a social work student from Newcastle university. I spoke a little about this in the grievance debate on Monday. This social work student undertook a research project within the electorate based on a sample of 560 people over the age of 55. The majority of those people fall within the age bracket of 70 to 79. That was 45 per cent of the people. There were only five per cent in the 50 to 59 age group, 31 per cent were in the 60 to 69 age group and 14 per cent were in the 80 to 89 age group. This survey identified health as being the most important issue for older people within the electorate. Once again, I think that most members would find that situation if they were to survey their electorate. I thought that I would put into Hansard a couple of comments that were made by those people that completed the survey and also run through a few issues relating to health. Some 88 per cent of the respondents to this survey-which was looking at quality of life issues-ranked good health as being very important to their quality of life. A further eight per cent ranked it as being important. Overall, 96 per cent of people put it in that category. The participants expressed a desire for more GPs, a return to bulk-billing by doctors and improved hospital services. Once again, this is showing the strain that the lack of bulkbilling is putting on doctors and also the importance of putting more money into our hospital system. The people that responded to the survey commented on the need for better health facilities, better health services, better hospitals and, more importantly than anything, more doctors in the area. Minister, I think it is very important that we ensure that the states are adequately funded for health and that we take into account all those issues that I have mentioned: the ageing population; the changes in technology; the impact that this changing technology has on the delivery of health services, how it leads to an increase in costs; and the importance of really making a commitment to Medicare, ensuring that Medicare is retained and that doctors bulk-bill, because if they do not it is transferring the cost of the delivery of those basic health services to the states. Be it the state or the Commonwealth, the bottom line is that, if we do not have a properly funded health service in our communities, in our society, in Australia, it is the people that each and every one of us represent in this House that miss out. Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2002 proposes amendments to the Health Care (Appropriation) Act 1998. Under the current Australian health care agreements with the states and territories, the Howard government is investing almost $32 billion in public hospitals over five years, a real increase of 28 per cent, or $7 billion, over the previous Labor government’s agreements.",135,Representatives Main Committee
285,Mr Andrews (Menzies,"Minister for Ageing) (10.29 a.m.)-in reply-The Health8540 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 As has already been outlined, this bill is a significant bill as it provides increased funding to the states and territories through the current Australian health care agreements. This includes the offer of additional funding to the states and territories, the indexation of the health care grants by wage cost index No. 1 and the government forgoing its right to claw back any funding from the states in recognition of increased private health insurance coverage. The bill also requires the minister to table in both houses of parliament a statement of the actual amount of financial assistance paid under section 4 of the act. I thank all members who have contributed to this debate, and I thank the opposition for their support of this bill, which further illustrates this government’s strong commitment to health care. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Debate resumed from 16 October. Second Reading move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Torres Strait Fisheries Amendment Bill 2002 is to amend the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 so as to allow for the Chairperson of the Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA) to be appointed as a full member of the Protected Zone Joint Authority (PZJA). The PZJA is the joint Commonwealth and Queensland body responsible for the management of traditional and commercial fishing in the Australian waters of the Torres Strait Protected Zone. Under current arrangements, my colleague the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Senator the Hon. Ian Macdonald, is chair and a member of the PZJA and the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries and Rural Communities is also a member. As recognised in the treaty ratified between Australia and Papua New Guinea in 1985, the people of the Torres Strait have a unique relationship with the aquatic resources of their region. For thousands of years, members of their community have lived from the sea and their contemporary culture remains firmly rooted in these strong maritime traditions. These cultural, social and economic ties are also recognised in the existing Torres Strait Fisheries Act, which under section 8 specifically requires the PZJA to administer the act with regard to the ‘traditional way of life and livelihood of traditional inhabitants’. In light of these strong connections and the unique legislative framework for fisheries management in the Torres Strait, the Commonwealth and Queensland governments have agreed to strengthen the involvement of Torres Strait Islanders in the management of the area’s fisheries resources by appointing the TSRA chair to the PZJA as a full member.",141,Representatives Main Committee
286,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10.31 a.m.)-IWednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8541 As a full member, the TSRA chair will be involved in all future decisions on the management of the Torres Strait Protected Zone fisheries and will enjoy similar powers to those of the other PZJA members. This bill contains the necessary administrative amendments to give effect to this appointment. It should be noted that as Chair of the PZJA, the Commonwealth minister, will retain certain select roles and responsibilities that will be distinct from the other two members. Additionally, as the joint authority is established by an arrangement entered into by the Commonwealth and Queensland governments, the TSRA chairperson will not be empowered by the act to terminate the PZJA arrangement. I consider that this appointment will be a significant step in realising the long-term aspirations of the islander people to have a greater role in the management of the region’s aquatic resources. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Fisheries and Forestry has joined us. He might be able to take the opportunity during this debate on the Torres Strait Fisheries Amendment Bill 2002 to inform us whether he has been successful in achieving some payments for those people in the drought-affected areas of Brewarrina and Bourke. He indicated to the House yesterday that he was hopeful some payments might be forthcoming today. Comprising more than 100 islands and stretching over 150 kilometres between Australia and Papua New Guinea is the area we know as the Torres Strait. It has a population of about 8,000 people dispersed over 19 small island communities. Deeply influenced by the sea, the Torres Strait people maintain a strong cultural maritime tradition. To protect the way of life and the livelihood of the traditional inhabitants and the marine environment, the Torres Strait treaty was entered into by the Australian government and the government of Papua New Guinea in 1985. Treaties, if properly and fairly constructed, are a means of achieving a winwin outcome for all the parties involved. For Australia, they maintain the sustainability of our natural resources and ensure an equable and fair sharing arrangement of those resources between nation-states and can provide a means of empowering economically our poorer regional neighbours. In other words, with respect to the last point, treaties can provide the best and most effective way of providing foreign aid to our near neighbours. A case in point is the Timor Sea Treaty. When that treaty is ratified, the fledgling country of East Timor will enjoy the lion’s share of revenue from what is known as the joint petroleum development area in the Timor Sea. Australia will also gain from that treaty. It will provide guaranteed revenues for the Australian people, and certainty and security for those investing in the area. Indeed, it is critical to Australia’s economic development and, in particular, to the development of the Northern Territory. Projects like the development of the Greater Sunrise and Bayu Undan gas projects cannot proceed without it-and the $3.4 billion Bayu project may not proceed if the treaty is not signed this year. It disappoints me that the government is displaying a distinct lack of urgency with respect to this matter. Bayu Undan venture partner Philips Petroleum has expressed fear that delays in the finalisation of a unitisation agreement in the JPDA could result in the loss of its LNG contract with its Japanese customers. One of the conditions precedent of the project is the ratification of the Timor Sea Treaty. Appearing before the Joint Select Committee on Treaties on",142,Representatives Main Committee
287,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (10.34 A.m.),"I am pleased the Minister for Agriculture,8542 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 Monday of last week, the First Assistant Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Dr Raby, indicated the government’s preparedness to risk, in the national interest, the $3.4 billion Bayu Undan project and its estimated $2 billion in revenue. I have asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources whether Dr Raby’s comments reflect the views of the government. My fear is that the government has in mind not the national interest but that of a particular venture partner in the Sunrise field. It certainly does not have in mind the interests of the people of East Timor. It is premature in the extreme for the government to be insisting on the completion of the unitisation agreement prior to the ratification of the treaty. Rather, it should be concentrating all of its efforts on having the unitisation agreement finalised in the interests of all parties involved. I know that the East Timorese government has taken offence at claims by Woodside representative David Maxwell that they were deliberately delaying the unitisation agreement to gain economic leverage. I believe that this was a most unfortunate development. For the government to overtly communicate an insistence that the treaty not be ratified until the unitisation agreement is complete would be a mistake. Like the East Timorese, the government should reaffirm its commitment to completing the IUA by year’s end and to the ratification of the agreement, because anything short of that will bring problems for the East Timorese people and potential disaster for the people of the territory with respect to the Bayu Undan project. The government says that Sunrise is more important than Bayu, but we can have both if this matter is handled properly. Of course, a bird in the hand with respect to Bayu is worth two in the bush; members would be aware that there is really no firm plan for the development of the Sunrise field. If the conditions precedent is not met for the Bayu project by March next year, the contract with its Japanese customers will collapse and, even if reconstructed, it may be reconstructed in a form that delivers to Australia a much cheaper price for its LNG-driven of course by the recent contract with China. It is time for the government to act and show some urgency with respect to that Timor Sea project. To go back to the treaty I was originally referring to, the treaty established the Torres Strait Protected Zone, in which each country exercises sovereign jurisdiction for swimming fish and certain species on the respective sides of the agreed jurisdictional lines. In 1984, the Torres Strait Fisheries Act was passed, coming into force on the same day as the treaty, 15 February 1985. The purpose of this act was to give effect in Australian law to the fisheries elements of the treaty. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 to allow for the appointment of the chairperson of the Torres Strait Regional Authority as a full member of the Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint Authority, a move fully supported by the opposition. The Protected Zone Joint Authority was established under the Torres Strait Fisheries Act, and its role is the management of commercial and traditional fishing in the Australian areas of the Torres Strait Protected Zone and designated adjacent Torres Strait waters. The Protective Zone Joint Authority is currently made up of the Commonwealth Minister for Forestry and Conservation and the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries and Rural Communities. The chairperson of the Torres Strait Regional Authority has been representing Torres Strait Islander interests at recent meetings in an advisory capacity. The amendment bill will formalise this arrangement and will allow the chair of the TSRA to become a full member of the Protective Zone Joint Authority. The formalisation of the role that the TSRA chairperson will Wednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8543 play in the PZJA recognises and strengthens the role of Torres Strait Islanders in the management of the area’s fisheries resources, and is strongly supported by the opposition. It is important that we recognise the significant cultural, social and economic ties that the members of these communities have had for thousands of years with the sea and that their contemporary culture is intrinsically embedded in these maritime traditions. Although this has been a positive and responsible move by the minister, and one the opposition strongly supports, I understand that there are current issues associated with representation and consultation in the Torres Strait and an element of frustration by one group who were refused individual consultation on this bill. The minister might care to clarify that. The government has far from a good record in Indigenous affairs and should be mindful that, unless it allows a fair, equitable and transparent process of consultation on Indigenous issues, it will undermine the entire process. Established in 1994 under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989, the TSRA is a statutory authority with the stated objective to ‘strengthen the economic, social and cultural development of the Torres Strait to improve the lifestyle and well-being of the Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people in the region’. This objective complements, reinforces and validates the role of the TSRA chairman as a full member of the TSPZJA. Significantly, section 8 of the Torres Strait Fisheries Act specifies that, in the administration of the act: … regard shall be had to the rights and obligations conferred on Australia by the Torres Strait Treaty and in particular to the traditional way of life and livelihood of traditional inhabitants, including their rights in relation to traditional fishing. Formal representation from the Torres Strait Islander community on the TSPZJA will ensure that their interests are truly represented and that they are not just observers of a process that governs their resources, traditions and culture. Labor commends the bill to the House. in reply-I thank the member for Hunter for his support for the Torres Strait Fisheries Amendment Bill 2002. I will not comment on the first three-quarters of his speech because it had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with this piece of legislation, but I welcome his comments in support of the bill in his last few paragraphs. He mentioned the current dispute on this issue by one group of Torres Strait islanders. I presume he is referring to the Kaurareg people. I can give him a few details on that matter if he is interested. The proposal for the TSRA chair to become a member of the PZJA was generated by the traditional inhabitants of the Torres Strait-including the Kaurareg people-and pursued by the TSRA as their representative body. There have been several opportunities for groups concerned about the proposal to raise their concerns through the TSRA, the PZJA or directly with the Queensland or the Commonwealth governments. Last year the Kaurareg people were granted native title over the Prince of Wales, Horn, Entrance, Damaralag, Turtle, Packe and Port Lihou islands in the Torres Strait. All of these islands and their surrounding waters lie outside the Torres Strait Protected Zone. However, they are included as part of the ‘outside but near’ waters set out in the Torres Strait Treaty. The Kaurareg people have a voice on the TSRA through the Horn and Prince of Wales islands. At its meeting in June 2002, the TSRA endorsed the proposal that the TSRA chairperson become a full and equal member of the PZJA. The TSRA is the most appropriate forum",143,Representatives Main Committee
288,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10.44 a.m.)8544 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 for consulting with local Indigenous people in the Torres Strait, given the extent of its representation and its statutory functions. I am aware that there are many issues surrounding representation in the broader sense in the Torres Strait. As the immediate past chairman of this particular body, I am certainly well aware of the issues that arise and the friendly rivalry between the people of the various islands. Because of its isolation there is often an absence of information flow, which is difficult for both state and Commonwealth governments to endeavour to counter. For a long period there were too few meetings, which adversely affected those involved in the decision making process. I understand it has always been difficult to get state and Commonwealth ministers together at the same time. More effort has been made over recent years to ensure that the meetings schedules are more regular. I do not think that those concerns are any reason to delay the passage of this bill-and I know the opposition agrees with that. This bill will actually strengthen the consultation process and help make it much more inclusive. I thank the honourable member for Hunter for his support for the bill, and I commend it to the committee. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment NEW PROCEDURES IN MAIN COMMITTEE accordance with the Deputy Speaker’s statement of 17 September 2002, the House has permitted interventions in this chamber. Debate resumed from 22 October, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the following paper. That this House: (1) expresses its outrage and condemnation at the barbaric terrorist bombings which took place in Bali on 12 October 2002; (2) extends its deepest and heartfelt sympathy to the families and loved ones of those Australians killed, missing or injured in this brutal and despicable attack; (3) offers its condolences to the families and friends of the Indonesians and citizens of other countries who have been killed or injured; (4) condemns those who employ terror and indiscriminate violence against innocent people; (5) commits the Australian government to work with the Indonesian government and others to bring those who are guilty of this horrendous crime, and all those who harbour and support them, to justice; and (6) reaffirms Australia’s commitment to continue the war against terrorism in our region and in the rest of the world. Ms ELLIS (Canberra) (10.48 a.m.)-These are the sorts of debates that we wish we never had to have. It is very important for members of this House to register our thoughts and feelings on an occasion such as this, not only on our own behalf but on behalf of our communities. Words appear to me to be quite understated when speaking on an issue like this. The",145,Representatives Main Committee
289,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. L.r.s. Price),"I remind all honourable members that inWednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8545 news of what occurred in Bali could only be met with the deepest of sorrow, the deepest of sadness. That is how I felt when I first heard about what had happened. A stunned reaction then comes over you. You have to try and absorb and digest the effects, occurrences, impacts, damage-all these words come to mind-and come to some realisation about what really happened. In my case, as far as the ACT community is concerned, it appears that we have been very fortunate that we are not on the list of communities that have carried death or injury. For that, should that be proven to be correct, we can only be thankful. It also gives us an opportunity to think about those other communities. The impact and the images that have been carried, particularly for those football clubs, have been an example of how a small part of our community can be impacted on so greatly. That has really hit home. On the Friday evening before the Saturday bombing in Bali, I was attending the presentation dinner of my own local football club, the Tuggeranong Cowboys, of which I am patron. It is one of the first grade ACT teams in Canberra. We had our presentation night on that Friday night, never knowing what was going to happen within the next 24 hours. It seems quite bizarre that on that evening a number of our players bounded up to receive their presentations wearing Bali T-shirts and Bali hairdos, having returned literally the day before. It was not until early the following week, when we heard what had happened to all those other footy clubs, that I began to try and imagine how we would have reacted if our team had been there 48 hours later. I cannot imagine it. It is impossible to. You can only begin to think about what you would be feeling if those young men who we saw on that Friday night had in fact not been there that night. It is reminders like that that really bring home the effect. One of our high schools, Caroline Chisholm High School, had an excursion of quite a number of their students in Bali at the time of the bombing. Their parents, friends and families would have gone into immediate shock and distress. Thankfully, that group was nowhere near that side of Bali at the time. The reaction of those families on receiving their people back in Canberra safe and sound last weekend was written all over their faces. One can understand why. Even though we have been fortunate in one sense, we have still had examples of close contact. On behalf of the Canberra community of my electorate, all I can do is to offer the rest of the country where the impact has been so enormous our deepest sympathy and compassion and every understanding that we can possibly offer to those people at this terrible time that they are going through-a terrible time, I might add, that is going to go on and on. I remember at the commemorative service a year on from September 11 the mother of one of the Australian victims of that tragedy. She made the comment very loudly that, whilst her family obviously will mourn every 11 September, they are going to be reminded by everybody in a very big way of the impact. The impact is not something they can hold privately. There will be a public display at the same time they have their private thoughts. The same thing is going to happen to the families of the people in Bali. We need to keep that in mindthat, while we stand with them, we need to also allow them the private space to react and mourn in the way that they need to. I am not quite sure how we do that but we need to have that in our minds. It is very difficult to even imagine how one would react to a thing like this. We have learnt a lot of lessons in this process, be they from the medical specialists, the evacuation teams, the 8546 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 doctors, the nurses, the ambulance teams or the RAAF teams, all of whom performed in the most miraculous fashion. Even they are saying they learned so much in this process. It has also given us time to understand and appreciate the specialist levels we have in this country. What has been going on in the burns units and in other places around the country since this terrible occurrence has reminded me of how much we need to continue to invest-I am not just talking money here-in our faith and our understanding of what we can do. We must allow the continuing education and programs in all of our medical services, because it is through those processes that these people are able to do the miracles that they do. Our heartfelt thanks go out to every one of them. I am not quite sure how they have managed to do what they have had to do, because they are saying the stress has been enormous on them. We need to pay due regard and give thanks to all of those people. We need to also remember the people across the water in Bali, the Balinese themselves: the victims, their families and the impact on their society, which is just as great as, if not greater than, the impact on ours. Economically they are going to be finding it very difficult for a long time and we need to keep that in mind. One of the most positive things we could have out of this, I suppose, is to remember as warmly and as positively as we can those who have suffered, those who have lost their lives, the people they have left behind, those who are still fighting for their lives and those who will have a disability and be maimed from now on-and there will be many in that group as well. We also look forward to the day when some of us are able to go back to Bali. I went there many years ago now, and it is a place I fell in love with. We need to look forward to the day when we can go back and show the people there our appreciation, our belief in who they are and what they are, and assist in any way we can in their recovery. While we need to have recovery at home, we also need to have it in Bali. On behalf of the electorate of Canberra that I represent, our thoughts and our prayers, whatever shape they may take, are with all of those people from Bali right across to here, be they victims, families, people in the process of assisting them or emergency workers. Everyone involved deserves our compassion, our tolerance, our understanding and our encouragement for their futures. Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (10.56 a.m.)-The terrorists’ bombing of the nightclub in Bali on Saturday, 12 October will always be remembered as one of the greatest crimes committed against all Australians. On behalf of the electorate of Murray, I wish to extend my most profound sympathy to the individuals, families and friends personally touched by this tragedy. In the first instance our hearts go out to the young Australians who were simply enjoying a holiday in a favourite place that has played gentle host to hundreds of thousands of Westerners. We also extend our sympathy to the other holiday-makers killed or injured and to the Balinese, who have willingly shared their beautiful island. No doubt they will continue to be victims of this atrocity for years to come as their fragile, tourist dependent economy teeters. In an open, tolerant and peaceful country like ours it is difficult to imagine what religious teaching, education, parenting or life experience would produce human beings so twisted, so hating, so envious and so malicious that they would painstakingly plot to burn, maim and kill total strangers-men and women relaxing in a nightclub. When these criminals are located and brought to trial, it is important that we strive to understand what influenced and drove Wednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8547 them. This will be important in helping to identify any others who are likely to share their associations and mind-set. It will also be important so we can work to ensure that the elements which created the terrorism are never fostered or tolerated in our homeland. The mass murders have given us reason to pause and think about Australia and Australians. It is important that we readjust our thinking about domestic security and about the security of Australians internationally. On the other hand, the terrorists would have succeeded to an even greater extent if they had stimulated a change in our culture away from an open-handed and carefree spirit to a more closed, isolationist or intolerant society. Mostly we gain a sense of who we are in a mirror held up by others. I was, therefore, very interested to read an editorial on the Australian response to the bombings in a UK broadsheet, the Telegraph, printed on Sunday, 20 October, a week following the massacre. Entitled ‘Once a Jolly Swagman’, the writer is considering our collective response to the attack. He reminds the British, however, that this is not the first test of terror or horror that has confronted Australia and Australians. I quote: There has been talk in the last week of the Bali bombing representing ‘a loss of innocence’ yet the Australian has been in every conflict of the past Century. He was, most famously, at ANZAC Cove. He was at Dunkirk and on the Burma Railway. He was in Vietnam and in the Falklands. He has always realised how (as he put it) bloody lucky he is to live in the most wonderful country on earth. However, he also understands that in fulfilling the national desire to be part of the wider world there are obligations that, from time to time, he has to meet ... The writer then describes what in his eyes is a typical Australian: The Australian is physically robust and usually brave. He is hospitable. He is sustained at all times by the ethos of mateship, the freemasonry or Broederbond of the ocker. Mateship provides that sense of community to complement the profound patriotism. I agree with this description. I am proud of it as a description of an Australian. Who will ever forget the last photos of the hundreds of Australians who were enjoying one another’s company in the Sari Club in Bali; friends who had played football together, women celebrating birthdays, men and women simply enjoying a lovely place, meeting one another and celebrating sheer pleasure in their surroundings, the food, the drink and the fellowship? During the attack, men and women tried to help one another despite the danger, but so many lives have been cruelly cut short. Last Saturday, a week after the bombing, I was in another beautiful place experiencing the full joy of shared experience and a sense of community with nearly 1,000 fellow Australians. We were doing what Australians are famous for: we were all volunteering time and raising funds to help others less fortunate. This was the inaugural Relay for Life organised by the Shepparton Women’s Community Services Organisation. All that effort was to help victims of cancer. The event was held at Princess Park, a football oval in the heart of Shepparton in my great electorate of Murray, on the banks of the Goulburn River. The weather was superb and around the oval’s running track, cheek by jowl, were tents and awnings erected to shelter the dozens of community teams representing workplaces, schools, sports clubs and service clubs. Together they had raised over $130,000 for cancer research and treatment, and participants were determined to walk all day and all night in a relay for life. Among the teams were nearly 70 survivors of cancer and their carers. Around the track in small paper bags were candles 8548 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 anchored in sand. Each paper bag was dedicated to a fellow Australian who had died of cancer or who was still fighting the disease. Those candles were like tiny headstones. It is hard to describe the spirit that was evident in all who kept walking, jogging or racing around and around the oval, meeting and greeting friends, holding hands, making jokes, wearing outlandish costumes, belly dancing, drinking fizzy beer and wine, cooking barbecues, dancing to the bands, or having a massage for the cost of a gold coin donation. There were babes in prams, elderly couples and widows who could hardly walk unaided, but everyone was there to contribute in a way that the English writer understood to be typical of our great country. I was hugely proud to be part of that event. I was especially proud knowing that many of the people of the Goulburn Valley so generously pouring out their love and caring for the needy were themselves in quite desperate circumstances because of the drought. At9 a.m. on Sunday we all stood together in shorts and T-shirts for the national day of mourning ceremony to express our collective sorrow for the victims of the terrorist attack in Bali. During the minute’s silence, the birds sang and the leaves rustled in the gum trees. A single small plane flew overhead. The peace was palpable. Then we sang the national anthem played by the Wanganui secondary college band. It was a most fitting memorial and expression of solidarity as we remembered our fellow Australians brutally killed and wounded. A UK writer acknowledged that such is the essence of the Australian spirit. It is why we will survive and perhaps be strengthened in our resolve not to be changed or intimidated by the madmen who are terrorists. He wrote: Your average Ocker loves nothing so much as his country ... You will see tears in the eyes of Australians of all ages after only a couple of bars of “Waltzing Matilda.” They have a sense of nationalism that pervades everything, informs everything. There has been much debate for years in cricketing circles, for example about why Australians are so much better at winning test matches than anyone else ... the real reason is that they believe so ferociously that what they do, they do for Australia ... The sense of nationhood and community is cast iron ... Once again, on behalf of my electorate of Murray, I send my sincere condolences to the families and loved ones of our fellow Australians killed in Bali. May we never forget what lies between us and such cruelty. May each of us be responsible for ensuring that our community and our country remain tolerant and free. Dr EMERSON (Rankin) (11.04 a.m.)-I offer my sympathy and support to the people who were affected by the tragedy in Bali and to the families and friends of all those young Australians who lost their lives in Bali. As the federal representative of the people of Rankin, I think I can speak on their behalf in extending their sympathy and their support to the relatives and friends of those Australians who lost their lives. It is a terrible thing to lose anyone, but we are talking about young, fun-loving Australians in their late teens, their twenties and their early thirties. The mums and dads of these young Australians brought them up, loved them and became so very close to them and then, in the most unlikely of circumstances, lost them. It must be absolutely heart wrenching. It is almost unimaginable to try to understand what they are going through and the grief that they are experiencing. This would have to be the greatest peacetime tragedy for Australia, at least since the Second World War. There were 500 or so Australians killed in the Vietnam War, which spanned almost a decade. On Saturday, 12 October, a week or so ago, around 120 young Australians were killed. That is a huge number of Australians who lost their lives. The Vietnam War Wednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8549 traumatised Australia for a very long time and continues to traumatise the families of veterans and those who were killed during the Vietnam War. The scale of what happened just over a week ago has probably not fully dawned on us, but it was a huge tragedy and a huge loss. I also think of the nationals of other countries. Of course, our first thought and our first responsibility is to the Australians who lost their lives, but a large number of nationals of other countries also lost their lives including the Balinese who died that night. We should pause and think of the future of those Balinese who are dependent upon tourism for their livelihoodsand that is most of them. These are not wealthy people. They are trying to keep families together and they are on low incomes. The impact that the Bali bombing will have on their livelihoods stands to be quite severe. In the aftermath of the Bali bombings let us pause also to think of the future of those poor Balinese who now will be in so much more vulnerable a situation as a result of this murderous act. When I spoke briefly on the bombing of the World Trade CentreI said that we must not and cannot avenge the death of innocents with the death of innocents. I repeat that here today: we must not and cannot avenge the death of innocent Australians with the death of other innocent people. I note that, in commenting upon the tragedy in Bali, the Prime Minister immediately indicated that there was no link between that atrocity and the entire issue of Iraq. He was right then, but he is changing his position on that now. Australians will not be fooled by claims being made more recently by the Prime Minister and claims by the US Administration that Bali and Iraq are linked-that somehow the case for Australian involvement in a unilateral action, or an action that is not conducted under the auspices of the United Nations, has been bolstered by the atrocities in Bali. So the PM has moved from the position of saying quite clearly that they are not linked. He is now starting to prepare the groundwork for claiming they are linked-but they are not. Noone seriously suggests that Saddam Hussein, as brutal a dictator and a killer as he is, was behind the tragedy in Bali. In fact, the Australian Federal Police have not indicated, and do not seem to know at this stage, who was behind the bombings in Bali. Certainly they are not suggesting that Iraq was behind that, although the Prime Minister is now saying, ‘This is all part of the war against terrorism,’ as if this strengthens the case for Australia supporting US military action against Iraq outside of the auspices of the United Nations. It does not. There is a clear argument that Australia’s counter-terrorism resources in all their forms ought to be concentrated here in Australia and in our near neighbourhood-not in places far away. It is time that we protected Australia’s national interests, that we looked after Australia in respect of counter-terrorism rather than looked so much further afield. We need to take a principled position in relation to Iraq and not be fooled by claims that the Bali tragedy somehow strengthens the case for Australian military action against Iraq. We will become even stronger in the aftermath of the Bali bombings if we commit to a triumph of light over darkness and if we are committed to a triumph of hope over fear. That is what will strengthen the Australian people out of the Bali tragedy; not some ill-considered retaliation in another country as if we were saying, ‘Someone attacked us, so we’ll attack someone else.’ That serves no useful purpose and it does not take Australia any closer to reconciling itself with the atrocities in Bali. I extend, as best I can, my own personal sympathies and support and I offer any comfort that I possibly can to the families and the friends of those who were killed in this tragedy. 8550 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 sympathy and condolences to the families and friends of those Australians who were so brutally murdered in Bali. The constituents in my electorate have been blessed in that we seem to have been spared, but they mourn, together with the families and friends of those who have been lost. They understand the brutality of what was done, particularly to those young Australians exercising the freedom that we regard so correctly as a right-the right to be free. Yet it is that very right to be free that is threatened by the hatred that is shown for that freedom. So many young people will never meet their potential-young people, as I said, who were exercising their freedom to enjoy the hospitality of the people of Bali, with whom great friendships have been built over many years. As you look at the photographs of those who have been lost, you feel, with the parents, that parents are not meant to have to bury their children. They are meant to grow old with them, enjoy them and see them reach their heights. The shock that comes with so many deaths is the motive behind their murder, murder that was motivated by hate, hate of everything that those people stood for-not only the Australians but also people from other nationalities who were there-and with no care for the Balinese themselves. We are at war with terrorism, and terrorism knows no geographical bounds. Historically Australia has felt quarantined in a sense in that we have not been invaded, although I had to walk the Kokoda Track to understand how close it came and how much we owed the diggers who fought on the Kokoda Track, particularly at the Battle of Isurava. We even kept the bombing of Darwin a big secret for so long. People haven’t realised that it was the same planes that bombed Pearl Harbour that bombed Darwin-that they flew 750 sorties-because at the time it was a question of security. Yet, in all the years that have passed we have never really let the rest of Australia know that 1,000 people died. So in a sense we have had a charmed life. There are those who think that, if we put our heads in the sand, if we pretend we are a small target, we will not be included, we will be spared. I repeat: terrorism knows no geographical borders. It is our way of life and the things which we hold dear that we believe in, of which the equality of women is very much a part. The freedom that those young women exercised in enjoying themselves in Bali was something that other people hate. Australia has never been one to shirk her duty. Australia has always been a nation that takes part and shares in international strife, where good people need to be counted. The war on terrorism is no exception. Again, we play our part. The JI in Indonesia, clearly linked with al-Qaeda, and the other terrorist groups that are around the world no doubt have their links in Australia. We cannot say we are immune. By pretending that we do not have a role to play in the international sense will not somehow quarantine us from something which is immediately on our doorstep because-I repeat-terrorism knows no boundary. In this difficult time. I think it is important that we start to acknowledge what we are fighting. Francis Fukuyama wrote in his famous essay The End of History that liberal democracy had been successful in overcoming communism and fascism, the two ideologies which had come out of the 1920s. Huntingdon has written about the ‘clash of civilisations’, but a more important voice I think is that of Daniel Pipes, who says that there needs to be an identification of militant Islamicism as an ideology which is just as much disdained by moderate Muslims as by people of the West.",146,Representatives Main Committee
290,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (11.13 A.m.),"Together with others, I offer myWednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8551 We have to realise that the ideology of militant Islamism also emerged in the 1920s, along with communism and fascism. We just did not really notice until, in Pipes’s words, ‘the Shah of Persia was not only opposed but deposed and a militant regime came into place’. He makes the point that we need to support moderate Islam and recognise militant Islamism as an ideology instead of categorising it as a religious problem. I think he is right. I think Fukuyama was wrong; I think Huntington is wrong. I think Pipes’s voice is the voice of reason. The immediate need for us as a nation is to again strengthen our resolve. We need to say that we will always stand up for the rights of the individual, that we regard every individual as an important person, that women are as important as men, that women’s rights are as important as men’s rights, and that the freedom to exercise those rights is fundamental to the Australian way of life. Our spirit as a nation will not be bent, and it certainly will not be broken. We have shown again and again in the short history of our nation that we are a resilient people who will always stand up for our values. This is going to be a difficult time for us. As we mourn and reach out to the families and the friends who have lost the people they love, we must stand firm in our resolve that our freedoms are precious to us and will always be defended by us. We will always hold our heads high and say, ‘We are proud of the Australian way of life.’ And we want more and more people to be able to enjoy the freedoms that we enjoy. The freedom to worship and the freedom to be free are important. AgainI say: we have to identify terrorism for what it is and we have to identify the people who perpetrate terrorism. We must know that the war on terrorism is right and we must never back away from it or pretend that we can somehow be cocooned from it. We cannot. We will remain the people we have always been-ready to play our part. by the Prime Minister. There is no question in my mind that Australia is presently at war with terrorism. I think about the lives of the people who were there, particularly those who were young. They were simply enjoying themselves at a holiday destination, and the fact is that they will not be returning because some bunch of scumbags somewhere around the world has decided to target people from countries such as ours, simply to prove some stupid point or to be fanatical followers of some fanatical religion. It really gives me little hope that, unless we tackle these people head-on, we are going to be able to do much about it. I heard only this morning that the stepdaughter of one of our great athletes passed away from injuries sustained in the bombings. I look at the young lives which have now expired. I look at the fact that it is not correct and it is not right for young people to have their lives snuffed out, under any circumstances, let alone in circumstances like this, where they were only doing what many young Australians love to do: have a holiday in a picturesque location such as Bali. I feel for all the relatives and friends, and particularly the mothers and fathers, of the young people who have died. As has been said in this debate by a number of people, there is nothing worse than to have a change in the order in which people should pass on. Parents should be buried before their children are-and not the other way around. Looking at a list of the names and ages of the people who have died, you can see just how terrible this whole episode has been. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.25 a.m. to 11.40 a.m.",152,Representatives Main Committee
291,Mr Sciacca (Bowman) (11.22 A.m.),"I rise to speak on the condolence motion moved8552 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 pened to go to New York and I went to ground zero. Of course, ground zero is just a big hole. Effectively, when one looks at it one can only imagine the horrors of the September 11 attacks, to which I believe the Bali bombings are linked in the sense that it is another act of terrorism. I took the time to walk across the street to look at the messages, notes, telegrams and little flags that were on the fences across the road from ground zero. If you read some of those things, you cannot help but get emotional-in fact, I had to stop after about five feet. It brings tears to your eyes when you read the messages from families left behind by people who have been tragically killed-if it doesn’t, you have no heart. The victims of the Bali bombings now join that band of over 100,000 Australians who have given their lives during times of war. In my view this is a war. There are people in the world who want to push their barrows and they are prepared to take lives. Life means nothing to them. They are the sorts of people who, because life means nothing to them, are prepared to give their own lives. How do you fight an enemy like that? That is the problem facing us as Australians and the problem facing the whole of the free world. We are fighting people who have no respect at all for human life, including no respect for their own lives. I want to pay a special tribute to the heroes and the people who helped those who were in need on 12 October. One good thing about the Australian spirit-and there are many good things about it-is that, when we face adversity, we are capable of acts of heroism that we would never even think we were. This is what happened in Bali. If you are ever looking for silver linings in these dark clouds, you need only look at the many examples of Australians wanting to help other Australians. I pay tribute to them. There are so many stories that have come out and there are so many more that will come out. With respect to the terrorists, I am afraid that I am not one of those who subscribes to the notion of turning the other cheek. I know that there are some who have spoken here who have said that you do not fix the problem by retaliating. But I put it to you that, if we were simply to turn the other cheek, what would happen is that they would think that we are a soft touch and that they can do it again. As much as I am a peace-loving person and I believe that wars are stupid and should not be fought, the fact is that we did not ask for this. We did not ask for Australian people to be killed on 11 September 2001 and we did not ask for these people to be wantonly bombed and destroyed on 12 October 2002. My view is that any country or any person who harbours these murdering criminals is an accessory after the fact. I know that a lot of my own colleagues will not agree with me-and I am sure my very good friend sitting next to me now will not agree with me-but my view is that, if you are an accessory after the fact, if you are somebody who is harbouring people who are nothing short of murderers, then you need to be dealt with. Those who have been hurt and those who have been affected should have the right to stop them. If they are not stopped, they are going to do it again and they are going to do it again to our people. I would rather have one of our people saved than take the attitude of putting up my hands and saying ‘C’est la vie; what will be will be.’ I am probably in the minority in my own party: I think I am a good Christian; I think I am the sort that forgives. But it is hard to forgive stuff like this. AllI say is that I want people in the community not to blame groups. Many good people in this country practise forms of the Islamic religion. We are not fighting the normal Muslim religion here; we are not fighting",153,Representatives Main Committee
292,Mr Sciacca,"Before the division, I was saying that only a couple of weeks ago I hapWednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8553 those ideals. They are good ideals; I have heard them. I have been to Muslim services and I know that the vast majority of people in the world, particularly those who live in this country, who practise Islam are wonderful people. But, when you have a bunch of ratbags who believe that they will go to heaven and that there will be, I think, 72 vestal virgins waiting for them and all this sort of rubbish, you know you are dealing with absolute madmen; you know you are dealing with people whom you cannot possibly deal with, because they are irrational, they are fools and they are criminals. Australia, unfortunately, is at war now. I have no doubt that the people involved in the Bali tragedy were targeted. I was overseas at the time. I was in Ottawa, Canada, in the House of Commons, attending a conference called Global Parliamentarians Against Corruption. I am very pleased that at that conference, at which some 170 parliamentarians represented 60 countries, a motion of condolence to Australians was moved. Those parliamentarians recognised that, even though people from other countries died in the tragedy also, it was Australia that was targeted; they recognised that we were targeted. People know that we go to Bali and we love Bali. Just to finalise my remarks, I will say this: my heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones, particularly those parents who have lost children-young lives that have been snuffed out; those who will not be able to live their lives, make their mark and leave issue; there is nothing more tragic. One family, I notice-I think it is a Greek family; I can remember the name but I cannot spell it, and so I will not put it into Hansard-has lost three or four members. That is tragic beyond conjecture. I can understand how that must feel to some degreebut to lose so many people. My heart goes out to them; it goes out to everybody. I express my deepest sympathies. In this time of grief for us, I say: let us not always turn the other cheek; in my view, let us get these people and let them pay for what they have done. FRAN BAILEY (McEwen-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (11.47 a.m.)-I am very proud to stand in this chamber today and have my remarks associated with those of my colleagues from both sides of the House. I have never seen this House speak with such a united voice on any issue as with the tragedy of the terrorist attacks in Bali, where so many of our Australian citizens, Balinese people and other young people from other nations were tragically killed. I think every one of us speaking in this debate does so with a very heavy heart. Most of us are parents, and it is a parent’s worse nightmare to be told of the death of one of their children-and, to add to that, to be told that your child was killed as the result of a barbaric terrorist attack. It is very difficult for any of us to really get our head around that sort of tragedy. I want to place on record my deepest sympathy for all of the families that have been affected by this tragedy; in particular, for those that have lost family members; and for those families that presently, as we are speaking in this debate, are keeping vigil by the hospital beds of their loved ones who are fighting for their survival. Many words have been said in this debate; many accolades have been given to those people who have responded so magnificently to this tragedy. I would like to pay tribute in this debate to members of our Australian Defence Force. Operation Bali Assist, as it has become known, represented the largest mobilisation of emergency military support in peacetime. Australian Defence Force personnel have played an extraordinary role in what can only be described as war like conditions. In the news footage and news broadcasts we have seen many of our men and women in uniform performing many tasks that, I am quite sure, they never expected to be called upon to do. 8554 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 The ADF response was immediate with the employment of a RAAF C130 Hercules to aid emergency casualty evacuation followed by delivery of refrigeration containers and support personnel, including psychologists. But, most importantly, the ADF worked quickly to get the required equipment and resources into Bali. It certainly did not have the resources to cope with the extent of the blast and the tragedy that ensued. The ADF has provided five medical teams, totalling 41 personnel, to assist in patient treatment and transfer to Darwin, as well as other personnel, including technicians, psychologists, chaplains, linguists, drivers and support staff. Military chaplains who have been sent across to Bali have been facing one of their toughest missions. They are trained to deal with members of our defence forces who are placed in very difficult circumstances, but in this instance they were on the front line, dealing face-to-face with civilians in the most awful set of circumstances. They are continuing to play an integral role in assisting the victims and comforting the relatives who are trying to come to terms with the scope of this tragedy. We must remember that our defence personnel are also mothers and fathers, husbands, wives, brothers and sisters and that they are not immune to the mental anguish that they have been through in the rescue and recovery process. We must remember that, like all of us, they feel this anguish. I want to also pay a special tribute to the many groups and individuals including our police officers, our doctors, our nurses and our volunteers for their continuing help with the investigation, the care for burns victims and in the grim process of recovery. All of our hearts go out to those parents who will not get the remains of their loved ones. As has been pointed out the Prime Minister has made special mention of this-identification and recovery have been made so much more difficult because we are operating in a foreign country with little resources. One of the stories I heard-and there have been many highlighting extraordinary commitment-was that a team of 60 doctors and nurses operated for five days straight. They performed 30 operations on 24 victims throughout this time. I would also like to pay tribute to the media for the role they have played. They have not only relayed the stories of the sorrow, the tragedy and the loss, but also highlighted the bravery of those involved in many of the rescues. I am advised that many members of the media have assisted in rescue efforts: sifting through rubble and comforting victims. They, too, have been affected by this, as have our military personnel. The camera lens cannot obscure the pain and suffering when confronted with these events in close proximity. The rescue mission, in the first few hours, must have been one of the most frightening experiences for many of these people. Many of our nationals who live and work in Indonesia came to their aid, as did the Australian consulate staff. We place on the public record our genuine thanks to all of those people. We have to ask ourselves what has come out of this tragedy. I cannot express it any better than the Prime Minister did when he spoke to the victims’ families in Bali and said that all of the victims were supported by 19½ million Australians. This has been one of the characteristics of the Australian people: in tough times we always bounce back and we always support our fellow Australians. In the limited time. I have, I want to place on the record my commitment to the war against terrorism. These bombings represent a brutal reminder that the campaign against terrorism is far from over. The awful event bears witness to the fact that terrorism can touch anyone anyWednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8555 where. Like everyone else, I have spent this past week grappling with that realisation. The tragedy has served to remind us that the campaign against terrorism must continue with unrelenting vigour. We must work with our neighbours to rid our region of this growing evil. Of course we have learnt that terrorism is a global threat. It would be wrong of Australians to bow to an isolationist mentality in the misguided belief that non-action will protect us from such vile acts; it will not. This senseless, barbaric attack in Bali has been an attack on our easy, fun-loving Australian way of life. But our Australian tenacity to preserve our way of life, our freedom and our capacity to bounce back as a nation is stronger than ever. No terrorist attack will undermine the spirit of Australians. firstly express, on my own behalf and on behalf of my family and the constituents of the New England electorate, great sympathy to those who have suffered loss and tragedy due to the occurrences in Bali last week. It has been a very difficult time for all of us. It has been a very rude awakening for Australians that these sorts of activities can in fact happen to our young people and they can happen very close to home. A lot of us have been to Bali. It is a beautiful spot and I hope that we do not abandon Bali as a place for a holiday. If we did that, we would be playing very much into the terrorists’ hands in terms of the purpose of these sorts of attacks. I encourage people not to forget about the people of Bali. This is not only about a tragedy in Australia; it is a real tragedy for the Balinese people and obviously it will have a great economic impact on their country. As the tragedy unfolded, it came home to me quite strongly because that Saturday night was the 21st birthday of our eldest son. There were lots of young people engaging in frivolity, fun and laughter. Yet unfolding was a tragedy where similar people of similar ages, having good times and enjoying each other’s company, had their lives destroyed. It made me think particularly about the parents who have lost their children. When my wife and I visited Bali some 23 years ago, my wife was pregnant with our first child. Due to complications in the pregnancy that set in during our time in Bali, we lost that child. So, as the tragedy in Bali unfolded, it brought home to me the very real grief that the parents must be feeling. One can live with the loss of an unborn child, to a certain degree, but to lose a 23-year-old must be very tragic. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the volunteers, the people who did get in and give people a hand. That is a very Australian trait we have developed and something we should hold very dear. To divert to another subject briefly, in our deliberations in the public liability debate, we have to make sure that whatever we do-irrespective of what it takesenables voluntary organisations to exist in the future. If we lose that volunteer spirit, as was displayed in Bali the other day, we lose part of our psyche. Watching the incident unfold on television the next day, the tragedy came home to me when I noticed an ex-resident, whose family still lives in the town that I come from-Werris Creek. It is a community of only 1,400 people. Eric de Hart, who was interviewed a number of times on television, was the sponsor of the Coogee Dolphins football club. He was very distraught at the loss of six of the team from that particular club. I pay tribute to Eric for the way he conducted himself-the grief he felt was obvious-and the way in which he was able to bring the message back to the loved ones of those who were lost.",154,Representatives Main Committee
293,Mr Windsor (New England) (11.57 A.m.),"I will speak briefly to this motion. Let me8556 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 There has been a lot of talk since the tragedy about what Australia should do in terms of terrorist activities. I would like to congratulate the Prime Minister on his handling of the circumstances in the last week. Obviously, it has been a difficult time for everybody. We have to remember that the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have to make important decisions on the run. We have to remember that they are human too. This tragedy has an impact on all people. We can always find things that we could have done better had we had another day to think about them. I am sure the Prime Minister would reflect on some things as well. As an Australian citizen, I congratulate him on the way he has conducted himself particularly in the last week. I also get the feeling that, since this tragedy, some of the real heat may have gone out of the Iraqi situation. I encourage the Prime Minister and those present here today to think about how we should conduct ourselves in the global community from now on. I look at this particular case, that of Iraq and other terrorist activities in the world in a fairly simplistic way. These individuals are no more than the old school bully who had very little regard for property or people, who picked on people when they were in unfortunate circumstances or when they were down, and who maintained that sort of guerilla terrorist tactic in the playground. One way of getting rid of that problem is for the whole playground to turn around and say to the bully, ‘We do not want this activity happening in our playground.’ This is what we have to do here. To be successful-and I think there can be a successful campaign against terrorismit is going to have to involve all the nations of the world, not just one, two, three or four. If we go in with just the United States-and I understand all the implications of our friendship with the United States et cetera-as two countries, that will defeat the purpose of what we are trying to achieve. If any good can come out of the Bali bombings, it may well be that Australia and our near neighbours in South-East Asia come together in a closer sense of commonality to defeat these extremist terrorist groups. If we can do that with our near neighbours and encourage that sort of participation through the United Nations, I think there is a way of eradicating these terrorists from the surface of the earth. SoI would encourage the Prime Minister to think carefully before committing our young people to any sort of ground war in Iraq. There are other ways of coming to grips with the problem. Obviously we have to deal with terrorism; we cannot just let the bully run around the playground forever. If we can get all the kids in the class to turn around and face him, I think the weight of numbers will have a dramatic effect. One final thing: I know that this is not the first time this has been suggested, but obviously Australia will be doing something in the form of a memorial in Bali to recognise not only the Australians but also the others who died in this particular tragedy. A constituent of mine, Ms Fiona Taber of Armidale, has written to me-and I have actually written to the Prime Minister-suggesting that, rather than some grand monument, Australia’s contribution should be by way of medical facilities and a hospital, so that there can be a lasting recognition of the destruction that took place and of the tragedy that occurred. It would also encapsulate Australia’s health facilities and deliver some health care to the Balinese for the future. I think that would be the sort of epitaph that a lot of the young people who died would prefer to see. It would be a lasting contribution and it would send a number of other very positive signals in terms of the way that Australians feel about the Balinese and South-East Asia generally. SoI would encourage the Prime Minister to take that suggestion on board; I know others have Wednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8557 suggested similar things. I think it would be appropriate that the recognition that Australia gives to this particular tragedy be in the form of some sort of health care facility. the tragedy surrounding the Bali bombings. I do not have any scripted remarks; I would just like to take a few minutes to express, on behalf of all the people of Aston, my outrage at and condemnation of the most barbaric terrorist bombings that we have ever known in this region of the world. I join all the other members of this parliament in supporting the motion put forward in the House by the Prime Minister. I cannot begin to know what the families and friends of those who were so sadly and so suddenly lost on 12 October are feeling. Certainly, as a father, I can only imagine the deep distress that one would go through after being informed that your children-or your partner, your friends or your parents-had been taken from you. It is a tragedy that many members have spoken very eloquently about, and that leads you to wonder what on earth you can take out of such a terrible event. There is something-there is a message that we can take out of these Bali bombings. In my view, it brings home to us the need for each and every one of us to each and every day cuddle our kids and our partners and embrace our friends. It is important to do that and to enjoy the time that you have with your children, your partner and of course your friends, because they are treasured times in our lives. Many people have gone to extraordinary lengths to try to help in this tragedy. We have heard a lot about them. On behalf of the people of Aston, I particularly thank all of the doctors, nurses, ambulance officers, volunteers and people who have come forward to help counsel the people who are suffering-all those people who have helped in one way or another. I thank members of the Defence Force, who have worked extraordinarily hard to help; members of the various police forces, both those that have gone to Bali to be on location and those working back here; and staff of the airlines that have assisted in one way or another. I especially thank members of the various government departments, particularly the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. On the Sunday after the bombing, I called in to the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and found a large complement of his team on hand working flat out trying to help people. I also thank the members of many churches and many different types of organisations which have, since 12 October, in one way or another, stepped forward to help every person they could who has been affected in whatever way through this tragedy. In the case of my electorate of Aston, I regrettably inform the House that four constituents have been affected very closely and deeply by this tragedy. There are Leanne Woodgate and Samantha Woodgate of Lysterfield, two young and beautiful women who are today still suffering in hospital. There is Lynley Huegenin, 22, of Wantirna, who remains in hospital and is still suffering. There is also Natalie Goold, of Ferntree Gully, who was expected to return to her home from hospital yesterday. I also particularly place on record my deepest sympathy for the family of Jessica O’Donnell. She is not a direct constituent; she is a constituent of the neighbouring electorate of La Trobe. However, my staff and I have spent a lot of time working with the member for La Trobe to assist her parents in each and every way that we possibly could. It is important that we as a nation do everything possible to ensure that such a tragedy is never repeated. The government, together with the opposition, has put in place a range of programs and initiatives that will work towards eradicating any future incident like the Bali",157,Representatives Main Committee
294,Mr Pearce (Aston) (12.07 P.m.),"I rise today in this chamber to offer my remarks on8558 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 bombings. But if we look to the future, we have to bear in mind the need for each and every Australian-in fact, each and every person in this region of our world-to work together to strive for peace and harmony in our nation, in our region and across the world. I have been reminded of some comments that were made by our Prime Minister in May 2001 during the events marking the centenary of our federation. The Prime Minister said: We have built in this nation of ours a society of which we can all be justly proud, a society to which people from all around the world have contributed, a society which is a model of cohesion, compassion and decency and one in which we should express undiminished faith and hope for the next 100 years. I cannot think of any more apt words than to say that in these times we should indeed express undiminished faith in ensuring that, as a nation, we go forward and work to have cohesion, to have compassion and to be decent in each and everything that we do. My heart-and, I know, the hearts of all the people of Aston-goes out to all of those people who have lost their loved ones. It is a tragedy and it is something the full breadth of which we as a nation are still coming to terms with. Since 12 October, we have seen extensive media coverage of this outrage. I join my colleagues in thanking those in the media for keeping the Australian public informed about this tragedy. However, I make the point that, while we have had a dreadful tragedy and we have had thorough and complete coverage of this tragic event, it seems to me that, if we are talking about what sort of society we want to live in, what sort of culture we want to bring to our children, to their children and to future generations, it is important to think about other ways of doing things. It reveals to me that in the future as a society we should stress more and more the positive things that happen in our lives, in our nation and in our world. It should not be only tragedies that get page after page of coverage. One of the best ways to beat these criminals is to keep revealing to them each and every day the good things that are happening. So the next time something great happens in our nation we should absolutely promote it. We should talk about it. We should talk about the positives of that great event, whatever it might be-a great cultural event, a great sporting event or a great environmental event. It seems to me that we need to emphasise and promote the positive things that happen in this country. We should show the people of Australia and of the world that we are a positive nation and that great things happen in our life. As I said at the beginning, the key message that comes out of this tragic event for me is the need to ensure that each and every day we cuddle our kids and our partners and we embrace our friends. We should do that. I say to all the people who have now moved to heaven the following words from the last verse of the letter of Paul to the Galatians: may the grace of our lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen. the House who have expressed their horror and disbelief and who have, more importantly, praised the people affected by the dreadful events on 12 October 2002. When mention is made in my electorate of what happened in New York on 11 September 2001 and in Bali on 12 October 2002 is, people say, ‘But we have lost so many people in other tragedies.’ I say to them, ‘In a case like this, innocent lives have been lost through an act of terrorism. This is not a war we are talking about; it is a terrorist act.’ That is why I believe that words have to be expressed continually so that we will not be ruled by these terrorists.",159,Representatives Main Committee

Fortunately, I have heard of no-one in my electorate who was in Bali or who lost a loved one but, needless to say, we are all Australians and that is why I also rise to speak on behalf of my electorate. I know that every one of my people-man, woman and child-who live within the Prospect electorate would want me to express in this parliament their absolute horror about what occurred and to tell those who are grieving that we feel for you, we understand what is happening to you and, most particularly, we will always remember you. I had a feeling of utter disbelief when news started to filter through about the tragedy. We can probably all describe what we were doing at that particular time. My first reaction, having a son who works throughout the Asian region, was absolute panic about where he was at that particular time. What was he doing? Was he on a plane? Was he in Indonesia, which he frequently travels to? I suppose in such a situation we all look inwards and work out first where the immediate members of our family are. So the first reaction I had was one of horror about what was happening. I then started to listen to every bit of news that became available. I was honestly in utter disbelief-it cannot be happening. Then, as more and more information came through, we realised these young people who had gone on holiday and these parents who had gone with friends to enjoy a break-all of those innocents who had been farewelled with such joy at the airport-would not come back. I know we have to move forward but in moving forward we must never, at any time, forget those who have been lost. At the same time we have to also acknowledge, as other members have done, the work done by those fine men and womenparticularly, as mentioned, those in the RAAF. The RAAF carried out what has now been described as the biggest peacetime medical airlift in Australia’s history. I say to them, ‘We are just so proud of you.’ To all of those wonderful people who are working behind the scenes even at this very moment caring for the injured and looking after the families who have lost their loved ones and those who have suffered such great loss, we thank you most sincerely. It would be impossible, even in the debate that we have had on this, to name every one of those people who have done so much. So, collectively, we say to those out there that we appreciate and are proud of what you have done. Most importantly, what you have done is help your fellow Australians. We can all judge after the event and we can also comment on what should or should not have been done, and I do not think a debate like this is the time for that. I was rather alarmed by what appeared in today’s Sydney Morning Herald. The headline was ‘Australians “intercepted” terrorist plot’ and read: Australian intelligence eavesdropped on radical Muslim extremists discussing attacks on Australian citizens in the weeks before the Bali terrorist bombing, according to a report published in the United States. It goes on to describe what is happening-and everyone can get the report and read it. We, as members of parliament, know that we cannot expect our foreign affairs minister to stand up in the House and talk about security, nor can we expect our Minister for Defence to do the same. But I was rather disturbed last night when the Minister for Defence on Lateline virtually stated that he was aware that the JI group, the Jemaah Islamiah group, are in Australia. If that 8560 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 is the case, I am pleased that we are going to have emergency legislation go through today to make sure that we take action against groups such as this in this country. This alone should be prompting us to have a full investigation into what could be the concerns of many individuals around this nation. If there is any inkling of a doubt in anyone’s mind that information was available and it was not broadcast or that information was available that was of insufficient note to broadcast, then let us clear the air. Let us have a full and open inquiry into it. I know there are investigations going on and I know they will continue for a long time to come. But I know all of those people who have lost a loved one and all those people sitting next to their family members who are going through great suffering are asking, ‘Why?’ We join them in asking, ‘Why?’ I think each one of us, on both sides of the House without making a political issue about it, would like to request an investigation that is so broad that it does cover every area of doubt. If information was out there and we were not informed about it then we need to know. If information was out there and it was only scurrilous like some of the rumours that are now being reported in the media, then we need to know that as well. We as parliamentarians are here not only to defend our nation and to speak for our Australian people but also to provide some security and protection in the future, and you can only do that if you acknowledge mistakes that have happened in the past. If you acknowledge that certain steps may have been taken or should have been taken but were not taken, then let us act on those. I do not think we have to hide from that. I do not think we have to stand up and say, ‘We weren’t certain but there could have been.’ I do not want to ever see that in the future. We do not need another tragedy to have our minds focused on what we should be doing as a nation. We do not need another great loss of life and have us saying, ‘We need more interception to get rid of these terrorists.’ As previous speakers have said, we have to fight unitedly to rid the world of the terrorists. We have to do it in this country in particular and we have to be aware that we are not immune from it. In fact, I borrowed from my colleague the latest Time. In the edition of 28 October there was an interesting article-and we have all read them-quoting Ross Babbage, who is a leading strategy expert at the ANU, as saying: We’re not used to thinking about these sorts of threats in Australia, and for good reason-we have been immune. But the world is different now, and so is terrorism. We have to remember as the world changes that we are a continent removed at times, we think, from the rest of the world, but we are no longer immune. We have feelings, we have lost lives and we have had loved ones taken from us quite unexpectedly, not through tragedy or accident, but through a deliberate act. In future we will have to be mindful and aware that things like this must not be allowed to happen. At the same time, I know we cannot stop our lives. We cannot stop what we choose and wish to do, but we must at all times be protective of those who could be placed in danger. I call on the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence to make sure that we have the expertise in this nation-we know we do-to ensure that everything possible is provided to those experts so that they can carry out a full and thorough investigation, not only to protect those who have lost family members but also to protect future generations, and to ensure that as a nation we never again have to go through this grieving period. I know other events will occur. I keep thinking of the tragic train disaster in Granville in 1977, near my own electorate, and the number of lives lost there. Even though it Wednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8561 was a loss, its effect was quite different from the way a loss such as this affects you-an act that you know was deliberately done by terrorists. That is why we should do everything we can on both sides of the House. The government have the direction, the means and the money to provide to our experts so that they can get on with the job and make sure that that investigation is thorough and open and that in the future we will know that we have truly learned from past mistakes. Let not the loss of life in Bali-not only Australian lives but also the Balinese and all of the other people who lost their lives-be in vain. Many people have quoted different texts. As I tried to comfort a person just the other day one came to mind. It was, Without Goodbye: ‘Without goodbye you went to sleep and loving memories are ours to keep. But we pledge that we will make sure that those who did this are brought to justice.’ tion and commend him and the leadership team for the exceptional handling of this tragedy. Much has already been said by fellow members about the despicable terrorist act in Bali. It was an atrocious act that destroyed the lives of so many and one that will continue to wreak much pain and trauma in the months and even years ahead. Much has been said about how it has affected the people who live in our own electorates-their pain, loss and suffering. Like it or not, we have been thrown into a war against an invisible enemy. We are now in deep uncharted territory. It is an unfamiliar world that we now live in. We must all remain vigilant because, make no mistake, that fanatic-driven war is now on our doorstep. It is even more important now that we maintain our vigilance on border protection. History has taught us there is a distinctively Australian spirit which stands tall in the face of any enemy. Over the years we have seen it in all its glory, time and time again, both in war and in peace. It is an inner strength we can depend on and be assured by. It will unite us against this unholy terror. We know we can depend on it because we saw the same spirit again in Bali from the young and the not so young. It shone through the devastation in spontaneous acts of courage by people who did not stop to ask why-they just did what they had to do. Tara Edwards, a 23-year-old young lady from my electorate of Dobell on the Central Coast, had been working in Bali as a teacher. On the night of the terrible tragedy she had walked past the two nightclubs minutes before the deafening blast filled the air around her. Despite the shock and the sound of the explosion still ringing in her ears, she and her Welsh friend Emma Cort immediately returned to the scene. Without any thought for their own safety they did whatever they could to help. They calmed the injured, cleaned the hospital rooms and tried to help people find their friends and relatives. For two nights until dawn they worked in the hospital morgue, confronted by scenes of human carnage like nothing you would think could exist on this earth. When asked how distressing it was, Tara Edwards is reported to have said, ‘We had no time to think about the horror. We had to do it. There was no-one else there.’ There are many others who, at the time of the attack and during the days that followed, personified the brave Australian spirit. There are the survivors who stayed to help the injured, and those who tried to find those who were missing. There are the friends and relatives who frantically searched for, and who linger there with the fading hope of finding, their loved ones. There are the medical teams and the RAAF who raced to the scene of the devastation and made sure that within 48 hours all the injured Australians were safely back home. I had the privilege of spending a week at the RAAF base in Richmond. During that week, the medi-",160,Representatives Main Committee

I congratulate the people at RAAF Richmond because the exercises that they carry out regularly can be put into practice quite quickly. There are the people lying in hospitals around the country who, despite their trauma, must carry their shocking pain with dignity, and those who will rise against their injuries as they bravely face the days ahead. Then there are the mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, friends and relatives throughout Australia who are struggling to come to terms with their grief but who will also catch the spirit and somehow find the courage to overcome their tragic losses. It is a sad time in Australia’s history, but it is a time that will eventually allow us to move forward to a better place because, as we know, we can rely on the tried and tested character, that source of unlimited strength, that unique Australian spirit. For the present my thoughts are going beyond my own electorate to the people of Forbes, a country town in New South Wales. It is the place where I was born; a place of innocence and fond memories that I still hold dear; a familiar place where I spent some of my youth-certainly long before this terrible tragedy took the lives of three of its young men, innocent men who, in a distant country, tragically and unknowingly found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. There are others from Forbes who remain missing and injured. My deepest sympathies are not only with them and their families and the people of Forbes, but also with those people of my own electorate of Dobell who are suffering from this tragedy. While I want to share their pain and to carry some of their load, in reality, in my humble inadequacy, the best that I can do is to wish them all the strength of that Australian spirit, as much inner strength as they will need to overcome their heartache, their pain, their grief and their loss. God bless Australia. colleagues, the Prime Minister’s motion on the terrorist bombings in Bali. On 12 October the world witnessed, once again, a despicable act of hatred and violent murder of innocent people-this time mostly young and mostly Australians. We grieved along with the rest of the world as we lost Australians on 11 September 2001, but this act has touched us as I suspect no act of terror has ever touched Australia and Australians. Bali was almost like another Australian state or city in our expectations of holiday time. On that night, those clubs that were destroyed by the frightening bombs were full of mostly young-some older-Australians and people from dozens of other countries around the world. The loss of life is appalling. In any sense, it is perhaps even more appalling because of its totally unexpected nature. The fact that terrorists went out of their way to attack tourists was, I have to say, a cowardly act. We do not know what kind of terrorists struck those nightclubs in Bali. We do not know whether they were religious, ethnic or territorial terrorists. There are a number of kinds throughout the world today and there have been for some years past, but it seems to me, rightly or wrongly, that the incidence of terrorism is escalating rapidly and frighteningly. We cannot possibly know at this point in time why those evil people did that evil act. I hope that, with all the assistance that is in Bali now-from Australia, the United States, Britain and other countries-to help the Indonesian authorities, we will be able to find who initiated those actions, who drove the vehicles, who made the bombs and who created the carnage, because we must bring them to justice.",163,Representatives Main Committee
297,Mr Charles (La Trobe) (12.33 P.m.),"I rise this afternoon to support, as have all myWednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8563 In order for us to be able to have finality, we must do everything possible to identify the remains so that the families and loved ones can come to an end of their grieving. We fear terror, but we cannot run away from terror. History has shown us over and over again that, if we run away, the terrorists are only emboldened by their own actions and they create further terror. We cannot run away. We cannot hide. If you run from bullies, they only become more bullying. As the Prime Minister said, we cannot roll up into a little ball and hope it will go away. We have to root out the terrorists and we have to bring a close to this time in history which is so frightening and so despicable. The thing that has touched us more than anything from 12 October is the fact that the majority of the people in those nightclubs were young people just having fun-innocent young people just out to have a good time. My goodness, if we cannot go about our lives expecting to have a bit of fun every once in a while without having to look over our shoulder every five seconds to see what is coming down the pipe, we will have very sheltered, very uninteresting and very frightening lives. It was, as many have said, a loss of innocence for Australia. I thought, in my naivety, that Port Arthur represented a serious loss of innocence. It did, but Port Arthur was a single act by a single madman. Cyclone Tracy in Darwin was absolutely frightening, and the devastation to Darwin was almost beyond description; the loss of life there touched all of us, as it did in the Newcastle earthquake and the Hoddle Street murders. But, despite the loss of life and the hurt, anguish and anger, somehow Bali was different-different I think because these were young people on holiday. There were some parents and some older people, but they were mostly young people on holiday, just having fun. Unnamed people purposely came and took their lives and then ran away. In the aftermath of that fireball, Australians demonstrated, both on the ground during the devastation and continuing later, the thing that we call mateship, and they demonstrated it in great measure. Australian mateship has once again survived tragedy, as I am sure it will do again and again in the future. We believe in doing all we can to help those who are in trouble. May I say in winding up that I send my condolences to the families, friends, loved ones and acquaintances of all those who have been touched by this thing, either because they have been killed or injured or frightened in the attack or traumatised throughout or after the ordeal. It is in the nature of human beings that some of those who have gone through this ordeal will never recover; their lives will be touched forever. Some will go through a period of pain and grieving and will move on; they will get on with their lives. We must have the greatest feeling and the greatest regard for them all and offer our greatest condolences to all of them. motion today and to say that, in my case, when I heard the announcement it was with a sense of disbelief. It very closely paralleled 11 September, when we switched on our television sets and radios long into the night. I remember my wife waking me up and saying, ‘I think you should listen to this.’ At first you thought you were watching some outrageous American movie, but all of a sudden it dawned on you that it was real. That same sense of disbelief wafted across me this time; and then, as the reports kept coming in, the absolute enormity of the event came into comprehension. How anyone in such a cold, calculated and heinous way could set out to so wantonly and cruelly kill 180 of their fellow human beings simply defies belief. That one explosion could",164,Representatives Main Committee

The breadth of the tragedy is reflected in the 180 lives that were lost. That 90 Australians were killed fills us with grief and a sense of infinite sadness. As the member for La Trobe has just said, that young people going about their holiday experience in such an innocent and unobtrusive way, or groups of footballers celebrating the end of their season, could have been cut down in those circumstances again elevates our reaction to one of outrage. Then we had the acts of heroism. They came to fill us with pride and admiration and the certainty that the Australian spirit is truly alive and well: people helping others over the wall or through holes; people who had left the club earlier coming back and going inside to pull their friends out-friends returning shows, to me, a great sense of courage-and doctors who were there on holidays immediately making themselves available at the various hospitals. Then there was the magnificent work of the RAAF in getting emergency personnel to Bali and taking out the wounded. The fact that that exercise was completed in 48 hours should again fill us with a sense of pride and admiration. On behalf of my family and my electorate of Hinkler, I extend sympathy to those who lost family and loved ones. A special place in our hearts must be reserved for the families who are still in Bali or back in Australia waiting for identification and the ability to repatriate their loved ones’ bodies to Australia. That must be a horrific circumstance. I can empathise with that because not quite 2½ years ago in my own electorate we had the horrific Childers backpacker fire at the Palace Hotel. In the early hours after that happened, even for the whole next day, we had no idea of how many people were in there-whether it was five, 15 or 50. I can well empathise with the frustration that the families of those involved in the Bali attack must be experiencing because I remember how long the identification took in the case of the Childers fire. It took over two weeks-and that was with only 15 people. When I say ‘only’ that belies the tragedy in a way when you compare it with this one. With the best of Australian and Queensland forensic experts right on the spot in Childers, it took over two weeks to identify the various victims. In fact, one victim still has not been identified two years on. So in Bali, with 90 Australians and another 90 international and Balinese people, you can just imagine what a horrific job this is going to be. I do empathise with those families. Fortunately, my electorate was spared any direct involvement, although in the electorates either side of mine-Capricornia and Wide Bay-people were affected by the tragedy. There was one tenuous link with my electorate: David Kent Jr, the son of David Kent Sr, from an English family that came to Gladstone some years ago, was killed in the tragedy. He was a man in his prime-41 years of age-still playing rugby. In his days in Gladstone he played in Central Queensland rugby union. He moved to Sydney and played for the Randwick club. He relocated to the Gold Coast. In fact, he was in Bali on a Singaporean rugby union tour. A cruel stroke of fate saw him there with those footballers at that time. I do extend my deepest sympathy to the Kent family, who live in my electorate. Two things said this week at various functions in this parliament resonate with me. The first is that everyone thinks that by feeding the tiger the tiger will eat him last. Churchill used this during the Second World War, and I think it applies very much to the sort of atmosphere we live in today. We should not think that this wave of brutal terrorism is just going to somehow sweep across Australia and leave us alone. The other statement-repeated by the memWednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8565 ber for Griffith at the prayer breakfast on Monday morning-which also resonates very much with me and is one that I have used very often in debating in the past but which really came home to me with a vengeance in this last week is: All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing. Again, you can see a message there for us that we need not think that by rolling ourselves into a small ball, as the Prime Minister said, we are going to escape this dreadful horror. We need to confront it, and we need to eliminate it once and for all. There are other things I would like to say about this event but, in deference to my colleagues, I will not. I extend my sympathy to the families, especially to the families who are still waiting for that dreadful identification process to be completed. I salute those who acted with such bravery. I salute the medical teams that are still working against tremendous odds to save some of those who have survived. I trust that, although this is etched in our psyche as one of the seminal events of our history, good will come out of this and we will emerge as a stronger nation. Minister’s motion. Like most members who have spoken before me, the events in Bali have hit all of us as parliamentarians hard. It has certainly made us look at our role as members of parliament in a new light. I trust that this ongoing reflection will continue to make us react in the way that we have in the last few days. I offer my condolences to the families of all those who have died in the Bali bombing. My prayers and thoughts go to the parents who are still waiting for loved ones to be identified. I have two young girls missing from my electorate: Rebecca Cartledge and Jessica O’Donnell. Their photographs have been on the front page of the newspapers in Victoria on a number of occasions. We have seen their bubbly faces and their youthfulness in the swimming pool in Bali with some friends enjoying a moment of relaxation and humour. Their parents are going through incredible turmoil at the moment-a turmoil which we can only imagine. Like a lot of young people, these girls would have gone to Bali with great expectation. They would have been saving their money and planning for their holiday for a long time. They would have arrived at the airport with great anticipation of a good time to be had. Jessica and Rebecca, who shared a house in Blackburn, went to Bali together as friends, and as friends they are now missing. I have spoken to Rebecca’s parents, who live in my electorate, a number of times. Jessica’s parents do not live in my electorate. Rebecca’s parents have welcomed the small gesture that members of parliament have made in contacting parents. It was a distressing time for the parents last week. Not only were the girls listed as missing; the Herald Sun had them as dead. This would have been very distressing. One has to appreciate that, in a situation like this, parents hold on to any remaining glimmer of hope of finding their loved ones alive and well. Wayne Cartledge, Rebecca’s father, flew to Bali with DNA samples and a photo. The flight to Bali must have been one of incredible pain. While he was in Bali, he met with the Prime Minister. I know that he was very grateful to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition for meeting with him and giving their time. There is no doubt that prior to Bali there was an overwhelming concern in the community about a US-led pre-emptive military strike in Iraq-a concern that a lot of my constituents shared. We cannot view the events of September 11, the Bali bombings of October 12 and the atrocities occurring in Iraq separately. Whilst the connections are difficult to substantiate,",165,Representatives Main Committee
299,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (12.50 P.m.),"It saddens me to rise today to support the Prime8566 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 there is one aspect that binds the al-Qaeda network and the Iraqi dictator-terrorism. That terrorism is also now being spread by other terrorist organisations throughout the world. In our particular part of the world, the link has been made to the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist organisation; otherwise known as JI. If nothing else, the very freedoms that we enjoy were not only threatened on September 11 but brought home to us on October 12 in Bali. As I have said in the past, Australia cannot, on some issues, claim to be part of a global society and, on others, retreat to create a Fortress Australia. To assume that by putting our head in the sand we are immune from terrorism is to deny totally historical evidence. Innocent civilians from New Zealand, England, Germany, Sweden and a number of other European nations lost their lives in the Bali bombing. Only recently we had the murder of innocent Westerners and non-Muslims in places such as Tunisia, Nairobi and Helsinki, and of course we had that attack on a French ship-to name but a few incidents. You cannot try and buy protection from terrorists by ignoring them. It just does not work. You cannot simply say that the bombing in Bali was due to our hitching our bandwagon to the US effort. That really defies the evidence from around the world about where these terrorists are willing to strike. Fanaticism fuelled by ideological or religious fundamentalism is an important factor to be considered in this. The enemy of fanatical fundamentalist Muslims is not Australia but all Westerners. I know that there will be some in Australia who are probably questioning at this stage whether or not we should continue having a Muslim immigration intake. I say to those people that it is not the Muslims who are the enemies but it is certainly the fundamentalists who are the enemies. ‘Terrorism’ is another word for mass murder. The expectation is that governments will act against murderers, and this will be no exception. Inaction on this very difficult issue erodes all we have fought for in the past and what we stand for as a nation today. Australia is coming up very soon to its season of festivities. There will be various sporting activities and outdoor celebrations. We are now required, as a result of what took place in Bali, to have a heightened sense of vigilance. Whether we are attending the Melbourne Cup, the Ashes series, the tennis or even a family barbecue or making a visit to the beach, our innocence is forever lost as a result of the Bali bombings. My prayers are with the missing. My prayers and my thoughts go out to the Cartledge and O’Donnell families and they go out to all those families who are still waiting by the phone for that phone call from DFAT to say that they have identified their missing loved ones. My prayers are for the family and friends who have lost someone and are now coming to grips with life without their loved ones. We are all there united in our support for the Australian families. We, as members of parliament, owe it to them to be vigilant against terrorism in our region and elsewhere by taking action as a government. and Community Services) (12.57 p.m.)-The mind of the government is concentrated on four matters of pressing urgency. The first is the identification and return of the remains of Australian citizens in Bali. The second is the restoration to health of the injured-all now repatriated to Australian hospitals. I want to particularly acknowledge the generosity of the pharmaceutical industry-companies in my own electorate such as Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Baxter Healthcare responded immediately to the crisis. Charlie Bonnici from Baxter Healthcare rang me in Canberra on Sunday to say that Baxter’s expertise in intravenous solutions would be made imme-",167,Representatives Main Committee

I see that Eli Lilly has contributed almost $10,000 worth of supplies to help treat sepsis and bloodpoisoning and that Pfizer has likewise launched a Red Cross Bali appeal matching staff contributions along with the donation of medical consumable supplies. The third immediate objective is the capture and punishment of the criminals responsible for these acts. Finally, we are engaged in assisting the families of the victims and indeed a grieving nation in a process of mourning. Last Sunday there was a national day of mourning and tomorrow, here in the Great Hall of the parliament, there will be a service involving the families of the victims. However, when the immediate challenges of this great tragedy have passed, we will turn our minds more and more to the causes of terrorism and to the character of Australia’s participation in the global response to terrorism. I want to direct my remarks to the question of how we, not so much as a government but as a people, as a nation, as a culture, respond to the threat of terrorism. I begin with the object of the terrorists which, as the word implies, is to threaten, to intimidate, to destroy the quality of life which grows from the normally unquestioned trust between two unrelated citizens. This experience is causing us to hold in relief the value of this precious commodity of trust between citizens, this feeling that the price of civilisation is a submission of human beings to certain conventions of courtesy and to the rule of law, conventions like a willingness to submit disputes to an independent third party, giving up the tribal and barbaric instinct that one feels in the basal part of human nature to take the law into one’s own hands and to wreak revenge in response to injustice. Civilisation involves rising above those barbaric instincts which lie below the veneer of humanity. I want to call on the best and highest instincts in the Australian people. I ask them not to give the terrorists the satisfaction of seeing us stoop to their level. I note that Martin Luther King Jr, in his great speech at Montgomery, when he was talking to his followers in the black civil rights movement-when blacks were being hauled out of their homes and strung up in trees, without trial, to chanting and cheering mobs-said to the crowd, ‘Let no man pull you so low as to make you hate him.’ As we reflect on the barbarity of these terrorists-the inhumanity and cowardice of a human being who would attack a civilian in peacetime, who would kill dozens of our citizens without notice, without warning, without declaration of war-that kind of cowardice can draw out the instinct of hatred and revenge in us for the sort of fear it can provoke. Inevitably, our hearts go out to the family members of those at Monash university who are trying to make sense of a senseless act of violence. I am appealing to us to draw on the very best in our character. I do not want to see us go through a knee-jerk reaction of, for example, turning Parliament House into a bunker. I do not want to see us installing layer upon layer of security in areas of Australian life in which our citizens have come and gone freely without concern, without suspicion and without check. I want us to retain that sort of happy, phlegmatic character which is the archetype of what it means to be Australian now and certainly has meant in European Australia over the last two centuries. AndI want to say that it is perhaps an unsettling truth-but, nonetheless, I believe a truth-that the Indonesian government today has a greater capacity to secure Australian citizens against future acts of terrorism than does the Australian government. While we bring to bear the diplomatic machinery of government, it is not in our interests to browbeat, to bully or to seek to force the Indonesian government into action. Over the next 8568 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 October 2002 generation we have to recruit the goodwill of the Indonesian people to commit themselves to attack terrorism with diligence, determination and commitment, in part out of their friendship with the Australian people. In spite of the deep sense of frustration that Australians may feel at the previous lack of intent inside the Indonesian administration to tackle this problem, it is my hope that we will continue to nurture, foster and strengthen that relationship on the basis of goodwill, friendship and, as much as possible, shared values. As we think about security at home and how we respond to these threats of violence against civilians in peacetime, the court of equity, by analogy, is responsible for establishing the standard of negligence in commercial disputes. Some centuries ago the court determined that no-one would be held accountable for negligence who was subject to fraud by another party or was subject to a deliberate act of dishonesty. The logic of the court was that the whole of our economy functions on an assumption of trust and that if, in our policy, we remove the assumption of trust as the basis for human relationships-the assumption of trust that one person will repay their debts; that if they make a promise, they will fulfil it-then the whole system will come to a grinding halt. In the same way we ought not to hope or wish for an Australia that is not capable of protecting itself against a malevolent malcontent who wishes to kill people in times of peace, nor do we want to live in a police state. We do not want to live in a constant high-security environment. We want to live in an open, trusting, laid back country which opens itself to the rest of the world, which engages with those who are different from us, which looks for the best in others and which draws on the best in ourselves. This is the character of the Australian people. It is our gift to the world. While Australia may have been changed by Bali, I hope it has not been changed too much. (1.07 p.m.)-I echo all the words of my colleagues today in standing here to say that in peacetime this was the most terrible thing that has happened to Australia and has come as a shock to the entire community. My special thoughts today are with those relatives of people in Bali who are now missing. Many of them have been confirmed dead and many of them are presumed dead. My thoughts are also with those families who really do not know where their loved ones are. They may have had children travelling in Bali and have not heard from them since the accident. They still could be alive in Bali and unable, because of lack of communications, even to know about the event, but they certainly have not called home. So my thoughts are with those families who wait by the phone hoping to get some news. Australia’s immediate response to the tragedy was immense shock that a place of holiday and recreation for Australians and many other nationalities could be a point of terror. Our first priority was to get Australians there to assist the Indonesians in what for them was a horrendous task in an area that had only previously been known as a holiday destination. We immediately sent people from the Australian Federal Police, naturally from Foreign Affairs, from Defence as well as from other organisations who could assist. Our first priority, having reached Bali, was to repatriate the injured to Australia to give them every chance in the hospitals in Australia. In total, the number of injured repatriated was 113 Australians and 19 foreign nationals. Unfortunately, subsequent to that, several of those people who were very badly burned have died in Australian hospitals.",168,Representatives Main Committee
301,Mrs Gallus (Hindmarsh,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs)Wednesday, 23 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 8569 A second immediate priority was to secure the site, which I understand had not been secured prior to the Australians arriving. Then we had the task of identifying the bodies. You can imagine the absolute grief of the families who rushed to Bali and those who were able to identify the bodies of their loved ones but were not able to bring them home. That is one of the more difficult things that they had to face. But we understand that we are obliged, as are the Indonesians, to go through the proper process. There were, unfortunately, instances where people were wrongly identified. Because of that danger, we have insisted that we go with the approved process, which is to have a definite one of three: the dental records, the DNA or the fingerprints. The dental records can sometimes be enough without dental X-rays. However, you have to have at least four items listed on the dental record of changes to the mouth and teeth for that to even start to be useful, so in many cases the X-rays are needed. The process is that this information has to be collected from relatives in Australia, which is extremely painful for them. That then has to be coordinated within Canberra by the AFP, and that coordination is not easy; there are 60 pages of material. Frequently, the dental records they receive from local family dentists are not sufficient. The family dentist does not have the expertise they need to fill that out. That has to be checked by experts either in Bali or here to make sure that the information is accurate. That material has to be processed. Material able to be scanned is scanned into computers and sent to Bali. But, where dental X-rays are received, they have to be sent by hand; you cannot take copies. When you are relying on DNA, the analysis can take from three days up to months. That can be a very slow process. Where you have bodies that are identified, you really want to try to match up the ante-mortem and the post-mortem information so that these bodies can come home as quickly as possible. We are hopeful that in the next few days we will have a large number of Australians repatriated. However, it is a long process. I can understand the grief of the families who are waiting for the bodies of their loved ones to be returned home. The Australian government has facilitated families to go to Bali to help in identification or just to be there to see what they can do for their relatives. The government has also paid for accommodation and travel, and in Australia it is assisting families to come to Parliament House tomorrow for the memorial service. That will be a day of intense grief for all of us as we share in this very difficult time for the families. The service is for not only the families but all of us here in Australia. Our thoughts go out to the families. I want to also emphasise that we are doing everything we possibly can to get home those people who unfortunately died in Bali and to complete the identification of those who unfortunately are very hard to identify. Our thoughts are also with those families who have realised that they will never have their loved ones returned to them because where they were in the Sari nightclub was so close to the blast that they would have taken the full impact. For those families, and I have talked to all of them, there is an understanding that at least their loved ones died at a time when they were enjoying themselves and were happy and that it was all very quick. Certainly the majority of them did not have to suffer. Although that is of little comfort, it certainly is of some comfort. TodayI would certainly endorse the motion of the Prime Minister and say that we in Australia are determined that the people who are in any way associated with this atrocity, who in any way helped bring it about, will be brought to justice-the full force of international justice. Debate (on motion by Ms Julie Bishop) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 1.16 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Defence Industries: Sale (Question No. 679) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Further to the answers to parts (2), (6) and (7) to question No. 394, did the Minister consult with the Minister for Defence prior to the sale of all shares in Australian Defence Industries (ADI) to Transfield Thompson-CSF Investments Pty Limited with respect to those matters raised in those parts; if so, (a) when and (b) what was the advice of the Minister of Defence prior to the sale of the former share assets of ADI; if no why not. (2) Further to the answer to part (4) of question No. 397, is he able to say who (a) are the top ten shareholders and (b) has a controlling interest, being a person holding fifteen percent or more shares, in (i) Transfield Thompson-CSF Investments Pty Limited, (ii) Transfield Holdings Pty Limited and (iii) Thompson-CSF group known as “Thales”. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The former Minster for Finance and Administration and the then Minister for Defence were jointly responsible for the sale of ADI Limited with the Minister for Defence having primary carriage of Defence issues. Ministers consulted at key stages in the ADI sale process. Those matters raised in parts 2, 6 and 7 of Question No. 394 were considered in the context of the ADI sale process and fall under the portfolio responsibility of the Minister for Defence. (2) No. While there is some publicly available information on the shareholding of the entities in this part of the Question, the Portfolio does not maintain current information on the shareholdings of those entities. Attorney-General’s: Staffing (Question No. 766) (1) Has the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) been recognised for its efforts to assist staff to balance the demands of work and family life. (2) What was the nature of the award and what policies and practices have been implemented by the AGS which led to the award. (1) Yes in April 2002. (2) AGS participated in a work/life initiatives survey conducted by Managing Work/Life Balance, a firm specialising in this field. The aim of the survey, which has been conducted in conjunction with publishing house, CCH Australia, for five years, is to identify what progress has been made in the implementation of work/life and diversity strategies within Australian organisations. The survey is open to all organisations in Australia and allows them to benchmark their work/life initiatives against other organisations. AGS was surveyed about the progress that it had made in developing work/life initiatives, its future intentions in this area and the likely impact of those intentions. AGS was ranked 20th out of the 195 organisations surveyed. This was the first time AGS had participated in the survey. The following work/life policies and practices which have been implemented by AGS, were part of the survey’s considerations: flexible working hours part-time work working from home relocation assistance",170,Representatives Main Committee

Health and Ageing: Residential Aged Care Review (Question No. 949) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Ageing, upon notice, on 24 September 2002: Has he seen a report by Emma McDonald titled “Aged care: $7.2m cost of review questioned” on page 5 of The Canberra Times on 17 September 2002; if so, how (a) was the final total of $7.2 million determined and (b) does the Government propose the grant of $7.2 million be spent.",173,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice

308,Mr Andrews,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Yes, I have seen the report. $7.2 million has been provided over 2002-03 and 2003-04 to conduct a Review of the long-term financing options for the aged care sector and will take into account the improved care outcomes required from providers and underlying cost pressures faced by the sector. The importance and wide ranging nature of this Review is reflected in the level of funding that has been provided by the Government, which will ensure that the issues of critical concern to the sector and the community can be addressed. The money will be used to fund a number of studies that will provide the necessary expertise to examine the complex financing and structural issues that the Review will be examining. It will also allow the Review to travel to State and Territory capitals and several regional centres, as well as publish and distribute discussion papers. Professor Hogan has generously agreed to do the Review for a nominal fee of $55,200 per annum in line with the fees paid under Remuneration Tribunal arrangements for part-time holders of public office. The $7.2 million provided is considered an appropriate level of funding for such an important Review and represents less than 0.04 per cent of the total estimated appropriation for residential aged care over the budget and forward estimates period.",175,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
