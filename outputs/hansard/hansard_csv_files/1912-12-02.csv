When I hear our honourable jfriends opposite talking about the huge anonopolies, trusts, and combines that are ^growing up in Australia, I am disposed to -.remind them that in their own Labour manifesto, issued at the last general election, they did not seem to recognise that ihev had assumed the gigantic proportions -which they have since endeavoured to make --us and the country believe to be the case. ""Under the heading of "" Nationalization of -.monopolies,"" I find it statedIt may be admitted that trusts and combines -have not yet attained the same giant proportions in Australia as elsewhere, but, notwithstanding our youth, the capitalistic system is -developing here upon the same general lines. Already we have in Australia the Sugar Monopoly, the Tobacco Combine, the Coastal 'Shipping Ring, the Coal Vend, and various -«minor business combinations of a character detrimental to the public. In 1907 the Federal .Parliament passed an Act to restrain trusts and ""combines. we expressed our conviction that it would f a il -Jto effect its object. ""Then this document goes on to sayThe experience of America shows that nothing -short of nationalization'of these monopolies will prevent their exploitation of the public. I wish to point out in regard to what is generally referred to as the Anti-Trust Act which was passed by the Federal Parliament, that an attempt was persistently and successfully made by the members of the present Labour party to try to make the measure ineffective. Therefore any defects which have since developed in the working of the measure may Mr W. Elliot Johnson. be largely traceable to the anxiety of members of the Labour party themselves to prevent it reaching out to deal with trusts, combines, and monopolies in an effective manner. Many of those specifically mentioned in the manifesto were the subject party for exemption from the operation I they wished to exempt. The ex-Leader of to a statement of the honourable member I am quite with the honourable member that we should take care that nothing is done to prevent such legitimate combination amongst coal mine-owners as may be found necessary to enable them to get a fair profit on their capital invested, and to insure fair wages to their employees. Mr Watson also speaking on behalf of Mr S. E. O'Brien's candidature for North Sydney in opposition to the present member for that constituency said on the 4th March of the present yearHe did not object to the Coal Vend in so far as it meant the combining of the colliery proprietors to fix a fair price for coal, and do away with the cut-throat competition that ground down prices and wages. So that notwithstanding the denunciation which we have heard from the Attorney General and other honourable members opposite we have the ex-Leader of the Labour party supporting a candidate of that party in New South Wales approving of the Coal Vend. The honourable member for Newcastle, speaking in this House in 1906, as reported in Hansard, page 936, saidAt Newcastle miners have practically gone out on strike to get a general agreement with Although supporting that measure their proprietors, and incidentally to bring the proprietors into a combination. Again the honourable member saidI wish it to be clearly understood that the position at Newcastle ought not to be disturbed. BecauseI believe that to disturb an arrangement of that description would be to do something which would bring an injury, not merely upon the combination of proprietors, but upon alj the employees at their collieries. Here we have the honourable member for the district in which the Coal Vend flourishes making an appeal to exempt it from the operation of the anti-trust measure with which we were at the time dealing. In the same year, Senator Henderson, speaking on the Coal Vend, as reported in Hansard, page 627, saidIt has materially increased, not only its sellword to say for trusts and combines. As* ing price, which I candidly believe it was ena matter of fact, there is not a single titled to do, but also the wages paid to the men member of our party who has ever raised? engaged in producing the coal. The Coal Comhis voice in defence of any monopoly, trust, bine has done a very great service up to the present moment. Here we have a prominent member of the tation in covering up their own support by Labour party declaring that this Combine has been of great service to the workers. wrongfully accusing their opponents of What are we to understand when the membeing supporters of monopolies. Senator bers of the party opposite keep running saidwith the hare and hunting with the hounds, with one voice denouncing these trusts and combines, and with another voice testifying however, as to the benefits they have conferred upon is the time for the honourable senator to act, the workers? Continuing, Senator HenandI am sure he will always find me ready toderson saidFor years I have advocated just such a combination of the coal trade as exists in that State (New South Wales) to-day. . . . The Coal Combine of New South Wales has done, up to the present moment, a laudable work. It has already very materially increased the outnationalizing the coal industry if it were in the? put of New South Wales. increased its selling prices, which I candidly believe* it was entitled to do, but also the wages paid to the men who are producing the coal. Here we have a member of the party opposite rejoicing that the Coal Vend had increased the price of coal to the poor unfortunate workers who had to pay through the nose for it when buying it for the warming of their hearths in the depths of winter time. Senator Guthriea Labour senator -in the same debate, saidI can largely agree with what has just fallen from Senator Henderson. He illustrated his remarks by alluding to the history of cut-throat competition in the shipping business, and expressed his approval of the subsequent Shipping Combine. senator-in the same debate, saidIn season and out of season, it was pointed out that in the maritime carrying trade it was owing to suicidal competition that the steamship companies were unable to pay a decent living wage. they were very tardy in taking our advice. So that we have prominent representatives of the Labour party saying that the shipowners who combined did a good thing in forming the Shipping Ring, and they did it on the advice and with the support of Labour members, and even then they combined with appaient reluctance. Yet we have the same honourable members denouncing the trusts and combines which they have been instrumental in creating. They do not tell these things to the public outside. They would try to make the public believe that it is only wicked people on this side of the Chamber who have aor combine. In spite of this, honourable members opposite have not the slightest hesiMcGregor^ speaking on the same day,, Senator Findley ought to keep his mind easy,, and should not object to combines. When,, a combine becomes a monopoly, thenco-operate with him. Senator FINDLEY -What is the object of a. combine if it is not for the purpose of getting, a monopoly? Senator McGREGOR I ask the honourable senator whether there would be any chance of It has materially hands of small coal miners or master miners? Here we have disclosed the underlying reason why honourable members opposite desire such combines-wh y they do not wish* to see private enterprise developing in a small way with open competition, and thebenefit of reasonable prices to the consumer. Under the latter circumstances industries cannot be nationalized; and theidea is to encourage combines, and then form them into the greatest combine of alla Government combine-and shut out private enterprise altogether. We now seethe inner meaning of all the actions and expressions of the Labour party-the y all) radiate from different points to one centre,, which means Unification and nationalization. Then Mr Edden, when interviewed, Senator Lynch-anothe r Labour by representatives of the Sydney Dailytelegrafh in regard to the Coal Vend, om the 28th .February last, said:He thought that if the Vend were dissolved! it would be a most disastrous thing for the NewWe urged them to combine, and castle district. The Labour Government are asking for powers to deal with, amongst other things,, the Coal Vend, and yet we have State and! Federal Labour members all protesting, against any interference with it. Mr Edden went on to say :Any successful attempt made to smash up theVend would, under the circumstances, therefore^, in his opinion, be a terrible thing for the district. These are not my words; and I undertaketo say that if any honourable member on this side had expressed sentiments of the kdndi they would have been denounced from the house-tops from one end of Australia to the other; no trouble would have been too .great to show what wicked people we were in supporting and sheltering the huge monopolies for which Labour members have acknowledged they were primarily responsible. Yet we have Labour representatives, not only using emphatic language in defence of combines, buturging that legislation to suppress them will have disastrous effects on the Newcastle district. The Attorney-General himself, on the 3rd March last, is thus reported :Prices of half the things we ate, drank, and wear to-day were regulated by an arrangement ""between combines, trusts, and rings in the country . He did not condemn that. Honourable words:He had no criticism for it. It was an inevitable stage in industrial and social development. -""Rings, combines, and trusts were as much a -consequence of modern progression as man was really a development of the baby Rings, trusts, and combines were not all evil, and in some respects had been instruments of igood. Who would imagine that this is the same Attorney-General we listened to the other day on the second reading of this Bill? In an article under, the heading of "" The -Case for Labour,"" which the Attorney-General wrote for the Sydney Daily Telegraph, the following appears: It is not only illogical and unfair to complain About the trusts, it is also very foolish. For the trust is really a labour-saving device, and -the latest and most effective. The anti-Socialist who wants tp destroy trusts is like the old Luddites who wished to destroy machinery. -earlier trade unionist fell into the vulgar error -of regarding machinery as a device of the evil -one, which ought to be destroyed. -now learned better; they no longer seek to destroy machinery, but to control it. But the riuiti-Socialist is still a troglodyte in this matter. possible, as bad as the Sydney Morning He wants to club the trust. We are told that we on this side wish to "" club "" the trusts, and at the same time are twitted with being the supporters of -trusts. The Attorney-General goes on to -say:The trust or combine is not merely a labour saving device, and the best and latest at that, 'but it marks a notable epoch in the history of .production and civilization. . . . The central ideas of the combine are co-operation and sys-temization. . . . -chaos, and combination for the competition. It takes 'Cognisance of factor utterly ignored by -ihe old barbaric ways of cut-throat competition. These words were not spoken on the spur -of the moment, but written by the Attormey-,General after thoughtful consideration itr. W. Elliot Johnson. for publication in one of the leading news-papers in the country. No wonder that some of the Labour newspapers read these articles with amazement. No wonder that so outspoken and enthusiastic a Labour paper as the Barrier Miner came down heavily on the Attorney-General, and, in reference to the article I have quoted, said:-i If trusts, as he says, are such useful and altogether admirable institutions, being the stepping-stones, if not the very gates, to the paradise of that co-operative Commonwealth we all dream of if these things are so, then why on earth is Mr Hughes trying to smash the Coal Trust or Coal Vend at this particular moment? Well might the Barrier Miner ask that very pertinent questionIf trusts are such useful machines in premembers will mark those paring the way for the control of industry by the people, if they are "" a phase of industrial evolution, a triumph of co-operation over senseless competition, and so a step towards control of industrial enterprises directly by the people "" -se e Mr Hughes' letter-if trusts are so good as all this, why on earth is Mr Hughes trying to smash the Coal Vend that has kept up the wages of both miners and seamen whilst ""triumphing over competition""? Mr W. J. JOHNSON -The Barrier Miner is not a Labour paper, but a capitalistic organ.' not think that the Barrier Miner can be said to be a paper that favours the. side of the capitalist.

26,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"ApartCoal Vend?"" It did not spring into existence as the result of some secret capitalistic combination. It had its origin in a suggestion of the miners of Newcastle. From a report published in the Newcastle Morning Herald of 26th March, 1966, I extract the followingMr F. Livingstone Learmonth', representing the A.A. Co., and, in tbe absence of Mr Mr Curley, after endorsing the remarks of theKeightly, the Newcastle Coal Mining Co.; Mr chairman as to the market outlook and regretting: John Brown, representing Messrs. J. and A . 1 Brown; Mr A. Thomas, representing the East Greta Coal Mining Co. L t d . ; and Mr Morrow, rethere was a probability that results of a disaspresenting the Caledonian Co., were present at a meeting called at the instance of the Colliery Employes Federation to discuss the question of an increase in the hewing rate of coal. These companies are the owners of thirteen collieries, including some of the largest in the Newcastle and Maitland districts. ployes Federation was represented by Mr Peter Bowling, president; Mr James Curley, general secretary; Mr A. Lewis, district treasurer; and the other members of the committee of management, Messrs. J. Patterson, W. Brennan, W. Rees, J. McWilliams, S. Rees, A. Burns, and W. Wardell. Mr Bowling was elected chairman of the Conference. This was the Conference at which the Coal Vend was formed, and Mr Peter Bowling was its president. responsible for the creation of the Vend? tainly. The report goes on to say that in opening the Conference, explained that the reason for calling the Conference was because the Miners' Federation had decided to ask for an advance of 8d. per. ton. in the hewing rate. He explained that this demand was regarded as reasonable, in view of certain conditions and contingencies which would have a direct tendency to enhance prices at the port of Newcastle. Tbat is. to say it would have a tendency to increase prices to the users of coal during, the winter, and these users consisted largely of the class whom Mr Bowling and his associates were supposed to represent. Mr Curley, general secretary of the Miners' Association, after referring to the objects of the Conference, saidThe committee was there at the request of the miners working at the various collieries in the district. The men desired that the proprietors should be approached upon the subjects of an advance in the price of coal trade prices and an increase in the hewing rate . . . . This (the foreign, Inter-State, and Home trade) has a large market which the proprietors could to some extent control, in the way of preventing undue competition. By proper combination the same preventive measures might also be applied, to some extent to the. operations of foreign trade. Mr Curley, after endorsing the remarks ill the chairman as. to the market outlook, and regretting that there was not a larger attendance of proprietors As in the case of the Shipping Ring r the proprietors did not appear to be soeager to form this Vend as were the miners,, and they showed, their lack of interest in the proposal by their failure to attend thegathering. The report proceedsthat there was not a larger attendance of proprietors, said that unless conferences were held trous character might ensue at any time. Theproprietors themselves knew this. So that Mr Curley, Mr Peter Bowling and other omcers of the Miners' Associar tion actually urged the formation of this The Collieries EmVend, on the understanding that the miners themselves were to have a "" cut."" in. So long as they obtained their "" cut,"" it did not matter how much fhe public were fleeced. Apparently, according to some of our Labour Democrats, a combine, a monopoly, or a trust was a good thing so long as the employees in the industry could have s> substantial financial finger in the pie. It is not the principle that some of them object to; it is only their own exclusion from? participation in the proceeds of monopoly thaF, in their mind, constitutes a wrong. The public side is a minor consideration. In the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 6th? December, 1910, there appeared the following references to the same Peter Bowling, who had brought the Vend into existenceMr Peter Bowling's opinion of the Vend is not a flattering one. Tn fact, he has at different times declared that it was the principalthing the miners were fighting against. After it had been formed the miners became dissatisfied with it, because some of the terms of the compact were not adhered to, and because the colliery proprietorsfound a way to get a thick slice of the cake for themselves. As a result I find the followingI n Saturday's Daily Telegrafh, a number of"" extracts made by Mr Bowling' were printed, showing clearly what were his views on the subject. Some of his phrases describing the vend were:-""The combination that is trying tosmash up the workers of this community and"" get its claws on our industries""; "" Save the public from its octopus grip "" ; "" The vend hascrushed out employment""; "" The conspiratorsof the vend""; and others of like character. He apparently forgotthat this combination not only had the endorsement of theleading members of the Labour Party, but was a creature largely of his own creation'. I have quoted the foregoing extracts to-",19,Hughes

J. C. Plunkett). The candidate in the In fact they have been the only advocates -of them to be found on the floor of this House. most gigantic combine which exists in Australia to-day is a labour combineI refer to the Australian Workers Union. I do not know any combine which is more powerful, which exercises a wider influence or which has direct parliamentary representation in the Senate, the House of Representatives and in the State Parliaments. It has been stated in this chamber that that organization has the nomination of no fewer than twenty-three representatives in -this Parliament. If that is not a combine, I do not know what is. YetI have never heard a single word uttered in condemnation of it. The opinion which I held for many years is that the only effective cure for monopolies, trusts, and combines, is to be found in freedom of production and exchange. Where production is free, no ""corner""can Ibe made. Where exchange is free, there -can be no ""corner"" created. But the Labour party has been the cause of all these monopolies, because a great many of its members have supported Tariff proposals 'the effect of which has been to rehas arrived when a demand should be made by -strict competition more and more by forcing the import duties higher and higher, and thus creating monopolies which -otherwise could not exist in Australia. They show by their legislative action in -this chamber that they are not only the -supporters and champions of monopolies, trusts, and combines, but actually the creators of them. From the quotations I have made it is clear that they wish to create these monopolies in order that they may 'have an excuse for appealing to the public to nationalize them, and so create the -greatest of all monopolies, a monopoly in the hands of the supreme governing authority of the country. In spite of the -declarations of honourable members opposite to the contrary, and although it may not be stated in print or proclaimed from the house-tops, the real objective of these proposals is Unification and Socialism. 'This may be proved in a number of ways. Only the other night the Senate campaign was opened in New South Wales at a meeting in which there were present: Mr David Watkins, Mr Edden, Mr Gardiner, Mr Estell, M.L.A. ; Dr. Doyle, M.L.C. The President of the Senate Committee ( Mr course of his speech said thatBy an extension of the constitutional powers May I also point out that the they would be able to encourage every individual who was prepared to build up an industry without detriment to the people and with advantage to the men engaged in that particular industry. They were also seeking for the nationalization of trusts and combines. Senator Pearce, the Minister of Defence, was present on that occasion. To show further that the trend of thought in Labour circles is towards Unification, I need only show that resolutions were carried when the leaders of the Labour party in New South Wales were taken to task by various organizations for their opposition to the Federal LaBour party. The Hunter District Labour Political Council carried this resolution, which will be found quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald of 25th October, 1909That this Council protests against the utterances of Messrs. McGowen, Holman, and Dacey and others of the State Labour party with regard to the question of Unification, and that the delegates to the Congress be intrusted to uphold the idea of Unification. About the same time the North Melbourne Political Labour Council, as will be seen on reference to the Daily Telegrafh of 10th October, 1909, declaredThat, in the opinion of this branch, the time all Democrats that State Parliaments and the present method of appointing State Governors be abolished, as our present method of government is too cumbersome, and is, consequently, subversive of the best interests of Democracy; and, further, the question of Unification in a modified form should be made a leading question at the next State Labour Conference. read what happened to that resolution at the Conference. speaking of the trend in a particular direction. I find that a delegate of the Women's Conference, a Miss Mathews, said, at about the same time, that Unification was the foremost question of the day, and she advocated it very strongly. Referring to the same matter, Mr J. R.

But I am at present showing that amongst Labour organizations the trend of thought is in favour of Unification, and that is denied by honourable members opposite. clauses from that petitionThat the continued existence of State Governments with their existing powers prevents the development of any true Federal spirit in Australia, and tends to perpetuate the State jealousy and provincialism which it is the purpose of Federation to destroy. That the continued existence of the State Governments, as at present constituted, hampers the efficiency of the Commonwealth Government, and prevents it from exercising its powers to the fullest measure for the benefit of Australia. It will be seen that the trend of thought amongst the people by whom this petition was signed was distinctly in the direction of Unification. 1909, Senator E. J. Russell presented a petition signed by 2,250 electors praying that a referendum might be taken in regard to the abolition of State Governments and Parliaments. That is clearly evidence of the same tendency. I quote the following from a leading article which appeared in the Argris of 31st January, 1911, with respect to views expressed by Mr Prendergast, the Leader of the State Labour party in VictoriaMr Prendergast, on the other hand, has no reservations. He boldly proclaims that the purpose of the Labour party is to destroy all State rights and boundaries. His cynical frankness is certainly preferable to the smooth phrases of Mr Fisher, which are intended to turn public opinion on the wrong track. The leader of tbe State Opposition, while professing to answer the Premier, really justified all Mr Murray's forebodings regarding the results of affirmative referenda votes.

Then the late Mr Dacey, M.L.A., speaking of the demands of tiie Labour party in October, 1909, saidWhat is the cause of this anxiety to obtain control of the State debts? There is something behind it-the States' assets, such as the railways. That is one of the means by which unification is to be brought about. The assets must follow the debts. That is the whole thing' in a nutshell. If the amendments of the Constitution now proposed are carried, the Commonwealth will be able to determine the conditions of employment and the wages of railway employees, and. to interfere in the fixing of fares and freight rates. It is only a short step further to make nominal, as well as practical, f u l l and complete possession of the lines. Another amendment of the section at present under consideration would sweep away every right the States have to retain, the ownershig of their rail-way property.

41,"Ence On 27th January, Mr Mcgowen, The","I emphasize the argument that the powers asked for (by the referenda) are too great, and that the States can better control industrial laws. Wages Boards are preferable to Federal Arbitration. Mr Holman, the associate Leader of the Labour party in New South Wales, and Attorney-General of the State, answered the Federal Attorney-General at the Conference, and his speech is reported in the Worker of 31st August, 1911. The Federal Attorney-General saidI maintain now, and w ill continue to maintain, that we must have all the power that we sought ing the referenda were carpeted, and in the Constitutional amendments. It is immeasures amounting to intimidation and possible to abate one word of those amendments coercion were taken to induce them to and still be able to carry into eifect the platchange their speeches, or, in the alternaform agreed upon by the Inter-State Conference. To those remarks Mr Holman, the State the ConferenceAttorney-General, replied as followsMr Hughes had said that he could not bring the Labour platform into effect with any smaller measure. He( Mr Holman) told him to his teeth, as a lawyer, that that was absolutely wrong. He could have effected all the Brisbane Conference demanded, with a much smaller measure. The argument-if I dignify it with the name of argument-that because the Federal Parliament imposes the Tariff, it should have charge of all industrial legislation, will not stand investigation. This step, as suggested, will mean the end of State Labour parties. . . . .man can consider the conditions under which the battle of social reform has to be fought out without realizing that State' Parliaments are infinitely more valuable and effective weapons than the Federal Parliament. . . . one of those possibly misguided individuals who regard the right of every people in every locality to self-govern themselves as one of the fundamental principles of progress and liberty. I don't believe in it being taken up to-day and iput down to-morrow, as the exigencies of party fortunes or welfare may dictate. It is the rock upon which I build my church, and against which the gates of hell shall not prevail. Mr Holman further declared that if certain things took place, he would leave the Labour movement. Then Mr Beeby, Secretary for Lands in New South Wales, -speaking at Blayney on the 31st March, 1911, saidAn attempt was being made practically to g r a f t a unified system of government on the Federal Constitution. He contended the submission of the questions now before the country was a mistake and against the best interests of the Commonwealth. Speaking again at Oberon, on the 9th' November last, he further emphasized his position, notwithstanding the attacks made on him at the Labour Conference, in the following wordsI intend to assert my right to take the same stand I took when the referendum proposals were previously before the country. I have used all the power and influence I have had to obtain from the Labour Conference right of freedom of action for every individual on this great issue. I have claimed that the issue is above party consideration, and that every man should not be compelled to subscribe to what he cannot honestly believe. That right has been refused me, and whatever the consequences may be, even though it may lead to my retirement altogether, I intend to persist in my opposition to certain of the referendum proposals. At the Labour Conference, those members of the Labour party who had been bold enough to express their convictions regardtive, to retire from the movement. Mr Lamond. the editor of the Worker, said at Any one of them who did not support the referenda was a traitor to the Labour movement. If Mr Holman wanted greater liberty and freedom he could find it inside the other parties. There was not room for traitors in the Labour party. It is a good thing to have it on record that, in the opinion of the editor of the Worker, greater liberty and freedom can be found inside the Liberal party than is permitted inside the Labour party. He movedNo That the clause in the Constitution disqualifying from membership in a league or union anybody in the movement who opposed a Labour candidate's election should be extended to apply I am to anybody in the movement who opposed a referendum proposal submitted to the people by the Labour party. Senator Rae movedThat, in the opinion of this Conference, the decision arrived at by the New South Wales Political Labour League last Friday to support the referendum proposals requires members of the State Labour Parliamentary party to f a l l into line and withdraw their opposition or else resign from the Labour movement. Let me quote once more from Mr Beeby. According to the Argus, of the 15th November, he resents the criticisms levelled against him by the Worker, and is reported to have said at OberonThe Labour organ has adopted a policy of in every possible way belittling the State Government and its functions, in order to glorify the Federal Parliament. It is worth noting that it is at present controlled by a peculiar triumviratea disgruntled ex-Prime Minister, an ex-Liberal canvasser and candidate, and an ex-Socialist editor from Brisbane. It may be mentioned in connection with this combination that the most respected of the three, the ex-Prime Minister, is supposed to have abandoned his position in Federal politics because of the outside dictation and unreasonable criticism which is resented by myself, and, I believe, some of my colleagues. In conclusion, let me quote a couple of of our predecessors in Ministerial office paragraphs from Prentice's Federal Power have been what he calls rubber stamp over Carriers and CorporationsTo turn over to a single legislative body the to anything submitted to them by officials. vast intricacies of social life throughout the I wish to deal with this subject in the light country, that it may prepare a system applicafforded by the experiences of the Departable to all conditions-to child labour in the South, for example, and in the tenements of ment over which I preside.

44,Mr Tudor,"Yes. Let me give ansix Parliaments, when it could be fairly and intelligently exercised by one, the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. Both Australian.and oversea manufacturers complain of the difficulties caused by the diverse legislation of the States. They point out that they have not only the regulations of the Commerce Act to comply with, but must also study the legislation of each of tb"" States. Honourable members opposite say that all these matters are best left to the States; but in my opinion they should be dealt with by the Commonwealth, and to enable us to deal with them we must have, not a modified power, but complete control. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro did a great deal of good by discouraging the use of bags and sacks of a certain size by preventing their importation into Australia; and by securing an amendment of the law I have been able to further the end that he had in view by prohibiting the importation of sacks over a certain size. But we cannot prevent their manufacture and use inside Australia; and therefore our workers, particularly in the country, suffer considerable hardship at times by having to move bags that are too heavy to handle. Government of South Australia has prohibited the transport by railway of bags exceeding a certain weight, but that is not sufficient. To give full effect to the beneficent intention of the honourable member, the Commonwealth Government should have power to deal generally with the use of bags and sacks. If it is a good thing that the men working on the wharfs should not be required to handle bags whose contents exceed a certain weight, it is a good made, and, consequently, a conviction can thing that our country and town workers should be prevented from having to handle such bags; but not one of the States, although the matter has been brought under the notice of the State authorities from time to time, has done anything in regard to it. Again, the Commonwealth has tried to prevent the importation of cure-all medicines, but much of our good work is nullified by the inaction of the State authorities, and I shall presently give instances to show how and why our action Jias failed. The honourable member for Riverina referred in the House recently to the importation of a preparation that was known to be harmful, and upon which were placed misleading labels, stating that it was perfectly harmless, even in the case of children. called upon the agents and the importers [226] to amend the statements on the label, with the result that they interviewed me, and, as is often the case in such circumstances, threatened the Department with legal proceedings. I told them to ""go right ahead "" ; but when they learned that we had the Crown Law Department backing up our action, they said, in effect, "" Very well, we shall have these labels printed in Australia, and shall label this article after it is imported, so that you will not be able to interfere with us."" The position under the Constitution, as at present, is that this preparation and others can be imported either in bulk or in bottle, and, with misleading labels printed in Australia, then placed upon the market. Once the article has left the control of the Customs they may place upon it what label they -please. The Department of Trade and Customs is powerless ""to take action. The honourable member for Lang, who has just resumed his seat, took a very active part in the agitation for prohibiting the importation of opium. Its importation was prohibited, but in case after case taken against Chinese found in possession of opium we were unsuccessful, because the I understand that the High Court held that the opium found upon the defendant might have been imported before tlie prohibition order came into operation. Until quite recently we were unable to sustain a conviction. The High Court, however, now holds that, inasmuch as six years have elapsed since the prohibition order was made, it is reasonable to assume that opium now found upon any person in the Commonwealth must have been imported since that order was be upheld. Then, again, we prohibited the introduction of certain articles, with the result that they have since been made in the States, and the States themselves have taken no step to put a stop to their manufacture. The honourable member for Robertson recently put to me a question concerning an alleged cancer cure which was found, on analysis, to be useless, and probably harmful. Not only would it not cure a sufferer, but it would actually have an injurious effect upon the person who took it. I believe, as a matter of fact, that, in one case, it was shown that a person had been injuriously affected by using it. We prohibited ifs introduction, with the result that it is now being made in Victoria. This is not Under the Commerce ActI the only State in which cure-all or quack medicines are now being manufactured as the result of action taken by us to stop their importation. Recently, in reply to the honourable member for Herbert, I read out the names of certain patent medicines which we refused to allow to come in while bearing extravagant claims. One of these is known as "" William Radam's Microbe Killer."" The label to which we objected set out thatIt is a positive and certain cure lor all disthe misleading character of the labels or eases, and is guaranteed to be perfectly harmless. It will eifect a cure in every instance if given a fair trial. . . . The Microbe Killer is perfectly harmless, and can be taken in any quantity without danger. the microbes, I suppose. misleading statement, and I dare say that the honourable member would approve of the action we took. now being made in Melbourne, and we have no power to interfere. In a circular issued by the manufacturers, we have the statement, "" The William Radam Microbe Killer Company, Melbourne, Australia."" The words, "" Melbourne, Australia,"" have been substituted for the words, "" Chicago, USA."" action to deal with these matters. have asked them over and over again to take action, but they have not done so. This ""Radam's Microbe Killer,"" upon analysis, was found to contain sulphurous or sulphuric acid, and the claims made in respect to it were so extravagant that the oversea manufacturers were advised by us that they could not be permitted. As this patent medicine is now being made in Victoria, we have no power to deal with the advertisements relating to it. one say that it is better that questions of this character should be dealt with by six Parliaments rather than by one ? All that we ask for, however, is that we shall have equal power with the States to deal with these matters. Let us have the chance to take action on behalf of the people, and if the States fail to do so, we shall. I do not propose, as some honourable members have done, to soar into the realms of higher politics, or to quote precedents or decisions of various kinds to support certain arguments. I am dealing, and propose only to deal, with the practical everyday aspects of these questions as disclosed to me every day in the week in my capacity as Minister of Trade and Customs. In a publication entitled, Quackery, containing articles reprinted from the American Medical Association Journal, I find the statement concerning this ""Microbe killer,"" thatThe hoary fake, when analyzed, was said to consist of hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, and red wine. In this case as in others where the Department of Trade and Customs has objected to advertisements, the preparations themselves are either being made here, or the advertisements and literature are being printed in the Commonwealth. We have thus no power to put a stop to these extravagant claims. We objected to certain advertisements relating to Mother Seigel's Syrup being imported, and as the result of our action, Mother Seigel's Almanac and Home Companion for 1Q13 has been printed in Australia. ment analyzed Mother Seigel's Syrup? Mr .TUDOR -An analysis of tha* patent medicine appears in Secret Remedies or in More Secret Remedies, which the House has decided shall be printed as Parliamentary Papers. Honourable members unanimously approved of the adoption of The States have not taken any that course, believing that the extravagant We claims made in respect of many of these patent medicines, and, in some cases, the medicines themselves, were harmful to the public. In Mother Seigel's Almanac, we have the statementMother Seigel's Syrup has cured-cure d permanently-in many instances, even after many other medicines have been tried in vain. I appeal to the medical men, who largely support the Opposition, to say whether they approve of the do-nothing policy of Will any the States in regard to quack medicines, and the way in which they are advertised. support the Labour party. members opposite say that we were beaten on the occasion of the last referendum, and that we shall be beaten again. I do not share that view. One honourable member opposite last week quoted one of Abraham Lincoln's sayings. I should like to remind the House of another statement made by Lincoln, "" You can fool all the people some of the time, and you can fool some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.""'

Customs objected to a misleading label in regard to that preparation, and I ask honourable members what they think of the following advertisement which appeared in the Australasiana newspaper with a very large circulation-concernin g that preparationI'm the absolute cuie for baldness. '. Wioletta Ltd., 109 Pitt-street, Sydney. It will thus be seen that this preparation, in connection with which the extravagant claim is made that it is an "" absolute cure for baldness,"" is now being made in Sydney. VVe refused to allow it to come in bearing such extravagant labels, and will any one say that we were not justified in doing so? Manufacturers of quack medicines find it necessary to make extravagant claims in respect of them in order to get a sale for them. They have to assert that they will cure everything, otherwise there is no demand for them; and when we do take action against the importation of various quack medicines bearing misleading statements, the manufacturers have the labels printed in Australia, or, in some cases, manufacture the preparation itself here, with the result that the Commonwealth is helpless. I took exception to an advertisement or label in regard to preparations known as Grasshopper Ointment and Pills. In the Bulletin there was an advertisement stating that they had ""never failed.""

Medical men are prepared to devote their very best skill, free of charge, to the relief of the poorest of the poor in our public hospitals. fession, deserving of every encouragement. have in this advertisement the statement that Grasshopper Ointment will cure, even where a doctor has advised amputation. The advertisement continuesSend to the Drug Stores for a box of Grasshopper Ointment and Pills, which has never failed to cure the worse cases of bad legs, ulcerated joints, poisoned hands, injured knees, bites, carbuncles, &c. We objected to that coming in with such a statement upon the label. Then the proprietors of the article turned round, and printed the misleading advertisements in Australia, advertising it in the newspapers in which, I presume, they can obtain the largest circulation. As I said the other day, the worse offenders among the newspapers in publishing these advertisements are the Sydney Bulletin and the Australasian. We have obtained more advertisements of the kind from those newspapers than from any others. We objected to the statements circulated with Dr. William's pink pills. The pills are now made locally, and are largely advertised throughout Australia. The States have failed to interfere. I have here what is described as a teething necklace.

I have also some particulars concerning the alcohol contained in some patent medicines. As honourable members know, there are other things which we have tried to deal with through the Customs. We have tried to prevent certain articles being imported which are conceived to be harmful to the community. But when we have prevented their importation, they have been manufactured in Australia. Many honourable members have said to me that, to their knowledge, certain things, the importation of vvhich has been prevented, are being made by young girls in this country to-day.

Under such circumstances, it is only right that one years. Parliament should deal with the matter in one Act. The Customs Department have taken action in regard to other objection-able forms of manufacture. For instance, we have prohibited the importation of wax matches containing white phosphorus, and a similar step has, I believe, been taken *by every civilized country in the world. It is true that nq State of Australia has passed any law on the subject, although -<the Act passed by the House of Commons was sent to the Victorian Government. Then, again, paint containing white lead for indoor work has been prohibited as 'injurious. phorus matches the matches with white heads ? may be made any colour, and I ought to say that I do not think that it is used in Australia. As to the 200-Ib. sack, with I which the name of the honourable member in Australia to-day, the importation or exportation of any over that size being prohibited. South Australia has, I think, prohibited the use of bags of over 200 lbs. on the railways; but it will be observed that there is nothing to prevent larger sacks being made here and carted to upThe States have had six country mills, and owing to the prohibition of their use for export purposes, they are over and over again employed. It would seem that it is a State right to permit the maiming and crippling of men in the country by the use of heavy sacks. I have dealt with all these matters because they have come under my notice more, perhaps, than under the notice of any other honourable member. In view of the inaction by the States, we are perfectly justified in asking for the Commonwealth Parliament at least as much power, in this connection, as that now enjoyed by the States. must congratulate the Minister of Trade and Customs upon the very clever way in which he managed to drive a coach and four through the ruling which you, sir, gave earlier in the afternoon, when you intimated that it was not usual to allow this Chamber to be used for electioneering purposes. I would point out that the matter articles to which he has called attention, and more particularly ih regard to patent medicines, is one entirely within his own control, and has been so for the past two When the honourable member for Eden-Monaro filled the position of Minister of Trade and Customs, I recollect that he took some sort of dislike to saccharine, and that, as a result, he induced Parliament to impose upon it an import duty of 30s. per lb. and 20s. per lb. Excise duty, which practically prohibited its use in Australia except for medicinal purposes. If the Minister desires to prohibit the use of the articles which he has mentioned there is nothing to prevent him inviting Parliament to act in a similar way.

My constituents know my fiscal policy, and it was partly on that account that I was returned to this House. I am quite in accord with the honourable member that our present Tariff is a hotch-potch, and one which does not effectively protect all our industries; but he was unfortunate in the industry which he selected in order to prove its ineffectiveness. He chose the boot trade. Now, from a return published by the Commonwealth Statistician a day or two ago, I learn that the position of the boot trade in Australia during the past twelve months may be thus summarizedImports, ,£295,892; local production, £3,713,948. The wages paid are stated, and the proportion which they bear to the local cost of production is 29.5 per cent. The duty upon boots imported from Great Britain is 30 per cent., and 35 per cent, is levied upon the products of the outside world. In other words, the duty on boots is greater than the total labour cost of production. I hold that when we protect an industry to the full extent of the labour cost of production we are granting it a fair measure of protection. Beyond that point, I , as a Protectionist, do not intend to go, but right up to that point I am willing to gober says that the boot trade enjoys a suffiParliament powers which belonged to the cient protection? is 30 per cent., and the total labour cost of production is 29.5 per cent., so that it enopposite are endeavouring to alter the existjoys a protection of .5 per cent, more than ing position.

Some of' our industries are languishing for lackof sufficient Protection, and I am quitewilling to assist in adequately protecting them. The honourable member for Brisbane, during the course of his speech upon this Bill, spoke very disrespectfully of the framers of our Constitution. He went so far as to say that they were not elected,and that they were hardly representativeof the people of Australia. But I think, that even he will admit that the late Hon. C. C. Kingston was a Radical. He was a member of the Convention, and he it waswho used these wordsNo doubt every power which is proposed to be given to the Federal Parliament will be. closely scrutinized before being parted with. I am sanguine that the American plan of preserving the residue of power to the local Legislature will be followed as proposed in the Commonwealth Bill rather than the Canadian plan-., of giving everything not specifically reserved,, to the Federal Parliament. While recognising the interests of Federation for nationalpurposes we should cherish with equal importance the principle of home rule in all local' affairs. The Provinces must maintain, so fatas possible, consistently with true Federation, the glorious principle of managing our own affairs. These were the words of the late C. C.

A limitation was imposed, under ^ which the States have power to legislate * within their own sphere, whilst a definite sphere of action was assigned to this Pardiament. The people are still supreme, .and each legislative body, Federal and :State, is supreme within its own ambit. The States may deal with any monopoly which exists within their own boundaries, and the Commonwealth may deal with any 'monopoly of an Inter-State character. Many reasons have been cited by the Labour .party showing why the proposed changes in our Constitution should be made. Amongst 'Other things, they have urged the industrial unrest which has existed in Australia -during the past few years. But one serious cause of that unrest has been the creation of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. As the honourable member for Flinders pointed out, that tribunal, -which was intended to be a peaceful centre, /has become the storm centre of Australia; -and, in order to get before it, unions in -different States have federated, so as to -.make their disputes partake of an Interstate character.

We have tried our hand, and have absolutely failed. connot have looked into the matter, or he would not say that. the matter. I was dealing with the question whether the people had asked for these alterations of the Constitution. I find that on the 25th September last a conference of the Independent Workers was held in Melbourne, at which the following resolution was passedThai this Council, representing the Victorian organized independent workers, expresses its deep concern at the reported statement that there is a movement on foot by certain State Governments to voluntarily surrender certain industrial powers to the Commonwealth Parliament. Inasmuch as past and present experience gives undeniable evidence that Federal control of industrial affairs does not tend towards concord and amity, while granting that Federal control is essential to deal with large national aspects, we consider that home rule in industry governed by progressive State legislation can give much better satisfaction to all sections for many years to come. We therefore respectfully appeal to the Victorian State Government to display extreme caution before voluntarily giving up any of its present industrial powers. That is a resolution passed on behalf of an organization numbering many thousands of independent workers. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -That is "" Packer's Union."" of Victorian workers who have united to resist the tyranny of that great combine, the Trades Hall. It is evident that these people do not regard legislation by the Federal Parliament as a panacea for all their industrial ills. people working harmoniously under awards of the Federal Arbitration Court. orable member say that they are working harmoniously? On the occasion of the Brisbane strike the waterside workers in that city left produce to rot on the wharfs. They would not touch it.

The Attorney-General has told Us that unlimited power to make laws no longer exists. Surely the honourable gentleman does not expect the people of Australia to believe that? He can hardly hope that they will believe that between the Federal and State Parliaments we have not unlimited power to make laws. I have already pointed out that the legislative powers of the people have been divided between the Commonwealth and State Parliaments, but they have not been lessened at any time. The Attorney-General went on to say that before Federation*"" the State Parliaments had ample .power to deal with trusts and combines. That power within their own domain has not been> The public are treating it as a taken from them. The effect of Federation has been to give the people widerpowers than they ever had before, and they can now deal, not only with matters affecting the separate States, but also with Inter-State matters. The Federal Parliament has exceeded its powers on one or two occasions, and as a result has hack to face adverse decisions of the High Court. That is not the fault of the Constitution, but the fault of this Parliament in passing laws that were ultra vires of the Constitution. The Attorney-General waxedvery warm in his references to the Coal( Vend. He informed us that it had been? suggested in Germany that the coal industry should be nationalized. It was suggested' that the industry should be nationalized in Australia when I was quite a boy. The nationalization bogy was trotted out then as it has been trotted out occasionally ever since. In Victoria the coal industry has been nationalized, and I leave it to the Victoriarv people to say whether they are any betteroff with a nationalized coal industry thanare the people of the other States in which* the industry is carried on by private enterprise. The people have a perfect right tocontrol and regulate industries, and, if they please, to nationalize them; but the question is whether it would be wise to nationalize them, and that is an entirely different matter. I am under the impression that some time ago the Attorney-General spoke in highly complimentary terms of the Coal Vend. It would appear that some folk regard plunder as unobjectionable so long; as they can get a share of it. The honourable member for Lang has extensively dealt with this aspect of the matter this afternoon, and, therefore, I need not go into itfurther. On the subject of the high cost of living, the honourable members for SouthSydney and Denison have put it down to* the defeat of the last referenda proposals.. If either of those honourable members had given the matter any serious consideration, they would have gone nearer the truth, and would have arrived at very different, conclusions.

There are no rings in these things. in Fitzroy is, I believe, a dairy and at almost every corner there is a fuel dep6t. This shows that there is the keenest competition, with no combines at all. Yet, in those matters, where the keenest competition prevails, the consumer is paying double and treble the price which the producer receives.

130,"Limited, Mr Sinclair","I hold that Mrparty have always told us that if they had the power they would reduce the cost of living. Now, what have the Labour parties that have had the power done for the people in that regard? On this point, Mr Adam McCay has expressed himself in the Sydney Sun in these words""What have you done for Labour?"" answer rises fast From every toiling work-shop, and the answer comes at last; Comes with a hollow echo from the parliamentary den, "" We raised our screws four pounds a week, and sacked three hundred men."" Mr ILightfoot, giving evidence last week before the Arbitration Court, made a comparison regarding the cost of living in the capitals of the six States. He said that in Sydney £[1,114 would have to be spent, in Perth and Fremantle, or in Adelaide, £[1,107 ; i "" Melbourne, £ [ 1 , 0 0 0; in Hobart, £ [ 9 7 6 ; and in Brisbane, £[937, to obO'Brien."" The Standing Orders would tain the same commodities. Thus the cost of living in Sydney, the capital of a State which has a Labour Government, is n per cent, above the average. Then come Perth and Fremantle, in Western Australia, which is also under a Labour Government, and Adelaide, which has only recently rid itself of Labour administration. In Hobart, the capital of a State which will not have Labour at any price, the cost of living is much below the mean. I ask why, if Labour Governments can do miracles, they have not reduced the cost of living in the States in which they are in power? The honourable member for South Sydney made some misleading remarks about the cost of butter locally, quoting figures supplied by the Minister of Trade and Customs, which were proved incorrect by other figures supplied by the honourable member for Richmond, showing that some of the Victorian factories made more out of their London shipments than they received locally. The honourable member for South Sydney was very careful to take a period of the year when practically no butter is exported from Ausobliterate it . tralia, our exportations of butter practically ceasing during April, June, July, and mine is untrue, it is not because of any August. In the years before the exportafault on my part, and I am always willtion of butter to London had been coming to withdraw such statements.

Swift £[100,000 a year to subsidize vessels for and Company have been described by the the carrying of butter, local consumers Attorney-General, and the honourable memhave to pay more for it than do consumers ber for South Sydney, as an American abroad. Those statements may be accepted trust. We have nothing to do with their in Woolloomooloo, but thinking people wiU regard them as ridiculous. The butter industry has nothing to thank any Government for. By combination the dairy farmers broke up a monopoly, and asoperated in building factories and distributing their produce. Were there no butter to be exported, the Commonwealth The would be paying much more dearly for the carrying of its mails to the Old Country. The honourable members for Maribyrnong and Adelaide have tried to make capital out of an interjection which I made when the honourable member for South Sydney was speaking. Shortly after the New South VVales Dairy Act came into force, requiring every dairyman to have his name printed on his cart in 3-inch letters, a dairyman who had his name chalked on was stopped by a policeman, who said to him, "" Your name is obliterated."" "" You're a liar,"" he replied, "" m y name is not allow me to use such language in regard to what has been said about my waving a flag in glee because the Beef Trust is to be established in Brisbane. I have no fault to find with either the Hansard report of the incident, or the press report. The honourable member for South Sydney knows my opinion regarding the wool top monopoly, and when speaking, was looking at me as if he wished me to finish his sentence. He said, "" There is a beef trust starting in Brisbane; they are spending £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 on meat works there,"" and thinking that he wished me to finish his sentence, I said, "" Yes, and we are pleased to see them there."" I was putting words into his mouth. I forgive him for taking me incorrectly, though I do not think that he misunderstood me, because he replied, "" I see no reason for rejoicing.""

142,Mr Brennan (Batman) [6.16],"I nmade a very strong appeal for increased power for the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court. He saidWhatever legislation we may pass we cannot, unless we give the central Parliament the final and supereminent control, deal effectually with all the cases which may arise. Therefore, I say againThe honourable member, apparently, had made this statement more than once at that timethat we should amend paragraph-XXXV. of section 51 of the Constitution to give this Parliament a wider and more general power than it has to deal with conditions of employment. I do not see what we have to be afraid of. this side, should not be afraid to give this Parliament a wider power, because the governing political party is strongly opposed to us in these matters. I do not know that the honourable member has given expression to any different opinion on, this subject; but I shall have occasion to show that he has been somewhat contradictory, as has already been pointed out, in respect of other matters. In any event, the quotation made by the honourable member for Moreton to show that we should not have the extended industrial power for which we ask was rather inapt. I am not going at present to discuss the industrial question, beyond expressing the view that I have always held-and which, I am pleased to know, is supported by honourable members on both sides of the House, wEose opinions carry more weight in the country-that it is impossible to deal with industrial troubles piecemeal, so long as we are bound by arbitrary geographical limitations, when a dispute is commenced, and so long as the President of the Arbitration Court cannot call up his powers of conciliation before the dispute has reached so critical a stage as to inflame the minds of people in more States than one. Before passing from the honourable member for Moreton's remarks, I should like to reply to the allegation made by him, and also by the honourable member for Lang, that honourable members on this side often find in trusts and combinations something to admire, while at other times they cannot visit them with too strong reprobation. 1 think the view of the Attorney-General was sufficiently clearly put by himself when, he said, in moving the second reading of one of these Bills, that he did not object-and I do not think that any one of us objects-to combination. So far from denouncing or objecting to the principle, we recognise that it lies at the very base of this party's existence. combinations as long as they do not rob the public. tice is done to the public. We know that the Labour party is built upon organization and combination, and that its views in regard to combinations and organizations have been accepted in this House, and have been placed upon the statute-book in the form of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. My contribution to this debate, brief as it will be, comes at a time more suited for We, on summing up the position, if I were qualified to do so, than for adding anything original to the vast and useful volume of evidence for and against these proposals which has already been brought forward. Still, one feels that it is a duty one owes to oneself and one's constituents to have one's views recorded on a matter of such momentous consequence to the Commonwealth, whose citizens we all are. I do not join with those-indeed , I hope they are comparatively few-wh o would belittle the work of the framers and founders of the Commonwealth Constitution. So far from belittling their work, I remember the. keen interest which I took, as a very young man, in the debates at the time, and the feeling of gratitude, which has by no means entirely passed away,to those who, in that time of stress and strain, fought the national battle. It was for them to fashion the giant instrument with which succeeding generations of Australia have to control this country of ours for good or evil, and it is for us now, as best we may, to try to guide the people as to how far, if at all, that instrument is to be amended, or, as some would prefer to say, remodelled and remoulded. It is for us to say when, and to what extent, we shall avail ourselves of the power which, whatever other faults there may be in the Constitution, the framers of that Constitution have given us to amend it. The difficulties which face us in this debate are certainly of the same kind as those which faced the framers of the Constitution; but it must be confessed that in extent they are infinitely less. They are, in my view, divisible into three classes of varying degrees of worthiness. First, there was the natural timidity of Federalists to vest in the central power, tbe Commonwealth Parliament, many of those powers which had hitherto been enjoyed by the separate States. That timidity still exists amongst many honest Federalists.",39,Hughes
143,Mr Archibald,We do not object to,40,Hughes
144,Mr Brennan,"As long as no injusSecondly-and this was less worthy-ther e was the grudging and jealous disposition of those in authority in the States to conserve and retain power and prestige as long as they themselves remained in a position to exercise that power. To these difficulties may be added, thirdly, that attribute of our fallen nature, the claims of party. I suppose that we are all more or less influenced by party considerations. Some of us more than others enjoy the new virtue formulated by the honourable member for Flinders, ""mere verbal consistency""-for which graceful expression we are much indebted to him. I am sure he will not mind my saying that he will find that we are going to be greatly indebted to him during the campaign for the referenda upon which we are about to enter, for many well-considered, and, may I add, well-supported expressions of opinion in regard to these Federal matters, on which we are only too sorry to learn that, for some reason too recondite for me to fathom, we are not to be supported on this occasion by his vote. I do not think that other honourable members should enjoy the sole privilege of quoting the honourable member for Flinders and of having some of his literary gems embodied in their speeches. I also should be able to send some of them to my constituents. I want it to be recognised how the honourable member approached these questions in the past, and how he is approaching them now. It is not merely a personal matter. It is a matter which appears to me to show, in the clearest possible way, the attitude of honourable members opposite towards this party and their attitude towards the proposals which are now being submitted by us. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. said, I see no reason why my speech should be divested of those pearls of wisdom with whioh the honourable member for Flinders has at different times enlivened and ornamented our debates. The quotations which I shall make are directed to show that we are perfectly entitled to say that the Opposition have proved conclusively out of fche mouths of some of their leading spokesmen that this is essentially a party question with them, and that at a time when they were altogether divested of party feeling they expressed views on these great national questions entirely in harmony with those which we hold, and entirely antagonistic to those which they themselves are now expressing. The honourable member for Flinders, in the former debate, saidAs we are asked, in a time of peace and rest, to consider deliberately a fundamental constitutional change, it is our duty to put out of our minds wbo sits on the Government benches and who is in Opposition. If we f a i l to do so we shall fail in our performance of the most sacred trust given to us by the people. Again, the honourable member saidWe on this side should not be afraid to give this Parliament a wider power, because the governing political party is directly opposed to us on these matters. The honourable member said, laterIn any case, I am not afraid to trust to the sound common sense and spirit of fair play which the majority here has inherited from its British ancestors. I believe that all will come right in the end. We ought not, like the inhabitants of Lilliput, to try to tie down with a thousand strings of technical and constitutional restriction this Gulliver, who is bound to break away sooner or later. When we compare those broad and statesmanlike views with those on the very same subject so recently expressed by the honourable member, and when we recollect his contemptuous reference to "" mere verbal consistency,"" we cannot help wondering whether this direct change of front upon fundamental questions of policy, and, indeed, political morality, is, as he puts it, a failure in the recognition of our most sacred duty, or whether it is merely an example of verbal inconsistency. In his recent speech, the honourable member concluded with the wordsI hope that it will be safe at some future time to extend the trade and commerce powers of this Parliament, but I say emphatically that it is not safe to do so at the present time. He said a little while before, speaking of his own party, "" I trust members on this side of the House, but I do not trust you "" -referrin g then to honourable members on this side. It is regrettable, to put it mildly, that an honourable member to whom we have been accustomedI say advisedly --to look with some respect for light and leading on constitutional questions, should be guilty of such a startling reversal of policy as the honourable member Has shown. The honourable member, in another debate, claimed to have the courage of his opinions. In view of the quotations which I have made, I should say that he has shown that he has not only the courage of his opinions, but that he has the courage of opinions which are diametrically opposed to each other. The only thing that yet remains to be seen",40,Hughes

Almost every speaker opposed to the proposals has answered in the affirmativeindeed, that is their favourite battle-cry. The honourable member for Richmond, if I may address myself, as a junior member on this side, to one of the younger members on the opposite side, argued lucidly enough in an endeavour to prove this contention. I think I understood his view that if we give the Federal Parliament complete power as to trade and commerce, coupled with the other grants, of power, we shall, by that means, put the Parliament in a position to undermine the autonomy of the States, and the honourable member urged that this is particularly so, in view of the duary legatees of power, while we here very wide definition of trade and commerce. I venture to agree with him; but the difficulty is that his argument proves too much. The Federal Parliament has already sufficient power, and more than sufoccupied by one Parliament or the other. ficient power, to undermine State autonomy. The Parliament has, for instance, complete power over taxation, and by one measure of this House it could probably cripple the borrowing powers of the States; and by the same measure, or a separate one if need be, it could exhaust for itsown purposes every subject of local taxation. It could pass laws as to marriage to the Prime Minister, would, in very truth, Personally, I am not make the people "" fall down with fright."" It could pass measures dealing with emigration and immigration in a manner calculated to fill this continent, perhaps, with a mongrel race, or, on the other hand, denude it of population, and leave it a bare and barren fragment of the British Empire. The fact is that if we only assume I do not share the national insanity, we find there is abundant power in the Commonwealth Parliament to rob the States of every particle of practical autonomy that they possess.. Of course, the argument cuts both ways. The States might, it is true, indulge in reprisals so long as they lasted. They have the whole of the explored and unexplored powers contained in the resiand which include control over life and limb. By this means they have direct and immediate power over every member of this Parliament, and every citizen of the their authority they could-to push the argument to absurdity, as we aTe entitled to do-han g each one of them as high as Hainan. It is only necessary to reduce the argument of the honourable member for Richmond and other honourable members roan absurdity to show it is false in its premises. The test of Unification, at all events as I have always understood it, is whether complete sovereign power remains to the States, which are the units of the Federation. I mean complete sovereignpowers, so far as they can be complete, in view of the extreme position I put a while ago,, to legislate on any subject with the very small limited number of exceptions, closely allied with the Federal machinery. The States are, one might say, the resiare the specific legatees.

The object of the proposed referenda is to give this one people complete power to prevent individual units or corporations coming together to defeat the National Parliament, or to side-step it in any way by raising the arbitrary, illogical, and fictitious cry of State rights. In submitting these proposed alterations of the Constitution to the electors, we are relying first, on our experience. It is not a long experience, it is true, but it has been a rich one in many ways. We are able also to draw upon the experience of the country on whose Constitution our own was based, and we are able to point to those countries which have wisely avoided imposing on themselves the limitations which we' imposed upon ourselves when we entered the Federation. Our own experience has been summed up in a number of cases which were cited by the Attorney-General in moving the second -reading of the first of these Referenda Bills. am quite aware that the analytical mind of the honourable member for Angas has been devoted to an endeavour to show that those cases do not quite prove all that the Attorney-General claimed for them. I do not propose to analyze them.. I have neither the time nor the inclination to do so. It is sufficient for me to say that legislation to which both parties in this House have sought to give effect has been rendered nugatory by the constitutional limitations which we desire to remove. immediately under consideration is concerned, the reference of the Attorney General to the case Kalibia v. Wilson was very pertinent to show the sharp delimitation of our powers in regard to commerce. It shows not only how sharply our powers are delimited, but how that delimitation may operate to render void, as it did, a measure which was not dealing with commerce at all, but of which commerce was merely Turning from the difficulties we have already experienced, let us endeavour to anticipate the obviously imminent dangers to our national life. In discussing this question, why should I endeavour to express in my own language what has been so admirably expressed by the honourable member for Flinders? The Government propose to break down the arbitrary limitation of our powers with regard to trade and commerce. The honourable member, who is one of the most brilliant members of the Opposition, is assisting his. colleagues in fighting the Government proposals. In -dealing with the words in the Constitution of the United States, which, we have practically adopted in ours, he saysThat such a form of expression which was. then sufficient to deal with and define the whole limits of the Federal power in regard to commerce should have been found sufficient in 1901 has always<.> seemed to me veryremarkable ; and is still more remarkable when we remember that that limitation of trade and commerce between the States and"" with foreign countries has been the sourceof perpetual litigation during more than a century. It has been the battle-ground of a host of cases. The leader of the Opposition referred: to the fact that in taking over the form of expression, we had also taken over the wholeof the cases which had arisen in the attempts, to define the limitation. That, to a large extent, is true; but it was not merely taking as part of our Constitution the immense burdenof accumulated cases and law knowledge whicb is not yet complete, or even approaching completion, and which is changing -with every new I Vehicle of commerce and new means of communication, continually requiring new definition ; it was also taking the burden over under the form of words held to be sufficient in 1780. to deal with a comparatively simple state of: affairs. If it had not been, as some honourable members know, for the judicial audacity, if I may use such an expression, of that very great Judge, Chief Justice Marshall, who has been, called the second maker of the Constitution, the provision, even at the beginning of last century, would have been found utterly unworkable. He it was, and those who followed on. the same lines of policy, who, from time to> time, gradually extended, not the interpretaSo far as the Bill tion, because it was practically a judicial extension of those words, arising from the absolute necessity to govern the new conditions that arose in the development of that .great country.. I might multiply instances arising from the difficulty, and almost impossibility, of making' distinctions within distinctions, and definitionsbehind definitions, in the attempt to limit the commerce power of the United States underthis provision. These iwould sometimes make even a lawyer's head reel with confusion in the endeavour to follow the intricacies to which the Courts are reduced in trying to divide whatan incident. is really and substantially an indivisible whole-to divide the commerce of the community intoparts, and to say that one part shall be underthe Government of one Parliament and another part under another Parliament. Commerce is really an organic whole, and an organic whole of continually increasing complexity. It is just as impossible in commerce to draw a line of demarcation based on local geographical conditions as it would be to commit to the careof one physician a man's body and to the care, of another physician his limbs. Each is really part of one organic whole; and the result of",43,Hughes

156,Mr Brennan,"The honourable memIbe attempts has been, as_I say, perfectly enddoes this prove? It is evidence that trustsless litigation and uncertainty. ,Then he proceeds to give, one or two striking illustrations of how that has worked out in practice. We do not want to follow the example of the United States in the matter of being obliged to say that ours is a Judge-made Constitution. We prefer to have it a Constitution made by the free, unfettered votes of the people. We need not discuss why the American people have not amended their Constitution more freely. As a matter of fact, they had amended it fifteen times up till 1900. Yet we know there are many reasons why amendments of substance have not been made in it. as readily as has been desired. One of the chief reasons is that there are interests in the Senate which are, from selfish motives, antagonistic to reform. That, in itself, is very significant. The honourable member for Angas and the honourable member for Bendigo have urged that the Canadian Parliament does not possess an absolute power as to trade and commerce, and that the express powers which have been given to the States negative the existence of the unlimited power which is said to have been vested in the Dominion Parliament. that that is merely another reason why this Parliament should hot interfere with purely local matters, and that it does not disprove the important fact that if the proposals of the Government are carried, this Parliament will have absolute power to deal with matters of national concern, although incidentally they may touch matters of local concern. That is a very important point, seeing that we desire only to deal with affairs of national concern. Closely associated with the trade and commerce power is the power relating to trusts, combines, and monopolies. I may remark that honourable members opposite have been hard pressed to find reasons why they should not secure for themselves powers to deal effectively with these combinations. The honourable member for Bendigo was at great pains to collate a number of cases which were dealt with in the United -States of America in order to show by analogy that this Parliament has already sufficient power to deal with trusts and combines. He was good enough to contribute an article to the Age newspaper, in which he set out a large number of decisions given in the United States Courts to show that they have dealt trenchantly with these disastrous combines in America. What and combines are rampant and pestilent in the United States, and a largenumber of convictions have been obtained-., against them, but it makes no reference to the number of cases against trusts and combines that have been launched in the United States Courts and have failed* by reason of the State limitations. It does not disclose the fact that two-thirds of the States have passed local: laws in a vain endeavour to deal with these-. combinations, and have failed substantially, for the reason that they cannot exercise jurisdiction outside their own?boundaries. On the other hand, theSupreme Court of the United States cannot exercise jurisdiction in matters that areproved to be purely Intra-State, howeverpowerful they may be. It is an easy matter to cite cases that have been successfully prosecuted in the United States Courts, but we may assume that the law officials of the United States are astute enough to be sureof their ground before launching a case, and generally speaking they would see to if that there was jurisdiction before commencing a' prosecution. It is significant that,, notwithstanding these successful cases, theMy answer is different States of the Union are constantlypassing laws in a vain endeavour to deaf 0 with these combines. We desire to be able to deal with them, not only when their influence has been felt in more States than one, but as soon as they have so far developed as to threaten the interests of the community, even though their operations;should for the time being be confined to only one State. I wish to quote here Mr Eddy in his monumental work on Combinations., At page 935, volume II . , I find that he: saysWhile {he jurisdiction of Congress over commerce among the States is complete, it has nojurisdiction whatsoever over commerce which is. wholly within a State, and therefore Congress, has no jurisdiction over combinations which mayaffect, control or restrain trade within the limits of a State; nor is any jurisdiction acquired)over that part of a combination or agreementwhich relates to commerce wholly within a State by reason of the fact that the combination also covers and regulates Inter-State commerce. It r follows, therefore, that in proceedings under the Anti-Trust Act the Court have no jurisdiction to issue any order or injunction interfering, with the operations of combinations where the trade is confined within State lines. Then, at page 942 of the same work,, hegives a significant illustration in connection with the Addyston pipe case. This is a* case which was quoted by the honourable: member for Bendigo as proving hia view of the sufficiency of our powers to deal with these matters. It is true that there waa .a conviction obtained in the United -States Supreme Court to put down -this obviously detrimental combine. It was an interesting association of different (firms established in different States, who -entered into an agreement that a particular kind of steel pipe should not be sold below -a certain rate. They put up one of their -own people to tender, and in order to lend an air of versimilitude to their proceedings, -other members of the combine then bid a -slightly higher price themselves, and by this means this huge organization completely regulated the price of this particular kind of piping in the United States. The honourable membei for Bendigo showed that -the Addyston Trust was successfully prose-cuted in the Supreme Court, But the honourable gentleman omitted to mention the very important fact that, before being prosecuted in the Supreme Court on appeal, the Trust was prosecuted before a single Judge, who -decided that, although it was, in effect, a potentially harmful combination, designed to impede and imperil trade in a particular commodity, still it was only an Incidental interference with Inter-State -commerce. It was only on appeal to the Supreme Court that the prosecution were able to show that there was sufficient evi-dence to bring the case within the Interstate power, and so secure a conviction -against the Trust. Referring to this case, Mr Eddy saysIn the Addyston case the Supreme Court held that where the combination 'was illegal under the Act, the injunction issued could only apply to the Inter-State commerce of the combination, leaving the illegal combination to operate within the limits of any particular State, subject only to the laws of that State. The laws of the United States of America' on this subject are as various almost as are the types of man on the face of the earth. Many of them have been proved quite ineffective, and the combinations register in the States in which they believe the law against them is weakest, and when they are -successfully prosecuted as an Inter-State -concern they resolve themselves into their -component parts, and continue their nefarious work in the separate States. Owing to the flight of time, I must leave unsaid much that I proposed to say. I particularly desire to refer to the observations made by the honourable member for Darling Downs when Attorney-General, and when this opinion was asked, in connection with Mr Brennan. the framing of the South African Constitui tion, on the subject of the commerce power and extended industrial powers. The honor-, able member, having read a minute prepared by Mr Garran, Secretary to the Crown Law Department, urging the South African Government, in response to a request for advice on the subject, not to limit themselves in the way we have limited ourselves in regard to trade and commerce, appended this foot-note to the minuteI have carefully perused the memorandum prepared by Mr Garran during my absence in Queensland, and If u l l y agree with the views therein expressed. That was a memorandum issued from the office of the Prime Minister and Minister of External Affairs (the honourable member for Ballarat), and ratified by the Attorney General (the honourable member for Darling Downs), so that it represents a view which has the endorsement of practically all the leaders of the party on the opposite side. This is most important, because the views expressed were embodied in the memorandum under a sense of grave responsibility-o r should have been so-and when the consideration of the question was entirely free from party influences. We can couple this with the observations of the honourable member for Flinders, and numerous quotations to the same effect that might be made from the speeches of other honourable members on the other side, and, in the circumstances, I say that if the people of the Commonwealth, will be guided by expert advice, as well as by common sense, they should have no difficulty in accepting these proposals, and voting "" Yes"" at the referendum. honourable member for Batman, with quite unnecessary modesty, assured us at the outset of his speech that he had no intention to add anything very original to the debate now proceeding. The honourable member is always interesting to listen to, and when he indulges in intellectual and legal exercises I follow him with a good deal of attention. But occasionally the honourable member diverges into arguments and statements that seem to suggest that he has recollected that he is a member of the Labour party, and should say something in accord with their ideas and sentiments. I am afraid that on these occasions he does not reach the high intellectual level of the other portions of his address. When he assures us that under our present Constitution the Federal Parliament could",45,Hughes
157,Mr Fowler (Perth) [8.50],"Th eneutralize every particle of autonomous power possessed by the States he makes an assertion which, on further consideration, he will, I think, be inclined to modify. ,We cannot assume for a moment that the great master minds who were called together to frame the Federal Constitution did their work so badly as such a sentence would lead us to infer. They were seized with the great Federal principle which honourable members opposite have, to such a large extent, forgotten or wilfully Overlooked, that there were certain powers which could be better exercised by a Federal authority for the whole of Australia, and certain other functions which might with advantage be left in the hands of the State Parliaments. That was the simple Federal principle on which they proceeded. They have undoubtedly done their work well according to some of the best experts and authorities throughout the world. I take it that there is a certain limitation of power under our Constitution which would prevent even the most insane Federal Governments going to the lengths suggested by the honourable member for Batman. I notice that honourable members opposite have been very strong in their criticisms of inconsistencies alleged to have been discovered on this side of the House. That was all very interesting in its way, but I remind them that a far greater obligation than that is now imposed upon them. These inconsistencies may exist for all that I care, and I can well understand a number on this side of the House having looked on with feelings of more or less surprise at some of the doings of the Labour Government during their term of office. I can easily imagine such honourable gentlemen, who may have regarded the Labour party with more or less favour only a few short years ago, hesitating, in view of the experiences before them, of committing to them any more powers than they possess at present. We all know the story of George Washington and his axe, and even although his father's admiration of His truth and good intentions may have been very pronounced, I am quite confident that the parent did not present his son with a heavier and sharper axe in lieu of the one which he deprived him of. He made up his mind that the young man had done enough mischief in the garden with the old axe, and that probably it was better that he should have none at all. not go so far as to say that we should deprive the Labour Government, even if we could, of the little axe which they use now. But I think that those people who might have had an idea of presenting them with a sharper axe two and a half yearsago will conclude that the one they areusing at present is quite sharp enough. The onus of proof in connection with* these proposals lies with the Government and the party behind them, and it is not satisfactory that they should give so much attention to the observationsand the alleged inconsistencies of their opponents, while neglecting to a very largeextent to strengthen their own position, and to justify themselves before the country. The Attorney-General, who succeeds ir» suppressing his modesty much more effectually than does the honourable member for Batman, gave us to understand in his opening address that the meat with which he proposes to feed the Federation on this occasion is something better and stronger than that which was previously offered.. But after listening carefully to many of the speeches, and wading still more laboriously through the pages of Hansard, I have been forced to the conclusion thafc there is nothing particularly new in the proposals and the arguments put forward by the Government at present as compared with those with which they endeavoured to* woo the electors on a previous occasion.. To use a homely figure of speech, which will be familiar, I have no doubt, to the. Prime Minister, it appears to me that what the Government are dishing up to the Parliament and the country is nothing more orless than ""cauld kail het again."" The dish is not by any means regarded as anappetizing one. The Attorney-General has tried to make us believe that it contains, certain new ingredients, but beyond some of his most pungent pepper, I fail to seeanything particularly new in the messwhich is put before us. It is quite truethat it is dished up now much more attractively than it was on the previous occasion. The first time it was placed before the electors in the primitive old-fashioned way-the pot dumped in the middle of the floor. Now, however, we are having it dished up in various more or less ornamental tureens, in the hope that in the smaller quantities the electors may show less aversion to it than they did before. But I am very doubtful as to whether the electors will be beguiled by the renewed attempts to make them parI do take of this dish. I have seen nothing that would incline me to take the view that"" ithey wilt do other than what they did before, and that is reject the dish with contempt and contumely. In fact, looking at ""the course of events since the Government *came into office, I am inclined to think that the electors may be found more decided in Iheir rejection of these proposals than they were previously. And, speaking for my -own State, I am strongly inclined to take ithe view that, even there, we shall have a very definite rejection of the proposals which last time, for various reasons, the -electors felt inclined to adopt. If that be -so, then I feel sure that it will be the turn -of this Government, and not of the electors, to "" f a l l down with f r i g h t , "" and I ""believe that it is about time that the electors were giving the Government a lesson ""in this respect, and enabling them to realize that their minds are not so fickle, and their -opinions not so uncertain, as to justify all the expense and all the turmoil which is 'being brought upon the country at so short an interval after the previous attempt to .carry these proposals. I always enjoy an address by the honorable member for Denison. throws out his chest, and raises his -voice, there is no doubt that he is iin dead earnest, even although the 'House may not take him quite at-his own -estimate of himself. -course of the speech with which he favoured us, I heard him refer to these proposals as something which the people -desire, I felt an amount of wonder as to -where he had got that particular notion. I have heard something very like it from mother members on the opposite side. They ;talk about the necessity for tliese proposals, iand the desire of the people for them, but I have yet to learn, in what way the people have expressed any desire of the kind. -anyhow. -small majority these proposals were carried in my State; but if the honourable member -will have the patience to wait for a few months it is very probable that he will see the numbers reversed. we admit, for the sake of argument, that Western Australia did indicate a desire of that kind, as a good sound Democrat, my honourable friend must recognise that the great majority of the people of Australia were of the opposite view, and if that be so, I fail to see any force at all in the contention that the people desire this -change. A few militant trade unionists and Labourites undoubtedly do desire thei adoption of these proposals, but I have seen nothing since the last referenda to show that any considerable proportion of the people of Australia is in the least degree interested in the change which the Government wish to bring about. On the contrary, there is an increasing suspicion that it would be dangerous to give any of these enlarged powers into the hands of the Government, and as they were refused on the last occasion, there is every reason to conclude that they will be more emphatically refused this time. the part of a Jeremiah; but it is sometimes necessary to warn men like my honourable friends opposite of the fact that they are committing, unwittingly, political suicide, and certainly it is my duty to do my best to show the people of Australia the dangerous position into which the Labour party wish to lead them. The honourable member for Herbert is absolutely honest and straightforward in his attitude as to When he Unification; but the position is somewhat different as regards many of his colleagues, whatever they may say to the contrary. It is possible they do not f u l l y comprehend their position, but there is no doubt But when, in the whatever that these proposals, in the aggregate, mean a very long stride indeed towards Unification. They may not go all; the way, but if the suggestions of the A t torney-General as regards the regulation of prices are to be taken seriously, there is no doubt that if any attempt is made to carry these proposals into practice to the extent indicated, we shall have, not only Unification, in the ordinary sense, but a Socialist State, which will be found to be all that the honourable member for New England desired a few sessions ago under the sweeping proposition which he put before the House. I would I admit that by a give many members of the party credit for the inner conviction that these proposals of theirs are not altogether for the good of the country, as a whole. During thisdebate, I have listened to speeches from Suppose that the opposite side that did not carry any great weight, as it appeared to me, by reason of a lack of conviction about them, I feel sure that there are members opposite vvho have their doubts as to the wisdom of the course which the party, as a whole, are pursuing.

There are influences behind the leaders that make them in many respects leaders only in name. The pace is being continually quickened by those behind them, and there is no doubt that if they do not keep in front they will be remorselessly and ruthlessly pushed aside. I do not think that the country is of the same mind to be driven as are some honourable members on the opposite side. The bulk of the electors are satisfied that the Federal contract, as originally drawn, was well and wisely made, and if our Governments are only honest and earnest in their attempts to carry out their duties under the Constitution, there will be no lack of effective law-making and effective administration as regards all those evils which are now said to be threatening the Commonwealth. It has been shown time and again by some of our best constitutional authorities that we have practically all the be assumed that either the Federation or power required to do the things which the Labour Government say they cannot do. The Government had reason to refrain from putting their hand to the plough so definitely and so earnestly as they might have been expected to do. Now that the elections are coming on, and many promises remain unfulfilled, naturally Ministers feel that they must have excuses, and be able to bring forward reasons why they should have another term of office. One of these reasons will, no doubt, be that they require further opportunity to give effect to their promises. But I do not think that the country is inclined to risk any more experimenting, and I believe that, after the next election, it will be left to a Liberal Government to show the extent to which the Constitution is operative in directions in which this Labour Government say that it fails. I do not know what Ministers would do on the present occasion had they not the trust bogy with which to frighten the electors. We are told quite seriously that, because the trusts sometimes fix prices, the Governin power. ment should step in and do it instead of them. That is a very curious argument. Would it be said that because burglars sometimes raid houses burglary should be made a State industry? My opinion is that the majority of the electors hold the common-sense view that it will be sufficient not to take over the trusts, but to prevent them exploiting the public. I feel sure that, under our Federal law, when the occasion arises, trusts will be dealt witb effectively by any honest Government that may be in power, and I shall require much more evidence than is yet available to causeme to change that opinion. The honourable member for Batman, in attempting to reply to the honourable member for Bendigo, misrepresented his line of argument, though, I think, unintentionally. I have .listened to, and read very carefully, the: speech of the honourable member for Bendigo to which he referred, and others on the same subject, and I know of nothing in them justifying his criticism that the honourable member for Bendigo looks upon, the Federal and State Governments as in conflict. On the contrary, the honourable member for Bendigo takes the true Federal view that they operate harmoniously, possessing co-ordinate and not antagonisticpowers, and mutual interests. It is not to the States would do the mad things that: the honourable member for Batman hinted at. If the members of a Government wereto lose their heads entirely, they might doa great deal of evil; but under our Con-' stitution there will always be a delimitation of frontier, and, under ordinary circumstances, friendly co-operation, by the powers operating on each side of the frontier line. In spite of a certain amount of friction between this Government and others of a different politicaL complexion, there is nothing to justify apprehension of any very grave conflict between Federal and State authorities. For one reason, the High Court is charged with, the duty of acting practically as umpire: between the two authorities, and, in addition, there is the safeguard of commont sense, which, in the long run, generally governs British politics. If any Goverament, Federal or State, oversteps thebounds of common-sense and justice, they will be brought to book at the earliest moment by the electors who placed them, We have been told time and again that it is necessary to enlarge the powers of the Commonwealth, because the Upper Houses of the State Legislatures are Conservatives.

163,Mr Fowler,"The honourable memberstrong and definite stand on this point, holding the view that, even if one or more State Legislatures have Conservative and reactionary Upper Houses, that is not a reason for throwing the Constitution into the melting-pot, to emerge in a form quite un-Federal, and, therefore, quite unsuited to the necessities of Australia. While I admit that, from my point of view, some of the Legislative Councils are objectionable, the majority are not open, to the charges made against them by honourable members opposite. The Legislative Council of Victoria might be pointed to as justifying the proposed changes; but, as I read the public opinion of this State, the electors are not inclined to make any great effort to reform their Upper House. If they were desirous of reforming it, it would .not remain long unimproved. chise which would enable them to reform it. were a strong, definite movement for reform in the Victorian Upper House, nothing could withstand it. But the electors -of the States seem to be by no means as hostile to their Upper Houses as honourable members would have us believe. ing at some of these Upper Houses, I. fail to see any strong reason for ihe vials of wrath that are being poured .upon them. In the State from which I come, for instance, the Upper House Is .constituted on what is practically a houseago. That, I venture to say, is a charge 'hold suffrage. Surely it is not an altogether un-democratic basis, that practically the head of every family should have a vote for that Chamber. -that there are many householders who are by no means Conservative, and, as a matter of fact, the Upper House in Western Australia is having steadily added to it at we have passed, I find that almost every -each election a considerable number of pronounced Democrats, and even Labour men. That is as it should be, and' I believe in other parts of the Commonwealth the position is no worse. If these Upper Houses, after all, show certain signs of -improvement in the right direction, we have very little justification for making such a sweeping change as is now proposed simply ^because one, or perhaps more, of those Chambers is of an altogether reactionary and Conservative character. Let the people anost concerned-the people of those States -where the complaint is made-besti r them-selves to obtain reform of the institutions making burglary a State enterprise. If , complained of. That is the legitimate line of advance, rather than that which is now being proposed of recasting the Federal Constitution, merely because there is a difficulty in obtaining legislation arid administration in certain directions in some of the States. I did not intend to detain the House very long when I rose, and will now conclude. I feel quite certain that the debate as a whole will have tended to the further enlightenment of the people of Australia on this subject,and I am equally confident that the result of that enlightenment will be to confirm the opinion of the electors in regard to the position which they took up at the last referenda. Mr W. J. JOHNSON (Robertson) [9.24] I regard this as an occasion when those who hold the honourable position of representing the people in this House should not record a silent vote. That being so, while we are told that there is nothing new under the sun, I venture to contribute a few remarks to this debate, although it is quite possible that when I shall have concluded it will be said that I have not broken any new ground. I must, at the outset, dissent from the remark Lookmade by the honourable member for Perth that the. Government are submitting these questions to the people by way of referenda merely to cover up unfulfilled promises made by them and their supporters when seeking election nearly three years that cannot justly be laid at the doors of the present Administration. As a matter of fact, this Parliament's record of We must assume achievement, under the leadership of the Fisher Government', is of a unique character. Comparing the platform on which we went tp the people with the measures which promise then made by us to the electors has, as far as the Constitution will permit, been fulfilled. Therefore, the suggestion that by this referenda we are seeking only to cloak up some unfulfilled promises made to the people is by np means correct. I also dissent from the suggestion that the fact that trusts and combines are robbing the people is not a sufficient justification for seeking the power to nationalize them. The honourable member said, by way ofillustration, that if burglars were carrying on their nefarious practices to a large extent, surely that would not be a reason for",50,Hughes
164,Mr Riley,They have not the fran,51,Hughes
165,Mr Fowler,"In these days, if therehowever, burglarious enterprises are increasing in number, it is certainly the duty of the authorities to strengthen the police force and, if necessary, to enlarge our gaols. combines are robbing the producers, the .workers, or the consumers generally, that surely is first class evidence that legislation to prevent that sort of thing is demanded. The Government, in my opinion, are to be congratulated on the fact that they are again submitting these questions to the people. for their rejection on the last occasion. Some urge that they were not understood by the electors, whilst others contend that if adopted they would have been detrimental to the best interests of the country. Whilst varied reasons are given for their rejection, the outstanding and unmistakeable fact is that on the last occasion there was not associated with the carrying of the referenda the fate of a Ministry. The carrying or rejection of those proposals could not affect the position of the Government or their supporters. On this occasion, however, the Government, knowing full well that these propositions for the amendment of the Constitution have been for some reason or other rejected by a large majority, venture to put them forward again, closely associated with the individual success of their supporters and themselves in the political campaign. As a Government supporter, I shall tell the people in my electorate that it is their duty, first of all, to vote for our referenda proposals, and then to support the candidate who advocates them. Ever since Federation became an accomplished fact, and perhaps for a little time before, the referendum, as an instrument of government, has been growing more and more in the favour of the people. There could be no better way of educating public opinion, and of ascertaining what is really the public will. These several questions which are to be submitted to the people will, if adopted, enlarge the powers of this Parliament in such a way as will enable the Government of the day-whethe r it be a Labour or a Liberal Administration-to pass legislation which is at the present time essential and necessary for the well-being of the people. I am bound to confess that we have a grand Constitution. It was the work of some of the greatest minds that Australia has ever produced. It was recommended to the. people by those great men who drew it up, and who advocated it as an instrument of government worthy of acceptance. One of the chief reasons which they put forward in< favour of it was that the Constitution was In the same way, if trusts and capable of amendment. The people of Australia were recommended to accept it, and were assured that it could be altered from time to time as necessity arose. It was pointed out that many alterations had been made in the Constitution of the United' States during the history of that country. But I must say that some of those gentleMany reasons are put forward men who advocated the adoption of the Australian Constitution, to some extent misled the electors, when they failed to mention that the amendments made in the American Constitution were mostly of a purely formal character, and did not involvequestions of vital importance. Much that has been said during the present debate has been very wide of the mark. The honourable member for Parkes dealt pretty liberally with the question of majority rule. He said that our previous referenda proposals were rejected by an overwhelming majority, but that nevertheless the aggregate majority of votes placed the present Government upon the Treasury benches. But whilst the honourable member was dealing; with majority rule, he might have informed the House that he himself does not represent a majority of the electors in his constituency. I have taken the trouble to look intothe figures, and find that the honourable member sits here representing a minority to the extent of 2,533 votes. Associated with him in that respect is the honourable member for Richmond, who sits here representing a minority to the extent of 4,645. through the splitting of theLiberal vote. Mr W. J. JOHNSON I am not prepared to say what was the reason. Just as the honourable member for Parkes appeared to consider that it was only his business to state part of the facts, so there is no need for me to do more than state part of the f actson the other side. The honourable member for Illawarra introduced a side issue whentalking of export duties on wheat and butter. He accused honourable members on this sideof having advocated such duties. Whilst the matter is fresh in our minds I wish toquote from the Mudgee Guardian of 2nd May, 1912, which reports the proceedings connected with the opening of a new flour mill. A speech was made by Mr A. C. Gaskin, who is well known in the-",51,Hughes

It is alleged against the Sydney agents 'heing fostered by protective tariffs; why roas it that the oldest form of industry-on e of the to fix beforehand the maTket price of fruit, thus soundest, and one which benefited the people more than any other-wa s not fostered by 'bonuses. Every ton of flour exported from New South Wales was being exportedat a loss. The reason of this was because shippers bought wheat, sent it to England or the Continent, where wages and machinery cost 50 per cent, less, and there turned it into flour. Australia -only milled about one-sixth of her wheat, she should mill the whole of it . Wheat should be -prevented from being exported by means of an -export duty. I have quoted that passage to show that there are men who are practically engaged -in the flour-milling industry who believe that an export duty on wheat should be imposed for the purpose of stimulating their 'business. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -Yes. He is an active member of a Liberal League in ""the district. -the misrepresentation of the honourable mem--ber for Illawarra. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -That is why I -read the passage. It is useless to deny that there are trusts and combines operating in Australia, as in most other countries of the world. It is absolutely futile for honourable members opposite to attempt to deny that. I wish to quote a passage from a re>cent issue of one of the daily newspapers to show that it is recognised by the Western Australian Government that there is a ma-chinery combine or trust in operation. On the 4th March a telegram was received by -one of the Sydney newspapers from Perth, to the following, effectI t has been announced by the Premier, Mr of $5,000, or less. This week the same melanScaddan, that the Government intends to undertake the manufacture of agricultural implements and machinery, and he suggested the advertising in Australia for an engineering supervisor at a salary which would induce the best men in Australia to apply for the position. I take it that in every State of the Commonwealth concern is being expressed by the people as to the operations of the Machinery Trust, otherwise the Government at present in office in Western Australia would not have felt the necessity of making an arrangement to protect the people. Evidence of a fruit -ring is given in the following extract from the Singleton BudgetA New South Wales orchardist visiting the Huon district, in Tasmania, is emphatic in condemning the shipping ring in Sydney, which He is reported to he declares, acts most detrimentally in the interests of Tasmanian growers. Tasmanian apples, which bring the exporter 5s. per case, are retailed in Sydney at the rate of 25s. per that one of the least questionable practices is giving the produce a value which is not in accord with the natural price, as fixed by the law of supply and demand, but made either high or low, to suit the ring. That was written by a New South Wales orchardist who visited the Huon district in Tasmania. Mr Goodsir, who represents Messrs. W. Weddel and Company, merchants, of London, recently gave evidence before the Empire Trade Commission, in the following words :Since the Beef Trust commanded a capital of £15,000,000 sterling there was nothing to prevent its success in Australia, if it desired to buy up meat interests there. In one of the Melbourne newspapers I recently read that the Chief Secretary of Victoria had announced that his Government had decided to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the working of the Brick Combine in the State. Once a trust gets control of a single industry, it seeks to amalgamate with other trusts, and the result we find in what are, so to speak, trustified trusts. I read the following in a Sydney newspaper the other day :Sir Marcus Samuel, head of British capitalists, representing the Shale Transportation Co., has bought out the UnionO i l Co., of California, for £10,000,000. The following quotation from the Financial World shows the effect of trusts and combines on small business people:For many weeks with monotonous regularity the commercial agencies whose business it is to look after such matters have reported that the majority of firms that had failed and gone into the Bankruptcy Court had a capital choly record is made, and actually g i per cent, of the 239 business houses which failed throughout the country during the week, had a capital of $5,000, or less. What does this mean? It means that the small manufacturers and the retailers are being crowded to the wall by the big businessesThere can be no doubt that the big business houses that we find in every town and city in Australia tend to crowd the smalt retailers out; and when once a business, of any kind whatever, is concentrated in a few hands, the prices go up to the detriment of the public. During the twelve years of Federation many attempts have been made by our political leaders, and those associated with them, to place on the statute-book legislation beneficial to the people; but the results have not always been satisfactory.*",52,Hughes
167,Mr Roberts,I s that man a Liberal?,53,Hughes
168,Mr Roberts,"We can put that againstWe found ourselves unable to apply the new Protection under the High Court ruling, and the law we passed in that connection is now a dead letter. We remember that the honourable member for Ballarat, as Prime Minister, presented to this House a .memorandum in which he declared that it -was necessary that further constitutional powers should be given in order to carry out the new Protection proposals. Further evidence that greater powers are necessary in this Parliament is afforded in the memoranda presented by the ex-Attorney-Gene.rals, the honourable member for Angas and the honourable member for Darling Downs. We all remember the fate that overtook the Seamen's Compensation Bill. The benefits that that legislation was ""intended to confer were successfully fought for in the Courts, so far as the verdict went, but it was a very -different matter when it came to the application of the law. The case for the extension of the powers under the Commonwealth Constitution is strengthened by the remarks of MrH . Y. Braddon, the manager for Dalgety and Company, Sydney, in an address which he delivered on the 25th April last, on the subject of "" Company Law : Some sidelights on modern commerce."" In the course of his remarks that gentleman saidThe company laws of the Australian States had been copied from time to time from the English Acts, and throughout the Commonwealth there was a regular jumble of company conditions. They should have one company law, and one bankruptcy law in Australia.

Austrastatements which are in their very essence lian Workers Union. I regard the honourable member for Darling as a sort of industrial godfathera man with whom it has been an honour and a pleasure to be associated. Prior to the days of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court nothing but turmoil arid unrest were experienced in the pastoral industry. But since that tribunal has been established, and the men engaged in the industry have been permitted to appeal to it, industrial peace has reigned. Their wages and conditions of employment have been materially improved, and the women and children dependent on them have had reason to thank God that we have a Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. The employers, too, would be very loth indeed to revert to the old state of affairs. This afternoon the honourable member for Moreton attributed to the honourable member for Flinders a remark to the effect that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, instead of being a place where industrial disputes are settled, has become an industrial storm centre. In opposition to that I propose to quote from a speech delivered by the honourable member for Flinders at St. Kilda on 15th May last. On that occasion he saidWith regard to the power of industrial control greater difficulties arise. I have no hesitation in saying that ultimately the control of industrial relations must rest with the Parliament which controls the fiscal policy of Australia and the general Inter-State trade relations. by the honourable member for Moreton.

So far the honourable member for Robertson is quite in order. Mr W. J. JOHNSON Mr Justice Higgins continuesThere has never been a strike against any award made by my predecessor or myself. have been three or four strikes to my knowledge. Mr VV. J. JOHNSON Mr Justice Higgins proceedsThere have never been refusals on thepart of employers or employees to carry out the terms of an award. Mr W. J. JOHNSON There have been no cases brought to my notice in whicb any award has been disobeyed by any master or man. As to the Court embittering the relations of employers and employees, there has been indubitable proof to the contrary. Many groups of employees have been held back from striking by their leaders because the leaders have been able to induce them to wait for a remedy from this Court. Unfortunately, some people look only to the strikes which have taken place which this Court could not deal with, and cannot realize the strikes which would have taken place but for the existence of this Court. They will not see, because they do not feel that there have been several disastrous strikes averted by conferences held under the Act of the President with the parties. In 1006, one agreement was registered in the Court, in 1007 one, in 1908 four, in 1909 three, in 1910 twenty-four, and in i g n ninety-three. Most of these agreements I am informed by the registrar have been the result of proceedings for arbitration in this Court. I have no desire to further occupy the time of honourable members. I merely wish to add that 1 am wholehearted in my support of these proposals. I would point out that in supporting them the honourable member for Flinders saidSooner or later we must be prepared to vest in the national Parliament \he powers that are necessary to achieve great national objects. . . . adjourned. iThey were afraid to vest that power unlimitedly; let us protect ourselves as they did in Canada and say that the States shall have exclusive rights to deal with certain things. When the people of Australia agreed to federate, they did so in the belief that 10.30 a.m. to-morrow. Acts passed by a Federal Parliament would operate all over Australia moreeasily if administered by one Government than would similar legislation passed by the State Parliaments and administered by six separate Governments. Upon the consummation of Federation< we became a nation, and the peopleof Australia, in my judgment, will not now reject the opportunity which will! be afforded them to give effect to the desires they expressed when the Constitution Bill was submitted fo them for acceptance. They accepted it believing; that they would thus become a nation capable of making laws for the good government of the Commonwealth more effectively from that date onward than they had been, able to do at any preceding time. I have no hesitation in saying that, be the result of the reference of these questions to the people what it may, they will find a much, larger measure of support than they did' on a previous occasion. The objection> urged on the last occasion to the complexity of the questions is now removed by the fact that instead of two questions embracing several subjects there will, on this occasion, be six questions dealing practically with the same subject-matter. Honourable members opposite, on the last occasion, objected that the questions submitted to the people were too complex and involved, and' they complain that the questions now proposed to be submitted to the people are too numerous and plain. It is, indeed, most difficult to satisfy the opponents of these proposals, many of whom oppose them only for party reasons. We have heard some of the most brilliant men on the other side assert that they still adhere to all they said in the past regarding-the desirability of legislation of this kind. Their opinion is the same now as it was two years ago, or at any time since; but they are not prepared, for party reasons,, to give their support to these proposals, which I , and those associated with me, consider necessary and essential to be giveneffect to for the good government of the Commonwealth.
