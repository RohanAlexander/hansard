In the course of a few days, and as Boon as able to be moved, he would, in all probability, be removed to some other centre, so as to make room for fresh cases from the front. These hospitals are scattered over a wide area, including the iEgean Sea, Dardanelles, Alexandria, Cairo, Assouan, Malta; while many of the wounded are in or en route to England. The lists of wounded would be compiled as the men were despatched from the scene of operations, and the compiling officers would, in all probability, not have the slightest idea of their destination. In view, therefore, of the fact that wounded must, in -most cases, necessarily be moving on from hospital to hospital, it is not deemed to be of any practical value to delay the notificawhich I do not desire to do. I ask honortion of our casualties while the information is being obtained.

37,Mr Josephcook,"I desire tofront. Several honourable members interjecting, honourable members to discontinue these interjections. The honourable member for Parramatta bas appealed to me for protection against this continuous interruption. If honourable members persist in these tactics I shall he obliged to take a course to prevent further disorder of the kind. members on the Government side have fought many valiant battles to acquire for the people of Australia the right to determine, without let or hindrance, their own destiny as far as it is possible for them to do so under the laws of the country in which we live, but there is the outnot believe it. standing fact that 60,000 of our citizens have left these shores to fight for the safety of the remainder in Australia, and by these proposals the Government are submitting the most supreme of all questions, the Constitution which governs them as well as us, and which fixes the destiny of all of us, to a referendum of the of a house while the house is burning. Is people in the absence of those soldiers, and without affording them the privilege of voting on the issue. Surely that is a complete subversion of democratic rule aud principle. Moreoveri t is a political crime of the deepest dye against those brave fellows who are fighting at the front. amended in the absence of 60,000 of our citizens who are fighting for their lives, and, above all, for our lives? Is it treatAttorney-General, who is in charge of ing those soldiers fairly to persevere with these proposals at this time? The 4,000,000 people living at home in safety are asked to decide this great issue in the absence of the 60,000 who are at the front helping to keep the fire-sides of the 4,000,000 warm and safe. I care not of what complexion the absent vote may be. Honourable members opposite claim that it would be a labour vote. Let it be so; I am not concerned with that point, but I am concerned with the fact that 60,000 men are deprived of the right to vote, and were not told that in their absence the Constitution would be altered, and made a different sort of instrument altogether. That is my first indictment against this procedure of the Government -that on democratic grounds these men have as much right to be consulted in the alteration of our Constitution as we who are still in the country have. there before the Rill is through. are told is correct, before these Bills are submitted, there will be 80,000 soldiers away from these shores. Is this procedure fair to them? the Canadians who were at the front to vote, and they did vote. members think that it is possible to make provision for voting in the trenches? the trenches, and they did vote. am telling a lie; but they did. do not believe that they were able to vote. In the meantime all we are doing in Australia is to talk about the reconstruction this the time to be tinkering with its reconstruction-wit h its alteration here and there in detail? Surely the first thing you should do is to get the fire engines, and to devote all your energies to putting the fire out. Then, afterwards, you may do what you will with its strucOught the Constitution to be tural position. If there be one man more than another who sees the light in this respect it is the these Bills. No man saw it more clearly than he did a little while ago. I cannot do better than quote his language. then. time when there was no Parliament in existence, when it was not possible to do what he suggested. Nowi t is possible. There is a Government, there is a Parliament, and all we are asking is that this Parliament should concentrate its energies upon the supremest of all questions, putting away these considerations until we are able to devote ourselves to them without the intrusion of the war.

What then remains. How can Mr Cook consult us and we co-operate with him, and at the same time go on with party warfare. We cannot at once have party warfare ' and united action. you say to that? what I say now. said on the first occasion. would. Then the Attorney-General went on' We cannot go on to the platform and denounce the Government, and at the same time work with the Government. The choice lies between party and the welfare of the nation. It rests with Mr Cook to make his choice. He says party strife must continue throughout the Empire. His is the only voice that says so. I say that, throughout the Empire today, his-the Attorney-General's of Australia-is the only voice that says party strife must continue. May I in this connection call honourable members' attention . to the the Imperial Prime Minister, which came to us only yesterday, and I want to put the two statements in contrast, because they seem to me to so completely put the setting of things as we are seeing them to-day, after ten months of war? If things were serious then, and the honourable member was so anxious to stop party strife, so anxious to help us to do everything in the prosecution of the war, surely matters are even more serious to-day. . Speakingi n the light of this graver situation, Mr Asquith uses this languageI come reluctantly to think that there should be a' broadening of the basis of Government, so as to remove even a semblance of a one-sided party character. That would demonstrate to our people at Home, our fellow-subjects across the seas, to our Allies and enemies, as well as neutrals, that the British people were more resolute than ever in their one aim and purpose. Mr Asquith states also that they were determined to obliterate all distinctions until every personal and political, as well as moral and material, force was devoted to the prosecution of the Empire's cause. The Prime Minister of Great Britain stated, in fact, that the national emergency demanded the unreserved and whole-hearted co-operation of all parties. Its Government was reconstructed, so as to intimate to the British people over the seas that there was not a shred of party difference in Great Britain. Everything savouring of party has been put away. Everything is being concentrated with the one object of effectively prosecuting the war. Contrast this with the statement of our Prime Minister. He saysI said to that We are not here as children playing in a dangerous place. I wish you have that confirmation of his attitude. We are not here as children playing in a dangerous place, likely to be attacked by the enemy. If we do not exercise our power and authority whilst we are practically at peace, when shall we? That was a scandalous statement for tlie Prime Minister to make, but the Prime Minister repeats it here, and now. ' to his shame and scandal able member must not use language of that description, and I ask him not to weighty words of repeat it . I ask the House to look at this statement. Are we practically at peace? Is this the attitude of the Government? I s it the attitude of the party behind the Government that we are practically at peace? And that there is no let or hindrance to our proceeding with our ordinary party programmes and party propaganda? Here is the statement, repeated and emphasized, this morning, that there is no dangerthat we are practically at peace, and, therefore, that we should not be obsessed, as the Attorney-General was nine months ago, with the one idea of the war,, but that our first business here should be the perpetuation of party conflict, puttingthis great national war as far into the background as possible. I should like our men in the trenches to hear this statement by the PrimeM in ister.

"" own correspondent in the field sending an appeal for more men; and yet the Prime Minister tells us that we are at peace, and should get on w i th our business^-that there is no danger-that we are not in a dangerous position. ThisI cannot understand. think that the right honourable gentleman does not read of what is going on, or he would not make such statements. Times has, I suppose, the best military correspondent on tlie Continent to-day, and he tells us that, as the result of our efforts-as the result of our sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of lives, and the desolation of hundreds of thousands of homes-w e are practically where we were, except that our resources are being gradually better organized. Then, again, my newspaper this morning informs me about a battle in Galicia. In reading these cables, we must remember that all have been heavily censored-that much has been taken out-and yet we are permitted to know that the Russians are being heavily tried. Reading between the lines, that means-if it means anything at all-that the Russians are being beaten right out once more. We are told of a British advance, and of some trenches having been taken; but a little further on, General French reports thab these trenches were retaken by the Germans. These are all heavily censored messages, it must be remembered, and this is the news that is coming to us every day. Let me read it And let us not forget that tlie abolition of union restrictions at Home is being agreed to by the union leaders. old friend Ben Tillett, than whom I suppose there has never beena more flaming propagandist in the interests of all that relates to the well-being of the worker, has been on a visit to the front , and he makes this statement in the paper this morning in the course of an interview in Paris on his return-, I have learned"" a new meaning for the word "" strike."" We have got to strike now, and with every ounce of British grit, energy, gold, and brains behind the blow.

We want shells and gas, and every death-dealing device conceivable. "" Give our soldiers the proper backing."" Thab ought to be the keynote of our action here. I am inclined to orable member say that we can give our soldiers the proper backing while we are discussing these proposals here, and in The dulging in this party warfare? warfare ? be party warfare? For the simple reason that it is intended by the honourable member to be party warfare. It is in tended by the Government to carry out the decision of the Inter-State Conference in Adelaide the other day. to carry out the party propaganda on which they have consulted the country a number of times, but have refused to take the country's decision. Why should it be party warfare? Surely the honourable member, as well as his leader, has his tongue in his cheek when he asks should these referenda be the subject of party warfare. aim at the radical alteration of our Constitution by the complete elimination of the Federal principle, and yet the honourable member asks, "" Why should it be regarded as a party question?"" Is there any other question in the whole purview of our party relations which has.one tithe of the party tincture that these questions have? How absurd, therefore, is the statement that this is not a party matter. Besides, this is only a new cry. Hitherto these question's have always been regarded as the dividing line-as marking the great distinction between parties in this Commonwealth ; but now that the war is overshadowing us the honourable member makes the appeal that they should be regarded as a great national matter, and not as a party issue at all. I repeat that our part of the Empire is the only one where this kind of thing is taking place. What for? What is the motive underlying it?

114,Mr Joseph Cook,"Thes e proposalsgoing up. But is not the cost of living going up everywhere in the world just now ? Is not the cost of living in Australia up just now because of the drought? Would not the cost of living have been up had there been no war? What has the war done in Australia, so far as our financial relations are concerned? So far as our business relations are concerned, with one or two singular exceptions, we have had enough money to finance ourselves. There never was a war conducted where there was so much available money, and so many business operations, as there are at present in connection with this war. I venture to say that the war is not responsible for the increase in the cost of living in Australia, except to a slight extent, and that slight extent is far below the extent to which prices have risen all over the world. For instance, we are told that the price of beef is up, and the honourable member for Indi asked a series of questions as to the increase in Victoria, carefully singling out those articles affected by the drought-beef , bread, sugar, and such like things; Well, as to beef, may I remind honourable members what they probably read in the papers only yesterday, that beef in Austria is 3s. 4d. per lb. There is a result of the war if you like. AndI say that, considering that a world war is being waged, we ought to be profoundly thankful that beef is no higher than it is in Australia to-day. That is my feeling in this matter. AndI want to know now how will these referenda proposals, if carried, help to bring prices down ? Isi t necessary to tear up our Constitution and interfere with our preparations for war because the price of beef is a little high just now? Surely there is a strange want of proportion in the settir-g of the whole case. cognises that he has power already. Justice Street has delivered the final word on this matter of beef prices. He says that, after a full investigation, the Trusts aimed at in this propaganda are not causing any injury to Australia so far as our present beef prices are concerned. Then we are told that there is a sugar monopoly ; but yet the other day, on thefloorof this House, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports was careful to tell us that we had cheaper sugar in Australia than anywhere else in the world. the war. fact. The Minister himself had to admit in Adelaide that there were worse combines than the Sugar Combine. Well, let it be so. But cannot these combines wait a little longer while we are finishing this combine of the Germans and the Austrians? That is the combine we have to face just now, for that is the combine the removal of which brooks of no delay. It will submit to no arbitration. It has to be fought out and down before there can be national peace again. And then we are told that the price of bread is up. I regret that bread is up a little, but, surely,, it is because of the drought and not because of the war. In Sydney the Necessary Commodities Commission the other day decided not to grant the bakers any further increase in. the price of the loaf. Will any one say that in war time a 4^d. loaf is a thing to require the elimination of the Federal principle from our Constitution? Can it be said, that because bread is temporarily dear, that is a reason for entering at this time of all others upon a great constitutional struggle? These are the cases that honourable members opposite cite. I want to see cheap beef, cheap sugar, and cheap bread, but I say you will not make them one whit cheaper by political strife. tical action. says that he has all the power at present. say in reply to the honourable member for Bendigo is that, between his party and the five Labour parties of the States, they have all the political power they require at present.

My last words are not to this House; they are to the citizens of Australia, to the fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters of this country upon whom depend largely what troops and equipment shall be sent to the front; upon whom will rest the responsibility of raising the forces that we need. Notwithstanding any political disturbance that may arise, the hearts of the people. I believe, are beating true, irrespective of politics, irrespective of party warfare. The nation is in trouble. We are determined to see the trouble through; and, having provided all these forces of both men and money, it is our business to proceed with the ordinary work of government, and especially is it our business^ in my opinion, to proceed with this necessary amendment of the Constitution, so as to enable the Commonwealth Government to give effect to the will of the people, and to protect the people's interests.

I am not going to speaK of the matters which the. Prime Minister referred to as having occurred in the past.

Sir WILLIAMIRVINE We do not want a chance just now. whole of this Parliament-and this is the only reference I shall make to the pastthe Opposition has placed itself under the closest and most continuous restraint with regard to the actions of the Government. Time and again there have been opportunities which, under ordinary normal circumstances, would have been availed of, for pointing out what members of the Oppositon regarded as grave defects in the conduct and administration of matters arising out of the war. time and time again these opportunities have been deliberately passed by by honourable members on this side. only when the Government, who, in this matter, are not acting as free agentsneither they nor the honourable members who support them are free, but are carrying out the express directions of a body which is superior to them and their supporters-sa y that they are now going to plunge Australia into what must be the bitterest political conflict that could possibly be aroused, that we as an Opposition have considered it our duty, in the only way open to us, to ask the House to decide that the country shall not be plunged into internecine political warfare while our sons and brothers are dying on the battlefield. There is the simple issue, cloak it as you w ill ; and there is not one honourable member on the Government side of the House who, if he were free, would not endorse such a statement of the case. honourable member say that we are not pledged to do this? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE The Attorney-General asks why I say that the Government in this matter are not free agents. man and his Leader, a week or two ago, leave on one side for a whole week the most important business of this country, in order that they might attend a Conference in Adelaide to receive the directions of their political supporters? And when, they came back, did not the honourable member and his Leader deliberately alter the order of procedure which they had set out for this House, and introduce, at the bidding of those supporters, the particular measure now before us ? There is no truth in what the honourable member says. During the Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I did not "" say "" anything; I simply asked a quest i o n ; and, although the ordinary rules of courtesy in this House prevent me from expressing my disbelief in any thing that is actually said here, I , like every member of the public, am entitled, notwithstanding the Attorney-General's denial, to form my own conclusion as to the necessary inference to be drawn from the facts. What is the present position? It is one of the defects of the system under which my honourable friends opposite conduct Buttheir parliamentary proceedings, the system by which they are appointed, and through which they gain their places in It is this House, that they are given, from time to time, general sailing orders by a political Conference. They have now placed over them a political executive, the object of which, as stated in the motion published in the press, is to see that the resolutions and objectives of the Conference are carried out by the Labour party in this Parliament. One of the objectives of that Conference is the immediate introduction of these Bills. The Attorney-General now wishes to appear as a free, responsible Minister, acting upon his own judgment in introducing this B ill . Sir WILLIAMIRVINE The more emphatically the honourable member makes his denial, the more it comes into striking contrast with the facts as we know them. The Government, acting under the directions of a political Conference In what way does the which was held some weeks ago, and which itself was composed of representatives who had been appointed some little time before, are now placing these Bills before Parliament, in order to carry into effecta resolution affirmed, I believe, some conD i d not the honourable gentlesiderable time ago.

162,Honourable Member,You have Mr HUGHES -No! Emphatically no!,18,Shells Foe The Army Labour To Be Mobilized Abolition Of Union Restrictions
163,Mr Hughes,"I say that emphatically.views of a large number of those who placed the Labour party in power. I read this from a hundred different signs. I know it from my own personal experience. Less than a week ago, I had the privilege of addressing a huge gathering consisting, as I am assured, and firmly believe, to a large extent of people who are either direct supporters of, or sympathizers with, the Labour party in this Parliament. AndI can assure honourable members that that gathering was unanimous and most enthusiastic in the determination that there should be an end to this wretched party conflict until the war is over. The Prime Minister made the statement that this Government had done all they could to aid the Mother Country; that they had given to the Mother Country kindly and sympathetic consideration. Good heavens! are we blind? Are honourable members opposite blind to the danger which hangs over us at the present moment? The Leader of the Opposition has sketched the present position in Europe. Let me deal a little further with it. Any one who reads the newspapers can see that, on the Eastern war frontier, the power of Russia to actively participate for the present in any serious blow against the coalition of our enemies is either broken or being broken, and that before long the 700,000 or 800,000 enemy troops who are in one part of the Galician movement will be thrown back to aid the Germans in their attack upon our own men in Flanders. In addition to that, we must not lose sight of the fact that the cable news which we read in the papers from day to day has been censored, and that what is more, everything is put in the most favorable light to us. That cannot be denied. Our own men who are fighting in the Dardenelles are backing up an almost impossible position. calling to us. speech more calculated to hearten the Germans in their business than this speech by the honourable member. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE accusation back in the honourable member's teeth. If the Attorney-General and his party persist in throwing down this bone of contention, they and their Government will fall under the imputation of not being sincere in carrying on this war. The honourable member knows this and knows it well. Do we not also know that an efficient censorship has been provided in order to enable us here to speak the truth concerning matters affecting the welfare of Australia without danger of information being given to the enemy? The only reasonable conclusion that we can draw from the facts is that the result of this war hangs in the balance, and that we are now at the most critical point in the most dangerous war that has ever threatened our safety. And yet the Prime Minister talks in this way of the Mother Country! What stake has the Mother Country, great as it is, compared with the stake that we in Australia have ? Is there an honourable member opposite who will venture to suggest that if we are beaten in this war Australia will not come tinder the domination of Germany? ber think that the passing or non-passing of these Referenda Bills will decide the great issues of the war? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I do not. It is well-known that I personally would go a long way towards the object that the Government have in view in the desire to enlarge the powers of the Federal Parliament. The passing or non-passing of these referenda proposals, when they are ultimately submitted to the people, will, have no effect on the war. But this invitation to the whole of the people of Australia to engage in what we all know will be a bitter political conflict, will have a very deleterious effect on Australia's share of the war. That is my answer to the honourable member. Several honourable members interjecting, members on both sides are again interjecting, notwithstanding my request that they They are should desist. I ask the honourable member for Barrier and the honourable member for Calare to cease interjecting. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I do not intend to occupy much further the time of the House. We desire, in the most emphatic way, to make an appeal to honorI hurl that able members to open their eyes to the actual situation confronting them. We appeal to the Prime Minister, above all others, to take his courage in both hands and to come forward and lead the people of Australia.

174,Mr Hughes (Attorney,"Generalto damage opponents in the eyes of the public, what is party warfare? have they omitted to say that they could have said ? They tell us that they have shown in every discussion since the beginning of this Parliament a severe restraint. But it is this affectation of restraint that makes their criticism more effective; it is the barb of the javelin they hurl into our breast. The charge made against us is that we are hot alive to our present circumstances. It is said that we neither comprehend the danger in which the country finds itself, nor have taken steps to protect her interests. Both of those charges are totally unfounded. No t one fact can he adduced in support of them. Why are we subjected to such criticism ? The answer is easy to find. The Labour party is in party is despised and condemned, as it always has been by its opponents. There has never been a set of circumstances in which they have found the Labour party right. peace, or plunged into a bloody war, we are always wrong in their eyes. This condemnation of the Labour party is no new thing ; but the charge now levelled against us is one that must not remain unanswered for a single moment. ' I-wish to show clearly that this party and the Government are not only keenly alive to our present danger and its duty to prosecute the war with all its energies, but foresaw this war, and took steps to prepare for it , when the voices of honourable gentlemen opposite were dumb-whe n there was neither enthusiasm, nor prudence, not even common sense, displayed by them. The honourable gentleman has said we are not alive to our present danger. Sir, we foresaw it when he was certain all was well; we warned him and the country, but he would not heed. L e t meprove that this is so. I shall quote from a speech I made in 1908. speech had could not more appropriately set out the causes of our present danger, and tlie quarter from which that danger comes. Reid, then, I think, the Leader of the Opposition, and who had said that, in his opinion, everything was well with the British Empire. I saidHe would nave us believe that everything is well with the British Empire; that there is no fear of war; that we may securely fold our What arms, and rest in peace under the aegis of the mightiest fleet that the world has ever seen. But we should look the facts in the face, and see what reflection lightens or darkens the heavens therefrom. At the present time the British fleets are being drawn closer and ever closer to Great Britain. But three years ago, when the Naval Agreement Bill was being discussed, they were policing the most distant seas. There was then a respectable squadron in the China seas, and a fleet in the Pacific. To-day, except for the Mediterranean squadron,, all the British warships are within a stone's throw of Great Britain, encircling with a triple wall of steel the islands which are the heart of the Empire. The right honourable gentleman believes that everything is well, although circumstances tell a very different tale. Similar action on the part of a private person would be regarded as significant of his apprehension of danger. When a man takes the precaution to be always within a stone's throw of his house, all men accept it as conclusive evidence that he believes himself to be iu imminent power! The Labour danger of attack. I went on to show where the attack would come from , and what the consequences must inevitably be. ' In support of my contention, I quoted from the ClarionI n an atmosphere of unruffled some words used by MrH . M . H y n dmanThere is not the slightest doubt that Germany, under. the . leadership of Prussia, is steadily making ready, at heavy cost, which the German Empire can at present ill afford, for a crucial naval engagement in the North Sea, followed by an invasion of this country. This is perfectly well known to all our leading politicians, and conclusive evidence of the truth of this statement is on record in the War Office and at the Admiralty. Everything is being got ready with that scrupulous care and minute attention to detail for which the Germans have been famous in military matters for nearly half a century. I went on to elaborate that point; but it fell on deaf ears. I showed that Captain Mahan, the great American naval expert, Lieutenant Dewar, and authorities of one sort and another, all agreed as to Germany's purpose: that war was inevitable -that we must prepare to meet it ; but these gentlemen who to-day are so If that keenly alive to our danger did not heedbeen made to-day it because there were party interests in the way. Who can say that there is one word I uttered seven years ago that has not been amply borne out by the facts toI was replying to Sir George day? Y e t they say we are not alive to our danger. We always have been alive to ifc. B ut they have only just awakened.

The honourable and learned member declared that, so far from Parliament being a committee of public safety at a time of the greatest crisis in our history, it was a committee of public insecurity. From the day we took office until now, these gentlemen, under cover of a reticence imposed upon them by the present extraordinary conditions, have never ceased their unrelenting criticism of the Government, and of our every act for the prosecution of the war and the conduct of affairs generally. my quotation from the answer of the honourable member for Flinders to my proposal to postpone the elections, and put an end to party warfare-h e went on to sayIt cannot be justifiably asserted that Government cannot be carried on under existing circumstances. There has not been a murmur of opposition against any action taken by the Government. That was true so far as the Labour party was concerned. ours criticised the actions of the late Government regarding the war. The declaration of the present Prime Minister was unconditional, that we would support them in everything they did. We were so desirous of helping them that we suspended our political campaign for three weeks with that object. The Prime Minister and myself came to Melbourne. For three weeks we refrained from taking an active part in the political campaign. But were honourable members opposite silent during that time? No; they made declarations of the difficulties in which they found themselves; but they were unceasingly active. Not only did the Prime Minister and myself refrain altogether from party warfare for three weeks, but we asked the present Minister of Defence to come across from Western Australia. What for? To assist us in the campaign, and to harass the then Minister with criticisms Before the lunfrom his predecessor? No; but to place at the disposal of the Government the services of a man who knew more about the Defence Department than any other I had shown with what conman in Ausbralia.

That was the feeling .of honourable members opposite when the Germans were thundering against Liege, and when there seemed to be between them and Paris only the space of a few hours. A t that time the British expedition had not reached France, and it seemed as if the German eagle, in the vicious f u r y of its first flight, was about to plunge its talons into the very heart of our Empire. was at this dark moment the Liberal Government spurned the offer we made. They did not want to share their responsibilities with us, they were resolute in insisting upon going on with the elections. Yet they now denounce us because we propose to submit the referenda to the people. The gravamen of the attack upon us to-day is that we are in truding into this great crisis a petty party squabble. If there is any question that is supremely national in its character, it is this question. Every honourable member on the Opposition side whose opinion is entitled to respect has affirmed over and over again that the question of amending the Constitution is urgent, and must be dealt with. The honourable member for Flinders is impaled upon his own logic and his and he has repeatedly affirmed, that amendments of the Constitution were urgently necessary, and that there could be no half-way house, at any rate, so far as two of them were concerned, between the Constitution as it is and the amendments we propose. Indeed, the honourable member, on the 15th February of this year, while the by-election We proposed to postpone such of the Grampians was in progress, emphasized the unsatisfactory position of the Commonwealth in unmistakable langauge to which the honourable memA t that ber for Balaclava found himself so completely opposed and unable to agree with that he publicly repudiated it . No one can doubt that the honourable member for Flindersi n his speech went far beyond what we propose. It is evident that what the honourable gentleman really proposed was U n i fication. I will leave that matter now; it will come forward again in the second-reading debate. If the honhave made. I will confront him with the Balaclava and my comment upon it . The honourable (member for Flinders regarded this matter as supremely important, and in February of this year, when the war was at its height, he was of opinion that it was necessary in order to meet existing, not prospective, difficulties in regard to finance, that there should be one spending authority. The honourable member cannot deny that, and, being a constitutional lawyer, he knows that there is no It way of doing what he proposes except by an amendment of the Constitution.

There was then no war, and no prospect of war. But they said there were reasons why they should not be submitted. General not to submit them. vented the people dealing with them. And now, in 1915, once again a reason is found why the proposals should not be presented to the people. The Opposition will never lack reasons for preventing having these powers. jection was that the proposals meant Unification ; that State rights were in danger, though one honourable gentleman stood up boldly in this House and declared that we were only exercising powers in a sane and rational way. Jfr. Hughes. 1912 the same objection was put forward. Again the Unification argument was used and counter proposals were submittedemasculated, effeminate, hopeless. 'Some of the people were deluded by their utterin ances, but not many; for the proposals were within an ace of being carried. There was no war then-no t with Gercan it be said many, Austria, or Turkey; but with every vested interest in this country there was Government war to the knife, and there is war still. That is the explanation of all this spurious patriotism which we have heard toThat they did approve of it is day.

But prised that when the tocsin rings, We are whether it be in time of peace or war, the phalanx of vested interests will rally to the sound. This is the exIn 1911, when they were first planation of the opposition to these proposals. Look at the columns of the great There was newspapers to-day. They are against They then had objections these proposals. They were always against the proposals sufficient, overthem. If Providence by some sudden act In were to wipe out this awful war and forward every one of its dreadful consequences these newspapers would not abate one jot them. of their biased criticism. It is not the circumstances in. which these proposals are brought forward that raise opposition. The opposition is to the thing itself. Honourable members opposite, after two or three days of Caucus, have taken their apparently courage in both hands and have made a great demonstration of their patriotism. I am not going to say one word They advised the Governoragainst their patriotism. It is as They pregood as ours, but it is no better. Yet this I do say: that it is not by such means as this that patriotism can be demonstrated. The right honourable gentleman tells us we ought not to take the referenda the people with 60,000 men at the front. The men In 1911 their obwho have gone to the front, whether they believe in Liberalism or Labour-ma y God speed them. But in what way w ill the taking of this referenda affect their operations ? When the fortunes of our our constitutional party were at stake, and thousands of our In men were away, or were about to go away, honourable members did not hesitate to push on with the election. They turned down with contempt and ridicule all suggestions to suspend party hostilities. Prime Minister did. you, right or wrong. tunity comes for rational and sober discussion of this matter, we meet with opposition which professes to be non-party, but which is partizan to the core. Why should these matters not be discussed ? Why, at least, do not honourable members allow the B ill to go to the second reading, and there discuss the merits of these great questions ? Why do they take this unusual and unreasonable method of denouncing the subject before its merits are disclosed ? I leave the matter there, with this positive assurance: that just as the people of the country were not blind to the motives that actuated honourable gentlemen opposite and their friends at the time of the elections, just as they saw through the specious reasons advanced for pressing on with the election and condemned their arrogance in proclaiming their ability to bear upon their shoulders responsibilities which would crush other men, so will they now judge between us. They will not forget the fact that honourable gentlemen opposite proposed to keep Parliament shut;-Parliament , the great safety-valve of the nation, the constitutional mouth-piece of the will of the people-the Parliament that was referred to as merely a committee of public insecurity, that would only hamper these honourable gentlemen in the performance of their tremendous duties. The people listened to them and to us, and gave their decision. To their judgment I now again appeal. We were elected was clearly put before the people; and neither the thunder of the guns nor the blood-red mists of war prevented the people from realizing that they had to choose between the Liberal party and the Labour party. party, one of whose fundamental planks for the last six years has been that there must be an amendment of the Constitution to protect the interests of the people. Upon that I stand, perfectly confident [153] that the people will approve of what we propose to do. After the storm of eloquence to which we have just been subjected, a little quiet COOK -Just as your argument on my part may be justified. I fail to understand why the Attorney-General, who has just resumed his seat, should have displayed so much excitement and warmth in dealB u t when an opporing with this matter. The issue is a simple one, and may be put very clearly in a few words, without any of that thumping of the table, or enforced, excited and out-of-place rhetorio to which we have just listened. There must be something very important, from the point of view of the Labour party, in the amendment which the Leader of the Opposition has moved, since we have had from them two most furious party speeches, traversing' the whole arena of Labour organization and aspiration for many years back. We have had the Prime Minister telling us what happened in Queensland some twenty years ago, we have had from him references to the Electoral Act , and a story concerning people who went to prison, although he did not tell us for what reason they were sent there, and we have had to listen to the right honourable gentleman steering all round the political compass in stating his objections to the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Now, what is that amendment? The motion is that leave be given to introduce the first of the six Referenda Bills proposed to be submitted by the Government, and the amendment is in the way of an addendum that the leave be given "" as soon as adequate provision has been made by theunited energies of the Government and Parliament for the successful prosecution of the war."" There is nothing in such an amendment that calls for any excuse. upon a programme which The Labour party should not be surprised at the action we have taken. One .might think, after hearing these two hostile party speeches, that these proposals were new, whereas they have been twice submitted to the people They chose the Labour by referenda, and have been twice rejected. In these circumstances, is it reasonable that we should consent to their submission once more to the people at this time of crisis in the fortunes of the nation ?

Let honourable members opposite put themselves in our position, and ask themselves how they would view such a proposal on our part. Labour party taking up an attitude the opposite to that which has been adopted by our great exemplar in the Mother Country? Isi t because we are far away from the seat of war that we imagine we are in perfect security? In the British Parliament all controversial legislation has been laid aside, and both parties are not only working together, but have joined in shouldering the burdens of government. Some honourable members opposite think that, personally, the Opposition in this Parliament are anxious to join with the present Ministry and to share in the government of the country,. Nothing, however, b u t a strong sense of public duty would induce any one of us to do anything of the kind. Some have said that we are after the loaves and fishes, bub that, after all, is a most contemptible suggestion to make. No such motive in fluences the action of any honourable member on this side of the House. We recognise, however, the dangers and the difficulties of the present time, and believe that, no matter what our personal cr party feelings may be, our first consideration must be the safety of the country. with honourable members of the party opposite in the one Ministry, and I suppose that they do not wish to work with me in the same Cabinet; but if we are, to consider the safety of the country we must divest ourselves of all party feeling; the desire to protect the safety and interests of the.

General told us the true reason for the urgency of the Referenda Bills. that the Government wish to have the referenda before the end of the year, simply because it is a great plank of the party; but I wonder what honourable opposite would have said of us if we had been in power and persisted in sending to a referendum of the people, in the midst of this terrible war crisis, a question that has already been twice upon by an adverse vote. not entitled the Bills simply mean that home rule, ing to honourable members opposite, has been found to be no good for the Australian members opposite, and their prefer to be governed in their local and industrial matters by a far distant authority; but if the Bills be passed, and the referenda tive, that a great mistake has been The simply power consider them more important any other business-more the proper prosecution of the war, and the safety of the country.

The Prime Minister, for in stance, must find it most difficult to attend to his duties, and be present in the members House; and I repeat that the introduction of the referenda measures at this juncture simply means that the Labour party regard them as of more importance than the proper prosecution of the war decided and the safety of the country.

All credit to her if she does so under those circumstances. As Blatchford saysUnless the British are ready to light and pay and work as they have not fought or paid or striven for a hundred years-if ever-the Empire will assuredly go to pieces and leave us beggared and disgraced under the conquest of .a braver, better-trained, and better-organized nation. four years ago. now that the conflict is upon us, and has been waging for nearly eleven months, that Australia, in common with the rest of the Empire, awoke to the truth of this warning? God forbid that I should say a word against the brave men who are upholding so magnificently at the Dardanelles the honour, and glory, and reputation of this country. We all acknowledge the magnificent work that they have accomplished, and the great name that they have earned for Australia by what they h^ve done. But shall we not prove ourselves a set of doddering idiots if , while these men are falling thick as autumn leaves, we sit here discussing questions utterly insignificant, and which are as nothing compared with the tremendous issues at stake? short of world domination w ill satisfy those who guide the destinies of Germany. For many years, her philosophers, poets, public men, historians, scientists, and politicians, her whole intellectual life, liave been steadily preaching this one doctrine of world domination, so that it has entered into the very soul of the nation.' Germany has a white population of .65,000,000 persons, which is more than 'the white population of the British Empire. We have to recognise the tremendous driving 'force behind the German nation, that the Germans have bent their whole energies to the organization of the nation down to the tiniest details for the accomplishment of their ultimate purpose. struggle in which we are now engaged, ifc must be evident to every honourable member that the day .will come when once again Germany will feel her strength, and once again that indomitable spirit which urges the German against the world will -re-assert itself. Unless Germany is absolutely beaten to her knees, and made powerless, I believe that, within our lifetime, she'will choose her opportunity to attack again the one enemy that she had in mind when she entered upon this war. To any one who has read what the Germans have written for all the world to see, it must be perfectly evident that the great enemy that Germany had in view was England. Do honourable members believe, for one moment, that it is the British Isles that Germany wants? Isi t there that she looks for a place where her surplus population may live "" under a German sky and on German soil,"" as Bernhardi put it? Those who have read his books know that what Germany wants is not Great Britain, but her colonies. I have read all of Bernhardi's works that have been translated into English, and I can tell the House that in more than one hundred passages he says, in one way or another, that it is England with which Germany is going to t r y conclusions; that it is the English colonies that Germany is going to take; and in all but absolute words he asserts that it is Australia that she desires. We know that Bernhardi is tlie popular exponent of the policy of blood and iron, the man above all others who has crystallized and expressed German sentiment on this subject. designs on French colonies? signs on French colonies, but it is Australia that they chiefly seek to get. For the sake of having them on record, let me read some passages that I have taken from his works. He saysIf we continue to exist as a colonial power by the grace of England, Germany, will once more occupy that position .of utter insignificance which she occupied befpre 186(1. World power or decline is Germany's motto by the will of history. . "". . England opposes us throughout the world with hostility, and prevents us acquiring colonies the possession of which is for Germany a question of life and death. . . . Every unprejudiced man must to-day have arrived at the conviction that Germany's further development as a world power is only possible after a final settlement with EngI f they are only checked in the land. Bernhardi's definition of a world power is a power with great colonial possessions. He saysiI t can really not be expected that Germany, with her constantly-growing population, shouicl renounce her claims to become a great colonial power, and to acquire territories suitable for settlement. . . .",35,William Irvine Di D Not Your I T Is Upon That That We Were Returned
