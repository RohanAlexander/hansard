Is I T A Fact That Grave Concern Is Being Ex","pressed by many farmers on the Tumut and Murrumbidgee River flats at the delay in the construction of the Blowering adequate accommodation there to cope Dam, because of the possibility that the main Snowy River waters will 'be turned into the Tumut River before the Blowering Dam has heen completed, causing the continuous flooding and destruction of some of' the most fertile river flats in New South Wales? WiU the right honourable gentleman examine this project from a national staud-point with a view to making. available to New South Wales the .finance necessary to enable the Blowering Dam to be completed at a time coinciding. with the turning of the Snowy River waters into the Tumut River for irrigation purposes, or does the right honourable gentleman intend that there shall be a Bob Dyer"" Cop the l o t "" show for the. farmers along tbe Tumut River and the MurrumHealth say why, underthe arrangement bidgee River? -ber will be delighted to' know that this Government has made many millions of pounds available to the New South Wales Government, which has the responsibility for constructing the Blowering Dam. He is quite right when he says there is dissatisfaction among farmers because of delay in the construction of the dam. I have heard it credibly reported that many farmers have become almost intolerably hostile to the New South Wales Government aa a result of its neglect of the project. Immigration inform the House, first, of the circumstances surrounding the proposed closure of the immigrant holding centre at Enoggera, in Brisbane, and secondly, whether the interests of memmembers of the staff of the centre wbo are ex-servicemen will be fully protected ? Enoggera immigrant centre was made in the interests of efficiency and economy. With the exception of a small caretaking staff, the people' now in occupation of the Enoggera centre will be transferred to the Wacol centre at the end of this month. The Wacol centre is more economical to operate, and portions of it can be readily opened or closed, according to the level of immigrant occupancy from time to time. There should be with our needs. .Honourable members will realize that a reduction of the number of immigrant establishments in Queensland and other States cannot result in other than a cutting down of staffs, but as retrenchments become necessary, they will be effected in accordance with the general policy laid down for the discharge of temporary employees. In the order of discharge, special provision is made for consideration to be given to the claims of ex-members of the forces who, other things being equal, will be the last to he retrenched. with friendly societies for the payment",7,Setup

All dependants of married, people are usually covered by the one premium. Minister for Health a question regarding the medical benefits scheme. As there may be . occasions on which it is difficult or . embarrassing for a patient who is insured with a recognized medical benefits organization to meet the f u l l payment for medical treatment and then have to wait for the appropriate refund from the scheme, could the Mmister explain how a patient may take advantage of the scheme without first' making settlement in fnll to the doctor? regarding the medical benefits scheme which have been published set out definitely two different ways irwhich the medical practitioner may he paid. The first is that the patient himself pays the fee and recovers both the Commonwealth contribution and the insurance benefit from the organization with which he is insured. That is the more common method. I was informed during a conversation that I had on Monday with the representatives of two major medical benefits organizations that in only one in a thousand cases was the other method adopted. The second method available to the patient is that he may ask the organization to -pay the doctor, and then he will recoup the organization for 'such part of the doctor's fee as is not covered by his insurance and the Commonwealth contribution. the Minister for Health with the statement that I have here. an account submitted by a Grafton medico to a patient receiving treatment in the public ward of-the Grafton Base Hospital. In view of this fact, does the Minister still . adhere to his statement that members of the medical profession are not making i charges for the treatment of patients in Isi t the public wards of hospitals? charges shall be made for treatment in the public wards of hospitals is entirely a matter of policy for each State government.

I say that the question asked by the honourable member is not i h accordance with the facts. for Health advise the House of the number of health societies that have been refused registration as approved societies ? If he cannot state the exact number of such refusals, will he say whether the refusal in one instance was based upon the unsatisfactory financial history of the applicant company ? Is he aware that that company, the Bankers Health Society, still advertises extensively for custom and bases its appeals on the ground that its benefits are superior to those provided under the Government's health scheme? As there are strong grounds for believing that the administrative costs of this company are still unduly high, will the Minister say whether he has the power and, if so, whether he will exercise it, to inquire into the affairs of. the company? Department has no power to inquire into the affairs of any organization that is not an approved society under the health scheme. It will be remembered . that,",7,Health And Medical Services

17,Sir Earle Page,"The Healthabout eighteen months ago, the Government introduced a bill under which occurrences of the kind to which the honourable member has referred could have been prevented, but, unfortunately, the members of the Labour party in another place voted for the deferment of the measure ;ind it was not carried. :iuy information about the proposed construction of a new Commonwealth Bank building-in Rockhampton? Are the plans ready for construction to begin? Does the right honourable gentleman know when it is planned to commence construction, and whether the construction will be carried out by day labour or contract? orable member was good enough to inform me that he intended to raise this matter, and so I have been able to obtain some information for him. The matter relates to the internal administration of the Commonwealth Bank, and, accordingly, is one for decision by the bank rather than by the Government. However, I have ascertained that the bank is planning the construction of a new building at Rockhampton, although the plans are only in a preliminary stage and it is not known when construction will commence. It is the usual practice of the Commonwealth Bank to have buildings such as the proposed building erected by contract, and I presume that in due course the bank will, call for tenders on ii contract basis. Minister for Labour and National Service aware that in Brisbane recently the Queensland Full Court of Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration declined to terminate the system of quarterly adjustments of the basic wage? Will he examine the details of that decision to ascertain whether the reasons given by the Full Court are correct, that is, that it has knowledge that there has been an upward trend in the C series price index, which would normally be reflected in the next basic wage adjustment? Has the Minister yet received any information as to when the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration will publish its reasons for cancelling future quarterly adjustments of the basic wage, and when we may expect information from the court in relation to that matter ? monwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration did not bind State tribunals, which are free to take such action as seems proper to them. Most honourable members will agree that it is desirable that, as far as practicable, in the interests of industrial peace, there should be a united approach to, and treatment of, the large questions of wages and industrial conditions. Indeed, State legislatures have frequently issued instructions, or directions, to their own industrial tribunals that they should, as far as practicable, follow the decisions of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I did not understand from the announcement of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court that it had any view as to whether or not there would be an upward or a downward movement in prices during the months ahead. Our own inquiries suggest that we have reached a situation of price stability, and that any movements, whether upwards or downwards, will be likely to be of a minor nature. I believe that there is a general recognition that this country needs, at the present time and for a considerable time ahead, a state of economic stability so that industry can plan confidently on certain -assumptions. I was asked questions about this matter yesterday, and I have sought to ascertain when the reasons for the judgment of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court are likely to be published. I have no further information about that matter, but I know that the court proposes to hear, on the 20th October, applications from other parties who desire to have applied to them the order previously made by the court in relation to other bodies. Labour and National Service arrange to inform the House how many federal awards which provide for quarterly adjustments of the basic wage have been affected by the decision already announced by the Full Court of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration?",8,Health And Medical Services

What will be the procedure taken iu the court in connection with the ordinary announcements of quarterly adjustments which are acted upon, as the Minister knows,, by some of the State tribunals which adopt the quarterly system of wage adjustment? Only a small number of wards is directly affected by the order which has already been made by the court. paratively small number of awards is affected directly by the decision given by the court, but as I have intimated to the honourable member for Blaxland, on the 20th October the court proposes to hear applications in relation to certain awards which will then be before it. As the matter is obviously of great importance and has a very wide effect, I shall ascertain whether I can secure authoritative information on the subject for presentation to the House. the Minister, in addition to supplying information about the number of trade unions affected by the decision of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in connection with automatic increases of the basic wage, and about the number of unions to be listed on the 20th October, also supply, for the information of honourable members, a list of the unions whose basic wage assessments are determined, not by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but by State arbitration courts? it is practicable to meet the request ot the honourable member. tion to the Minister for the Navy. When I was iu Manus Island and in the Territory of Papua and New GuineaI was asked by members of the forces, both the Navy and the Air Porce, who are at present serving in those areas, that no discrimination be made between service personnel and Commonwealth civilian employees in regard to income tax exemptions. As I have not received a reply to representations which I made to the GoMinister whether it is a fact that he has vernment on their behalf, can the Minister agreed to meet the Lord Mayor of tell the House whether the Government has made any decision on the matter ? honourable member returned from Manus Island, he made representations to the Government that service personnel serving in Manus Island be exempted from the payment of income tax -The matter was considered by the Government, and a decision was made to exempt Navy and Air Porce personnel in the same way as civilian personnel who serve in the area are exempted from the tax. My colleague, the Minister for Territories, announced a. few days ago that the exemption would extend to all service personnel serving in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. I did not reply to the honourable member's representations because I hoped that it would be common knowledge that the exemption had been granted. the Minister for Supply been directed to"" statements which suggest that the atomic tests are being delayed for political reasons because the Australian people are obsessed by the fear of radio-active clouds ? Are these suggestions true or otherwise? grossly, untrue. There are no political reasons connected with the timing of the atomic tests. at the moment? Labour party! The atomic tests, which are of the highest order of scientific complexity, are in the hands of scientists of great skill and experience, and the timing is entirely a matter for them and not for anybody else I do not believe for one moment that the Australian people are anxious. . The tests are quite safe. If they were not safe they would not be taking place. Furthermore they are part of the defence of the free world, and I believe, as I think every honourable member believes, that all Australians are glad to play their part in such defence.",9,Basic Wage

In view of that refusal will the right honourable gentleman inform me why he refused to acknowledge the representations that I made, considering that the proposed site for the airport is within will be authorized to give such help in my electorate, and has agreed to meet the Lord Mayor as a result of representations made by a member of his party, without informing all other honourable members interested in the project of his intentions? ment of the Interior and the Department Is this happening merely the result of a mistake, or is it that the Prime Minister is playing the diabolical game of politics fo which he once referred ? cannot even answer the question, because I do not know the answer. I know that I shall be visiting some portions of New South Wales, but I am as yet unaware of the details of the arrangements. fusion in the minds of people who are in receipt of a service pension as well as :t war pension regarding the proposed increase of pension rates, can the Minister as seaside or country holiday residentials. for Social Services inform the House of , the increased ceiling rate for ' such pensioners? If those persons are able to do so, are they permitted to earn sufficient Can the Minister inform the House to bring their incomes, plus pension, to £5 10s. in the case of single persons and £11 in the case of married couples? rates are £4 17s. 6d. for an unmarried person and £8 17s. 6d. for a married couple both of whom are pensioners. Other income may be earned to bring the total income of the unmarried pensioner to £5 10s. a week and of the married couple to £11 a week. Mr J. R. ERASER I ask the Minister for the Interior whether, in view of the fact that an estimate of £3.000 prepared by the Department of Works for the removal of sand from the enclosed . swimming pool at Jervis Bay has been rejected by the Department of the Interior on the ground of expense, he will undertake that if the citizens of Jervis Bay organize working bees to carry out this project necessary plant will be made available for that purpose by the Department of Works? Will the Minister also seek from the Minister for the Navy and Minister for Air an assurance that the naval officer commanding at Jervis Bay men and equipment as may be available at Jervis Bay naval station for this worthwhile community effort? of Works are always open to reasonable propositions. I do not know the details of this particular proposition, although I have a hazy recollection of dealing with something like it about a fortnight ago. I shall examine the matter, and see what the position is, although I think that the honourable gentleman's requests are a little out of court. for the Army whether the Army still owns or has on lease, as quarters for Army personnel, properties formerly used What were the purposes behind the acquisition of these properties? Have some of them already reverted to civilian use? whether substantial financial losses were incurred by the Army as a result of the acquisition and subsequent reversion of the properties ? Will he table the departmental files relative to all such properties so that all the costs of acquisition, renovation, reversion and subsequent repairs may be scrutinized ? sideration to the honourable member's questions if he will indicate to me the properties that he has in mind.

If price is not the trouble, why is the scheme not extended immediately so that school children in those districts shall not be at amounts, within their own semi-governa disadvantage in relation to children in Brisbane and its suburbs? of the local conditions in Queensland because the administration of the free milk scheme for school children rests entirely with the State Government, which carries out the work through its Department of Education. There has been some difficulty in Queensland because the State Government has failed to observe tlie terms of the legislation that provides honourable gentleman inform the House for the distribution of free milk to school whether that is so? What authority children. The act provides that tenders shall be secured for the supply of milk to schools. The price fixed by the Queensbe paid by local government authorities land Prices Commissioner for milk delivered to schools is either above or at the same level as the price charged to the ordinary householder. In every other State, because of the quantities involved, milk for school children is supplied at a price considerably lower than that charged to the individual householder. I intend to go to Queensland at iny earliest convenience in order to discuss this matter with representatives of the State Government with the object of straightening out the difficulty and expediting the distribution of free milk. made representations to the Treasurer in relation to loan allocations for the Council of the Oity of Newcastle. The right honourable gentleman informed m.': in reply that borrowings by semi-governmental bodies were not subject to the financial agreement and that, therefore, the Australian Loan Council had no legal authority in relation to them. Does that mean that the limit imposed upon the borrowings of the City Council of Newcastle for 1953-54 could not be enforced and that the council could borrow more than the specified amount? matter, obviously, concerns the Government of NeAv South Wales. The authority to which the honourable member has referred comes within the scope of what is known as the gentleman's agreement, which is an arrangement between the various States to allocate certain raental loan programmes, to various instrumentalities, including the Newcastle City Council. to the Treasurer. The Lord Mayor of Brisbane recently stated that local government, authorities were seriously disadvantaged in the raising of loan moneys because of the allowance of a rebate for taxation purposes in relation to interest on Commonwealth loans. Will the right determines the rate of interest on Commonwealth loans, and the rates that can when raising loans? and conditions relating to the raising of loans are fixed by the Loan Council, and there is no need for me to reiterate the constitution of the Loan Council which affords the States a preponderance of votes. With regard to the statement that local authority borrowing has been prejudiced by the concessional allowance for taxation purposes on interest on Commonwealth loans, let me remind the honourable member that the provision has existed for very many years and that the concession was granted by a decision of the Loan Council. for Supply to explain the composition of the body or group described as the Combined Development Agency, which is said to be handling the sale and distribution of Australia's uranium.

""Was the Australian Government notified of the British-American decision to evacuate ZoneA in. Trieste and allow Italian troops to take over there? Is this Government being kept informed of all developments by the United Kingdom and United States Governments?

I have vernment does not intend to proceed with no reason to suppose that the Royal Austhe appointment of an Australian Ambastralian Air Force wing referred to could sador to Ireland?

55,Mr Luchetti,"I ask the Primecussed at the last conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. The Australian Government has jurisdiction over importations under its customs powers. As the honourable member knows, those powers have been exercised from time to time-usuall y under a blast of criticism, but nevertheless exercised. Literature published and sold in a State comes under the jurisdiction of the State Government, and under State laws prosecutions have been launched in a number of cases. I should be very reluctant to think that the Commonwealth ought to exercise its power over postal matters by opening correspondence or packages in order to ascertain the contents. I think that would be a grave invasion Of the rights the people expect to have in regard to postal matter. But I have never been able to understand why a State, which has complete authority over these matters within its own boundaries, should have difficulty in dealing with the matter if it thinks fit. Therefore, I strongly suggest to the honourable member that he nudge the ribs of one or two of his State colleagues and ask them to do something about it, because if the. literature is as bad as he saysI would not know, because I never have time to look at it-it is high lime the State Government did something. LAND SETTLEMENT OF EX-SERVICEMEN. the Interior say whether it is a fact that Territory as it is elsewhere to find land over 36,000 ex-servicemen throtighout Australia have been declared to be eligible that matter will be discussed with repreand qualified for land settlement, and have applied for blocks of land, but that loss than 6,000 have been granted farms? upon the best information I have been able to obtain from the StatesI should say that, as a rough estimate, the problem of soldier settlement has been overcome to the extent of 50 per cent. In other words, there are about as many genuine applicants for allotments as have already been allotted blocks. Mr CA.t.wBt.1, -What do you mean by nemiinp ? who are still eager to go on the land. The number was considerably larger shortly after the war, but information I received from the various State authorities suggests that a. large number of those would not go on the land even if they were given an allotment. However, the problem is still grave enough, seeing that seven or eight years have elapsed since the war ended. As I explained recently, we are engaged in finding out what would be involved in, say, a five-year programme. As soon, as we have done so, we shall make plans accordingly, but such a programme would involve a very big effort and I should not like to guarantee that we would be able to do all that we wanted to do. for the Interior inform the House of the action that the Government is taking to institute an orderly scheme for war service land settlement in the Australian territories, the"" development of which is the prerogative of the Commonwealth ? Does the .Government intend to proceed with such a scheme? If not, why not? had a very pleasant and profitable discussion on war service land settlement with representatives of the returned servicemen's league from all States in Australia. One of the points raised during that discussion was the point mentioned by the honourable member. I have arranged to confer with representatives of the returned servicemen's league in the Australian Capital Territory on it. It is not as easy in the Australian Capital for soldier settlement. As I have said, sentatives of the returned servicemen's league in the Australian Capital Territory. I cannot give a definite answer to the question at the moment. Minister read a pamphlet on television that has been issued to the trade unionists of Australia?

Last night, I referred to the fact that, in this year and by this bill , the Government proposes to make a sum of £37,200,000 available to five of the States under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. I pointed out that, if the Government were to carry out the terms of that agreement, it would make available to those States a sum of £50,300,000. Even the sum . of £37,200,000 is not guaranteed by this bill, because, as the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) made clear to the Loan Council, which discussed this matter, if loan subscriptions this year do not amount to £100,000,000, the deficit will be deducted from the States funds for housing and other works. If this Government fails money made available for housing this year will be less than the restricted sum for which the bill make3 provision. I foresee that the line of defence however, in the last three years will have made available to the States much smaller amounts than they are entitled to under the agreement, and, in' fact, the States spend.

In the last three years, the States have not got more than two-thirds of the money that they could have expended, and which they were entitled to under this agreement. It may be asked what is the source from which I obtained the figures that I have mentioned. I got the figures in the same way as every other private member of this House and every other citizen of this country gets them if he wants them. That is from calculated leaks in newspapers. The operation of this agreement has been a major source of friction between this Government and the States in the last three years. One of the faults of their financial relationships is that all negotiagest step taken by any government to tions in connection with them are carried on behind closed doors. That applies to the Australian Loan Council, which operates under the financial provisions of the Constitution, as well as to the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, which is a treaty between the sovereign Commonwealth and the six sovereign States. It also applies to some of our other conference's such as the Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers and the Australian Agricultural Council, which do not operate under the Constitution or any treaty, but under a constitutional convention. No -minutes are published of any of those meetings, no communique is released and no ministerial statement is presented for discussion in our parliaments. are vitally affected by these constitutional and financial matters cannot learn anything about them, and honourable members cannot learn anything about them except from leaks in the newspapers. There is no doubt that there is need for the most skilled diplomacy in the relationship between the Mr Whitlam. Commonwealth and the States, but there is no need for such secret diplomacy as has occurred in. the last few If this Government years. Of course, this secret diplomacy suits the present Government; the mystery suits its book. It is fully satisfied if its constitutional and treaty obligations are not adequately exposed. We know that buck-passing is endemic in our federal system, and the present Government, by not making a full disclosure of these financial, facts, is avoiding its responsibilities and not allowing the Australian people to see where it has failed. No one pretends that the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement is perfect. We admit that a Labour government introduced it in 1945, but we now realize that it is not perfect. However, if this amendment is carried there will be an opportunity for review before the expiration of the ten-year period for which the agreement will operate. We make no apologies for entering into the agreements. It was the first step that any Australian government had taken to provide houses for the people since 191$. when the war service homes schemes were introduced. It has proved to be the bigimprove housing in Australia. Housing lags behind all other things in this modern age. The industrial revolution has passed, but it has left housing virtually unchanged. The ratio of material and labour costs in the building of a house is about the same as it was in the time of the Roman Empire. Legislation such as this does cater for the one in five or six families which must rely on rented accommodation being provided for it by others. The day of the private landlord has gone because the landlord and tenant legislation of the States has come to stay. The Labour party will not remove it, and the Liberal party dare not remove it. Consequently, private persons will not The citizens who invest money in houses for letting. They may invest in holiday flats, but holiday flats do nothing to relieve the distress caused by lack of accommodation. We shed no tears over the private landlords, because the sub-standard houses in this country are almost entirely owned by private landlords. They have not been replaced and they are not adequately maintained. Until this agreement came into force there was no systematic endeavour made in this country to replace sub-standard houses and to replace slums. And the creation of slums in this country is a blight on the system of private enterprise. No private factory could long endure if its premises were as antiquated as many of the privately owned tenanted properties in this country. The honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) referred to sub-standard houses in Australia. It is true that State government housing authorities in this country do not provide luxurious accommodation, but the houses that they provide are not sub-standard; all are decent, and provision is made that they shall be made available to tenants at an economic rent. The Labour party has said, and it says again-and next year it will have an opportunity to demonstrate its faith-that the best family unit in this country is that which occupies premises which it is buying and paying for during the earning lives of its members. However, there are certain people in this country who continue to need rented accommodation. Some, through accident or disease, can no longer earn enough to pay for a house, and others are peripatetic people in Commonwealth, State or private employment. The time will come when Commonwealth organizations like the Postal Department and the Department of Trade and Customs will have to provide adequate housing if their .facilities are to be efficiently decentralized. That fact is being realized by all large employers in Australia, whether public or private. This Government had the opportunity to take some action along those lines during its term of office, but it has not taken advantage of that opportunity. There are people such as teachers, policemen and employees of the lands and justice departments of the States, who cannot have a permanent dwelling throughout their earning lives: They need' accommodation to be provided for them. The private landlord' will not provideit, and so public Balaclava. instrumentalities have to do so. This amendment gives the Government voice of his party. He pledges: hisparty an opportunity to show its good' faith, in relation to various matters whenever and' toha;ve a better agreement made. he rises to speak. However, he assumes The agreement has provided for people who cannot afford to get their own places, and it has provided the best means that this country has ever had of attempting slum clearance. Moreover, it has provided the only means, apart from the War Service Homes Division, by which ex-servicemen could obtain accommodation. This amendment, which I support, and which has been supported by previous Opposition speakers, is a test of the Government's good faith. If it sincerely wants co-operation and good faith in Commonwealth and State financial relations, it, will adopt the amendment. It is up to the Government either to honour the agreement or to end it. I have shown how the Government has failed to honour the agreement, and bow, at any time by giving twelve months' notice, it could have ended the agreement. The Government refuses to honour its obligations; it refuses to amend the agreement; and it refuses to end. the agreement. had hoped to be able to make my address without having to correct false impressions created by honourable members opposite. Housing is a subject which should merit the serious and earnest consideration of honourable members on both sides of the House, but the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) again engaged in one of those flights of fancy which are becoming more and more a feature of his contributions to the debates in this House. He made an ill-judged attack on the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer), who knows more about housing than it is possible for the honourable member for Werriwa to have learned. In presenting his' views he challenged the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Joske) to give a legal opinion as to whether or not the Commonwealth ha'di breached.' the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement by failing to provide sufficient funds to the State governments for housing purposes. The honoitable. member then gavea considered opinion oi his s m , m which he attempted to include the honourable member for The honourable inember for Werrimai considers himself to be the 1",15,Second Reading
69,Mr Wheeler (Mitchell) 13.26],"Ia verygreat responsibility when he says that he can accept responsibility for indicating the views of the honourable member for Balaclava on this matter The honourable member for Balaclava is eminently entitled to form his own views on legal matters, but the honourable member for Werriwa is not so favourably placed as his legal thinking has already been done for him by his learned father-in-law. He came into this chamber and, assuming the role of his father-in-law, thought that he could pre-judge the views of the honourable member for Balaclava. He would have given much more reasoned consideration to this matter and would require more facts than are at present disclosed before he would agree that a breach of the agreement had been made by the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Werriwa did not show in any way that the provisions of the agreement had been broken by the Commonwealth because it had provided insufficient funds to the States. The true position is that the Commonwealth has given to the (States more money than they were entitled to receive. If the States did not apply the money given to them by the Commonwealth to the building of houses, responsibility rests on the honourable member for Werriwa to take up the matter with his co-socialists in the New South Wales Government and to ensure that they allocate to housing the amount of money which the honourable member deems should be allocated for that purpose. Let me dispense with the honourable member by saying that his judgments on these matters are obviously ill formed. The Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement has been in existence for eight years-time complete failure. It has given us far fewer houses than we need at a cost far greater than most of the community can afford to pay. It has' not solved the housing problem, and it is time that something was done to remedy its defects. I believe that something can be done to improve it. Developments in Sydney last year indicate that an infinitely better approach can be made to the problem. A scheme has been demonstrated in Sydney which seems capable of giving us more houses at a quicker rate and, above all, at lower cost. And this is Mr Wheeler. no mere blueprint which exists only in the mind of some planner; the scheme is already working in Sydney and has delivered the goods. In fact, a similar method has been used in Great Britain for a number of years and now provides a large proportion of the new houses built in that country. The Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, despite what the honourable member for Werriwa has said about it, arose out of an arrangement between the socialist government in the Commonwealth sphere and State governments which were also predominantly Labour. I do not think that the people realize even yet the disastrous position into which the agreement has led us, particularly in New South Wales. In that State the rents of houses owned by the New .South Wales Housing Commission are so high that many tenants who need houses most urgently simply cannot afford to pay them, and yet the commission isstill losing money. Nor are the tenants themselves happy even when they get commission homes. In my electorate one can drive along street after street containing hundreds of these houses, and the effect is often most depressing. Many of the tenants have made a brave effort to adapt themselves to their new locations. In some cases it has been entirely successful; in others it has not. There is little community life among the tenants of the commission. In some instances there are whole suburbs without even a public hall or meeting place. That is, perhaps, not surprising for these people have been gathered together as the result of the accident of a. ballot, often with enough to demonstrate its little in common. When one talks to them one finds that many of them are unhappy at being compelled to live in suburbs that do not suit them, and in homes that are not of their own choice. The officers of the commission do their best to fall in with their wishes, but the whole conception of the scheme is that the State dictates to a man where he shall live and in what type of house he shall live. In respect of a matter so personal as this, the whole concept of the scheme is wrong. Many of the tenants are young couples who married during or after the war. My own marriage was a war-time marriage. I had to face the problem of establishing a home under very difficult circumstances of the post-war era. I can sympathize with these married couples. I am afraid that many of them have had their dreams shattered and suffer profound disillusionment. The seriousness of the situation is illustrated by the fact that the turnover of tenants in housing commission homes in my electorate is alarming. Families go there, stay a few months, or even a few weeks, and move out again. Rents are fixed without logic or fairness. They have no relation to the worth of the house, but depend upon construction costs, which in turn depend upon when the house was built. A tenant may find that he is paying twice as much as another tenant of a precisely similar house, simply because his house was built two or three years later than that of the other tenant. That inevitably causes discontent. The New South Wales Housing Comin single units. For this reason they mission first began to operate in true have suffered from too great an increase socialist style, putting up its dwellings of costs. The system of financing home by day labour.

These costs have gone ing to cost. The houses at Miranda were far too high. The New South Wales Government is including the land, for brick houses with continually wailing for more money for three bedrooms, which are situated three the New South Wales Housing Commission. We in this Parliament have to consider whether it is fair to the taxpayers and the general public to give more millions of pounds to the States to be wasted by housing commissions in the way that those bodies have been wasting money in the last few years. In the long run it is the homeless who pay through the nose for houses built at too high a cost, and who suffer if an inadequate number of houses is built with the money handed over to the States. In spite of the partial breakdown of government home building in New South Wales in the last year, the number of homes actually completed in that year constituted a record for New South Wales, largely because of the efforts of private home builders and co-operative building societies. I believe that co-operative building societies are the brightest spot in the building picture. While they represent a form of true private enterprise it is still not free enterprise at it3 best because co-operative building societies for the most part can work only I do not want the House to think that it is producing uniform houses sold at the bank's valuation of £3,S00, minutes from a suburban railway station and are provided with all the usual amenities, including hot water system services, electric stoves, &c. One big advantage of the scheme is that the buyer sees what he is getting, and to that extent is in a better position even than the man who Builds his own house. The company first builds a show house, right on the estate, which is furnished and thrown open for inspection. The prospective buyers of similar houses then arrange for their own variations of the design. The matter of finance naturally arises, and in that connection a Commonwealth instrumentality played a large part in the Miranda scheme. Finance was provided through a cooperative society but, in effect, the firm was given an understanding that if it were prepared to sell at the bank's valuation finance would be available to the purchasers through a building society. The company took a risk, because it had to spend large, amounts of its own money before it knew whether or not it would get a satisfactory return. It might well have made losses, but the beauty of the private enterprise system from the community's point of view is that if the project had failed the company would have borne the loss. Under the Commonwealth, and State housing scheme the unfortunate taxpayer has to make good any deficiencies. Iu this instance the outlines of a really sound method of overcoming the housing shortage in New South Wales are emerging. Instead of paying over many millions of pounds each year to the States under the wasteful Commonwealtii and State Housing Agreement, let us use at least some of that money to provide more finance to the home builder, us say to any builder who has the facilities for large-scale construction, "" Submit us your proposition. We shall inspect the land, and examine the plans and specifications of the houses. Our valuers will then put a price on them. If you undertake to sell at that figure we shall undertake to provide finance for the purchasers, up to 80 per cent, of the selling nrice"". I believe that the British company which is behind the Miranda scheme gave purchasers a fair deal. However, Mr Wheeler. what we want in home building is competition, which is the life-blood of free enterprise, but which was entirely destroyed in New South Wales by the Housing Commission. I believe that once it was understood that the Government would provide the finance, a number of other builders and building companies would come into the field. Once we get them bidding against one another the cost of home-building should really start -to come down. It might be asked why should not the co-operative building society handle the whole scheme, that is, do the construction work as well as the financing. The answer is that, in theory, there is no objection. However, large-scale building is an involved and difficult business which needs very experienced management in order to get real economy. As a matter of fact, a co-operative project was tried iu my own electorate. It lost a lot of money, and the New South Wales Government, which guaranteed it, had to foot the bill. For the sake of the taxpayer I prefer that private operators, who bear their own losses, should be responsible. Another problem is, where is the land to be had? In New South Wales at least, the answer is simple. The New South Wales Housing Commission has thousands of acres of good building land that it has tied up, although it has no immediate prospect of using it. The commission was established to overcome the housing shortage, and it apparently concluded that the shortage would last at least 50 years to judge by the amount of land it acquired. That might indeed be the case if we have to rely on the present socialistic programme to overcome the shortage. I suggest that the estates which the commission cannot use let within a reasonable time be handed over to the Commonwealth at cost of acquisition, which would be credited to part repayment of its housing advances. The Commonwealth could then make the land available to any one who had the facilities necessary to carry out a housing project. At the same time it could take the opportunity of rectifying any injustice to the former owners of the land. It is well known that some States took over estates at confiscatory prices, and, in many cases, have not as yet paid anything for the land although it was resumed several years ago. The Commonwealth could fix prices for the new buyers which, while not burdensome to the eventual home owner, would still represent fair value for the land. This would provide a surplus from which it could make payments to the former owners based on reasonable compensation for resumption. There is one other way in which we could help the home seeker. At the present time the building regulations of some States are antiquated, and unnecessarily inflate building costs. A Liberal colleague in New South Wales, Mr D. Stewart Fraser, M.L.A., who, as Director of the Building Industry Congress, is an expert on the industry, has made a study of this subject. He has estimated that an amount of £347 a house could be saved by certain alterations, which he detailed, without sacrificing building standards. It is necessary, of course, to take every precaution in. such matters. However, where experts are agreed-and they are agreed regarding some of these regulations-w e could very well say to a State, "" We are prepared to finance your home builders, but we are not prepared to compel them to waste their money. If you wish us to extend the scheme to your State, you must be prepared to modernize your regulations "". Here is a method of having to the Commonwealth and State Housing more houses built quicker and cheaper, which should go a great way towards solving the problems of the man who wishes to own his home. There would remain, of course, the problems of two other important sections of the community. The first section consists of the many people who want to rerat houses rather than own them. I fear that nothing can be done for them while the State Government continues with its present policy of imposing rent control on new as well as old buildings. The State has controlled rents so thoroughly that it is no longer a sound proposition to build a house to let. This the charges made by the honourable memhas had the result of accentuating the shortage of homes. The other class that T haVP in mind consists of those people who now occupy housing commission homes. Many whom I know would like to purchase .their homes, but the method of fixing purchase prices has become bogged down in argument 'between the Commonwealth and the State, as has happened with so many matters that are dealt with by both governments. It is desirable that tenants should be given the first opportunity to purchase housing commission homes on easy terms and at fair values, but I am totally opposed to the idea of leaving the proceeds in the hands of the States in view of their sorry record as landlords. The problem of providing houses for the people is extremely complex. The New South Wales Government, owing to the lack of adaptability which arises from departmental handling and management, has failed to measure up to the requirements of the situation in that State. The Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, on its present basis, has not resulted in the construction of houses in adequate numbers or at satisfactory prices. There is a pressing need to overhaul the agreement and I hope that, if it is overhauled, the socialistic approach of the New South Wales Government, which has enabled an ambitious Minister to lay many foundation stones without providing ^sufficient houses, will be thrown aside and that a plan for a fairer deal will emerge. bill is designed to give effect for 1953-54 Agreement, which first came into force under legislation enacted in 1945 as a part of the former Labour Government's post-war reconstruction policy of social justice for all. It was based upon recommendations made by the Commonwealth Housing Commission, which reported at the end of World War II . that there was a shortage of 400,000 houses in Australia and that an estimated additional number of 400,000 would be required by newcomers in the ensuing ten years. A programme for the construction of 80,000 houses a year over a period of ten years was laid down. BeforeI proceed to discuss this programme, I wish to reply to ber for Mitchell( Mr Wheeler) and the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) against the New South Wales Housing Commission. The fact is that the commission has arranged for houses to be constructed by private enterprise. Contracts are let after firm tenders have",17,Second Reading
70,Mr Morgau (Reid) [3.48],"Thisbeen submitted to the commission on a competitive basis. That fact disposes completely of the statements made by the two honourable members on this subject. 1 I give full credit to private enterprise for the fact that some very fine houses have been erected by this method 'on behalf of the Housing Commission. Many of them are in the electorate that I represent, where happy families are blessing the Housing Commission and the former Australian Labour Government that arranged for the construction and financing of their homes. The building trade took some time after the end of the war to gear itself for the ten-year programme that I have mentioned. In the early stages, the full target have only two years left in which to comof 80,000 houses a year was not reached, but the rateof construction on behalf of the Housing Commission was fast approaching that figure when the Chifley Government went out of office. In fact, approximately 200,000 houses had been constructed under the programme at that time. By September, 1951, the annual target figure had been passed and the programme was fast 'overtaking the arrears that existed at the end of the war. The following table shows the number of houses that were under construction at the end of successive quarterly periods from the end of September, 1951:30th September, 1951 31st December, 1951 .. 84,841 31st March, 1952 . . The last, figure was over 5,000 beyond the annual target that had been set. However, with the full impact of the horror budget, aggravated, by the Government's credit restriction policy, the rate of construction late John Curtin, declared that the began to wane, as the remainder of the table shows30th June, 1952 30th September. 1952 78,542 31st December, 1952 31st March, 1953 ..' Those figures disclose a reduction of the annual rate of construction by nearly 14.000 houses since the peak period was reached in 1952. Now the programme is actually falling behind, instead of progressing and overtaking the arrears. The situation is made worse by the fact that, since the war, between 700,000 and 800,000 immigrants have entered Australia, most of them to settle permanently. Mr Morgan. The number of houses completed in each year of the programme up to date is shown in the following table:194546 .. 15,376 194647 .. 32,607 194748 .. 43,503 194849 .. 51,339 194950 .. .. 55,485 195051 ... 07,44.4 195152 .,. .. .. 77,000 195253 (approximately). .. 7S.000 The total number of houses completed in the eight years of the programme to the 30th June""last was 420,754. Thus at that stage we had virtually overtaken the lag at the end of the war, but, as I have shown, the lag is again increasing. ""We plete the full programme of 80,000 homes. According to a conservative estimate, the 500,000 or 600,000 immigrants who have settled permanently in Australia will require only 100,000 houses at that time. This will leave a total shortage of 500,000 houses, and so we shall, be 100,000 houses further behind than we were when the war ended. In fact, the situation will probably be worse than those figures indicate because the programme has not provided for slum clearance, which was another matter to which the Commonwealth Housing Commission directed attention in 1945. .. 84,819 Once again, the Government has failed .. 85,464 to honour one of its pre-election promises to deal with an urgent social problem. It has not fulfilled its obligations to men and women who made sacrifices for their country in World War II .

Unfortunately, the Chifley Labour Government did not remain in office long enough to complete the social programme which it had been steadfastly pursuing.

Both, these cases are from my electorate and tlie report cites, the further case.of a family living in a tent, and others who are living under all sorts of undesirable conditions. It seems that young people in the community have been completely discouraged from obtaining homes of their own and fulfilling the obligations of domestic life, particularly in their years of greatest fertility. The marriage statistics reveal a very sad state of affairs, indeed. The Commonwealth Year-book for 1950 discloses that in that year there were only 75,599 marriages in a population now bordering on 9,000,000. ages of the young couples shows that i!2,709, or only 43 per cent., were under 2'0 years of age, the age of greatest fertility. For those over 25 and under 30 years of age the figure was 21,390, or 28 per cent, of the population, and for those over 30 years of age the figure was 21,500, or approximately 28 per cent. The overall average age of bridegrooms marrying in 1950 was 28.99. I venture to suggest that for wives the a verage age was three years less. Incidentally, the average life of women is three years longer, so it would seem that the financial burden on husbands must be considerably greater! Those figures indicate, aa I said, a very serious state of affairs, indeed! But there is a worse feature than that. In 1942, the number of marriages was S6,000 or 11.99 for each 1,000 of the population. In 1950, although, our population had substantially increased during the .intervening eight years, the number of marriages had dropped to 75,599 or 9.2 for each 1,000 of population. I submit that those figures carry the grave implications that there is a serious shortage of hotises. .1 further very tragic aspect of this matter is disclosed by the figures relating to births, particularly ex-nuptial births or those conceived out of wedlock. I social significance, and also affects the shall not cite those figures, which are to general economy of the nation, particube found on page 595 of the latest Yearlarly the building industry. It is well Book. I received somewhat of a shock known that over 100 allied, trades are when I looked into them. I do not think associated with the building industry. it would be fair, particularly to tlie young people concerned, to cite those statistics, because, after all, the fault is not theirs . The responsibility lies fairly 1 and squarely on the shoulders of the government of the day, and' of earlier governments, because of their failure TD meet the housing needs of the community. Quite recently the press has given a lot of publicity to the case of one young woman, but I venture to suggest that such persons are more sinned against than sinning. I feel quite sure that a study of the figures will stir honourable members out of their apathy towards the housing shortage. That is not the whole sad story, because, when young people fall by the wayside, probably many of the young men do the right thing. They An analysis of the marry, and go to live with mother. Many learned divorce judges and social workers have stressed that such circumstances have, contributed towards the early break-up of marriages. 2Jo doubt the mother-in-law feels aggrieved because the young couple have been thrown upon her in that way. Various disagreements follow and the parties resort to tlie divorce court. In the year 1950 7,414 divorces were granted throughout Australia. In other words, the number of marriages broken up represents the equivalent of .10 per cent, of the total number of marriages in that year, a situation in regard to which housing must be a contributing factor. Moreover, the annua] marriage rate fell from 10.65 persons for each 1,000 of population in 1946 to 9.24 persons for each 1,000 of population in 1949. An even more disturbing aspect of the matter is that for every 1,000 unmarried persons of marriageable age of over fifteen years there are only 71 married persons in the community. As I said, that, indeed, is very disturbing in a country like this that needs a greater population, for it is obvious that many people will not accept the responsibility of matrimony because of the difficult housing position. This state of affairs has an important In fact, it has been estimated that approximately 600 people are interested, directly or indirectly, in tbe construction of one home. The ramifications of the building industry extend throughout the economy of the country. The building industry is the key to prosperity, because, after all, everything hinges on the home. When the building societies in New South ""Wales, to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) and other honourable members, began to operate in 1937, 9 per cent, of the work force in New South Wales was unemployed. A t that time, the unemployment rate in that State was the highest in Australia. Within two years as a result of the operations of co-operative building societies, the percentage of unemployment in New South Wales fell to 44 per cent., the lowest unemployment rate in -any of the States. The Chifley Government, by its housing and financial policy, brought prosperity, happiness and hope to many people in the community, but the hopes of people who are waiting for houses now have been crushed by the policy of this Government, which is to restrict credit for housing purposes. The building trade is in the doldrums, and New South Wales has felt the f u l l force of the effects of this Government's policy. The Sydney Morning Herald has statedThe full severity of the building recession last year is dramatically illustrated in the wealth has been niggardly in providing New South Wales building statistics issued by the Acting Commonwealth Statistician. They show that home building slumped by nearly 50 per cent. Whereas in 1951 local councils and Government authorities in this State approved 35,05.1 houses and flats, in 1952 they approved only 18,916. The number of houses and flats approved in New South Wales fell from 27,046 in 1946 to 18,916 in 1952 -Commonwealth under the Commonwealth -*-Order! The honourable member's time has expired the Commonwealth Parliament in 1945 had not meddled with something that did not concern it, we should not be debating this measure to-day. It is well known that, prior to the war, housing was a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the States. There was no reason why it should not have remained within the jurisdiction of the States, or why each State should not have continued to evolve its own housing policy. However, the fact remains that this Parliament did meddle with housing in 1945 and to-day is so deeply involved in it that we must take the situation as it is and, in circumstances that should never have arisen, try to find the best solution. I agree with the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) that housing is of vixal importance to this country, socially, economically and from many other points of view. All honourable members would like to see available a sufficient number of homes of a reasonable standard, at prices that people could afford to pay. But, having agreed upon those points, a more difficult problem arises. How can we achieve an objective, on which there is no dissent's The criticism of honourable members opposite has followed certain well-worn paths. I shall not reply specifically to the honourable member for Reid, because he repeated arguments that had been adduced previously by other honourable members. I shall deal with the arguments one by one, and, in so doing, deal generally with the arguments presented by honourable members opposite. The Opposition has argued that the reason why there are not enough houses of adequate quality is that the Commonmoney for housing. One branch of thai argument is that the Commonwealth has evaded its legal responsibility to provide as much money as the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement contemplated. Let us examine that claim. I do not like to quote statistics, but sometimes it is necessary to do so. In 1945-46, £6,795,000 was provided by the and State Housing Agreement. The figure rose steadily until, in 1950-51, it was £21,640,000. In this financial year, it is proposed that £37,200,000 shall be allotted to the States under the agreement. That is a six-fold increase, compared with 1945-46. We all know that the value of money has declined and that our population has increased, but I do not think any reasonable bonorable member will deny that a six-fold increase of the money provided for housing has more than kept",21,Second Reading

72,Mr Turner (Bradfield) R*,"W] Hpace with the decline in the value of money and the growth of our population. It cannot be denied that very great progress has been made in this connection, although not as much as all of us wish. One should not forget that the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement is not the only means by which money is made available so that people can acquire homes. There is also the war service homes scheme for which £2S,000,000 will be provided in this financial year. Still confining my remarks to the Commonwealth sphere, I point out that various Commonwealth departments, such as the Department of Territories, have expended substantial sums on housing. Bank, in one way and another, has provided about £20,000,000 for housing. A sum of something like £90,000,000 in one year is, to say the least, a very substantial their recent vigorous denunciation of high contribution by this Government to the solution of the housing problem. Every reasonable person admits that that is so, although it may he in the interests of honourable members opposite to appear to be unreasonable on this matter and attempt to'mislead the people. Let ine deal with the suggestion that the Commonwealth has failed to carry out its obligations under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. I shall not deal with all the legal aspects of that matter, because the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Joske) has been challenged to express his opinion on it, as a distinguished lawyer, and I hope he will have an opportunity to do so. I shall deal with it from a practical viewpoint. Let us assume that the Commonwealth is bound to provide whatever money the States 3ay they need for housing. Let us assume also that the amount of money that can be made available to the States for works of all types is limited, have, but the money of thousands of small as it is now, always has been and always must be. It is possible, for the States to say that they want £50,000,000 for housing this year, but if they were given that sum, they would have less money for other works. I presume it would be possible for the Commonwealth to say to the States, ""Under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement you are entitled to whatever money you request for housing purposes. £50,000,000, and you shall have it. But we shall have to reduce your allocations for other works"". If that proposition were put to the States, they might well say, "" We do uot want to rest on our legal rights under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. There must be some balance in our works programmes. We would rather have less money for housing, say £37,000,000, so that we shall have more money for other works "". Let us remember that it is not only loan money that is being made available for housing and other works. The allocations consist of two elements, first, such loan money as can be raised on the loan market, and secondly, a supplement in the form In addition, the Commonwealth of taxpayers' money made available by this Parliament. 1 do not know howhonorable members opposite can reconcile their statements on this subject with taxation. It may be that the two points of view are irreconcilable. It may be that, in politics, they seek to gain the support of all sorts of people by enunciating all sorts of policies that cannot be reconciled or fitted together. If so, that is grossly dishonest, politically speaking, and doubtless all sensible people realize that it i?. I turn to another argument advanced by the Opposition. Honourable members opposite are great advocates of cheap money. Cheap money is a splendid thing for the person who receives it, but the person who provides it may take a different view. We expect to raise millions of pounds by government loans. Who subscribes to government loans? I suggest that, in the main, the money is provided by small people. In general, it comes from financial institutions such as insurance companies, which invest, not the huge funds that some individuals may people. When the Opposition talks about cheap money, it means, in effect, that people who have been thrifty should lend their money cheaply. That is the other side of the picture. However, there is much to be said in favour of cheap money being made available to provide houses for people who cannot afford to pay economic rents. It is to work of that kind that You have asked for the operations, of housing commissions should be limited. There is a case for party that had not tried to sell houses cheap money for that purpose, and for to the people and the States were to be governments to make a special effort i u exculpated from any blame-so that that regard. The fact is, as the Minister houses built by State housing authorities for Works( Mr Kent Hughes) said could be sold to tenants. Apparently, last night, that cheap money has been honourable members opposite would have provided at all times under the Commonus believe that there is no obligation at wealth and State Housing Agreement. all on any of the States under the ComI think it was the honourable member for monwealth and State Housing AgreeWerriwa( Mr Whitlam) who suggested ment.

If there is any criticism which may be directed against the policies of past governments supported by the present Opposition, it is this: Too much of their legislative programmes was deliberately designed to place tlie workers in a position in which they would have a vested interest in the continuance of capitalism. That is a policy which will not have my support, at any rate. In view of the principles laid down in the part of the speech made hy Mr Dedman when this agreement was introduced into the Parliament, it is not unreasonable for ine to believe that he was stating the socialist attitude towards the ownership of homes by the people. However, we do not have to read Mr Dedman's statement to realize that that is really the socialist attitude. We know' that it is a socialist article of f a it h that nobody shall be independent at a l l ; that nobody shall be independent with respect to his home or his job, and that he must grovel, bow down and worship some socialist boss or other in order to rent a house or get a job or do anything else that he wants to do. The juggernaut of the State must be worshipped. It is true that certain provisions were 'made in the agreement for the sale of houses built by government authorities, but those provisions were regarded as very subsidiary matters, as honourable members may see by readman's speech when he introduced the bill to r a t if y the agreement. visions were quite inadequate, and did not result in the sale of a substantial number of houses to the people who wanted , them. I believe that the figures which I now intend to put before the House w ill be of some interest to honourable members. I have obtained them from the official statistics in each of the relevant States, and the percentages that I shall mention represent the proportion of homes sold under the agreement in relation to the total number built under it in each State. In New South Wales, 4.5 per cent, of the houses have been sold to tenants, in Victoria, 0.44 per cent.; in Queensland, 6.6 per cent.; and in Western Australia, rather extraordinarily, 20 per cent. It may be that the large proportion of government-built houses sold to tenants in Western Australia was due to the fact that, during the major part of the time that the agreement has been in operation, Western Australia has been administered by a Liberal government. Perhaps that government succeeded in overcoming all the obstacles put in the way of State governments by the last Labour Government. It is very easy to sec why State governments faced difficulties when they wished to sell houses built under the agreement by State authorities. Honourable members w ill realize that as a result of the inflation of the currency, houses that were built in 1947 were built much more cheaply than similar houses can be erected to-day. A t what prices are such houses to be sold, at cost price or at the present market price? The rent, of course, is based on the cost price. If such a house is to be valued at the present market price then obviously the tenant would have to make a greatly increased weekly payment towards repayment of the principal. It seems very curious to me that the honourable member for Werriwa should have been so concerned to ensure that tenants could buy their own homes. A fte r all, he is a member of the Labour party, and a Labour government framed the original Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. Moreover, the agreement was framed with the express object of discouraging sales of government-built houses, and his party, of all parties, should not complain because more of these Those prohouses have not been sold. I have read the agreement very caref u l l y, and I believe that its termination within twelve months w ill not be easy. There are all sorts of practical details to be considered which would lead one to believe that it would take much longer than twelve months to end the agreement. In any case, it must be terminated by the effluxion of time within the next two years. Honourable members opposite have said that the Commonwealth is not supplying enough money to the States, that it is evading its legal obligations, that it should supply cheaper money and that the tenants should buy their own homes, and so on. Let us pass on from those arguments with which I have already dealt, and come to the matter of what is to be done about the agreement now. It appears that the State housing authorities have grown f a r",28,Second Reading
81,Ing The Agreement Or By Reading Mr Ded,"beyond the original intention. readily concede that there are some people who cannot afford to pay an economic rent, and some who have to live in rented homes because they have to move about the country. But, with all respect to the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr amended. If we can induce more people Cramer), it appears to me that within the foreseeable future private enterprise will not be allowed to provide rental homes for the people. Therefore, it is imperative that the State housing authorities should be required to do the work they were originally intended to do, which is, to build houses purely for the people who cannot afford to pay an economic rent, and for those who cannot be expected to buy homes. It seems to me that something must be done in the re-casting of the governments to seek loan moneys for agreement to ensure that out of the limited money available for housingand the money available will always be limited no matter which party is in power -mor e provision should be made to enable the people to acquire their own homes. At the present time various obstacles stand in the way of that objective. The deposits required from people who wish to buy their houses are so high that very few can afford to pay them. Those who want to buy their own homes need low deposits, long terms and low interest rates. The agreement could be amended in respect of the value of houses tliat could be constructed under its terms. won't lend it we shall take it from them State housing authorities should return to their original .function of providing what may be called uneconomic housing, and then more scope should be given to people who want to provide their own homes by the Government making provision for small deposits, low interest rates and so on.

Turner. I there is always an obligation on all governments to make sure that conditions prevail that will enable the people to stand on their own feet. It is along those lines that I have endeavoured to indicate that this agreement should be to acquire their own homes, we shall harness one of the most powerful forces in the country. That is the thriftiness of the individual. If a man can perceive that by denying himself expenditure on other less essential things he can acquire something of real value to himself, such, as a home, he will be thrifty, will strive and will, in the end, benefit himself and the country. The alternative to the encouragement of thrift is for housing purposes. However, honourable members opposite advocate very .low interest rates. Now, there are two sides to arguments like that. We must ask ourselves whether people will be prepared to save money and lend it at low interest rates, or whether they will feel that the deprivation that makes it possible to save and lend is too great to be borne when the return from the low interest paid on their money is so small. People will not lend money unless it is worth their while to save it and lend it. Of course, the socialists approach the matter in another way They say, "" Well, if the people by way of taxation or capital levy"". In reply to that I say that if people who earn money find that it is being taken from them by way of taxation or capital levy for some socialistic purpose, a time will come when they will cease to bother to earn money. I suggest that the best, means of stimulating house construction in Australia is to make it easy for people to acquire their own homes, thereby harnessing to the drive the most powerful motive of thrift, for the ordinary person is eager to save for something which honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) quoted from Hansard in order to make a point.

If he had honoured that promise his action would have coincided with the policy of the Labour party. We believe that every family should have the opportunity to own its own home and when we again form the government we shall do everything possible to reach that desirable objective. Unfortunately, Labour has not been in office long enough to implement its policy. During the 53 years of federation, governments of the same political complexion as the present Government have been in office in the Commonwealth for 40 years. That is why so few people in Australia own their own homes. The honourable member for Bradfield told us that if the States had not muddled the housing scheme more houses would have been provided for the people. I do not agree with the honourable member. On the contrary, I believe that if this Government had not muddled the housing scheme many more houses would have been built. I understand that the Government is now interfering in Western Australia, where the State Labour Government is trying to build more .houses for the people. It has tried to prevent the State Government from building houses in the federal electorate of Curtin because it fears that if houses are built there the honourable member for Curtin, the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck), might lose his seat in this Parliament. Por that reason it has asked the State Government to build houses elsewhere. The people appreciate the efforts of State Labour governments to provide , houses for them, and they show their appreciation in a practical way by supporting Labour candidates at State elections. Under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement the Commonwealth is obliged to provide money to finance the scheme and the States are obliged to acquire land and build houses on it. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth has fallen down on its part of the bargain. During each year in which this Government has been in office, instead of providing the money requested by the States for housing purposes, it has cut down the State estimates by many millions of pounds. The biggest housing settlement in the Commonwealth is located in my electorate. The people who live in the settlement are there not because they choose to be there, but because they have been evicted from their homes by their former landlords. The huts in the settlement, which were used for hospital purposes during the war. period, have been converted to provide accommodation for homeless people. The State Government has made the settlement as comfortable as I>ossible. It is sewered and electricity services are provided, but, at best, life in the settlement is community living of the most emergency nature. If this Government had not reduced the estimates furnished by the New South Wales Government each year, many of the people who now live in the settlement would be living in their own homes. The Commonwealth reduced the amounts .requested by the States from £52,000,000 to £37,000,000, which means that the persons who are living in the housing settlement in my electorate will have-to remain there for three years instead of two years.

Of course Mr Costa. .i-equirements we must 'consider the number of obsolete houses that have to be replaced and the necessity to institute slum clearance programmes. The .cessation of house construction during a war is understandable, but there was no excuse for housing construction to be retarded during the depression years, .when men and materials were available in abundance. During the depression years our sister dominion, New Zealand, recruited Queensland and South building tradesmen in Australia to implement its housing programme. The New Zealand Labour Government of the day did not restrict Credit during the period of deflation.

The Credit .Foncier system makes available only t'J,S50 towards the construction of a home, and most homes require a much larger amount. Intending home-owners would havo to borrow at least another .t'1,200 to be able to build even a humble home in these days of high prices. The other home building plan is the war service homes scheme, the benefits of which are confined to ex-servicemen. It £25,000,000 last year. The same amount this year would not achieve much because, as previous speakers on this side of the House have shown, increased costs would, prevent the financing of as many houses as such a sum provided last year. Increased building costs possibly a vcrage £400 a. house. The total amount from, all these sources-the co-operative societies, the Commonwealth Bank and the War Service Homes Division-las t year was £3S,000,000. Wow, when the cost of an average home is £3,000, that amount would build only about 12,000 or 12,500 houses. Home ownership opportunities for the 100,000 families that require homes arc, therefore, poor at the moment. There is opportunity for only about oneeighth of the people who want homes to build them. The amount of £37,000,000 to be provided for State housing programmes will finance the building of only about 12,000 homes at an average cost of £3,000 each, and they are to be providedon a. rental basis only. It is expected that this year 80,000 couples will marry, and that we shall increase our population by 20,000 new Australians who will want homes. That means that :i 00,000 additional homes will be necessary this year. However, only about 25,000 families will be able to afford to build their own homes, which will leave 75,000 to obtain' homes, by other means. We know tliat those other means are well beyond the incomes of most salary and wage earners. It is necessary to have a {i;ood bank balance ready to be able to pay the deposit and look forward to paying the interest involved in borrowing money to build a home under present conditions. Statistics show that home ownership has been at its highest level during the regimes of Labour administrations. The census of 1933 shows that at that time 31 per cent, of the people living in houses owned them. In 1942, after years of anti-Labour administration, the figure had fallen to 2S per cent. In 1947, after two Labour governments had been in office, and even in the face of the war and post-war difficulties, the percentage had risen to 36 per cent. Labour governments made money availcalled for an expenditure of able at a cheaper interest rate, hence the higher percentages during their terms of office. One great bar to home ownership is the high interest, rate on money for home building. Interest rates have risen under this Government because it has yielded to the pressure of stock exchange investors. The increase of interest rates by -Jper cent, approved by this Government will add £270 in interest charges to the cost of a home built for £2,500 and paid for over a period of 30 years. Five per cent, interest on the same terms would mean that the cost of the home would be doubled. A rate of interest that would double the cost of a home is unfair. Because the money advanced by the. Commonwealth in respect of home building increases the interest bill on the national debt, the extra -Jper cent, interest will add enough to the bill to finance the construction of many homes. The cost, in loan money, of World War II . , was £1,500,000,000. which was mostly borrowed at a rate of 2£ per cent, or 3 per cent, interest, and never at more than 3& per cent. Those loans are falling due, and will keep falling due for the next ten years. Because the Government has permitted interest rates to rise and has, in fact, encouraged them to rise, because it represents people who gain from high interest rates man does not know what he is talking about.

96,Mr Wight (Lilley) [ 5 . 1 1 ],"I shouldheard members of the Labour party, now in Opposition indicate that though they do not like the present healthy trend towards home ownership when the people are getting away from life in State-owned houses, they are in favour of home ownership. The bill seeks to provide a sum of £37,200,000 to the States for housing purposes and to give the Government the authority to rai;;e that money by way of loan. I should like to say at the very outset that I am strongly opposed in principle to this bill, because I believe that if finance. the Australian Government is to accept the responsibility for raising that money from the people it should also have some responsibility regarding the manner in which it is to be expended. However, according to the terms of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement the Commonwealth has absolutely no responsibility in that connection, nor can it assume such a responsibility irrespective of how irresponsible may be the .actions of the States in expending the money. Unfortunately, every member of the Parliament must support this measure because we are under a legal obligation to support it, as a result of certain clauses in the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, which, I venture to say, is the most loosely and badly drafted document ever presented to this Parliament. General then? was the right honourable gentleman who is now the Leader of the Opposition. BeforeI discuss the agreement, I shall refer to some of the statements made last night by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam), who said that the agreement should be amended so as to give the States the opportunity to sell houses to their tenants. Let me assure the honourable member that, had he read the agreement closely, he would have discovered that it already confers upon the States the power to sell houses built under the agreement to the tenants. ber's interjection indicates clearly that he has not studied this problem carefully. He must know that only in rare circumstances can the purchaser of a house provide the full amount required. Almost invariably the buyer must have recourse to a bank, building society, insurance company or other agency to obtain finance for the purpose of buying the house. The Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement has been implemented in such a way as to dry up many of these sources so that individuals who wish to buy their houses to-day find that there is only a limited number of avenues that they can explore in order to obtain I strongly support the suggestion that the. Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement should be terminated. Apart from the fact that it is loose and badly drafted, it obliges the Commonwealth to pay vast sums to the States for the purpose of providing houses as stipulated in the agreement. If we include the sum of £37,200,000 for which this bill provides, the total contribution by the Commonwealth to the States up to 1953-54 will be £178,200,000. This money has not been used efficiently. Good quality houses have not been provided, and the funds have not been used for slum clearance. In fact, in many instances, the money has been used to construct new slum areas which will continue to be slums until the buildings fall to pieces. The House is not ignorant of this fact, because honourable was the Attorneymembers must recollect clearly the statement that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) made on the situation that exists at Zillmere, in Queensland. Honourable members must be aware that the money provided by the Commonwealth under the terms of the agreement has been used inefficiently. Furthermore, there is a. limit to the supply of labour and materials for house construction. The number of applications to the War Service Homes Division for finance to assist home-building has indicated the trend towards private ownership of homes. Yet, because of the use of labour and building materials for the construction of rental houses, there has been an enforced restriction of the building of houses for private ownership. That is another good reason why we should give urgent consideration to the termination of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement.",34,Second Reading

Nowherei n it is there any suggestion that the Commonwealth has power to regulate the volume of finance demanded by the States, or that the States have any responsibility to regulate their demands upon the Commonwealth. member and I are in agreement. Clause 16 (2.) providesEither tlie Commonwealth or a State may give to the other twelve calendar months' notice in writing that this Agreement shall not as between the Commonwealth and that State apply to any housing project commenced after the expiration of a period of twelve calendar months after the date of the notice and.thereupon this Agreement shall not apply to any housing project commenced by tliat State after the expiration of the said period of twelve calendar months. In other words, if the Commonwealth today gave notice to the States of its intention to terminate the agreement, the States could, with complete irresponsibility, not if y any number of projects that they desired w it h in the next twelve months and the Commonwealth would be committed to provide money for those projects. menced within the period of twelve months. a further indication of the looseness of the agreement, because, if a State merely sent a bulldozer on to a site to knock over a tree, it could claim legally to have commenced a project. How can we terminate the agreement? I say that we cannot safely do so by notification in accordance with clause 16 (2.), because the Commonwealth could be involved, by the actions of the States w it h in the next twelve months, in a legal obligation for untold years to provide untold sums to finance the completion of projects commenced by the States. That is why I suggest that urgent consideration be given to this matter and that a conference of representatives of the States and the Commonwealth be called for that purpose. I believe that we should have considerable difficulty in devising an arrangement that would be acceptable to both the States and the Commonwealth, because most of the State governments are socialist governments, and socialist governments believe in establishing a huge public service. Already we have a vast network of public service organizations known as the State housing commissions, which expend the money that the Commonwealth provides for housing. I believe that, if T h a t is quite true. we sought to alter the agreement,the F o r once the honourable States would agree only to an amendment that would permit of the continuation of these organizations. They would continue to supervise the building of houses, for private ownership or for rental, and this great army of public servants, which is leading to administrative inefficiency, would be perpetuated. However, there is ari alternative to the immediate termination of the agreement. This Government should appoint a royal commission to report upon the agreement. I believe that such a commission would expose such irresponsibility by the States and such ineffective administration as would confirm the report on the Zillmere project that the Prime Minister brought into this House.

107,"Mr Speaker ,","I say at once that Lfor a specific purpose, and honourable members are entitled to express their thoughts on that proposal. Mr ""WIGHT -As I have said, the States have acted irresponsibly, and there is doubt whether the Commonwealth is obtaining value for its money. Paragraph 7 of the interim report on the Zillmere project statedThat the Commission's decision, reasonably based in principle, to allow the contractors to proceed with new construction has resulted in public controversy, in an unsatisfactory relationship between the Commission and some of its tenants, and in a justifiable doubt on the part of the Commonwealth at this stage whether it is getting a satisfactory result from its advances under tiie C.S.H.A. and its subsidy payments under the States Grants (Imported Houses) Act, 1950. Honourable members should realize that the Commonwealth w ill lose over £500,000 iu interest charges alone, because this money is advanced to the States at an interest rate of 3 per cent, whereas the Commonwealth is obliged to pay interest at the rate of 4£ per cent, in order to raise the funds. Incidentally, I point out to the honourable member for Banks( Mr Costa) that the rate of interest was determined, not by the Australian G-overnment, but by the Australian Loan Council. If we are not obtaining a satisfactory return from our expenditure, the sooner the better it will be for us to appoint a royal commission to expose the failures of the agreement so that it can be terminated in order to save the Commonwealth from being required for many years to find vast sums for the development of slum areas. Honourable members opposite want to have the agreement amended in order to allow the States to sell the houses. They have a very good reason for that policy, because it is a well known fact that members of the Labour party in the Queensland Parliament are anxious to get out from under so as to escape responsibility for the extravagance and inefficiency of the State's housing projects. lutely untrue. Mr"" WIGHT honourable member by quoting an informative statement on this subject. I have here a clipping from a responsible newsB -[47 ] paper, the SundayM a i l , which is published in Brisbane. It published a report on the Queensland Government's housing projects under these head-linesLabour Members Say Situation . . . ""Is Hot and it's Sticky."" State seeks way out of pre-fab. "" mess"". There is a clear indication that the State Government has made a mess of the housing scheme and that the money provided by the Commonwealth has been thrown away with complete irresponsibility. The Commonwealth should not be required to find unlimited sums for the States to waste on the construction of slum areas. This money would have been used to better purpose had it been diverted, through the Commonwealth Bank, to finance the construction of houses by private enterprise for private owners. This method has been reconv mended by the honourable member for Bennelong, and I take this opportunity to congratulate h i m on his fine contribution to the debate. A passage of ""interest from the report of the Brisbane SundayM a i l reads as follows:Kecent developments iu Queensland's tragic pre-fabricated housing project threaten to bring the whole scheme down like a eard castle. Wrangling between the State Housing Commission and pre-fab contractors has assumed national importance, because of possible damage to Australia's reputation abroad. I hope that the Government w ill give consideration to that matter when it is making an approach to the Statesi n relation to the termination of the housing agreement, because that is the situation which has developed between the Queensland Government and the contractors who are building this £8,000,000 project in the Brisbane area. We have already discovered that 40 creditorsI refer to manufacturers and suppliers of building materials-ar e owed the sum of £150,164 by the firm of Le Corche Freres and Schroth. This company, as was suggested in the interim report which the Prime Minister read to the House, was placed in a most invidious position by the Queensland Government, which not only held great sums of retention money, but also became fanatical in its criticism of I shall enlighten the the method of construction employed by this firm at -Zillmere after the exposure in this House of the failure there. The Queensland Government became so tough",36,Second Reading
108,Mr George Lawson,"That is absothat it was forecast that the firm would become bankrupt under the terms of the contract. The firm has become bankrupt, and has left with the, Queensland Housing Commission responsibility for a great sum of money the amount of which that authority is loth to reveal to the court. Le Corche Freres and Schroth abandoned the project at Zillmere. That fact alone indicates that something has been wrong. At any rate, the creditors of Le Corche Freres and Schroth asked that materials and equipment to the 'value of £150,164 which had not been paid for should be returned to them. The housing commission had taken over all the assets without an inventory or any consideration of whether Le Corche Freres and Schroth had any legal entitlement to the materials. The commission has refused to pay to the suppliers of the materials the moneys which were owing to Le Corche Freres and Schroth. The Building Industry Credit Bureau in Queensland has asked that the housing commission make available to the court, so that the contents may be perused, a contract signed with Le Corche Freres and Schroth, but the Queensland Government has refused, for a very good reason, to do so. The very good reason is that the suppliers of the materials might find in the contract a clause which would allow them ,to take legal proceedings against the commission for the return of their property, or payment in lien thereof. This situation suggests that a cloak-anddagger game is being played by the housing commission. Everything has not been done above-board. Everything is being cloaked. In the words of the press, "" A plywood screen has been drawn over the commission's project"". That statement is perfectly true. This difficulty has arisen with the firm of Le Corche Freres and Schroth, but we also discover that the Italian firm of Pasotti is in a similar plight. The Brisbane Sunday Mail has stated, relative to that matterA representative of Pasotti, an Italian firm shortage, and I have been informed that erecting 1,000 pre-fabs at Carina, has gone it is impossible to give an estimate of the back to Italy to consult his principals on finance and other difficulties. I shall now refer to the value of the member for Banks plucked a figure out of houses which have been built by the the air in a completely irresponsible manQueensland Housing Commission. I had ner when he said that Australia required one of these dwellings valued by an indean additional 420,000 dwellings to overpendent valuator in Brisbane, and he con-, come the shortage. I say positively that sidered that the market value would be the honourable gentleman just does not. Mr Wight. between £1,400 and £1,600. Yet it has been estimated that the cost of building houses of this type will be approximately £3,500. That money is obtained from loans subscribed by the Australian people. If £3,500 is expended on a structure worth between £1,400 and £1,600, I can claim definitely that the money which the Commonwealth is providing under the housing agreement is being handled irresponsibly by the .States, and that this state of affairs should be terminated as quickly as possible. Let us consider some of the other contracts existent in Queensland. In the Serviceton area, 700 houses are being erected by sub-contractors. At Cooper's Plains, 300 Dutch houses are being built, with an option of an additional 700 dwellings. I believe that some query has arisen about the option. I do not think that everything is quite as it should be there. At Carina, 100 prefabricated houses of Italian origin are to be built. The whole housing situation in Australia requires close scrutiny and investigation, with a view to discovering whether there is really a housing shortage or whether, as the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) has suggested, there is a failure in the matter of the competent distribution of houses. This matter is important. The Commonwealth Statistician has revealed that whereas previously there were a little more than four persons to a house, to-day there are only 3.07 persons to a house. In addition, the findings of a gallup poll recently indicate that fewer people are living in houses at the present time than previously. I cannot state definitely the extent of the housing shortage, and the honourable member for Banks, who has said that Australia requires 420,000 houses to make up the leeway, is in no better position to estimate it than I am. I have referred this matter to the most competent authority available to us in an endeavour to discover the housing position to-day. Evidently, the honourable know. I asked the competent authority the following question:What is the estimated shortage of houses to-day? The reply was as follows:The Census of June, 1947, indicated that about 100,000 dwellings would have been needed to eliminate home sharing. Perhaps another 50,000 would have been required to rehouse families living in boarding houses, rooms and other unsatisfactory accommodation. The greatly increased house building rate since then has reduced this maximum backlog of 150,000 houses, but it is impossible to say what the shortage is to-day. In our opinion, however, current demand iucludes only a small component from this source. Since 1947 when the estimated shortage was 150,000 houses, no fewer than 338,075 dwellings have been built. I hope that the Government w ill investigate the whole situation. This Parliament should not continue to raise loan moneys, or appropriate money for the Statesf o r the' construction of houses, u n t i l the true position workers from 1910 u n t i l the making has been ascertained. Opposition members admit that it is preferable to provide money with a view to enabling persons to purchase their homes than to finance tbe construction of State-owned homes. We should put the Opposition to the test on this matter. able member has exhausted his time. [5.40] I have listened with great in terest to the speeches of Government supporters on this bill, particularly those of the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight) and the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer). heartedly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen). opposite may not be aware that the Queensland Government has been urging this Government during the last twelve months to summon a conference of the interested bodies to reconsider the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement with a view to amending it so that many more people w ill have the opportunity to purchase their homes. The Ministerf or Works( Mr Kent Hughes) and the honourable member for Bennelong have endeavoured to make the people believe that when Labour governments are in office, very few people are able to purchase their homes under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. The Minister and the honourable member for Bennelong seemed to have the Queensland Government particularly in mind when they made those statements. The Minister produced figures which showed that only 314 houses built in Queensland under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement had been purchased since the making of the agreement in 1945. Such a claim is completely untrue. I received to-day an official statement which gives the exact position. For many years, Queensland has been recognized as the State that has made it possible for the workers to own their homes. More workers own their homes in Queensland in proportion to the population, than in any other State. The explanation is that Queensland Labour governments built and sold homes to the of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement in 1945. Approximately 26,000 dwellings were built by Queensland governments in that period of 35 years, and 24,000 of them have been paid off. The remaining 2,000 are being paid off by weekly instalments. I do not know the source from which the Minister obtained his figure. He may have been indulging in guess-work, or he may have been merely tryin g to mislead the House and the people. The honourable member for Bennelong claimed that 6.6 per cent, of the houses built under the Commonwealth and StateI wholeHousing Agreement had been sold to the people.

112,"(Vide Page 90), On Motion By Mr Ken T","settlement is of the utmost importance, not only because there is an obligation on the people of this country to redeem their promises to those who fought for them, but also because no general scheme of land settlement can be undertaken until soldiersettlement has been completed. A general scheme of land settlement in this country is essential, because unless we increase our production of food we shall be unable to feed an increasing Australian population, even without making any contribution to the feeding of a hungry world, although that is an obligation that we should seek to fulfil. Food production is the means by which we live. It is the basis of our standard of living. A diminishing food production means a diminishing standard of living. Therefore, it is of the utmost seriousness that, since 1939, the number of farms in this country has diminished by 10,000 and the area of land under cultivation has become less. The area of land under cultivation has become less, despite the fact that since 1939 the population of Australia has increased by over 1,500,000 people, despite our soldier settlement schemes, despite every inducement and incentive held out to the primary producer to increase his production, and despite the fact that since 1939 the return from primary production in this country has increased by from 1,200 per cent, to 1,600 per cent. The -fewer rural producers on the land now obtain from twelve to sixteen times as much for their products .as they did in 3939. Therefore, it cannot be said that poor prices are forcing primary producers off the land. It is not true to say either that farmers are fleeing from arduous conditions on the land and that there are no people in this country willing or capable to take their places. Since the last world war, over 36,000 ex-servicemen have applied for land and have been classified as eligible for primary production. Many of them were specially trained by the Government. trained were guaranteed by government authorities as being qualified for positions on the land. But of those 36,000 men, fewer than 9,000 have received -Soldie r farms, although eight years have elapsed since the end of the war. In New South Wales, of the 1S,938 applicants eligible and qualified to go upon the land, 2,002 have received farms. In Victoria, 10,792 men applied for farms; and 1,847 have secured them. In Queensland, 1,739 men applied for farms, and 442 have secured them. In South Australia, 536 of the 2,7.96 applicants have obtained farms. In Western Australia, 836 of the 1,593 applicants have secured farms. In Tasmania, there were 232 applicants, and 136 of them have obtained farms. In that State there are also 440 applicants who have not yet been classified as eligible for primary production. In Victoria, 2,259 men have obtained single-unit farms, but the scheme under which single-unit farms were allotted no longer operates. In addition to the ex-servicemen who desire to go upon the land, there are vast numbers of civilians who desire to do so. In Victoria, over 20,000 civilians are willing and eager to go on the land. It would' not be an understatement to say that throughout Australia there are, in addition to ex-servicemen, over 100,000 people who are willing and eager to go on the land but have no opportunity to secure farms. Yet, despite those facts, there are people who say that we must bring immigrants to this country in order to solve our rural problem. There are others, including members of the Government parties, who maintain that the solution of our food production problem is to destroy or restrict secondary industries and, by that means, to force men and resources into the development of the land. In 1951, the present Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) enunciated that policy in his budget speech. Immediately afterwards, the policy was put into opera-tion. The result was that 100,000 people employed in secondary industries were put out of work, but not one of them secured a farm. The reason why many ex-servicemen and other people in the community who desire to obtain farms cannot get them is that the price of land Those who were not is too high. ber for Riverina( Mr Roberton) says",40,Second Reading

114,Mr Roberton,Rubbish!,41,Second Reading
115,Mr Peters,"The honourable in em"" Rubbish!"" Other members of the Government parties concur in that interjection. figures from the Government which showed the present cost of soldier settlement. The cost of settling 863 ex-servicemen on the land in Western Australia was approximately £15,000,000.. ber should get his figures right. They were supplied by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) less than a month ago, and they are recorded in Hansard. In Western Australia, 863 persons were put on the land at a cosl. of £15,000,000, or about £17,000 a settler. In South Australia, 536 persons were put on the land at a cost of £10,000,000, or about £18,000 a settler. In Tasmania, 136 settlers were put on the land at a cost not been successful is that the price of of £5,000,000, or about £30,000 a settler. The fact that those figures are conservative is revealed by a footnote to the answer that the Minister for the Interior supplied to my question. The footnote is to the effect that we cannot discover the cost of settling ex-servicemen on the land by dividing the number of men settled into the cost of settlement because there is still some developmental work to be carried out at the expense of the Government. So, in reality, probably the cost of settling a man on the land is considerably greater than the figures I have cited. We must bear in mind that ex-servicemen have been settled on the land under the most advantageous circumstances as far as the price of land is concerned. Many of the settlers were allotted land at a time when land sales control operated and' land was obtainable much more cheaply than to-day. In one State, 342 blocks in one district were purchased under land sales control. That State, like other States that operate under the agreehas been peremptorily dismissed in a few ment made between the Commonwealth and the States, had to decide what the economic value of the land was. The economic value is determined by taking the prices of primary products over a period of years and striking an average. The price of land to the settler is based on the economic value, and the difference between that figure and the purchase price is met by the State concerned and the Commonwealth. The purchase price of the 342 allotments, to which I have RecentlyI obtained some referred was £117,000 more than the economic value. That is approximately £300 in the case of each block. Since this Government discarded land sales control, 180 blocks have been purchased in the same district. The difference between the economic value of the blocks and the price paid for them was £870,000, or approximately £5,000 a block. I have in my possession a list of blocks purchased recently by a State government. In every case, the economic value is £5,000 or more greater than the purchase price. Under those circumstances, how is it possible to make a success of soldier settlement? I have already said that the reason why soldier settlement has land that is readily productive is too high. I have shown that the cost of settling an ex-serviceman on the land is £30,000 in Tasmania, about £18,000 in South Australia, and about £17,000 in Western Australia. The cost is becoming greater as time goes on. Yet, when the Minister for the Interior introduced the measure that is now being debated, he saidThis bill provides for the raising of loan moneys amounting to £7,000,000 to finance advances to States for war service land settlement. This money will be advanced under approved conditions to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania to be used by those States for the acquisition, development and improvement of land for subdivision and allotment to classified ex-servicemen, and for providing those ex-servicemen with working capital and finance for purchasing structural improvements, stock, plant and equipment. Therefore, £7,000,000 will be raised and allocated to the States for war service land settlement, but the whole matter of the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land words by the Minister. No matter that could possibly come before this House is of more importance to the future of the people than is the settlement of our citizens upon the land. But £7,000,000 will not do much more than pay the difference between the economic price and the purchase price of about 1,000 allotments of land. However, the money will not be raised solely to purchase land; it",41,Second Reading
116,Mr Hamilton,The honourable mem,42,Second Reading
117,Mr Peters,"I have got them right.will be raised to enable the States to acquire land, subdivide it, finance structural improvements and buy plant, stock and equipment. Surely honourable members will realize that £7,000,000 will not do more than settle about an additional 500 ex-servicemen upon the land; It is eight years since the end of the last world war, and of the 36,000 ex-servicemen who have applied to be settled on the land, less than 9,000 have been so settled. Therefore, 27,000 ex-servicemen are still waiting to be placed on the land and they must be settled befors this country can embark on the great general scheme of land settlement that is so essential to our future development. At the present rate of progress it will take from 27 to 54 years to settle on the land all the ex-servicemen of the last world war. That being so, when will the qualified ex-servicemen of the Korean war be settled on the land? They will have to wait in the queue for any time up to 50 years. We might also ask when the Government will settle the 100,000 civilians who are at present waiting' to become primary producers, and when will it settle the vast number of immigrants who must be settled on the land if we are to increase our population and feed that increase. The settlement of all those people is an utter impossibility under the existing scheme of land settlement, and therefore we must devise new schemes. What to do about land-hungry people who are living in close proximity to land that is practically unused is not a new problem, nor is it confined to this country. In the early days of the Communist revolution in Russia the revolutionaries exploited that situation. It was also exploited in all the Russian satellite States, and it is being exploited to-day in China. Down through the years, in every age and in every country, turmoil and revolution have resulted from landhungry people being denied access to the land. NowI desire to make some practical suggestions about this matter. Land settlement has been investigated time after time because it is a matter that has concerned governments down through the ages. France was forced to smash up large estates and to divide the land among the people by inheritance laws, so that those capable of using it could do so r and it was no longer allowed to lie idleQuite recently America was forced to introduce anti-land speculation legislation, and under that legislation vast numbers of people have been settled on the land and have carried out intense cultivation. In other countries resumption laws and land taxes have been used to subdivide large areas of land, and to increase food production and the numbers of the farming population. Because land settlement is of outstanding importance in our age and generation, and because our whole future as a nation depends on the manner in which we settle our people, the Minister for the Interior should appoint a committee on land settlement, and take all possible action to co-ordinate the activities of the States so that they will act in such a way as to enable the maximum number of ex-servicemen to be settled as quickly as possible. I know that the acquisition of land is a matter for the States. They purchase the land and carry out the scheme of land settlement, but this Government provides the money; as it pays the piper, I suggest that it is entitled to call the tune. It is entitled to lay down certain conditions under which money will be made available so that ex-servicemen can be properly settled upon the land with a reasonable chance of success. This bill provides for the raising of money that will ultimately be advanced to the States on approved conditions. We have to determine what those conditions will be, and should accept our responsibility in that regard. This ia a matter that transcends party political issues altogether. It is a matter of outstanding and urgent importance, and therefore we should set up a committee to work out means to promote the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land, and the settlement of others who desire to go on the land. It is obvious to anybody who has travelled in this country that readily cultivable land is available. In one part of Victoria there are 700,000 acres of the most fertile land in Australia, and 600,000 acres of that land could be made available to ex-servicemen. They could be settled upon it, and it would almost immediately become productive. After that may be achieved. In some cases 600,000 acres had been taken the present ex-servicemen have increased the producland-holders would be left with sufficient tion of the land upon which they have land to return them not merely a reasonbeen settled. On an earlier occasion I able living, but a very good living. They referred to an estate in my electorate of would be able to produce as much from 15,000 acres which had been worked by the land that would be left to them under one man and a boy who ran a few wethers that scheme as they send to the market on it It was said that a neighbour to-day. About 1,200 ex-servicemen could could sow 1,000 acres of wheat on it, be settled on those 600,000 acres. What strip the crop and take it away without is true of that small part of Victoria is any one being the wiser. The estate was true also of other areas of the Commonresumed for war service land settlement wealth. In every State there is land of purposes and there has since been a great that description available. There is increase in production from it. I remind plenty of land that is not being used to the honourable member for Burke( Mr its full capacity at present, and no man Peters) that the State governments have has an inalienable right to keep out of power to resume land which they believe production land that is essential, not is not being fully and economically merely to the welfare of others but to utilized.

I discussed this matter land shall produce food, through the with the Premier of South Australia settlement of those who served their some time ago in connection with the decountry so well in the days of war.

In explanation of that fact, the production, and there is no better way to Premier said to me, "" I got the best start than to settle ex-servicemen on the results by whispering around the district land.

118,Mr Fairbairn (Farrer) [8.27],"efforts of the agent States, the effort of New South Wales is absolutely pitiful. In that State, 17,000 applications for blocks are still unsatisfied. In the present financial year the New South Wales Government proposes to expend £2,'500,000 to settle 17,000 ex-servicemen on the land, compared with a proposed expenditure by the agent States of approximately £8,600,000 to settle 3,500 ex-servicemen. The story does not end there. In New South Wales, repayments received from settlers amount to approximately £1,300,000, so that the new money to be provided by the Government pf that State amounts to less than £1,250,000. vicemen has the New South Wales Government settled on the land? far. By far the best contribution to the scheme made by the three principal States has been made by Victoria, which has expended £32,000,000 from loan funds, compared with a total expenditure by New South Wales of approximately £23,000,000. This Government is criticized on the ground that it makes available to the State insufficient loan allocations for war service land settlement purposes. Honourable members will realize that the Commonwealth cannot make direct payments to the States for this purpose and that it can only do its utmost to ensure that all available money shall be provided. The manner in which the money is expended by the States is a matter for the States themselves. This Government has supplemented the loan funds available to the States during the last two years-in 1951-52 by an amount of £153,000,000, and in 1952-53, by an amount of £135,000,000. This year an additional amount of £95,000,000 is to be made available. I do not want to weary honourable members by quoting the percentages of allocations to the States which have been actually used by them for war service land settlement purposes. All honourable members"" know that they have been progressively reduced. In New South Wales the percentage dropped from a maximum of 27 per cent, in the highest year-1948-4 9 -to 2.8 per cent, last year. A ll of us desire to see the scheme placed on a very much better footing. The Commonwealth has waived its right to apply to its own purposes 20 per cent, of all loan moneys raised. It has passed on its share to the States and is doing everything it can do to assist them to meet their obligations. I propose to discuss the scheme as it operates in my own State because I am more familiar with the position there than in the other States. While we all can agree that New South Wales has achieved remarkable results in the operation of the scheme, they are not as good as we hoped they would be or, indeed, as they should have been. Already large numbers of ex-servicemen have been settled on the land, but the conditions of settlement could, have been made better. For instance, far too many certificates have been issued. The conditions under which certificates were issued were too easy. It must be borne in mind that this is a war service land settlement scheme and not a closer settlement scheme. If an opportunity to settle on the land is to be regarded as a reward for services rendered to the country during the war, let us ensure that those who actually served in the Forces during the war arc given first preference. In New South Wales men who were called up and served only a few months in Australia possess the same right to ballot for a block as does the man who volunteered early in the war and spent a long time overseas fighting for his country. I know of many men who did not get beyond Queensland who are already settled on the land under the scheme while many excellent soldiers who did their bit on the battlefield are still waiting to be settled, and apparently will wait in vain. Victoria has adopted a points system under which those who served abroad are granted points according to their length, of service. They also obtain additional points if they have had experience on the land. Many men in New South Wales have obtained certificates notwithstanding the fact that they have little or no knowledge of the land. Surely it would have been better to issue a smaller number of certificates and make certain that those most likely to make good on the land have an opportunity to secure blocks. In New South Wales the scheme has broken down because the Government of that State has",44,Second Reading

126,Mr Mcleod (Wannon) [8.43],"Th eas Australians, and this Parliament made certain promises to them. I have always maintained that rehabilitation of ex-servicemen is a definite Commonwealth responsibility. argued that because the power to resume estates that are to be made available for war service land settlement belongs to the States alone, the States should carry the burden of providing the capital cost. The proposed acquisition by the New South Wales Government of estates at the 1942 values was challenged in 1949 by a landowner. Judgment was given that the States had the power to resume land. The judgment also pointed out that the Commonwealth had no power to resume land except on just and reasonable terms. The lack of that power is being used by this Government as an excuse to evade its obligations. It can withhold aid to a State on the ground that it has not acquired the land in question at a just price. The Commonwealth has a responsibility for the settlement of ex-servicemen that is at least equal to that of the States, if not greater. Yet this Government is restricting loan moneys that are to be used for that purpose. Honourable members opposite ask why the State governments do not use more of the loan moneys available to them for the purposes of land settlement instead of using it for other purposes. I know that at one time a Country party Premier of Victoria had the alternative of restricting expenditure on capital works, the police force, roads and government instrumentalities, including the irigation works, or of making more money available for war service land settlement. If he had devoted more of the available loan moneys to settlement he would have had to restrict big public works, in which hundreds of ex-servicemen were employed, and would have thrown these men out of work. That is no sound way in which to conduct a land settlement programme. The whole thing boils down to the fact that this Government, which holds the purse strings, can evade its responsibilities in relation to war service land settlement by refusing to co-operate with the States in regard to settlement on land that it may choose to consider was not acquired at a just price. It can restrict loan moneys to the States and can throw the whole burden of financing war service land settlement on them. The States Now, however, it is have not available to them the great revenue resources that are available to the Commonwealth. They have to rely on Commonwealth hand-outs and such revenue as they can raise by taxes in fields into which the Commonwealth does, not enter. Yet this Government is leaving' to them the burden of repatriating ex-servicemen on its behalf. If the States went ahead and found the money for war service land settlement, and a slump in land values of 25 per cent, or more occurred, they would be left in a serious position. No State could undertake such a task. I agree with previous speakers that the States have done a far better and more economical job of settling ex-servicemen on the land than the Commonwealth has done. I have some figures here that were supplied by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes), which are nothing short of amazing when considered in conjunction with the fact that the Australian Government has all the resources of the nation behind it. A total of 4,621 applicants have been classified as eligible and suitable for settlement and out of those the Commonwealth has settled 1,535, leaving 3,086 still to be settled. After eight years! The cost of the purchase of land, development and improvement, and advances to settlers in the agent States has been £29,421,000. Victoria settled approximately 2,000 settlers at a cost of about £23,000,000 so it achieved at a lower cost more than did the Commonwealth. It would be far better if the Commonwealth were merely to provide the capital cost to the States and otherwise stay out of the business altogether. It could, of course, have control of the money to see that it was properly expended, but otherwise the work should be left to the' States, which can do a better and cheaper job. In Western Australia, acquisition of land out of Commonwealth funds has cost £3,262,000, development and improvement £6,789,000 and advances to settlers £4,874,000. In South Australia, acquisition of land has been cheap, liaving cost £1,917,000. It may be that the land acquired in that State is in remote areas to which the State w ill have to build roads, or is distant from railways. The cost of development and i m provement in South Australia was £6,606,000, and advances to settlers cost £1,280,000. The figures in Tasmania are amazing. £958,000, development and improvement £3,014,000 and advances to settlers £721,000. settlers under tlie war service land settlement scheme. per cent, difference in the figures for the principal States and the agent States.

127,Mr Mcleod.,"tlie last three years. What is the reason? It is of no use to say that it is lack of money, because the Government takes no financial risk by making money available to put men on the land. The land is an asset, and when men are put on to it to work, they imrjrove the value of that asset. They have to pay interest on the loans made to them, and they will work hard and produce more in order to clear themselves of debt. The Commonwealth's outlay will be returned in. the form of interest payments, capital repayments, increased primary production and increased tax revenue. The reason why this Government will not put this great scheme into complete operation is that it has yielded'to the pressure of great landand fertile areas are available for subdiviowners. As I have said, there is no valid excuse for great holdings of land. If we do not populate our sparsely populated areas then perhaps some other nation will decide to do so. X do not know why land-owners wish to hold on greedily to great areas that they cannot work to the full but which would support probably 20 or 30 familes. Perhaps they are imbued with the old feudal idea of Owning all the land that they can see from their doorsteps. At any rate, they refuse to sell at any price. Therefore, we should find ways and means of resuming many of these large areas, at a just price, of course. How shall we determinea just price ? Whatever method we employ, the prices charged to settlers must not be beyond their capacity to repay. This Government must bear a share of any loss incurred in such transactions. Neither the States nor the settlers can shoulder all the costs. The States have not enough loan money with which to acquire land for the settlement of ex-servicemen and, if needed. We must increase primary prothis Government alone undertakes the task of acquiring the land, it will have to perity. The Government has appointed take the full financial responsibility. The Minister for the Interior knows that there will be no land settlement of ex-servicemen if the Australian Government has to bear the entire responsibility, and that the have more farmers on the land, and young State governments cannot afford the enormous cost of conducting settlement without help. Therefore, unless the Commonwealth and the States co-operate, war serhonour its promises to ex-servicemen ard vice land settlement must come to an end. The nation made great promises to its .""servicemen during the war, but apparently those promises are to be dishonoured like the promises that were made to us when weserved in World WarI . Our promised rewards never materialized, and eventually we were regarded as a nuisance when our demands threatened to affect the interests of those who had made the promises. This measure represents the complete repudiation of a solemn promise that was given to our servicemen by the nation. That promise, if carried into effect, would benefit the nation. However, this Government apparently wants to send ex-servicemen out to the scrub, as returned soldiers of World WarI . were sent to the Mallee in Victoria many years ago. Yet large sion. Some of these great holdings have been resumed already, fortunately, because the Lahour Government in Victoria did magnificent work between 1945 and 1947. The men who were settled on those subdivisions will do well and the State will prosper, which will be of advantage to the entire nation because the States are the nation. To think only in terms of individual States is wrong. After all, this is a National Parliament representative of all the States. The prosperity of any State must reflect the prosperity of the nation as a whole. The Government and its supporters know very well that they have an obligation to honour the promises that were made to our servicemen. Therefore, they must find a means of financing this vital national work of land settlement. Unless those promises are honoured, we shall find that the task of defending Australia will become more and more difficult. Many immigrants are coming to Australia, and new farms are duction if we Ere to feed our growing population and promote national prosa committee of its supporters to study primary production and find methods of increasing our output, but there is only one way to increase production. We must men at that. They will give us all the production that we need. The obligation rests squarely upon this Government to to provide finance for the land settlement scheme, instead of leaving the job to the States. Apparently it fears that land prices will fall in the future and that, in that event, it will he called upon to hear the cost. Therefore, it has refused to commit itself and has said that the States must accept ful l responsibility for war service land settlement. I condemn it roundly for its repudiation of its promises to Australia's fighting men. ously, I do not want to devote my time to an analysis of the remarks of the honourable member for Wannon( Mr this process should stop. The mere fact McLeod). Nevertheless, one or two of the statements that he made could not be overlooked by anybody who has any knowledge' of this subject. First, he critisettlement scheme, from my point of cized the agreements under which the Governments of Queensland and New South Wales operate their war service land settlement schemes. I must, point out to him that the basis of land settlement in those States was selected by the Labour governments of those States in consultation with the then Labour government of the Commonwealth. I well remember that the honourable member for Wannon in 1945 defended the agreements between the Commonwealth and New South Wales and Queensland and assured the House that they would work out satisfactorily from the point of view of the contracting States. It is futile for him to criticize the Commonwealth at this stage for the way the agreements have worked, because he himself held them up to us as models of what such agreements ought to be. The main theme of the honourable gentleman's speech, which is the usual theme of all speeches made by honourable members opposite on the subject of war service land settlement, was that large estates ought to be cut up and made available to ex-servicemen. Well, many Australians who are eager to settle on the land would regard the honourable member as the holder of a large estate that would be suitable for closer settlement ! He and the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), from whom, no doubt, we shall hear later in this debate, because it has become more or less traditional for certain honourable members on both, sides of the House to engage in these discussions, consistently urge the. subdivision of large land holdings. They see all squatters as the owners of properties that ought to be resumed for closer settlement. Others see the honourable member for Wannon, for example, in a similar light. I recall that, in -a previous debate on this subject, certain honourable members who themselves were soldier settlers were cited as property owners whose holdings should now be cut up and made available for others who wish to settle on the land. Before we go any further, we should consider where that a person owns certain large holdings is no reason for taking his land from him. The trouble with the war service land view, is not so much that the present Government has departed from the policy laid down by the former Labour Government as that it has followed all too closely in the footsteps of that Government. Whatever the result of war service land settlement may be, the fact remains that the agreements with the States were laid down primarily by the Labour Government and have proceeded very much on the same lines since this Government took office. The rate of settlement also has remained very much the same. That is my main point of criticiism. Despite the urgent need and unlimited opportunity for closer settlement, particularly ex-service settlement, there has been little variation of the programme that was laid down five or six years ago with a total lack of imagination. It is very unpleasant to criticize a government that one normally supports, particularly when that government has been subjected to an attack on purely party political lines. I am sorry that the two members of the Opposition who have spoken in this debate have attacked the Government, because it is fair to say that at no stage, either in government or in opposition, has the Labour party dealt with war service land settlement as an objective in itself. Always its attitude has been influenced by the views of the Minister who was first in charge of the scheme, Mr Dedman, who made it perfectly plain in this House that he regarded settlement, not so much as the fulfilment of an obligation or a method of placing more men upon the land as independent farmers, as a means of takinir land from certain freeholders and givinc:",48,Second Reading
128,Mr Gullett (Henty) [9.4],"Obviit to others who would become tenants of the Government and be answerable to the Government for anything that they did. This is the first point upon which one might reasonably question the sincerity of the Labour party on this issue. It has always regarded war service land settlement as a political issue. The settlement scheme fits in well with its political beliefs. As Mr Dedman said in this House on one occasion, as I remember, the Labour Government did not intend to establish another race of capitalists in this land. Mr Dedman, of course, again proposes to contest the electorate of Corio, but, as every one knows, he has very little hope of winning the seat. At any rate, the Labour party has never deviated from the point of view that he expressed. Therefore, I say that all the talk that we hear from the Opposition side of the House on this subject is of doubtful sincerity. The war service land settlement project fits in very neatly with the Opposition's view that the Government ought to control the means of production. Let' everybody remember that the former Labour Government was persuaded only with great difficulty to give ex-service settlers freehold rights over their land. For some years, under the agreements to which the Labour Government was a party, ex-servicemen who applied for blocks of land were offered only what amounted to tenant rights. They were placed on blocks as tenants without hope of owning the land at any time. The first point to be remembered when we consider this subject, in my opinion, is that the basis of war service land settlesive Ministers on the matter, the fact ment is our obligation to honour promises that were made to our servicemen during the war. The welfare of the country, the need for increased production, and other such issues should not enter into consideration in the first instance. The fact is that members and supporters of this Government and many honourable members opposite made solemn promises to sailors, soldiers and airmen that, if they served their country in a theatre of war, survived the conflict, and were capable of running a farm, land would be made available to them after the war had ended. That is the first basis upon which we must consider this problem. Looked at in that light, the performance of any government since the war ended cannot be considered to be particularly impressive. I am glad to hear that honourable members opposite at least lack the temerity to contradict that assertion. This Government, I repeat, has continued the scheme much as the Labour Government left it. Whether the promises made by the leaders of all political parties during the war were wise or not is of no consequence. The fact is that they were made. Yet only a few thousand ex-servicemen have been settled on the land. Many are waiting to be settled, and many others have sickened of waiting and have been forced by circumstances, as the honourable member for Wannon rightly pointed out, to surrender all hope of being settled, and have entered other occupations. This is the situation eight years after' the end of the war. It can scarcely be a matter of pride to any of us that, year after year, we have stood by in the knowledge that this situation has existed without insisting that something be done to rectify it. I come now to another matter, and not without some heat. The honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn), the honourable member for Wannon, other honourable members and I have pointed out, year after year, not only to this Government, but also to other governments, the obligation to honour promises, and the desperate need to do so. Yet, despite whatever may be ""said here, and the somewhat glib assurances of succesremains that this situation persists, and so one is almost reduced to asking oneself whether there is any use in honourable members rising in their places and talking on this subject at all. If time permits, I shall make further reference to this matter. The problem of the land settlement of ex-servicemen is by no means new in Australia. It has engaged the attention of governments since the earliest times. In the first instance, governors from England made land available to men who had served with some distinction in the armed forces of those days, either on the land in charge of our earliest settlers, or in bringing fleets to this country. There was always a deliberate attempt to encourage men who had served their country to take up land. For my part, I find that wholly commendable because there can be no greater idea or ideal than that those who serve their country are entitled to hold a block of it in their own possession, and, for the want of a better word, for their own profit. As time passed, State legislatures made provision for free selectors, and the Parliament of the Commonwealth introduced legislation after. World WarI . and World War II . to provide for the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land. Unfortunately, all the schemes in the past have met with only a is increasing, and we are not able to moderate measure of success. It is unsatisfy it, except by the grace of good fortunately true that the rural populaseasons. The obligation devolves 'upon tion-the number of persons. engaged in us to feed our neighbours. Many Asian primary production-ha s not increased countries which formerly were unable to very greatly over the last 50 years. One buy our goods because of their limited of the primary reasons for that fact is standard of living, have become so highly that the prices which the products of industrialized that they can compete for, the land, such as wheat and wool, have and pay good prices for our products. commanded in the markets of the world, In view of all those circumstances, the and particularly in our home market, time was never more opportune when a have not been satisfactory. Until recent far-seeing Australian Government could years our products were in competition introduce a large-scale scheme for closer with the commodities of South America, settlement. Of course, it is quite footling North America, South Africa and New to talk about any scheme of closer settleZealand, and the world market had a ment on a large scale while we still have relatively poor, or limited, power to pay on our books promises which have not yet for them. The position has entirely been honoured, to settle our own sailors, altered now, for a number of reasons, one soldiers and airmen on the land. It is of which is that our own home market highly distasteful for me to criticize even has greatly increased. Indeed, without by implication the Government which I getting gloomy on this subject, I cannot have always supported since it has been help but point out that since World War in office, in view of the purely party poliIL , there has been an almost constant tical line which certain Opposition memshortage of one primary product o? bers take on this subject, but I must another in Australia. There is hardly emphasize that I consider that the time ever a time when the Australian comfor talking about this matter, and not munity is not short of eggs, potatoes, really doing something about it, has onions, milk or bacon. Had it not been ended. Ex-servicemen have been settled for an extraordinary run of good on'the land at the rate of a few hundred seasons, Ave should have difficulty to-day a. year.

Mr Gullett. Then again, people in the densely populated countries to the north of Australia are underfed, and, indeed, starving. That situation has prevailed for a long time, but it is now changing in one important respect. Hitherto, no international organization existed to give voice to a feeling of world resentment at, or intolerance of, such a situation. Now, there are all sorts of means whereby pressure can be brought to bear on this country to do. one of two things. Australia can either produce goods or food for the people of Asia and Europe, or admit the nationals of those countries, which we have not the least desire to do, to produce those goods and commodities for themselves. Consider the facts. Our own demand There are many reasons why the rate of war service land settlement has not been so satisfactory as it might have been. The primary reason why the whole pace of soldier settlement was unsatisfactory after the end of World War II . was that a Labour government was in office, and a particularly socialist Minister was responsible for the formulation of the war service land settlement scheme. should not spoil his speech at this stage. the man to whom I refer was a socialist? He admitted that he was a socialist and the admission, fortunately, cost hi m his seat. He believed that the war service land icttlement scheme should be used as a. weapon, as it were, to socialize the means of rural production. I am not criticizing him personally. He honestly believed in such a scheme, just as many Opposition members honestly believe in i l to-day. On that ground, he stood, or fell. Fortunately,-lie fell. He believed that it was the only basis of soldier settlement, l i e always thought of soldier settlement in terms of a great Federal and State scheme in which everything would be organized. From the start, the scheme was bogged too deeply in regulations, red tape, and Federal and State administration. The United States of America, which has tackled this problem on a. number of occasions after wars, has adopted a f a r more practical approach to it than hiis Australia. The Americans said, in !fleet, "" If we want to settle our veterans on the laud, the primary problem is a financial one. How are we to pay for the Mocks. Who is to be responsible for the enormous amount of public moneys involved? "" The Americans did not set up a great government department to undertake that responsibility, but agreed that the right people to administer large sums of money for settlement were those who have traditionally done so, that is to say, the trading banks. Whether we like it or not, the people who have most successfully financed land settlement in Australia throughout our history have been th?, trading banks. They are accustomed to evaluing land and stock, ahd, most important of all, as you, Mr Speaker, will agree, they are most accustomed to evaluing men. Right from the beginning, we should have done as the United States of America has done. We should have made the moneys available, backed the banks, and told them, in turn, to back the people who wished to secure properties in order to engage in primary production of any description. Some honourable members think almost exclusively in terms of grazing properties. I am thinking also in terms of places that can pro"" duce vegetables-, fowls, turkeys-indeed , primary products of every kind. Had such a scheme been introduced, war W h o w ill deny that service land settlement would be on a much better basis than it is at the present time. I now turn briefly to the cost of the scheme. In the last twelve months the average cost of settling a man on the land in Victoria had been £16,000. the arithmetic of the honourable member for Wannon is different from mine. But, let us suppose that the cost is only £11,000. How can this country afford to settle land at such a cost? It is quite impossible. The reason for this high figure is that, right fro m the start, we have thought in terms of a government scheme. We should make finance available in greater or lesser amounts for the purchase of large properties, or small farm?. Some honourable members think all tlie time in terms of the resumption of vast properties, building houses and dams, and erecting fences, and all the rest of it . If we turn the pages of any rural paper published in Australia, we find plenty of properties at very reasonable prices available for sale, on which people have made, a reasonable living, and on which it is still possible for people to make a reasonable living. The point which I make, here is that an ex-serviceman who wants such a property should be entitled to purchase it , and the money should be forthcoming to him. I have said all that I want to say about government policy in respect of the land settlement of ex-servicemen, but I should like to add that it seems, from my experience here, that successive Ministers, and. indeed, successive governments, have been quite unable to cope with this problem. This is evident from the pace at which progress has been made.

However, the cost of building roads, surveying, and cutting up the large areas of land became f a r too expensive. Very often these large areas of land that are resumed have no worthwhile improvements on them, and it becomes imperative for the Government to build roads, install water conservation schemes, and the many other things required to make the land productive. Honourable members, from studying the cost of production in the wheat and dairying industries, have become aware of the enormous capital cost of machinery required for primary production, and for the opening up of roads. To-day, the position is entirely different from what it was in the past, and the Queensland Government has found it impossible to continue the scheme. One of the questions asked was whether it had ceased operations. It has ceased operations. Another question asked was whether it had applied to become an agent State. The Minister replied, "" No "". The Queensland Government did apply to become an agent State, but failed to become one because this Government refused its permission. rhe Ministerf or the Interior, because he was ill at the time, and the acting Ministerf o r the Interior was responsible for tlie refusal. The honourable gentleman -aid it was not true. The position was not. f u l l y known when the question was asked. If the answer had been "" No, but it: did apply to become an agent State"", that would have covered the position. I had no opportunity of speaking on the matter because the question had been prepared, and probably the Minister was quite aware of it . The reply made the position in Queensland look very bad, indeed. There seems to be a concerted effort by the members of the Australian Country party in this House to discredit the Queensland Government, which, of course, is a Labour government. I invite honourable members to consider the question of actual expenditure. One hears a lot about the Australian Government making money available. If the Government does make loan money available, it has to be paid for. Let me state the position so f a r as Queensland is concerned. The total amount expended on war service land settlement in Queensland by the Australian Government from the commencement of the scheme to the.30th June, 1953, was £318,668. I wish to impress that upon the members of the Country party in particular, and upon other members of the Government. with the other millions they got ? State expenditure on war service land settlement in Queensland was £3,727,636 14s. l i d . That proves conclusively that the State Government did its job. Mr Adermann interjecting, opposite do not like it , I know, but this is the first time. I have had the opportunity of bringing the truth before the House. As I have said on previous occasions, truth is hidden at the bottom of the well, but when it comes to the surface it hurts a lot of people. In addition, it is to be noted that the Queensland Government is the only State government that has advanced money for a three-year T h a t is not true. interest free and redemption free period in order to establish returned soldiers in I do not want to blame rural industries. I am not holding up Queensland as an example to the detriment of the other States, but I do say that the Queensland Government has been very sympathetic and has done everything possible to settle returned soldiers on the land, despite the enormous increase in costs. It is not necessary for me to emphasize the tremendous increase in costs in every direction. The honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton), in supporting the recent wheat legislation, pointed out the extent to which the cost of production and the cost of materials have risen, and I accept his statement as being correct. The same type of machinery is required for the opening up of land for soldier settlement. Furthermore, the Queensland Government had to stop operations because the Loan Council refused to take into account the fact that to-day money has not the value it had in the past. It is expected to do the job at pre-war costs. Obviously, that has operated, not only in respect of soldier settlement, but also in every other walk",54,Second Reading

Henty( Mr Gullett). He said that in If we want to settle ex-servicemen on-the land successfully, as I think every honourable member believes we should do, more money will have to be made available. By making a success of war service land settlement, we shall not only be doing a good turn to our ex-servicemen, who are entitled to some of the land for which they have fought, but we shall also be doing something that will be of immense value to Australia at a later date. I say that no man who has acquired a huge area of land and has not improved it or used it to its full capacity has a right to hold that land while men who fought for this country are land-hungry. The ox-servicemen who have applied for land are mostly young men who want to settle down and raise a family; I believe that a great deal could be figure done to improve the administration of calculation. the scheme, with a-view to eliminating waste and enabling the process of settlement to go on smoothly and continuously. opening the case for the Opposition on Any interruption automatically increases this bill, referred to the number of setcosts.

This bill is designed to assist the agent saidStates to implement their war service land settlement schemes. It proposes that tobacco and sugar farms and grazing pro£7,000,000 shall be made available to perties is 785, and another 3,223 have received them for that purpose. That figure was advances to purchase or improve farms. criticized by the honourable member for Burke( Mr Peters) and by other members of the Opposition, who spoke mainly about the position in New South Wales and Queensland. BeforeI deal with some of the comments made by those honourable members, I want to correct a statement 1 Victoria the average cost of settling an ex-serviceman on a property was about £16,000. In that State, 1,847 men have been settled on the land under the ordinary war service land settlement scheme. In all, Victoria has spent £24,600,000 on war service land settlement. If we divided that sum by the number of settlers, the cost of establishing each settler would work out at about £13,5.00, but I remind the honourable member for Henty and other honourable members that, Victoria has also established 2,259 settlers on single-unit farms. For an expenditure of £24,600,000 it has settled, not only 1,847 men on ordinary properties, but also 2,259 men on single-unit farms. Therefore, the cost of establishing each settler is obviously much less than the cited by the honourable member foi Henty, which was based upon a wrong The honourable member for Burke, in was made by Mr Foley, the Minister for Lands in Queensland. It was published in the Brisbane Telegraph yesterday. He The number of men settled on mixed farms,",55,Second Reading
141,Mr Hamilton (Canning) |'9.50],"One of the problems of war service land settlement in the principal States is that there is so much divergence of opinion about what is being done in those States. I shall come back to Mr Foley's statement later. The honourable member for Burke said tliat £15,000,000 had been spent to settle S63 men in Western Australia, £9,800,000 to settle 536 men in South Australia, and £5,000,000 to settle 232 men in Tasmania. He-divided the total expenditure in each -State by the number of men settled in each State, and said that the figure he obtained fro m that calculation represented the cost of settling a man on the land. But he was well wide of the mark. In an interjection, I suggested that he should check his figures. For his information and for the information of honourable members generally, I point out that a great deal of the expenditure on war service land settlement in each State has been in respect of plant and equipment. I have in mind bulldozers for clearing land, equipment for fencing and structural improvements of buildings and plant for developing the land. It is useless to put a man on a property unless he can earn something from it within a reasonable time. Pastures have to be established and stock provided. W it h large areas, great quantities of material and equipment must be available. If the honourable member for Burke visits any of the agent States, he w ill see large quantities in 1953, there was a Liberal-Australian of timber, wire, 'galvanized iron and other articles required for land settlement stored in depots scattered throughout the areas that are being developed. In two areas in Western Australia, Many Peaks and Rocky Gully, forest land is being cleared by a unique method. Great trees are being felled by 8-ft. steel balls weighing many tons, attached by steel chains to bulldozers working 50 feet apart. On Kangaroo Island, where farms and grazing properties are being developed from virgin bush, great majestic ploughs are tearing down black boys, as we call them in Western. Australia, and rippers are tearing out the roots afterwards. In Tasmania, a great job has been done in draining the Montague Swamp. Projects of that kind cost an immense amount of money, but they must be undertaken before we can even think of putting men on the land in areas such as those. Honourable members w ill get nowhere by dividing the money spent in any State by the number settled on the land in that State, because before very long many more men w ill have been settled without much additional expenditure. The honourable member for Burke went on to say, in a scathing manner, that the best period of war service land settlement in the agent States was when land sales control was in operation. I think the land sales control was abolished in 194S. The figures showing the progress of war service land settlement in Western Australia are comparable with those for other agent States. In 1948, only 180 men were settled on the land in Western Australia. £1,688,000 had been spent. In 1949. after the land sales control had been l if t e d, 39S men were established on the land. Let me remind honourable members that, even while the land sales control was operating in a modified form , the Western Australian Government introduced legislation to allow land to be sold at prices 15^ per cent, in excess of the land sales control valuation. In 1950, 539 settlers were put on the land in Western Australia, and in 1952 the figure rose to 863. From 1948 to early Country party Government in Western Australia. During that time, war service land settlement proceeded quite well, but, prior to that time, members of this Parliament repeatedly addressed questions to the Ministerf or Post-war Reconstruction, Mr Dedman, in which they asked when something was likely to be done to implement the scheme there The honourable member for Burke said that it was the responsibility of this Government to seize land in the eastern States so that ex-servicemen could be settled on it . If ever there was a statement in favour of unification, it is that statement. Honourable members opposite want this Government to do the dirtv work. The States have sovereign rights over land within their borders. If honourable members opposite want any government to seize land, I suggest that",56,Second Reading
142,Mr Peters,A t what cost ?,57,Second Reading
143,Mr Hamilton,"A t that time,they approach the Labour governments in the eastern States and ask them to do so, especially as those States are principal States. The agent States do all the work in connection with the acquisition of land. The Commonwealth does not touch that matter at all. The States acquire the land, and the Commonwealth makes finance available to them to do so. They do not lose their sovereign rights over the land. They collect rents from it, which they pay into a revolving fund. Honourable members opposite are constantly reminding us that there are Labour governments in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. If they want land to be resumed, let them ask those governments to resume it. It is not the job of this Government to resume land. If the Commonwealth takes land, it is bound by the Constitution to pay a fair and reasonable price for it. I have heard Ministers of the New South Wales Government say that they do not want an obligation of that kind imposed upon them. believed that the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen was a Commonwealth responsibility. We believe that also, and so did However, at the original conferences between the Commonwealth and the States about land settlement of ex-servicemen, the Curtin Government offered to undertake the repatriation of ex-servicemen, but the State Labour Premiers of that day refused to allow the Commonwealth to do so. At a conference held in August, 1944, the late John Curtin, who was then Prime Minister of Australia, said to the State PremiersI also agree that the States should accept or 182 exrserviceraen settlers. The honortheir responsibility. The Premier of New South Wales almost repeated those words, of Mr Curtin, and then saidSo far I have suggested that the financial number of loans that have been arranged responsibility of the Commonwealth should relate only to repatriation. I have said the responsibility in respect to land settlement should rest with the States. Accordingly, the then Premier of New South Wales threw cold water on the proposal of Mr Curtin that the Commonwealth should be responsible for the land ifr. Hamilton. settlement of ex-servicemen. He admitted that the Commonwealth had a responsibility in that regard, but he refused to allow the Commonwealth to have anything to do with the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land. of New South Wales at that time? Was the Premier of New South Wales to whom I have been referring. Nevertheless, the policy that he then laid down has been followed by other Labour Premiers of New South Wales. Later, saidI have expressed my view that there are two aspects to it. The repatriation aspect is obviously a Commonwealth responsibility, but the proposal that the States should abrogate their responsibility with respect to land settlement is* untenable. Neither the then Premier of Victoria nor the then Premier of Queensland The honourable member for uttered one word of protest against those views of the Premier of New South Wales. In fact, they agreed entirely with him, and that is the reason why the Australian Government has not previous Labour Governments. handled the complete scheme of land settlement of ex-servicemen. In the light of what some honourable members have Said. I doubt whether they believe that the Commonwealth should carry out its responsibilities to tbe agent States. The honourable member for Wannon referred to land holdings in the western districts, but during a debate on this matter last year I believe that I mentioned figures relating to the western district which showed that twenty holdings had been divided into farms and allotted to ISO able member for Wannon said that this Government had repudiated its responsibilities, but that statement certainly does not come well from him in view of the for the benefit of ex-servicemen since the present Government has been in office. take any notice of what was said by the honourable member for Wannon. honourable member for Mallee( Mr",57,Second Reading

150,Mr Hamilton,"I agree with theTurnbull) and I shall take no further notice of his remarks. Mr Dedman warned the State parliaments and this Parliament, that war service land settlement coiild not be completed in a short time, but that it would take ten or fifteen years to carry out. The whole scheme he said was to be governed by the availability of good land, and not by the number of ex-servicemen who had applied for land. Very considerable sums of money have been expended by the Australian Government as advances to the States which have acted as credit authorities for the making of loans of up to £1,500 to ex-servicemen. Those loans have been sufficient to establish them on orchards, poultry-farms and so on. This Government has certainly no need to defend its attitude towards war service land settlement, because it has tried on a number of occasions to put ex-servicemen on the land, but, unfortunately, two of the principal States are avoiding their obligations. The Opposition has said that the States are not receiving sufficient loan money to carry out their part of the bargain. I quite admit that the amount of loan money that has been asked for by the States has not been made available to them, because the loan market will just not provide the money. It is all very well for the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr the mainland, but just how many will Whitlam) to criticize the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) about the amount that the Commonwealth has raised by way of loan for the States, but the honourable member should remember that, as a member of the Opposition, it is very easy for him to criticize the Government and make statements about what should be done and what should not be done. If he were a member of a governing party and had to take some responsibility for its actions, he would not be so ready to criticize. If the principal States ask for £70,000,000 from Commonwealth loans and receive only £50,000,000, I believe that the amount of money that they make available for war service land settlemen on the land, and to the £7,000,000 ment should be. reduced only to correspond with the overall reduction of the loan money. But in two of the principal States the amount that they have expended on the land settlement of ex-servicemen has been reduced by a much greater proportion. The States are not putting sufficient loan money into the war service land settlement scheme, especially in view of their statements at the early conferences when they decided to take all responsibility and threw cold water on the proposals of the then Australian government. New South Wales received £29,000,000 from loan moneys in 1949-50, £40,000,000 in .1950-51 and £60,000,000 in 1951-52. The honourable member for Werriwa in another debate stated that I had claimed that New South Wales received £70,000,000 last year, but if he studies the figures he will discover that that £70,000,000 was an estimated and not an actual figure. However, the percentage of the loan money allocated by New South Wales to the land settlement of ex-servicemen has fallen each year since this Government has been in office. Victoria has maintained fairly well its percentage of loan allocations to war service land settlement since 1950-51. In that year the percentage was 17 per cent., in 1951-52 10.1 per cent, and last year 10 per cent. But the New South Wales percentage was only 4.7 per cent, last year, and yet New South Wales is the State in which the largest number of ex-servicemen has applied to be settled on the land. At present there are dairyfarms in Tasmania available to men on take up those farms we do not know. It has been said that the £7,000,000 that will be raised under this measure is not sufficient for the purposes for which it is to be used. The honourable member for Burke stated that this £7,000,000 was a ""miserable"" amount. Honourable members of the Opposition should remember that the raising of this money will depend on the way in which the agent States can expend their shares, and we find that three agent States, who have fewer men to settle than the principal States, placed 139 men on the land last year. Those States received about £1,000,000 as repayments from ex-servicethat will be raised by this measure must be added a further £1,790,000 for repayments, which will also be exnended by the agent States. However, I doubt whether the £1,311,509 which will be paid back to the New South Wales Government by ex-servicemen in the present financial year will be added to the £2,500,000 that that State proposes to expend out of the approved borrowing programme of £63,000,000. The Queensland Government has repeatedly complained that it is not getting enough loan money, but the percentage of its expenditure of loan money on war service land settlement has been disgracefully low for some years. That is particularly reprehensible in a State that refused to allow the Commonwealth to take over the whole of war service land settlement. asked from time to time in this House about whether Queensland now desires to become an agent State. The honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Bruce) said that at a recent conference the Queensland Minister for Lands had agreed to accept the agent State principle. I was present at tliat conference, and I asked Mr Foley whether he believed in the agent State principle. He said that he did. but he wanted sovereignty over the land. However, the agent States all have sovereignty over their land, although the previous Labour Government wanted to allow the ex-servicemen to hold the land only on leasehold tenures. Mr Foley also said at that conference that he would refer the matter to his Cabinet. On the 6th October the Minister for the Interior was asked in this House whether there had been any further developments replied that the acting Premier of Queensland had written to the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) who had replied to his letter, and that the Government was awaiting a further communication from Queensland. However, only yesterday, after Mr Foley had repeatedly said that Queensland wanted to become an agent State, he criticized agent States and the relationship of this Government with them. In the Brisbane Telegraph of yesterday it was reported that he said that Queensland had settled 4,00S ex-servicemen on the land which was more than the number settled in all the agent States together. He criticized what he called the "" miserly "" contribution of £318,000 made by the Commonwealth. Mr Hamilton. In answer to a question asked by the . honourable member for Burke the Minister for the Interior said that £212,000 had been expended on war service land settle' ment in Queensland, as well as a considerable amount of money which had been made available under the £1,000 loan scheme, which is now the £1,500 scheme. In fact, Queensland received £1,567,000 under this scheme. A ll this talk by Queensland about becoming an agent State followed this year's meeting of the Australian Loan Council. At that meeting Queensland put forward claims for certain sums of money which were to be expended on war service land settlement. Questions have been After having approved of these amount' 1 the Queensland representatives went back to their State and publicly declared that they had finished with war service land settlement. In fact, the money is taken by them under false pretences. Last year a certain amount of money was allocated to that State for war service land settlement purposes but only one-half of it was expended. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight) will be dealing with this matter later, and as I have no desire to steal his thunder, I shall say no more about it at this stage than that so far, despite the appeals of this Government to the Government of Queensland to complete the developmental projects at Wandoan and Fairymeade because of the vast sums of money already spent there, the Queensland Government intends to do nothing about it and now desires that on this measure and he Queensland should become an agent State. Queensland Government might refund the money. hand, it may decide to utilize the money for other purposes. There have been some extraordinary occurrences in two of the principal States, New South Wales and Queensland. Yesterday the honourable member for Farrar( Mr Fairbairn) asked the Minister for the Interior a question relating to a property known as Nowranie. I have taken the trouble to ascertain some facts about it. It is understood that if Commonwealth and State officers, after having inspected a property, declare it to be unsuitable for war",58,Second Reading

152,Mr Hamilton,"On the otherservice land settlement, no further action is taken in regard to it. The responsible New South Wales Minister has written a letter stating that the Minister for the Interior would not agree to accept the Nowranie property because it was unsuitable for soldier land settlement. I was present at a conference at which it was agreed between the Commonwealth and State representatives that in the event of mutual agreement between Commonwealth and State officers that a property was unsuitable for soldier land settlement no action -would be taken in regard to it. Apparently the New South Wales Minister is not prepared to abide by that decision. It is the intention of this Government, if possible, to complete the war service land settlement scheme in five years. doing it will have achieved a worthwhile objective. In order to assure the success of the scheme there must be a complete understanding between the Commonwealth and the States in relation to their responsibilities in regard to it. We must know where we .are going. The States cannot have the advantages of the principal States scheme and the advantages of the agent States scheme as well. This bill provides for the raising of money for the agent States clone but the debate has developed into a general discussion of the soldier settlement scheme. This Government has nothing to be ashamed of in relation to the scheme. It has been the medium of settling more men on the land than has any other government. We are prepared to play ball with the States, but they cannot have it both ways, as the Minister for the In terior clearly told them on the 7th July last. The States are making a different approach to the subject now than they did when the Curtin Government was in office in 1944. When the agent States scheme was first drafted and the principal States asked to be brought into it, Mr of his answer. The figures cited by the Curtin categorically replied, "" No "". honourable member for Canning( Mr statistics which were used so incontro Hamilton), who has given us a long and exhaustive explanation of the soldier settlement scheme as he sees it, is apparently the victim of passionate confusion. He had before him a mouse's nest of papers, which he read page by page. I followed him closely and with great intensity, as did other honourable members on this side of the House, but the net result seemed to be a sort of apologetic conclusion that the Government is doing its best in this matter. He gave lis a gaggle of informationabout the agent States and the principal States. He told us how the great bulldozers on Kangaroo Island rolled over the trees and cleared the land. Elementary, ray dear Watson, indubitably so! What we want to know, and what a supporter of the Government wants to know, is when the Government, intends to push on with soldier settlement, to free it from its enveloping red tape and over-organization. What we want to know is when some real achieveI f it succeeds in so ments will be recorded. The honourable member for Canning did not attempt to answer the most cogent part of the Opposition's case when the honourable member for Burke( Mr Peters), who led the debate on behalf of the Opposition, cited figures that had heen furnished by the Minister and showed the excessive cost of soldier settlement; his apologia was merely that the cost included the provision of all the things that go to make up the home of the settler. We do not contest that. We realize that many -factors add to the cost, including the use of the bulldozers which seem to have so fascinated the honourable member. Nevertheless, the cost is still excessive. It was in no spirit of carping criticism that the bonorable member for Burke directed attention to that matter. Indeed, he highlighted the fact that the developmental costs are bound to be high but that as more men are settled on the land the cost will not be so terrific. The honourable member for Canning failed to answer the charges made by the honourable member for Burke, or if he answered them. I failed to grasp the implication honourable member for Burke have been completely vindicated.

Thanks to the providence of God, he is now prosperous. To have become a successful farmer despite the administration of the soldier settlement scheme by Liberal governments of the past is no mean feat. I salute the honourable member! The bill indicates how far we have progressed with the soldier settlement scheme. No matter how honourable members opposite may babble about the principal States, the agent States, the bulldozers, and the horrible crimes that the sovereign States have committed in an attempt to preserve their sovereign rights, the fact remains that we have not progressed very far with this scheme. What is wrong with the States taking measures to protect their sovereign rights in a federation such as ours? All the mewling and puking of the infants in politics among honourable members opposite is of no significance. The States have rights over their own lands. ThoseI f r . Haylen. rights have never been challenged. The honourable member for Canning has talked about a nigger in the woodpile. He has a little while ago, some one told him that the States were demanding sovereign rights over their own lands. What of it? This scheme is not new. It dates back to World WarI . Amendments have been made to it over the years, but the scheme itself was accepted years ago. Thousands of ex-servicemen were settled on the land after World WarI . and, eventually, when Considered in that a Labour government is returned to the treasury bench, thousands of ex-servicemen, including the Korean veterans, will be settled on the land as expeditiously as possible by farmers and others on this side of the House, who understand the land. The nub of the situation which the Government will not grapple with is the small amount of money that has been allocated for soldier land settlement. problem is one of its own inheritances and that in making available these niggardly amounts for the scheme it is virtually running up a signal to the mast indicatstill? The honourable member for Henty told us that the United Nations Pood and Agriculture Organization has directed primary produce throughout the world. If the atom bomb or the cobalt bomb does not get us, we may starve to death because of our over organization into city and urban communities. Are the miserable amounts of. money provided by this Government to be its sole contribution to the problem of soldier land settlement? Does the Government consider that the provision of £6,000,000, £9,000,000 and £7,000,000 in its successive years of office, is a sufficient contribution to the scheme having regard to the increased production that could be achieved if our men were able to be placed on the land? According to published statistics land-hungry ex-servicemen number approximately 30,000. The figures relating to the number of men who hold qualifying certificates but are still waiting for blocks have been cited by the honourable member for Burke. There is utter frustration in relation to the soldier settlement scheme and we know the reasons for it. I have a very shrewd Loan (War Service Land suspicion that the honourable member for Henty also knows the reasons for it when it suits him to do so. There is a contrast between the amounts made available for soldier settlement and those provided for the immigration scheme which I should like the House to note. This Parliament voted approximately £7,000,000 this year for the purpose of bringing new Australians to this country. No matter what advertisements emanating from Australia House may show we cannot sell Europeans the idea that this is not a vast empty country where men may be settled on the land when we spend as much money on immigration as we provide for soldier settlement. When they arrive in this country they realize that their hopes of settling on the land are very dim. That is the position and it is, perhaps, a summation of the remarks of the honourable member for Henty which I was so glad to be in the House to hear. The Government is in the habit of postulating that this is the best of all possible worlds and that it cannot make any mistake about these things because it has the interests of ex-servicemen so much at heart. Do the State governments consider that this scheme has been successful? Is there not a feeling among ex-servicemen that the scheme is going ahead much too slowly? Is there not a fear among the old crusty inhabitants of the land, the descendants of the old landlords, that if an ex-serviceman is able to get hold of their land, and wool prices continue to soar, before long the ex-serviceman will be as well off as they are ? former, Premier of New South Wales, Why is there constant wrangling and argument about the acquisition of almost every property that is resumed in New South Wales? Why were the Postmaster General( Mr Anthony) and a former honourable member for New England in this House most aggressive in their antagonism towards the acquisition of estates? Both of them are ex-servicemen and men who desire fervently that ex-servicemen should have the opportunity to go on the land, but their feeling was that the land should not go to anybody from the cities, but should remain in the hands of people who knew how to farm it. The ancient and horrible history of the old farmer is that he destroyed his land. [14 OOTOBEB, 1953.] Settlement) Bill 1953. 1395 I have not the right under the standing orders to discuss soil erosion and the wastage of our natural asset, the land, so I shall return to the point concerning the future of war service land settlement, whether it will continue at its present snail's pace, die of its own inertia, or be rejuvenated. The leader of the Victorian Liberal party, Mr Bolte, went on record as saying that the present Government, which is a government of his own ilk, kidney and colour, appears reluctant to permit war service land settlement to continue. Mr Bolte advocated in 1951 that a deadline be placed on the scheme, which should be tapered off. So there are two views on this matter. We have the view of that visionary, the honourable member for Canning, who has just left the chamber, who envisages the tumbling forests, the virgin soil upturned, the sweep of settlement, the great Cherokee land rush in an Australian setting; and we have the view of the logical-minded leader of the Liberal party in Victoria, who says that the scheme should be tapered off, and that we should finally get rid of it. He. not the Labour party, is the judge of this Government. The fact that he is a leading member of the Liberal party makes his condemnation of the Government all the more apposite. The problem of settling ex-servicemen on the land is not the haggle between the States about which* of them shall be agent States and which shall be principal States. I reject out of hand the statement attributed by the honourable member for Canning to a that he objected to the war service land settlement scheme. As a matter of fact, that Premier was the most countryminded Premier New South Wales ever had, and the vast rural development that has taken place in that State is in many ways due to him and the Government that he led. He used the word "" repatriation "" in its dictionary meaning and not in the meaning that the honourable member for Canning has ascribed to it.

The whole scheme of war service land settlement is moving too -slowly, and it is up to the government of the day, which will be the government for some time to come, to accelerate the pace. It is all-very well for honourable gentlemen opposite to ask us, ""What happened under the Chifley Government ? "" Honourable members opposite always use the achievements of the Chifley Government as a yardstick by which to measure their own achievements. If they appear to be doing a better job than the Chifley Government did then they are mighty proud of themselves. We are pleased with their admiration of the Chifley Government's performances, but I remind them that in relation to this particular matter that Government had to face extreme shortages of men and material. It was carrying out a war service land settlement scheme at the same time as it was decanting 1,000,000 men and women out of the services, and when the country was in a state of intense flux. It is an amazing compliment to the Chifley Government that its work is still used as a measuring stick by this GovernMr Haylen. Indeed, ment to assess its own progress in war service land settlement. We admit that the Chifley Government made a slow start in war service land settlement because of reasons that.are apparent to all honourable members. We claim, however, that, given present conditions, there should be more progress now. The fact that the Minister's second reading speech, which he made after he introduced the bill, covers only two paltry roneoed sheets, makes it not only curt, but also contemptible. The amount to be provided under the measure is equally contemptible. The Opposition would like There are ex-servicemen to have a full-dress debate on the problems of ex-servicemen, and would assist in liaving such a debate made possible, but would like the debate to be extensive and not curtailed. The honourable member for Canning pointed out that in some instances in the past the agent States have returned money that was made available to them for war service land settlement because of profits they had made on properties that they had acquired and not subdivided. That happened because of the acute difficulty in those days of obtaining men and materials. Those conditions have gone, yet the pace has not been accelerated as it should have been, and the results of the scheme are meagre and unsatisfactory. That is one point. The present position is eminently curable. With the assistance of the Opposition and the aggregate brain power on the Government side, of which I do not see much evidence to-night, we may be able to get something' done. It is' not an impossible task, but it is an imperative task. The second point is, where are the necessary lands tb be had ? If the Government is not prepared to find that land by financing large-scale acquisitions, then we shall not get very many fine farms for ex-servicemen. We have to bring this out of the realm of tuppeny-coloured patriotic slogans down to the hard black and white of reality. The only way to do that is to have a geophysical survey. Honourable members opposite know that we live on the lush fringe of this continent. They talk about the nation's potentialities in the outback areas, but they only fly over these areas in fast aircraft and waste no time in returning to the amenities of life in the cities. ""We know that the rich farmlands that fringe a part of this country are in the fertile area in which, in the first instance, the.farms for war service land settlers must be located if they are to be a success. These farms must be in areas where they can be run at a profit because, unless we get a continuance of careeringly high prices for primary products such as wool and wheat, new farmers will have to work hard to make a success of their land. Therefore, the land on which they are settled must be good workable land. Surely honourable members opposite would not suggest that wool will remain forever at a price of £1 per lb., or that under any international agreement wheat will remain forever at a price of 15s. a bushel. When the Government has brought into existence a heavy capital debt for ex-service settlers, can it leave them with it ? No! Part of the 'decision of both the States and the Commonwealth is that a fair price for the .subdivided land shall be fixed, and that the taxpayers shall carry some of the debt. That is not an entirely reasonable proposition either, because the farms should be such .chat they will be profitable enough to enable the settlers to repay the original loan. I do not think that there should b? confiscation of a man's property, but surely if it is possible for the valuers of a bank to estimate the ultimate capital value of a cottage before it lends the money to build it, valuers could be found to make the same sort of valuations in relation to rural properties. Disasters have occurred in rural areas. You, Mr Speaker, have vast experience of farming, and you know that the first farmers to go to the wall during depressions and in long droughts are those whose farms are over-capitalized. They bought land at high prices without taking into consideration its production possibilities, not in boom times, but in times of the lowest common denominator of drought and disaster, which affect this country in cycles. Anybody who has applied his mind to the question of war service land settlement must get back, no matter what his inhibitions may be, to the question of reasonably priced land. The financial burden cannot be loaded forever onto the taxpayer and it cannot be loaded entirely onto the .new settler. We also cannot let the old land-taker, who has been on the land for 50 years, and whose father was there 50 years before him, load himself with the spoils and leave for Vaucluse or Toorak while 30 settlers are left to sweat it out trying to carry the burden of increased land values. When we get the acceleration of production that will come from the subdividing of properties and from the activities of the departmentit is not the department that is under criticism now, but the Government's policy-w e will really get somewhere. The figures that have been given to the House to-night show how we have slipped in relation to our responsibilities to the ex-servicemen who want to go back on the land. I shall deal now with several points which were raised by the honourable member for Canning. He claimed that the money to be made available to the States under this bill would be adequate. He then said that something amounting to a fraudulent practice was being followed by the States in relation to'the amounts set aside for war service land settlement, and talked about the injustices inflicted by the States on land-owners. When the freezing hand of the Commonwealth was laid on their heads at the meeting of the Loan Council the States were thrown into dismay. Their housing commitments had be scaled down. Their vast developmental schemes, which in the long run will make large areas habitable for ex-servicemen, had to be scaled down and, eventually, in the process, their war service land settlement activities had to be scaled down also. The Ministei1 for Lands in New South Wales told me that finance was still lacking to bring into production land in some of the luscious parts of New South Wales, for instance in the Capertee Valley, with which the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) is familiar. Land in the Capertee Valley that could be subdivided into sixteen farms requires only capital to make these farms into going concerns. As the allocation to New South Wales is so perilously low, to all intents and purposes the scheme has been sabotaged. Surely honourable members opposite cannot wildly claim that New South Wales, which is a principal State, has sabotaged it? They will not deny that the Government's attitude to financing the scheme in the last two years is the reason why this plan has been laid low. So the contentions of the honourable member for Canning do not get very far. He was indulging in the fashionable niggle against the States, but in this instance the to the remarks of the honourable member States have a good case to put up for themselves. The situation in New South Wales has been considerably worsened by the puny grant from the Commonwealth, and the contribution made to the problem by the big land-owners has not helped. The New South Wales Government, bedevilled with applications to the High Court and the Privy Council about whether or not it has the power to resume property at certain values, has expended its own revenue for the acquisition of land for war service land settlement. The honourable member has referred to the examination of a property somewhere in the electorate of the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Roberton) as an indication of the frustration that the prospective land settler has suffered. It is valid for us to say that, with some notable Liberal party and the Australian Country party, particularly the latter, seem to be more concerned with the price of land, inflated as it is to-day, than with the availability of land for the settlement of ex-servicemen. closer settlement, of which the settlement of ex-servicemen is the younger brother, has been entirely lost sight of because of the holdings that have aggregated over the years. We must not forget that immigration settlement must eventually take place. The Government is not doing any imaginative planning for the settlement of ex-servicemen or immigrants. It has cost Australia £6,000,000 to bring about 100,000 immigrants into the country to be spilled into the cities. The same paltry amount has been applied in our efforts to settle 30,000 returned servicemen on the land with resultant irritation and frustration. Neither effort has been particularly noble. The figures cited by the honourable member for Burke are worthy of consideration. He merely said that they had been handed to him, but their whole tragic import .was confirmed Mr Haylen. by his statement that only a' handful of settlers had been established in each State at a cost of millions of pounds. That is the measure of our efforts to settle ex-servicemen on the land, notwithstanding anything that the Government may say about the matter. Finally, I turn my attention again for Henty, who said, with a wide sweep, that there must be more food and greater rural development, that the Government had done nothing to achieve these results and that he, as the Government Whip, should apply a goad to drive it into action. I pay him the tribute of acknowledging his great sincerity in this matter. He is knowledgeable on the subject of land settlement, and the views of a knowledgeable man should always be heeded. I pause, in passing, to thank honourable members for their attention to my remarks. The honourable member for Henty made a good point at the conclusion of his speech when he said that consideration of war service land settlement in this House was a hotchpotch business in which some honourable individual exceptions, the members were' interested and others were not. Why did we not have a committee, he inquired. Echo answers, "" Why? "" The reason is that the Government has almost killed the committee system. We had at least six working joint ""committees The big concept of in this Parliament in the days of the Chifley Government, and the Opposition now would welcome the establishment of a committee to deal with ex-servicemen's land settlement so that all parties represented in this House could share their knowledge and pool their brains tion refuse to co-operate on the Foreign Affairs Committee? ber knows what Marat said about the people"" There are people and people "". Members of the Opposition have a mental reservation in regard to that because of certain events of the past. I return seriously to the question asked by the honourable member for Henty. The proposal to establish a committee to deal with war service land settlement is thrown back on the Government's doorstep. The Government sabotaged the",63,Second Reading

156,Mr Haylen,"The honourable memcommittee system. It did not want committees in the first glorious flush of its victory, and it swept them away in a most undemocratic manner. If the Government will establish a committee on war service land settlement, the Opposition will be sure to co-operate with it and set it back on the tortuous road to a fair deal for ex-servicemen who want to settle on the land. With such a committee, no holds should be barred and no records should be withheld. Our objective should be to achieve something for the advantage of ex-servicemen regardless of our party political affiliations. the last 30 minutes the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) has treated the House to a spate of words on the very important subject of war service land settlement. We on this side of the House believe in action, and the record of this Government in relation to war service land settlement over the last three years is one of action. The bill, before us is designed to authorize the raising of moneys for the purpose of financial assistance to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania in connection with war service land settlement. As the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) pointed out in his second-reading speech, this money will be advanced under approved conditions to the three agent States that I have applied to become an agent State. mentioned to be used by them for the acquisition, development and improvecertain conditions. I shall have somement of land for subdivision and allotthing more to say about that application ment to classified ex-servicemen and for later in my speech. the supply to those ex-servicemen of working capital and finance for the purchase of structural improvements, in the bill that will make it possible for stock, plant and equipment. I have grants to be made to States other than mentioned these facts because, in the the three agent States named in the spate of words that we have heard, the preamble. The proposed appropriation true purposes and implications of the bill of £7,000,000 under the bill will be supplehave been somewhat obscured. I deplore some of the statements that received during 1953-54 from repayments were made by the honourable member for of advances made previously to settlers Parkes because they were not in accordand from various other sources. Finanance with the facts and the record of war cial assistance estimated at slightly more service land settlement over the years than £1,500,000 will be paid to all States during which this Government has been for non-capital expenditure, such as the in office. To accuse this Government of cost of interest charges, rent concessions, paltriness, niggardliness and lack of the writing down of the cost of holdings, interest in the settlement of ex-servicemen and living allowances for settlers. It is' a on the land is to cast a slur where it is not deserved. The honourable gentleman also spoke of utter frustration in relation to war service land settlement. That term can apply with justice only to those States that are not participating with the Commonwealth ,in the dual Commonwealth-State scheme which has operated so successfully in the three agent States The Government and itssupporters are deeply interested in the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land, and I am glad to know that some members of the Opposition share our interest because I believe that this matter should be above the party political level. Surely the treatment of those men who fought and risked their lives for their country in time of war should be considered on a non-party basis. Such men should be given every help and encouragement that this Parliament can give to them. Clause5 of the bill is of particular interest to me as a Queenslander. Queensland is one of the States that has not yet become an agent State, and I am very hopeful that it, and the other two principal States of New South Wales and Victoria, will see the light and appreciate the wonderful progress that has been made under the dual scheme in the agent States so that they all will fall into line and become agent States. I am very pleased to see the provision mented by approximately £1,500,000, which the Government estimates will be",66,Second Reading

159,Mr Drury,"Yes, but only onfact, 'which is readily confirmed hy investigation, that war service land settlement has made vastly greater progress in the agent States than it has made in the principal States, which have chosen up to the present to conduct their own settlement schemes for ex-servicemen. In Queensland, the position has become so bad that war service land settlement is almost at a standstill. This matter was debated recently in the Queensland Parliament, and Mr Foley, the Minister for Lands, admitted that there had been a bad lag in the scheme during the last couple of years. This Government is so concerned about the position in the three principal States that on more than one occasion it has offered them an opportunity to become agent States. I hope that the governments of the principal States will have the wisdom to try to raise themselves above the party political level and so give to intending ex-service settlers in those States benefits equal to those available to ex-servicemen in the agent States. This Government considers war service land settlement to be of prime importance from two points of view, first, from the point of view of the re-establishment of ex-servicemen and, secondly, from the point of view of increased food production. The second point is no less important than the first, because it is the duty nf Australia to put its hand to the plough and to increase its food production in the interests of the free democracies. Under the original war service land settlement proposal, the Commonwealth undertook to provide certain capital moneys necessary to acquire and develop lands and to make advances to settlers for stock, plant, improvements, and working expenses. . Under that proposal, detailed administration of the scheme was to be left to the individual agent States, but the Commonwealth was to retain some authority in relation to overall policy, ft is on this point that I take issue with the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr South Wales and Queensland GovernGeorge Lawson), who interjected earlier that the Queensland Government wa > willing to become an agent State. That is true, but it wants to become an agent State on its own terms. We should like to see the Queensland Government, and Mr Drury. the governments of the other two principal States, come into line on the terms and conditions that already apply in the agent States. We cannot have variations of the scheme in different States. We should have a uniform policy in the interests of all concerned. It is very unfortunate that only three States have so far accepted the status of agent States under the original proposal. Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria refused to participate under the terms of that proposal and insisted on retaining sole control of their own schemes in relation to both the selection of lands for acquisition and the allocation of funds. The unwisdom of their decision is shown by the results. Under a separate agreement, these principal States undertook to provide the capital moneys that were needed for the acquisition of land and for advances to settlers. At the same time, the Commonwealth undertook to make certain moneys available for non-capital expenditure such as I mentioned earlier. The three so-called principal States have largely failed to honour the undertaking that was embodied in the agreement to which they became parties. I refer particularly to Queensland and New South Wales. In both of those States many hundreds, and perhaps even thousands, of ex-servicemen are still awaiting settlement on the land. The promises that were made to them have not been fulfilled, -although they have been waiting for years. In the three agent States, however, the dual Commonwealth-State control system has functioned smoothly and effectively. The whole history of war service land settlement in the agent States is a powerful argument in favour of all States assnm ing the same status as soon as possible. It is a matter for great regret that the Labour Governments of Queensland and New South Wales have played party politics on this important issue to the detriment of men for whom we should be doing our best. The cry from the New ments that they are short of loan funds will not bear investigation. Such a. claim is a hollow sham. Their tirades of abuse of this Government, and particularly the criticisms hurled at it by the Queensland Minister for Lands, are designed to provide a smoke screen, as it were, to conceal their ineptitude and poor record in the administration of their own land settlement schemes. Out of a total loan' allocation of £25,480,000 in 1952-53, the Queensland Government provided only £676,500 for war service land settlement. In other words, the Government of that State saw fit to make available only 2.6 per cent, of its loan allocation for that year for the purpose of settling ex-servicemen on the land. The New South Wales Government, which had the next worse record, applied 2.8 per cent, of its total loan funds for the land settlement of ex-servicemen in 1952-53. Of the three principal States, Victoria had easily the best record. The Government of that State allocated 7.2 per cent, of its total loan allocation, or nearly three times the percentage applied by the Queensland Government for the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land. A survey of the scene in the last ten years reveals that only a fraction of the number of applicants in Queensland has actually been settled on ihe land. This is a shocking state of affairs. The Queensland Government must bear the blame for the present position, because a considerable portion of the funds which have been specifically allocated' to that State for soldier settlement have not been applied in that way. The Labour Government under-spent by £141,195 the loan irranted to Queensland for war service land settlement in 1950-51. The uiuler-expendLture in the next financial year was £320,802, and £452,460 in 1952-53. In other words, of the total loan moneys granted to Queensland for war service land settlement in the last three years, the Labour Government has underspent the allocation by £914,457. Yet the Queensland Minister for Lands claims that the reason for the failure of war service home settlement in that State is due to the shortage of loan funds. Altogether, about £500,000 has been repaid by settlers in Queensland. The money has not been used to further the war service land settlement scheme, but has been paid into Consolidated Eevenue. Yet. the Queensland Government persists in blaming the Commonwealth for the K -[48 ] present state of war service land settlement. In the last three years, loan allocations have increased by millions of pounds, and during that time, the Queensland Government has been spending less and less on the settlement of ex-servicemen. In other words, it has not been spending anything like the whole sum specifically granted to it for this important purpose. Yet we constantly hear the cry from the Queensland Labour Government about a shortage of loan funds. The fact is that the Queensland Government finished the last financial year with a surplus of £190,897, and has a total credit balance in cash and liquid funds of more than £19,000,000. That position does not bear out that there is any truth in the assertion of the Queensland Government regarding lack of Commonwealth assistance for land settlement schemes in that State. The blame for the present position is attachable entirely' to the Queensland Government. That fact should be borne in mind. In Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, which are the principal States, only leasehold tenure is available to ex-servicemen. In the agent States ex-servicemen have the option of leasehold or freehold land. That point is important. Another point is that the Commonwealth exercises joint control in the three agent States. In Queensland, ex-servicemen are obliged to pay at once 1.5 per cent, of the unimproved value of the land, and must purchase structures and other capital improvements on it. The applicant may borrow up to £7,500 from the Agricultural Bank, but even that is not a great help, when we consider that the average cost of settling an ex-serviceman on a farm is between £10,000 and £12,000. Every penny of the money put into the scheme by the Queensland Government, with the exception of the cost of administration, is an investment on which the Queensland Government collects interest from the ex-serviceman. In the agent States, Commonwealth moneys are, in fact, a grant to the settler. Many thousands of ex-servicemen are now happily settled on the land in the three agent States, and the money which they are repaying is being used to finance new settlers. So the scheme is flowing along smoothly and effectively. Money repaid is not paid into Consolidated Eevenue, as is done in Queensland, but is used to good purpose. As recently as last July, the Commonwealth renewed its invitation to the principal States, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, to join the Commonwealth scheme, which has operated so successfully. It is a matter of great regret three agent States, South Australia, that those States refused to participate in the scheme. Apparently, their main ground for refusal has been that they do not want to part with their sovereign powers over the scheme. The honourable member for Canning pointed out, in his comprehensive address earlier this evening, that those States, if they joined the Commonwealth scheme, would not be parting with any degree of sovereignty ever their land. All that the Commonwealth insists on is that it has some voice in regard to overall policy, and that procedure operates at present in the agent States. I can only conclude from the record that the Queensland and New South Wales Governments are quite indifferent to the fate of ex-servicemen who are desirous of settling on the land, and theretice of agriculture, and the products of fore, they must accept full responsibility for their failure to fulfil their obligations to those men. The Commonwealth offer to assist the establishment of ex-servicemen in Queensland and New South Wales is still open to the governments of those States. I am sure that everyone who has a genuine concern for the welfare of ex-servicemen will join with me in expressing the hope that the governments of those States will think again, and will link up with the wider Commonwealth scheme which has functioned so effectively in the three agent return to the bill, and the real subject States. Mr Speaker, may I compliment yon on there are as many applicants still eager the latitude which you have allowed to go on the land as have already been honourable members in this debate. I feel allotted blocks. That figure applies sure that that latitude, and your general to the agent States, and to the urbanity, have been appreciated, both principal States. It is of no use to by the squatters on your right and the differentiate between agent States and peasants on your left. In between, are principal States in that regard. Only Ihe members of the Australian Country half the applicants have been accomparty, who have not attended this debate, modated in the agent States, and only or participated in it, in very great numhalf have been accommodated in the bers. I except from that statement, the principal States. Half have still to be (honourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock), who has been consistent in his attendance, although one might think that his pastoral experience is of a different kind from that which this bill seeks to promote. The House is considering, strange as it may seem, a bill to make grants to the Western Australia, and Tasmania, and the debate has centered entirely on the principal States, New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. Moreover, the debate concerns the war service land settlement scheme, which came into operation after World War II . However, many references have been made to the settlement of ex-servicemen after World War 1., and the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), ever a resourceful debater, went back to grants of land made to officers in the New South Wales Bum Corps during the Napoleonic wars. Of course, the honourable member is a man who can well encompass that. He has a wide field of knowledge and appreciation of life. He is an exponent, with equal distinction, in the arts of war, the pracviticulture. The only blemish on his speech was his reference to the honourable gentleman who instituted the plan for the land settlement of ex-servicemen during World War II . and immediately afterwards. I refer to' the Honourable John Dedman, himself a captain in the Indian Army and a farmer, who will undoubtedly be returning to this House after an interregnum of four years, like Cincinnatus from his farm, next year. It is with regret that I feel I must of the debate to-night. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes), in answer to a question to-day, said that",67,Second Reading
160,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [11.8],"catered for in the agent States, and half in the principal States. It is of littla comfort to those who are waiting for blocks to be told that the Australian Government is in no worse a position in the agent States than are the State governments in the principal States, and it is a profitless pastime, surely, for the present Government to adjure the States fo take the motes out of their eyes when it loaves a beam of equal size in its own eye. Reference has been made to the'number of settlers in each State, and the cost of settling them on the land. I shall make bold to quote from figures which have been mentioned in State parliaments regarding the principal States, and given in answer to questions to the honourable member for Burke( Mr Peters) in this House on the 18th September last. It would appear, from those combined sources of information, that New South Wales has spent, -since WorldW a r II . £25,000,000 from its loan funds on war service land settlement, that the Commonwealth has contributed £778,000 in that State, and that 2,002 men have been settled on the land. Victoria has spent £33,600,000 from its loan allocations, the Commonwealth has contributed £735,000, and 4,200 men have been settled 021 the land in that State. I do not know, Mr Speaker, whether it is disorderly if I refer to the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister for the Interior ing, Mr Speaker. I got away w i th the use of that title when your deputy was in the chair a few days ago. Mr Wheeler observing that the best the honourable member for Mitchell can say in reply to me is to make reference to the great man to whom I am matrimonially allied. He does not deal with any of the facts that 1 have mentioned. Sir PHILIPMcBRIDE sot to do with the case? tions are disorderly. with the Ministerf o r Defence( Sir Philip McBride) that it has nothing to do with the case, but earlier in the day the honourable member for Mitchell, in his usual vapid style, thought it had some relevance to it . I said that the honourable member for Canning referred to the cpst of settling ex-servicemen on the land in Victoria, but he referred to only half of those so settled. He referred to 1,847 who were settled, but he did not refer to the 2,259 single-unit farms established under the same scheme. the honourable member's remarks is that, his figure for the cost of settling ex-servicemen on the land in Victoria should be halved. The loan funds appropriated for war service land settlement in Queensland after WorldW a r II . amounted to £3,727,636. The Commonwealth contributed £212,000 and 442 men were settled. Prom the figures it w ill be seen that this Government has contributed not one thirty-sixth of the amount of money that the three principal States have spent out of loan funds. The total amount of money spent in the principal States, which has settled 6,500 ex-servicemen on the land, is approximately £60,000,000. I refer again to the answers supplied to the honourable member for Burke on the 18th September, which show that the three agent States spent £25,000,000 and settled 1,500 ex-servicemen. These figures show that the principal States have spent twice as much I bow to your rulmoney and have settled four times as many ex-servicemen as have been settled in the agent States. Finance is really the core of this problem of war service land settleinterjecting, ment. That is shown by the fact that there were never any complaints from cannot help honourable members opposite about the delay in settling ex-servicemen on the land until the middle of last year, and those complaints were made only after the Australian Loan Council meeting in May, 1952.

168,,"Order! InterjecMr Whitlam The Minister w i l lhe will not venture too far into this field. was £473,629. His one intrusion into the field of war service land settlement was at a conference on the 31st March last, which was completely inconclusive, and probably his acting as an agent for the Minister for the Interior on that occasion was as unfortunate as that Minister's own administration in the agent States. In 1952-53, the principal State of New South Wales was granted by the Australian Loan Council the sum of £70,370,000. The figure I used was the approved figure, and T cite that figure from a letter sent to me on the 15th July last by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden). I repeat that last year the Australian Loan Council approved an amount of £70,370,000 for New South Wales, but the amount raisedand again I cite the figures supplied by the Treasurer-wa s £51,178,000. Victoria had an amount of £54,960,000 approved, and received £39,971,000. Queensland had an amount of £25,480,000 approved, and received £18,531,000. Honourable members will see that the amount available to the three principal States was very greatly reduced. The amount of money spent in New South Wales and Victoria, at any rate, on war service land settlement was reduced. The honourable member for Canning complained that the reduction in respect of war service land settlement in those States was not pro rata with the reductions in other respects. The States resolved that employment must be maintained and they were faced with the position that the amount of money required to settle one ex-serviceman on the land was enough to keep eighteen ex-servicemen in employment otherwise. The decision made by those States will be applauded by returned servicemen both inside and outside this House. No honourable member would say it would be reasonable to dismiss eighteen ex-servicemen in order to settle one. Queensland was criticized last year. That is all the more remarkable, when it i.? noted that for the last financial year Queensland allocated more money for war service land settlement than in any previous year. It allocated £676,500. In the previous year its allocation was £407,994 and in the year prior to that it The honourable member for Canning, when he cited the percentages spent on war service land settlement, based them ou the amount approved by the Australian Loan Council and not on the amount actually available to the respective States. Honourable members opposite cannot deny that last year for the first time the Commonwealth usurped the power of veto in the Australian Loan Council. If honourable members opposite care to study the Financial Agreement with the States, which is not a State creation but which was endorsed by the entire Australian people, the citizens of Commonwealth and State alike, a quarter of a century ago they will find that neither the States nor the Commonwealth received the power of veto or abstention in the Australian Loan Council. The States and the Commonwealth had usually agreed on the amount to be allotted by the Australian Loan Council, but last year for the first time jn twenty years there was a disagreement in consequence of which the States have received less money for, among other things, war service land settlement. It was not long after that that the Minister for the Interior started to make statements on this subject. Among other statements he said, on the 13th November last, that he would summon a conference with the three principal States. But he has no power to summon such a conference. He can invite them to a conference in the same way as they can invite him. but there is no over-riding power in the Commonwealth or in the States in that matter. He said he had been informed that, under its defence powers, there was no constitutional bar to the Commonwealth acquiring and developing land for the re-establishment of ex-servicemen. There is no doubt about its power in that regard. Just as the Commonwealth for over a generation has resumed land for the erection of war service homes in the sovereign States, so it has also been able to resume land for war service land settlement in those States. The honourable member for Canning, who holds a position which I cannot mention, never refers to the statement of the Minister that he",71,Second Reading

170,Mr Whitlam,"However, I thinkhas power himself to implement war service land settlement in the States. It is not a question of the States refusing to surrender their .sovereignty. When it comes to the exercise of the defence power, the States have no sovereignty if the Commonwealth chooses to exercise its sovereignty. After making that empty threat, the Minister has continued to back-pedal. Subsequent to his statement on the 13th November last that he intended to summon a conference with the States, a conference was held on the 31st March last and the Minister was represented by the Minister for Defence. The meeting was attended by the Ministers of the three principal States and by the Commonwealth Minister for Defence. No minutes were kept of the meeting. Each Minister made notes of his recollections of the meeting to guide his Government and his officers. The State ministers were the same as before except for the Victorian representative because, in the meantime, the Country Party Minister for .Soldier Settlement in that State had been replaced by a Labour Minister. One cannot help noticing that as much criticism was directed at Victoria last year as was directed at New South Wales and Queensland although Victoria last year had a Country Party government. However, that may he because the veneer over the relations between members of th° Liberal party and the Australian Country Party in Victoria is much thinner than it is of sheer necessity for obvious reasons in this place. To show the significance of the meeting held on the 31st March last I auote from a speech made by the Victorian Minister for Soldier Settlement in the Victorian Parliament on the 21st April. He saidI -then asked the Federal Minister whether, if we accepted the new agreement, he would guarantee that adequate funds would he made available for soldier settlement purposes. He replied that the granting of funds would depend on a decision of the Loan Council but lie could not anticipate what it would be. I then asked him whether lie would guarantee that additional funds would be made availab .?. and 1 received the same reply. My next question was whether he would recommend t ' i liis Government that additional funds would be made available not only from loan moneys but from surplus Commonwealth revenue and he stated that he was not prepared to make such a recommendation to the Commonwealth Treasurer. It was agreed at that meeting, according to a statement made by the Minister for Lands in the New South Wale* Parliament on the 1st October, thatanother conference would be held before the Australian Loan Council meeting. That conference was not held. A t the Australian Loan Council meeting once again the Commonwealth usurped the power of veto over the loan appropriations for the States for all purposes including soldier settlement. New South Wales had the approved amount of £63,510,000; it will receive £53,250,000. Victoria had the approved amount of £4S,270,000; it will receive £40,650,000. Queensland had the approved amount of £21.960,000; it will receive £18,450,000. There is one more repudiation of the Financial Agreement, and a restriction of the activities of the States, including war service land settlement. Thereafter the States asked whether the Commonwealth would hold a further conference to discuss the proposals made on the 31st March as the Minister had threatened on the 13th of the previous November. The reply was given on the 17th July, and went to all governments concerned. I quote it as it appeared in the speech of the Queensland Secretary for Public Lands in the Queensland Parliament on the 1st September. He saidMy Government has considered the proposals submitted on behalf of your Government by the Minister for Lands of your State, mid has decided that, as the Loan Council has determined the 1953-54 allocation of loan moneys, the amendments proposed by you should not be considered for the year 1953-54. The threat which the Minister made on the. 13th November last was not effectuated during that financial year. It will not be effectuated during the current financial year; and in not carrying out that threat, the Government is failing to fulfil its promise to ex-servicemen in the joint Opposition policy speech of 1949 in which it was statedWe will encourage and speed up soldier land settlement. 1 The Government is, still more importantly, failing to carry out its obligations and responsibilities under the Australian Constitution. Under the defence power, as the Minister has said in a lucid interval, the Commonwealth could take over ex-soldier land settlement. It already controls such settlement in three States and it could do so in the other three. The Minister has avoided that responsibility. He has regretted making that statement, and accordingly, this Government will continue, during its last months, to be false to its promises, and to betray its constitutional obligations to the ex-servicemen ol this c o u n t r y .

The volume of business transacted warrants the conversion of the Penshurst non-official post office to official status, but such » course will not be practicable until a suitable building can be provided for the purpose. 2. Yes. 3.

General, upon notice1. When does the department intend to start building the proposed new post office at Maroubra Junction? 2. When will the proposed new post office at Maroubra Bay be established? 3. When does the department intend to establish postal and telephone facilities in the new district of East Botany? 4. What are the intentions of the Telephone Branch in regard to the provision of telephone installation, both public and private, in the FJ and MU exchange areas? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. When circumstances permit. 2. Unable to Bay-bu t not in the immediate future. 3. EaBt Botany is at present served by the Botany, Pagewood and Bankameadow post offices. Letter receivers and public telephones are located at convenient points and letter and telegram delivery services operate throughout the area, and the department feels that an additional .post office in the locality is not justified at this stage. 4. The Maroubra exchange area will be relieved by the provision of an exchange at Matravillc which it is hoped will be completed in 1954. Further relief is planned by underground telephone cable schemes covering the Malabar and Maroubra Bay portions of the exchange area. The Mascot (MU) exchange area will be relieved by the establishment of the exchange at Botany whilst further cable schemes are contemplated to relieve the remainder of the .Mascot area.

If so, .what is the number of such exchanges allocated? 3. Can any indication be given of the installations of rural automatic exchanges to be made in the Darling Downs area during this period? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. It is estimated that 25 rural automatic exchanges will be' installed in Queensland this financial year. 3. It is hoped to have four rural automatic exchanges installed in the Darling Downs area including that installed at tbe Ascot factory on the 10th September, one to be installed at CrosshiU about the middle oi this month and one each at Biddeston and Pozieres.

If so, will he ' give consideration to increasing the proportion to the States of the excise duty at present collected? the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes, subject to an amount of £600,000 a year being set aside for strategic roads and road safety p'urposes. 2 and 3. It is unlikely that the Commona wealth aid roads payments will be affected significantly by any increase which may occur in the production of locally refined petrol before the present legislation expires in June, 1955. Nevertheless, at the last Premiers conference, the Commonwealth indicated that the petrol tax allocations for roads purposes would be reviewed before the present legislation expires, in the light of the prospective increase in the production of locally refined petrol.",74,Postal Department
