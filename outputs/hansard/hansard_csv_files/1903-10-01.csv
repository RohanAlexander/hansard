Motion (by Sir posedThat the Bill be now read a third time. W ill the Prime Minister make arrangements for the vote of the House on the B ill relating to the selection of the Capital site not to be taken until Wednesday next? External Affairs) -The request which the right honourable member makes is, that under the circumstances the vote on the Bill relating to the selection of the Federal Capital Site shall not be taken before Wednesday next. I do not think there need be the least difficulty about that under. taking. But I wish the House to be prepared to commence the discussion on Tuesday; it will certainly be Wednesday beforewe can come to a decision. To prevent any loss of time it will be necessary to commence dealing with the' question on Tuesday, though there is no prospect, I am afraid, of concluding the debate on that day. Prime Minister is now asking us to pass the third reading of the Appropriation Bill. I think that before we do so we should have an assurance from him that the Capital conclusion before Parliament rises. WhatI mean by a definite conclusion is that either the site shall be selected, or that the mattershall reach the deadlock stage, at which it will be absolutely impossible to select a sitetbis session. I gather that it is the honourable and learned gentleman's intention to try to attain a definite conclusion, but I wish to hear a statement made by him before the Appropriation Bill receives our assent. deavour to reduce the Capital sites to two-on e chosen by this House and one by the Senate.; and if it be possible we will bringabout an agreement between both Houses.

I have no doubt that that House will deal with itas quickly, perhaps, as we did. We put the Bill through in almost as many minutes asthere are stages. I have never seen an Appropriation Bill which received less contime to consider, and this Bill will be considered from the stand-point of Estimatesin another place. whether there is any special need for urgency at the present time. House is dealing with the question of the Capital site we wish to give the Senate an opportunity to deal with the Estimates which are embodied in this Bill. It must be remembered that from the point of view of the Senate the discussion on this Bill is equivalent to our discussion on the Estimates. The Appropriation Bill is the only measure that gives the Senate an opportunity to consider the Estimates for the year. measure which we ought not to surrender too hurriedly to the Senate. We ought not to give them the Appropriation Bill whenever they think fit. There are obvious reasons why an Appropriation Bill is held back in all Parliaments.

I admit some honourable members appear to be. 1 that our Constitution is somewhat different do not think that this Bill ought to pass its from the Constitution of the States, and third reading until the Capital site has been that some deference must be paid to that selected, or at any rate until some promise difference. That fact in itself, however, is of finality has been reached. Under the not sufficient to justify the passage of an circumstances I would ask the Ministry to Appropriation Bill at the present juncture. defer the third reading of the measure for Throughout the session I have constantly at least a week. Certainly it ought not to blamed the Ministry for neglect in failing be sanctioned until the important business to submit for our early consideration the which is before the two branches of tbe question of the selection of the Capital Legislature is in a fair way of being detersite. mined. That is one of the fundamental present position I think that the reputation principles of parliamentary government.

To get the Appropriation Bill out of the way is a wise proceeding on the part of any Ministry, because it places them in the position of being able to settle with Parliament whenever they may think fit. Of course there is something to be said in favour of the early passage of the measure through this House, because of the position of the Senate under the Constitution. The other Chamber naturally desires time to consider it. Nevertheless, as was stated by the late Prime Minister, the determination of the Capital, site is one of the most important questions with which this Parliament has been called upon to deal. It is quite unusual for a subject of such magnitude to be decided after Supply has been granted to the Government for the full period 11 KZ 1 which is proposed, no charge of haste can be ! Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney) According to But despite the gravity of the session closes. It is only upon that under to be expected that the Government would endeavour to push this very important measure to its finil conclusion as soon.as possible. To my mind, however, there is no immediate hurry to pass its third reading. Several other measures are awaiting our attention. Despite the fact that the question of the selection of the Federal Capital site has been given considerable prominence from the very inception of this Parliament, its consideration has been deferred till the closing days of the present session, and very little time is now available in which to deal with that matter. Moreover, present appearances point to the probability of future complications with the other Chamber which must inevitably result in further delay.

If we agree to the passing of this measure, it means that we shall lose control over the Government. The latter will then be able to close the session at any time they choose without consulting the House. But so long as the Appropriation Bill is held in abeyance, honourable members are in a position to exercise a controlling influence upon our procedure. I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask that the third reading of this Bill should be deferred a little longer. The adoption of such a course will not inflict any hardship upon the public servants, and, therefore, there is no need whatever to unduly hurry the passing of the measure, unless the Government desire to bring the session to a close at an earlier stage than Parliament would be disposed to approve of in view of the incomplete state of the business upon hand. I would strongly urge the Ministry to consider the request which has been preferred by some members of the Opposition. member for Wide Bay has certainly given the members of the Opposition a very timely reminder of their duty. He has declared House agrees to the third reading of the that, whilst it is to the interests of the Billi t will create a very dangerous preGovernment to secure the early passage of cedent.

A t a most critical stage in her history, New South Wales to-day finds herself without her f u l l measure of representation in either House, and if the leader of the Opposition were present I should hope to hear him strongly oppose the third reading of this Bill, pending the settlement of the Capital site question. We have received an assurance from the Prime Minister that the matter will be dealt with, but we know that the Victorian press arid various public meetings held in this State have bitterly opposed the selection of a site, and therefore there is a danger of the question being shelved for this session. B3' preventing the third reading.of this Bill today we shall be able to avert the anticipated danger, and it is my duty to join with other honourable members in exercising that power. I ask the Treasurer to say that he will not press the passing of this Bill through its remaining stages before New South Wales has secured her full measure of representation in the Federal Parliament.

53,Mr Mcdonald (Kennedy),"If theby the Treasurer. This is a very serious matter, and if a division is called for I shall certainly vote against the motion. I feel inclined to move that the debate be adjourned until next week : but in any event I think that the Government should give us some assurance that they will not seek to pass the Bill through its remaining stages for at least another week. that the practice usually followed in the States Parliaments is to keep back the Appropriation Bill until all other measures have been dealt with. We must not forget, however, that we are working under a new Constitution, and that the position of the Senate is altogether different from that of the Legislative Councils of the States. The Senate has a right to request the reduction of any item in the Appropriation Bill, and it is therefore only fair that it should have a reasonable time to consider the Estimates, and to obtain the fullest explanation in regard to them. In these circumstances we cannot adopt the practice of the States Governments, and hold back this Bill until the last moment. That practice works very well in the States Legislatures, because the Legislative Councils of the States can simply reject or accept an Appropriation Bill, and, as a rule, they agree to such measures as a matter of course. This House, if it doubted the promise given by the Prime Minister, would be justified in refusing to pass the Bill at this stage. The only object which honourable members could have in view in adopting that course would be to retain control over the Government. But, as my honourable and learned leader has given a definite and distinct pledge to the House that the Pederal Capital question will be advanced this session as nearly as possible to finality, even if it is impossible to finally settle it , I fail to see why any opposition should be shown to the Bill being read a third time to-day. An Appropriation Bill is held back, as a rule, simply to enable the House to have a check upon the Government, The honourable member for Dalley is afraid that if this Bill be passed to-day he may find to-morrow that Parliament has been prorogued, and that the question of the Pederal Capital has been shelved. I am astonished that he should make such a suggestion. Government will not be able to control sentatives of New South Wales to see that another place. able member did not base his objection on that ground. He said he was afraid that if we passed this Bill to-day he would find to-morrow that the doors of Parliament had been closed, and that the Government had failed to invite the House to proceed with the consideration of the Capital site. If we held back this Bill until both Houses had I quite admit dealt with that question, we should have to send it to another place at a time when it would be impossible for honourable senators to give it proper consideration. In view of the pledge given by the Prime Ministerwhich I am certain is accepted by the majority of honourable membersI see no reason why we should not now agree to the Bill being read a third time, and thus give another place a fair opportunity to dis cuss it. No doubt the Government will endeavour to keep the promise made to-day by the Prime Minister, but we cannot overlook the fact that they have no control over another place. I occupied a seat in the gallery of another place yesterday, and, whilst there, saw the will of the Government flouted by the majority of the members of that Chamber. Doubtless if they considered their purpose would be served by again taking up that attitude they would not hesitate ito do so. I do not think that the Government will fail to make an effort to carry out their promise to this House, but we have no guarantee that they wil] be able to do so. If we allow this Bill to pass we shall part with our control over the Government. I contend that it is the duty of representatives of New South Wales to see that this measure does not pass through its remaining stages until the question of the site of the Federal Capital has been dealt with. The Treasurer urges that another place must be given ample time to consider the Appropriation Bill. Let us remain here in order that it may have an opportunity to do so. Let honourable members of this House be the sufferers.

As has been well pointed out, no control can be exercised by the Government over the members of another place, nor indeed can they exercise an effective control over the members of this House after the Appropriation Bill has been passed. WhilstI have every confidence in the honesty of the Government, their intentions are one thing, and the intentions and acts of their supporters here and of the members of another House are quite another thing. Ihe representatives of theStateof New South Walesi n this House are entirely at the merc\ of honourable gentlemen who, not r to put too fine a point upon it , are not exactly eager for the selection of the Federal some arrangement which will enable the Capital. They would not bother very much if it were not selected this session, could view with equanimity the possibility of its not being selected during the first session of already too much of its control of the purse. next Parliament, and doubtless would sleep well if they knew that it would never be selected at all. Therefore, as the Government cannot effectively control the members of this House, and have no control whatever over members of another place, I think that they should agree to the suggested adjournment of the debate, at any rate until an opportunity has been given to this House to decide the Capital question. I do not think that we are asking too much in making that request. ment cannot state definitely that they will not prorogue until the matter has been dealt with, because they have no means of carrying that promise into effect. being unable to follow the line of reasoning adopted by honourable members who ask for the adjournment of the debate upon the ground that we shall have no control over the members of another place if we pass the learned member is now furnishing excellent Appropriation Bill through all its stages in reasons for the view taken by those who this House.

68,Mr Joseph Cook,"The honourable andMrM c CAY Honourable members who urge the keeping back of the Appropriation Bill are labouring under a delusion. We must rely upon the good faith of the Government so far as -our relations with the Senate are concerned. The position of the Appropriation Bill will not have any effect in bringing the Senate into line .with the House of Representatives upon the Capital site question. Besides, we cannot keep back the Appropriation Bill indefinitely. Therefore there is no force in the veiled threat that would be made by ""taking the course of action suggested. I do not wish to leave the House to the uncontrolled mercies of any Ministry, but we must either accept or decline the assurance -of the Prime Minister. If we accept his assurance it will not matter to us where the Appropriation Bill is, and so far as the Senate is concerned, it does not matter where it is, because we cannot in the least -degree control the actions of the members -of that body. able and learned member understand the .assurance of the Prime Minister to be ? would be dealt with in this House before the end of the session, and that he would try to have it dealt with in the other House. -do all he could to have it settled between the two Houses. lie could do, whatever the position of the Appropriation Bill.

I do. not see how the position of the Appropriation Bill can possibly affect the question in view of the relations between the two Houses, and the fact that we must, .sooner or later, send on the Appropriation Bill, and that we must also hold the elections at the same time that the Senate -elections are being held. fail to follow the honourable and learned member for Corinella in his observations.

Who suggested it 1 fully to the remarks 'of honourable members, and I did not hear any suggestion of the kind. If it had been made it would have at once struck my notice as a most startling proposition. WhatI understand is that the retention of the Appropriation Bill undoubtedly affords the House the most powerful means of exercising control over the Government. Of course, we can go on as long as we like passing Supply Bills in order that the affairs of the State may be carried on from month to month, but once we pass an Appropriation Bill which provides for the expenditure for the remainder of the financial year, welose our constitutional power so farasit relates to the control of the finances and of the Government. I think that that is a proposition of the most elementary character, and I do not see how it is possible to put the matter of retaining the Appropriation Bill other than as bearing upon the control which this House exercises over the Government. W i th regard to the action which should be taken by us, I think that we ought to settle the question of the Capital site as soon as we possibly can. I venture to say that honourable members are sick of it, that Australia is sick of it, and that the most mischievous consequences would ensue if we had to go to the elections before finally settling the matter. I hope that in the early stages of the next Parliament two matters will be removed from our consideration-tw o matters which have troubled us too long. I hope that the fiscal issue will be settled once and If the honourable memfor all-or , at any rate, for a considerable period-upo n the basis of the continuance of the Tariff now in operation, and also that the Capital site question will be disposed of. able and learned member wished to see preferential trade brought about ? honourable gentleman reconcile his statement as to the settlement of the fiscal question",19,George Turner Prosideration Than This One Has Had

Let the Government keep their noses to it . Judging from the Prime Minister's statements, I think that he is fully seized with the importance of removing from the constant notice of the Parliament and the people this question, which ought to be settled and which has all too long remained unsettled. I hope, therefore, that he will do all that is necessary to insure that both Houses shall express their choice ; that he will persevere, and not be induced by any desire to get into the haven of recess to spare any pains. As I believe that the Government will do all they can-Appropriatio n Bill or no Appropriation Bill-and that they will carry out what is the undoubted wish of this House, I am prepared to assist them in doing what they propose. absolute promise. shilly-shallied with the question : they have not adopted terms of dubious meaning, but have pledged themselves as absolutely as any Government could do Question resolved in the affirmative.

I am indeed With reference to what has been said on the Capital site question, I desire to point out that no one on this side of the House questions the sincerity of the Government. We do, however, doubt their ability, with the Appropriation Bill out. of the way, to carry the determination of the Capital site to a conclusion. We have known Governments to make promises before. I need scarcely remind honourable members of the statement recently made by a right honourable gentleman nolonger a member of this House, in perfect good faith, concerning a matter of vital importance, and of the fact that within one short month a course exactly opposite to that indicated by him was taken. That statement was made in the same good faith as the statement of the Prime Ministeri n reference to the Capital site. No one doubts his sincerity, or that it is his intention to carry his promise into effect. In. politics, however, no one knows what a day or an hour may bring forth, and there is. nothing like being ready for emergencies. Therefore I urge that the consideration of the Capital question should be postponed for a week, or until we can see how matters are likely to shape themselves between the two Houses. All the talk about the Senate having no work to donext week is quite beside the question. The Senate has had many holidays extending over a week during the present session. They had one recently because there was nothing for them to clo, and therefore there is nothing novel in the other Chamber being able to go away for a week. In view of the fact that this is the most vitally important matter which we have been called upon toconsider this session, I would' urge the Government even now to leave the consideration of this Bill over in order that we may see what kaleidoscopic changes may take place. We cast no reflection upon the Government or the Prime Minister, but we say that, as has happened before, political eventualities may cause the Prime Minister to take action contrary to the solemn promise which he has just made to>",20,George Turner Prosideration Than This One Has Had

92,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"the House. We have had recent experience that this is possible in politics, even assuming good faith, and all the like. We have seen that these political turnovers can take place, and what has happened will probably occur again. I therefore ask the Government to allow this Bill to stand over for a week at least. elicit some information from the Prime Minister at this juncture. There has just been handed to honourable members a document containing the minutes of evidence taken by the Royal Commission on Capital Sites.. ber is not in order in discussing a matter that is not connected with the Appropriation Bill. made to the Capital Sites question. able member will understanl that the reference which has been made to that question has been by way of a suggestion that this Bill should not now pass, but that the third reading should be taken at a later stage. Any reference to any printed paper concerning the Capital Site would be quite out of order in discussing tlie third reading of this Bill. which you have referred, sir, that I wish to elicit information. I wish to point out that one reason why the Bill should not now be disposed of is that we have been promised certain additional information bearing upon the Capital sites, and that, in accordance with that promise, we have to-day received documents containing a report of the evidence. But we were also informed that we should be supplied with the minutes of the proceedings of the Commission. the honourable member that that matter might have been brought up in the form of a question earlier in the proceedings today, and it may be brought up at a later stage, on the motion for the adjournment of the House; but I do not see how the honourable member can connect it with the measure now under discussion. ponement of this Bill, for the reason that, so far, honourable members have not been supplied with ful l information bearing upon the Capital Sites inquiry. A postponement would enable us to get that information, and we should be in a better position to deal with the sites. I hope the Government will see their way not to take from the House the power which we possess, as they will do by putting through this measure. There is no immediate hurry for it. I trust that they will accede to the wish of the Opposition in allowing it to stand over for at least a few days, so that we may be better able to see our way with respect to other matters which the Government have asked the House to consider. Whilst1 quite recognise all that has been said in connection with the desirability, under ordinary circumstances, of not giving the Government the Appropriation Bill until the principal business of Parliament has been transacted, I also recognise the claim that the Senate should be allowed time for the consideration of the Bill, which covers the Estimates for the entire year. While I think that the Government could, allowing for all that, have left over this Bill for another week, I also recognise that we can hardly go to the extent of resisting the.proposals of the Government so far as not to assent to the third reading of the measure until the Capital site and all the other business of Parliament has been absolutely cleared up. Since we have to agree to send the Bill to the Senate before other business is concluded, I felt that the best thing we can do is to obtain from the Prime Minister an absolute promise as to the carrying out of the principal item of business that remains to be transacted before Parliament is prorogued. There has been some doubt as to what the Prime Minister actually promised. To me his promise was not capable of doubt, and I will now state what I understood it to be. I understood the -Prime Minister to promise that before Parliament is prorogued there shall be, if possible, a selection by the two Chambers of one site; or, if that is not possible, that there shall be a selection of one site by each Chamber. Those words are plain enough, and are easily understood. sible "" ; there is to be a selection of one site I wish to urge the post"" if possible,"" and if not, there is to be a selection of a site by each Chamber.

The object of this clause is to prevent any action for an infringemen t of a patent being t a k e n by a patentee unless he marks upon t h e patent the fact t h a t it is patented. The provision is taken from the revised statutes in America, where it has been found to w o r k admirably.

121,Mr Deakin,"I movethe cost of transfer is, in some cases, far greater than the cost of taking out the patent itself. In very many instances holders of patents who may happen to be impecunious are utterly prohibited from transferring a right which may be of some value, although not valuable enough to justify the large expenditure at times involved in preparing the various deeds necessary to enable a transfer to be made. I wrote to the late Minister for Trade and Customs some time ago, suggesting that when he was drafting this Bil l he should embody in it some such simple reform as this. The right honourable member apparently did not think it worthwhile to adopt my suggestion, but I would remind the Committee that the reform, if it is a reform, present transfers have to pass through the is one which we have carried out in relation to transfers involving very much larger suras than are usually associated with the transfer of a patent. It has been introduced into our land laws by what is known as the Torrens transfer system. One can transfer property of very great value at a cost of about ten shillings, exclusive of the tax. Life assurance policies may also be transferred by endorsement, while one scrip, perhaps of the value of Â£100,000, may be transferred by a duly witnessed endorsement. It seems to me that we might well adopt this very simple expedient in order to facilitate the transfer of patents. It would be a very great concession to poor holders of patents, who have already received much consideration at the hands of the Committee. ment operate where a patentee had assigned his interest in some patent ? Mr G. B. EDWARDS -There are other provisions in the Bill which deal with assignments. if a patentee desired to assign only a proportion of his interest in a patent 1 Mr G. B. EDWARDS lawyer, but I think that the patentee in such a case would require to have a deed drawn up setting forth the interests of the several parties. But if a man were the original patentee, and still held the patent right, he would beable under this amendment to transfer it at a cost of 5s. or 10s. I was obliged on one occasion to take over some patents in New South Wales, and in one case the transfer cost me over Â£20. I had to go to the Patent Office-jus t as one was called upon to visit the Titles Office in connection with the transfer of land under the old system-wit h a bundle of documents tracing the holders of the patent from first to last, and showing the various releases and liens upon it . We should have a system under which patents would be retained in the office of the Registrar, and a certificate issued setting forth that "" A . B . "" is the holder of letters patent, giving him the privilege of a certain invention. Under that system, if "" A . B . "" wished to dispose of his rights, he would simply have to write on the back of the certificate a statement of transfer to "" CD . , "" who would have the transfer registered for a small fee, and thus complete the transaction. At hands of lawyers, who are called upon to display much ability in tracing the various holders of the patent rights, and in drawing up long deeds of recital. The adoption of my proposal will confer a great boon upon a very large number of holders of patents, who are unable at present to do anything with them because of the cost of the transfer. Proposed new clause agreed to. That the following new clause be inserted :""42A. (1) An appeal shall lie to the High Court or the Supreme Court from any decision of the Commissioner under the preceding section. ""(2) The Court shall hear the applicant and the Commissioner, and shall decide whether and subject to what conditions, if any, the application and specification shall be accepted.""

AVhat is desired is that when a monopoly is granted in the Commonwealth the patentee, or some person authorized by him, shall, if required, commence and continuously carry on the construction or manufacture of the patented article within Australia. The enormous development of chemical manufactories in Germany, now one of the most prosperous elements of the trade of that country, is largely due to the restrictive provisions of the German patent law. Formerly Great Britain controlled many of the most valuable and profitable chemical manufactories, but when the patentees found that they were under no restriction to manufacture in that country, while they were required to manufacture in Germany, they were induced to remove their operations to the latter country, to which they have proved one of the most prolific sources of wealth. Another illustration of the same result is the manufacture of linotypes, the patent rights in which, owing tc the provisions in the German law, were purchased for about Â£150,000 in that country as compared with something like Â£800,000 paid for the patent rights in the United Kingdom, and possibly some of its dependencies, and it is understood that the development of linotype manufactories in that country is largely due to the provisions of its patent law. The principle underlying the clause is so important that, in order to insure its acceptance, I have introduced conditions which will make it operative only in cases in which it is evidently not injurious to the legitimate interests of the patentee. For instance, the patented article must be reasonably capable of being commercially constructed or manufactured, or the invention patented reasonably capable of being commercially worked within the Commonwealth. The condition as to the working of a patent within the Commonwealth need not be complied with if the consumption of the patented article within Australia would be too small, or if some necessary element would be so expensive that its manufacture here would be an injury to the patentee, and involve an increase in the price of the article. by the Commissioner in the first case, and, on appeal, by the Court. supply a splendid lot of problems for the High Court. tional upon trades of a similar character being carried on within the Commonwealth. able to narrow the provision in that way. It might be possible to establish a new industiy upon conditions favourable to the patentee, and it would be unwise to impose any restriction such as the honourable and learned member suggests. There is no desire, under this power, to extract anything more then can reasonably be claimed. Surely when a person is being granted a monopoly, it is reasonable for us to say-""Tak e your monopoly and enjoy it, but if you can manufacture your patent with commercial success within the Commonwealth you will be called upon, in return for the monopoly you enjoy, to supply the requirements of the community by manufacturing here."" That seems to be only reasonable, and the conditions under which it is proposed to make the demand of the patentee, appear to remove the chief objections which apparently led honourable members in another place to strike out the clause. These amendments I propose will require to be embodied twice within the clause and also in the patent itself. W it h safeguards which I have indicated to honourable members, I believe that the provision will afford a means of legitimately increasing the productions of the Commonwealth, that it will result in advantage to our industries and to our people, and, at the same time, inflict no undue hardship upon the patentees. Prime Minister did not mention that the amendments agreed to in clause 83 almost dispense with the necessity for this new clause. desire to enter into the whole question again. last night, provides that the Court shall decide whether the price at which a patent is sold is a reasonable one.

The Court also has power to absolutely revoke the patent. teration which goes far beyond the English law, the Prime Minister now asks us to agree to a provision which is not to be found in any Patent Acts except those of Canada and Germany. I am informed that the provision in the Canadian Act has proved a dead letter. A similar provision was embodied in some of the South Australian Patent It enforced, it could only lead to an increase in the price of the patented article. For instance, honourable members must realize that it would not pay the Singer Manufacturing Company to manufacture sewing machines within the Commonwealth. The same remark would apply to the manufacture of linotypes. centralizing their work that these great manufacturing firms can turn out an article at a small cost. The Singer Manufacturing Company have been able to establish a successful branch in only one place, namely, Scotland. There is no necessity for this provision, which amounts to protection and nothing else. It is not required to tone down the effects of the monopoly granted by a patent, but is an attempt to enforce the local manufacture of articles in respect of which we have granted patent rights. though no working conditions are imposed upon patentees in the United States, the greater part of the time of the SupremeCourt actions relating to patents. doubt that during the last twenty or thirty years an enormous number of patent actions have been dealt with in America. Nearly the whole of the jurisdiction of some of the district Courts is monopolised by patent actions, aad similar results would be brought about here. Among other questions which the Courts would be called upon to determine here would be the question, for instance, whether a patent machine could be manufactured at a fair price, and such questions must lead to endless litigation. would be subjected to continual harassment, and I hope that honourable members will not consent to pass such an anomalous and drastic provision. . Mr Glynn. should have thought that every possible security-mor e than was desirable-ha d been afforded by the amendments which were accepted last night. Under the proNotwithstanding that drastic alvisions referred to by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, if a foreign patentee did not consider it desirable to manufacture in the Commonwealth, it would be competent for any one whothought he could successfully manufacture the article to apply for a compulsory licence to enable him to do so. Now we are asked to insert another provision Acts, but proved inoperative. which would have this effect. . If it did was recognised that if it were not pay any one in the Commonwealth to apply for a compulsory licence, and it did not pay the patentee himself to manufacture within the Commonwealth, the patent might be revoked. That would their mean that any person manufacturing in a place where there was no patent law, such as Holland, could gain the advantage of the It is only by patent in our market, in spite of the money spent by the patentee in registering the patent within the Commonwealth. must be satisfied that there is injury to thetrade or manufactures of the Commonwealth before proceedings for revocation of the patent are taken. That is provided for in Clause 82B, which imposes a restriction upon the proceedings. Almy argument. We know that many patents do not assume any great value until after the patentee has spent many years in creating demand, and is taken up in dealing with that frequently it is only during the lastThere is no year or so of the period for which the patent is issued that the patentee receives any return for his ingenuity and enterprise. In other words, the patentee has. to work his patent into repute. It is now proposed that if at the end of that period the patentee has achieved success and worked up a demand for his article in the Commonwealth, the patent shall be subject to revocation. A patent may be revoked before the patentee has been able to secure sufficient outlet to permit of his establishing works within the Commonwealth. I doThe patentees not think that is a fair provision. Moreover, it is to be left to the Court to decide whether a patent can be commercially and profitably manufactured within the Commonwealth. That is a very delicate question to be decided by any court.",26,Patents Bill

136,Mr Thomson,"That does not affectThe patent may be essential to the carrying on of certain industries, and if the cost of manufacture is increased through the requirement that it shall be made within the Commonwealth serious inj ury may be inflicted. The decision of the Court may have the effect of impeding the progress of industry. If a patent were not manufactured in Australia, more than sufficient security would be given to the public, because any person could obtain the right to manufacture under a compulsory licence. I object to the provision in the first place, because there is no necessity for it ; secondly, because the High Court would be called upon to settle very delicate and difficult questions; and thirdly, because it would operate, not only unjustly towards the patentees, but injuriously to the best interests of the Commonwealth. thoroughly sympathize with the views expressed by the honourable member for North Sydney. There are many classes of patented plant and machinery which must be obtained from abroad. For instance, the plant used in meat works is in nearly all cases imported from America. Most of the machinery has been patented in America, and is also protected by patent rights throughout Australia. The Americansare very sharp business people, and if they found it to their advantage to make this machinery in the Commonwealth they would do so apart from any legislation. If we enacted that all patented machinery should be made within the Commonwealth, we should practically prohibit the introduction of much valuable plant, and thus make a very grave mistake. If an attempt were made to manufacture within the Commonwealth all the machinery we required, the cost would be very largely increased, and I do not see that any good object would be served by passing the clause. wish to add my protest to the objections which have already been urged against this clause being restored to the Bill. It was very properly rejected in another Chamber. must not forget that I am modifying it . follow the modifications, because they do not appear in print. It would be difficult for me to conceive of any modifications that would remove the objections which I have to the clause. It seems to me that any such provision would result in increasing the cost of patented machinery,, and that, the effects would be the reverse of beneficial to our industries. In a great many instances patentees have been unable to get their patented articlesmanufactured within the Commonwealth except at a much greater expense. As has been already pointed out, the community islargely protected by the clauses to which, the Committee agreed at a previous sitting. I therefore hope that the proposal of the Prime Minister will be rejected. Question-That the proposed new clause be inserted-put . The Committee divided. Ayes ... ... 16 Noes 13 Majority. AYES.

But, so far as I have been able to discover, the papers which have been circulated give no estimate of what will be the cost of the Capital.

I would ask the Prime Minister to say whether it is not possible to put before the House a definite statement as to the expenditure to be incurred, and | how the necessary funds are to be raised. I hope so ; but the It will be difficult for us to determine the site of the Capital next week, unless we know how the necessary funds are to be raised. I do not think that we could now We shall provide Â£10,000,000 for such a work, and I trust that before a selection is made the Treasurer will furnish us with an. estimate of the cost.
