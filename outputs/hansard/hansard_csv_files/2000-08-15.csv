It has partly complied with the return of stolen properties and prisoners, has paid some war damages and has accepted monitoring of ballistic missiles. Some matters relating to chemical weapons remain outstanding. I am concerned that the goalposts have been shifted from resolution 687 to a broader objective of containing a heartless regime and removing its head. I am concerned that the sanctions have been particularly lethal to children under five years of age and have harmed those people who would most like to get rid of Saddam Hussein. But to those with money-that is, the friends of Saddam Hussein’s-just about anything they wish is available in Baghdad. I am concerned that sanctions have cemented in place a leader who presides over a police state with one of the worse human rights records in the world. I am not speaking in favour of capitulation, but after a decade of sanctions and terrible suffering of Iraqi children, I am speaking about being clear about our objectives and in favour of reviewing Australian support for the sanctions. I will be writing to the foreign minister with this in mind to inquire if there is anything that Australia can do to alleviate the suffering of the children in Iraq.

239,Mr Reith,"to move:The following answers to questions were circulated: Attorney-General’s Department: Provision of Legal Services and Staff (Question No. 1229) Mr Kerr asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 7 March 2000: (1) Is he able to say how many full time equivalent staff were employed in (a) his Department, (b) the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, (c) the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, (d) the Department of Defence, (e) the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs, (f) the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, (g) the Department of Finance and Administration, (h) the Department of Health and Aged Care, (i) the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, (j) the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, (k) the Department of Transport and Regional Services, (l) the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, (m) Airservices Australia, (n) the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, (o) the Australian Bureau of Statistics, (p) the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, (q) the Australian Federal Police, (r) the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, (s) the Australian Sports Commission, (t) the Australian Taxation Office, (u) Centrelink, (v) the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, (w) the Civil Aviation and Safety Authority, (x) Medibank Private, (y) the National Library of Australia, (z) the National Museum of Australia and (aa) the Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology Outsourcing in the provision of legal services, including legal advice, litigation, representation and legislative services, during 1998-99. (2) Is he able to say what were the salary costs of those staff in 1998-99 itemised by Department or agency. (3) How many legal services staff from his Department were based in each Department or agency referred to in part (1) in 1998-99. (4) What were the salary costs of those staff referred to in part (3) in 1998-99, itemised by Department or agency. (5) Is he able to say what were the costs of legal services provided under contract to each Department or agency referred to in part (1) in 1998-99. (1) My Department does not maintain information on the legal services staff employed in departments and agencies in other portfolios. I am not prepared to authorise the diversion of resources that would be necessary to seek this information. Some legal staff employed by the Attorney-General’s Department are involved in the provision of legal services as described in the question. Others are involved, either in whole or in part, in the provision of policy advice and other services to government. In addition, support staff and administrative staff are employed in part in the provision of legal services. I am not prepared to authorise the diversion of resources from other work that would be required to provide the level of detail sought by the honourable member. However, the following information outlines the general position of legal staff in the Attorney-General’s Department. The Department’s annual report for the year ended 30 June 1999 records that on 30 June 1999 the Department had 127 legal staff and 57 Senior Executive Officers employed under the Public Service Act (including the Secretary). These figures reflect full time equivalent for part time staff and include temporary and casual staff, as well as paid inoperatives and those acting in higher positions as at 30 June 1999. Numbers have been rounded to whole numbers. Some of these SES officers would be involved in providing legal policy advice and legal services. During the year ending 30 June 1999 the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) was still part of the Attorney-General’s Department but was administratively separate. The whole of its service was in the provision of legal and related services. The Department’s annual report for that year records that on 30 June 1999 the AGS had a total of 619 operative and 26 inoperative staff. (For these figures, actual staff numbers were used for part timers, rather than full time equivalents.) The Australian Federal Police (AFP) advises that 13 staff full time equivalent staff were employed in the provision of legal services to the AFP during the relevant year, including support staff.",93,Notices
240,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) The salary costs only of SES officers in the Attorney-General’s Department (excluding the Australian Protective Service) are Band1 $83,800 (median) $79,668 (mean) Band2 $96,100 (median) $103,756 (mean) Band3 $126,600 These amounts represent salary only and do not include amounts for superannuation, performance pay and other component of officers’ salary packages. Mean salaries for legal officers in the Department are as follows Legal Officer $40,756 Senior Legal Officer $66,471 Principal Legal Officer $76,140 These salaries do not include employer superannuation contributions. The amount of these contributions would depend on the fund of which the officer is a member. AGS is wholly directed to the provision of legal services. Its salary bill for 1998-99 was $35,054,301. This amount is made up of salary and allowances, including higher duties allowance. The Australian Federal Police advise that the salary costs of the 13 staff was $682,225.19. This amount does not include allowances or non-salary components of salary packages. (3) AGS had the following numbers of its staff in each department or agency in 1998-99: Attorney-General 2.30 Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 5.91 DHAC 1.95 DIMA 2.00 DISR 0.75 DTRS 1.00 ACCC 7.10 CSIRO 1.00 Total 26.01 (4) AGS is a government business enterprise, operating in direct competition with private sector law firms. AGS was administratively separate from the Department during the relevant year, in the lead up to its establishment as a statutory authority on 1 September 1999. The salary costs of employees in the provision of particular legal services relate to AGS’ cost and pricing structure which is commercially sensitive information. Because of the small numbers of AGS legal services employees involved, it is inappropriate to provide salary costs for particular agencies. Overall, however, AGS had salary costs (excluding performance pay and superannuation) of $1,936,013 relating to the 26.01 staff referred to in the answer to question 3. (5) While legal services provided by AGS to the Department were not provided under contract, I am advised that during the year in question the Department paid a total of $4,958,759.38 to AGS for legal and related services. This amount includes payment for legal services provided by AGS to other departments and agencies for certain Cabinet and international law work. It also includes work undertaken by AGS in providing support for the Attorney-General as First Law Officer, as well as work in relation to ministerial briefings and input into litigation policy development. The amount does not include payments made to AGS in respect of counsel fees where counsel were retained by AGS for matters involving the Attorney-General’s Department. The Department paid a further $804,095.04 for legal services from other legal services providers. This amount includes amounts paid to counsel in some matters. The Department also made payments for legal services to both AGS and other legal services providers for legal services it obtained in some proceedings in which the costs were paid by the Commonwealth pursuant to section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966. I am not prepared to authorise the diversion of resources that would be necessary to ascertain what amounts paid under section 305 relate to legal services. The AFP advises that it paid $594,551 to AGS and $29,781 to other legal services providers. This does not include amounts paid for counsel retained by AGS. Freedom of Information: Time Frames (Question No. 1470) Mr O’Keefe asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 9 May 2000: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1026 (Hansard, 6 December 1999, page 12924), does the Administrative Appeals Tribunal impose a $500 application fee if a person or an organisation that does not receive an agency’s decision within the time limits prescribed under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act makes application for appeal to the Tribunal; if so, does this make this avenue an ineffective remedy. (2) Can the Commonwealth Ombudsman impose sanctions pursuant to its investigation of complaints of agencies’ actions under the FOI Act, including decisions, delays, and refusal or failure to act; if not, does this make this avenue an ineffective remedy. (3) Why are there time frames for responses to be provided within the FOI Act when these limits are not adhered to by agencies, including Comcare Australia, and when effective remedies are not available. (1) Where an applicant does not receive notice of an agency’s decision on a valid request within the time limits prescribed under the FOI Act, the principal officer of the agency is deemed to have made a decision to refuse to grant access on the last day of the prescribed time limit. A person who applies to the AAT for a review of a decision may have to pay an application fee. The fee is currently $526.00. However, Regulation 19 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Regulations 1976 prescribes situations in which a fee is not payable. In summary, a fee is not payable if: (a) the applicant is the holder of a health care card, pensioner concession card or any of the other cards referred to in Regulation 19; (b) the applicant is a person of the type referred to in Regulation 19 (for example, he or she has been granted legal aid for the matter to which the fee relates, or is under 18 years of age); (c) the fee is waived by the AAT because paying the fee would cause an applicant financial hardship; or (d) the fee is refunded by the AAT because proceedings have ‘terminated in a manner favourable to the applicant’. The AAT also has a discretion to recommend to the Attorney-General that an applicant’s costs in relation to the AAT proceedings be paid by the Commonwealth where the applicant is successful or substantially successful. (2) After an investigation into action taken by a Department or prescribed authority has been completed and the Ombudsman considers that an instance of defective administration has occurred, the Ombudsman must provide a report to the relevant Department or prescribed authority. A copy of the report is furnished to the Minister responsible for the Department or prescribed authority. The report may include recommendations. It may also include a request from the Ombudsman to the Department or prescribed authority to furnish to the Ombudsman particulars of any action that it proposes to take with respect to the matters and recommendations contained in the report. If the Ombudsman is of the opinion that adequate and appropriate action has not been taken within a reasonable time, the Ombudsman may inform the Prime Minister and the Parliament. Following presentation of the Ombudsman’s report to the Parliament, the Ombudsman may have further discussions with the principal officer of the Department or prescribed authority, for the purpose of resolving the matter. (3) As I made clear in my answer to Question No. 1026, the statistics in the FOI Annual Report for 1998-99 show that the vast majority of FOI requests are processed within the required time frame. Statistics in other recent FOI Annual Reports are consistent with this finding. There are established and workable procedures in the FOI Act which allow for the provision of a remedy to an applicant who is not satisfied with a decision in relation to his or her FOI request or the processing of his or her FOI request.",99,Questions On Notice
241,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Vietnam Veterans’: Health of Children Study (Question No. 1489) Ms Macklin asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 9 May 2000: (1) Did the Vietnam Veterans Health Study released in December 1999 find that the children of Vietnam veterans had higher rates of death than children of other members of the community. (2) What action is he taking to address the needs of children and grandchildren of Vietnam veterans, particularly with regard to suicide and illness. (3) When will he put this into effect. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. Validation of the findings of the Vietnam Veterans Health (Morbidity) Study showed that children of Vietnam veterans had higher rates of accidental death and suicide, than children of other members of the community. (2) The package of initiatives announced in the 2000-2001 Budget in response to the Health Study builds on the extensive range of benefits, treatment and counselling services already available to veterans and their dependants through my Department and the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service (VVCS). Free psychiatric assessment and counselling will now be available through the VVCS to Vietnam veterans’ children, up to their 36th birthday. In recognition of the role of education in suicide prevention, access to the Veterans’ Children Education Scheme is being extended to Vietnam veterans’ children who are identified as being vulnerable to self-harm or suicide. The scheme provides veterans’ children in these circumstances with access to financial and other support so they may continue their education regardless of their family arrangements. In addition, two annual bursaries will be provided in each State and one annual bursary in each Territory to assist needy students to make the transition to tertiary study. Additional VVCS programs covering issues associated with veterans’ lifestyles and promoting healthy family relationships will also be provided to veterans, their partners and children. The policies of successive governments, as enacted under the Repatriation Act 1920 and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986, have intended that the Repatriation system be primarily directed towards the compensation and care of veterans. While my Department does have some responsibilities for veterans’ children who have been affected by their direct relationship with the veteran, this does not extend to grandchildren. (3) The Government has been implementing measures through the VVCS in response to the findings relating to the deaths of children since shortly after the 1998 release of the first volume of the report of the Health Study. This action has included: . expansion of the range of VVCS programs; . the creation of linkages to the National Suicide Prevention Strategy; . publishing of I thought it was just me, an information booklet written for older and adult children of Vietnam veterans . a satellite broadcast on Family Dysfunction and Suicide in the Vietnam Veteran Community to assist health professionals identify and manage families at risk; and . training workshops on suicide prevention for parents, members of the veteran community and health professionals. The additional measures, set out in (2) above, that form part of the recently announced Budget package for Vietnam veterans and their families, complement these initiatives and are being implemented progressively from 1 July 2000. Australian Defence Force: Recruits from Tasmania (Question No. 1490) Mr Adams asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 9 May 2000: (1) How many persons, by age group, have been recruited into the Australian Defence Force from Tasmania in each year since 1985. (2) Into which service did Tasmanian recruits enter each year. (3) When will the next round of recruitment be undertaken in Tasmania. (4) How is this information being advised to young persons who are not necessarily at school. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) and (2) Defence records for this specific data is only available from 1990 onwards. While hard copy records for the years before 1990 may be available from archives, the resource costs associated with collating the necessary information would be excessive, and in the interest of efficient utilisation of departmental resources, I am not prepared to authorise the time and effort that may be involved.

(3) and (4) ADF recruitment in Tasmania, as in all states, is an ongoing activity augmented by press and television advertising such as the current ‘lifestyle’ campaign. Young persons interested in Defence Force careers are reached via these mediums, as well as our web sites and physical presence in the Defence Force Careers Reference Centre in Hobart and careers counselling visits to regional areas in Tasmania by recruiting staff. Australian Taxation Office: Company Garnishees (Question No. 1493) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 9 May 2000: (1) Is the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) able to use Section 218 notices to garnishee income from a company that is in debt to the ATO. (2) Is the ATO able to use Section 218 notices to garnishee income from a company that is in debt to the ATO while the company is trading from an insolvent position; if so, how frequently does the ATO use Section 218 notices to garnishee income from a company that is in debt to the ATO while the company is trading from an insolvent position. (3) Does the Government accept the use by the ATO of Section 218 notices to have debts to the ATO repaid ahead of workers entitlements when this would not be the case if the provisions of the Corporations Law were followed. honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) Yes, though no statistics are recorded for this type of situation. However, if the ATO is aware that a company is trading while insolvent the ATO would seek to have the directors remedy this. (3) A full explanation of the interaction of the income tax law and the corporation law in relation to garnishee notices, voidable transactions and payments to liquidators can be found on the ATO’s web page at www.ato.gov.au, Go to For Business, Go to Pay Tax, Go to Paying Your Tax, Go to Debt Collection policy.",101,Docita 2 00 Dewrsb 2 00
242,Mr Costello,"The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to theExcise Evasion: Prosecutions (Question No. 1496) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 9 May 2000: (1) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a recent conviction of a Queensland truck driver on three counts of defrauding the Commonwealth, relating to excise evasion through purchasing marked solvent and selling the product to service stations as transport fuel. (2) What other prosecutions were undertaken for fuel excise evasion in 1997, 1998 and 1999, and what were the outcomes of those prosecutions. to the honourable member’s questions: (1) The Minister for Justice and Customs is aware that a truck driver was sentenced on 17 April 2000 after pleading guilty on 27 March 2000 to three charges of defrauding the Commonwealth in the Brisbane District Court. (2) On 21 October 1998, a new Administrative Arrangements Order resulted in the transfer of the Excise function to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). On4 February 1999, the core excise functions were passed to the ATO. Customs and the ATO agreed that investigations and prosecutions of excise and fuel substitution offences would, for a period of six months, continue to be conducted and managed by Customs under a temporary purchaser-provider arrangement. In May 1999, the ATO decided to assume responsibility for investigations and prosecutions as from 12 July 1999. Customs had commenced three prosecutions during the 1998-99 financial year. All three cases were transferred to the ATO on 12 July. Prior to 1998-99 financial year, no other fuel substitution prosecutions were initiated. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Noise (Question No. 1498) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 9 May 2000: (1) Why do aircraft departing Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport from runway 16R and crossing the Kurnell peninsular over north Cronulla, not track out to sea to avoid noise impact on residents along the southern coastline and the Royal National Park. (2) On how many occasions, and when, have aircraft flown directly over, or in the near vicinity of, the township of Bundeena since May 1999. (3) Are there regulations preventing the dumping of aviation fuel along the coastline or the Royal National Park. (1) Jet aircraft departing south from runway 16R at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport cross the Kurnell peninsular over the sand hills between Kurnell and Wanda. The proximity of the adjacent parallel runway, the need to facilitate independent operations between the runways in a safe manner and cockpit workload considerations, are major operational constraints to the design of alternative procedures. However, on 15 June 2000 a new Standard Instrument Departure (SID) procedure was introduced which means jet aircraft departing runway 16R will turn slightly to the east as they reach the southern side of Botany Bay. This procedure has been designed to provide relief to Cronulla and points south while avoiding an increase in noise exposure at Kurnell and resulted from extensive consultations within the LTOP Implementation and Monitoring Committee. Non jet aircraft departing from runway 16R use a track to the west of the jets over Yowie Bay and the National Park. This is required to achieve a safe separation between the jets and slower non jet aircraft.",105,Service Enlistment Year Army Navy Air Force Total
243,Mr Williams,The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answers,106,Service Enlistment Year Army Navy Air Force Total
244,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) The following data is provided for the number of aircraft arriving at or departing from Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport that have flown within a two kilometre radius centred on the township of Bundeena: 1999 Arrivals Departures May 239 306 June 197 356 July 195 449 August 133 178 September 175 266 November 164 277 December 224 276 2000 January 127 284 February 299 228 March 167 309 April 172 325 May 260 235 (3) Yes. Under the Air Navigation (Fuel Spillage) Regulations 1999, the operator of an aircraft within the Commonwealth’s jurisdiction must ensure that fuel is not released from an aircraft during flight unless fuel is released: . in an emergency over areas where it does not create a hazard to a person or property on the ground; or . according to a permission given by a person performing duty in Air Traffic Control. In the latter case, aircraft should maintain a minimum height of 6,000 feet above ground level to ensure maximum vaporisation of the fuel. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Runway Crosswinds (Question No. 1505) May 2000: Further to the answer to question No 1097 (Hansard, 4 April 2000, page 14692) will he act on the recommendation of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation report to reconsider routinely operating the short runways at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) airport, with up to 25 knots crosswind. Since 1989 the procedures across Australia have allowed for the continued use of dry runways with a crosswind component of up to 25knts and downwind components of up to 5knts. Continued use of wet runways is available with a crosswind component of up to 25knts with no downwind component, or a crosswind of up to 15knts with a downwind component of up to 5knts. In response to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), formerly the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, report into the Sydney Airport Terminal Area (B98.90), the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) reviewed the criteria used at Sydney Airport. Following discussions with Airservices Australia and Airline operators, CASA concluded that routinely operating runways with up to 25knts of crosswind does not pose an unacceptable safety hazard. Given the continuing concerns being raised by some parties within the industry, I have recently asked that CASA, in conjunction with the ATSB and Airservices Australia, revisit this matter with the industry. I am advised that the agencies have now commenced this review process.",106,Service Enlistment Year Army Navy Air Force Total

246,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:McHugh, Justice Michael: Migration Act (Question No. 1509) (1) Has his attention been drawn to comments by his Honour Justice Michael McHugh in the High Court of Australia in the recent case of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ex parte Durairajasinjhim wherein he expressed concern that amendments to the Migration Act (Commonwealth) are resulting in an excessive number of applications under the Act coming before the High Court. (2) Has he considered his Honour’s comments and will he take steps to ensure that the High Court is able to concentrate on constitutional and important appellate matters rather than cases which are in the nature of trials under the Migration Act. (1) I am aware of the comments of His Honour, Justice McHugh in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 about the effect that the current judicial review scheme contained in Part8 Migration Act 1958 (Cth) is having on the work load of the High Court. (2) I have considered his Honour’s comments. The Government has already taken steps to ensure that the High Court is able to concentrate on constitutional and important appellate matters. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 1998 currently before the Senate would have the effect of decreasing the number of applications coming before the High Court under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business: Commonwealth Funded Programs, Tasmania (Question No. 1533) Ms O’Byrne asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 11 May 2000: (1) Does the Minister’s Department administer any Commonwealth funded programs for which community organisations, businesses or individuals can apply for funding in Tasmania; if so, what are the programs. (2) Does the Minister’s Department advertise these funding opportunities; if so, (a) what print media outlets have been used for the advertising of each of these programs and (b) were these paid advertisements. (1) Yes. Details of the 14 relevant programs are as follows. Contracts for the delivery of Job Network services are awarded through a competitive tender process. Job Network consists of private, community and public sector organisations which are currently contracted to provide a range of services for the period 28 February 2000 to 2 March 2003. The department administers the Small Business Enterprise Culture Program (SBECP) to provide funding for the development of business skills for small business owners and managers. The department, jointly with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), administers the Indigenous Small Business Fund (ISBF) to foster the development of businesses owned, operated and managed by indigenous people, and promote sustained indigenous employment opportunities throughout Australia. Indigenous organisations which provide services to foster indigenous businesses and indigenous individuals seeking support for their own businesses, may apply for assistance from the fund. The department is also a primary source of funding for the establishment of Small Business Incubators. The program provides funds to help cover the costs of setting up an incubator to assist new and growing businesses to become established and profitable by providing premises, advice, services and other support, normally lasting from one to three years. Most organisations within the community are eligible to submit a proposal for funding to establish a Small Business Incubator.",107,Service Enlistment Year Army Navy Air Force Total

The Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) Placement Incentive Scheme, allows indigenous community organisations controlling the projects to claim a bonus of $2000 for each of their participants, who through CDEP are placed in ongoing, mainstream, full-time employment. The Indigenous Small Business Fund provides the opportunity to foster the development and expansion of indigenous small businesses, by encouraging community organisations and individuals to identify and develop innovative business opportunities. The department also administers the Regional Assistance Program (RAP). RAP aims to generate employment in metropolitan, regional and remote Australia, by encouraging business and communities to take action to boost business growth and create sustainable jobs. It provides seed funding for innovative, quality projects of value to the community. RAP project proponents will usually be not-forprofit organisations. Community organisations and businesses can apply for funding under the Work for the Dole, Return to Work and Community Support Programs. Work for the Dole Program The Work for the Dole Program seeks tenders from private, and not-for-profit community and government organisations/agencies to provide Work for the Dole Community Work Coordinator services across Australia. An important part of a Community Work Coordinator’s role is to develop and manage Work for the Dole activities/projects in their local community, by seeking Work for the Dole activities/project proposals from local community, government organisations/agencies, and to promote these projects to job seekers. The funding for this promotional work is part of a Community Work Coordinator’s contracted price. In turn, not-for-profit community and government organisations/agencies are eligible to apply to Community Work Coordinators for funding to host Work for the Dole activities/projects. Not-for-profit community and government organisations/agencies can approach Community Work Coordinators at any time with activity/project proposals. Community Work Coordinators submit all activity/project proposals to the department for final approval. The department also produces promotional material about the Work for the Dole Program. This material is distributed to Community Work Coordinators, Centrelink Offices, not-for-profit organisations/agencies, other organisations and individuals who express an interest in the Work for the Dole Program. Return to Work Program The Return to Work Program is promoted generally through Managing Agents, advertising and recruiting strategies, the DEWRSB internet site and promotional material displayed and distributed by Centrelink. It seeks tenders from any entity tendering to provide Managing Agent services for all, or a number, of States/Territories, or a single State/Territory. Community Support Program The Community Support Program is administered by Centrelink. However, the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business will be resuming administration of the Program from 1 July 2000. There have been two tenders for organisations to provide services to eligible job seekers. Centrelink has administered both tender processes. Individuals can apply to the Employee Entitlements Support Scheme (EESS) to seek assistance in the event that their employment has been terminated on or after 1 January 2000 as a result of their employer’s insolvency, and where they have not been paid certain employee entitlements. (2) Yes (2) (a) Programm Advertising The Job Network tender was advertised in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and in metropolitan and major regional newspapers. The Work for the Dole 2000 Community Work Coordinator Request for Tender and subsequent appointments were advertised in national and regional newspapers in August 1999 and March 2000 respectively. A complete listing of all newspapers advertising the appointments of Community Work Coordinators has been included. The department paid for these advertisements from its funding allocation. The Return to Work Request for Tender was advertised in the national press and regional newspapers. The Small Business Enterprise Culture Program (SBECP) was advertised in the Australian Financial Review, The Weekend Australian and state newspapers including the Hobart Mercury. These were paid advertisements. It has also been advertised on the department’s website and in offices of the department. The ISBF has been advertised in the indigenous press, on departmental and ATSIC websites and in departmental and ATSIC offices. Paid advertisements were placed in the Koori Mail. The support for Small Business Incubators has not been advertised in the press. Funding details and information about Small Business Incubators are available on the department’s website at dewrsb.gov.au. The indigenous employment Programs are promoted by departmental staff and through paid advertisements in indigenous print media outlets such as the Koori Mail. A paid advertisement for the Wage Assistance subsidy was also placed in the Tasmanian Business Reporter in August/September 1999. In addition, the Indigenous Employment Program is also promoted through direct mail to stakeholders, including small businesses, major corporations in the private sector, and community organisations. The department writes to every jobseeker eligible for Wage Assistance every six months to advise them of their entitlement. The department promotes RAP through the Commonwealth’s network of Area Consultative Committees (ACCs) including through the ACC web site. The department has also advertised RAP in local Tasmanian media. Paid advertisements appeared in three Tasmanian print media outlets the “Mercury”, the “Examiner” and the “Advocate”. Advertisements have been placed in National, State capital, and certain regional newspapers.

(4) What action has he taken in relation to this concern. following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) To date, 29 projects valued at $9.6m have been approved for expenditure in Cape York. (3) I am aware of the comments made by the Centre for International Economics Resource Policy and Management 1999 in relation to the Cape York Natural Heritage Trust. The comments were in a report prepared by the Centre as part of the broader Mid-term Review of the Natural Heritage Trust. (4) I met with conservation, pastoral and indigenous stakeholders, local government and government officials in October 1999 to discuss ways of progressing the implementation of the Cape York Natural Heritage Trust Plan. The Cape York Regional Advisory Panel, which represents the main stakeholder groups in Cape York, is also finalising its own response to the Mid-term Review report and will be forwarding this to me shortly. I will then consider any outstanding concerns.

253,Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister Representing The Minister For Family And Community,"following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) A person providing full-time care in the home of a child under 16 years of age with a profound disability as defined by the Social Security Act, may be eligible for Carer Payment. Under subsection 197(2), a child is a ‘profoundly disabled child if’: (a) the child has either: (i) a severe multiple disability; or (ii) a severe medical condition; and (b) the child, because of that disability or condition, needs continuous personal care for: (i) 6 months or more; or (ii) if the child’s condition is terminal and the child’s life expectancy is less than 6 months – the remainder of the child’s life; and (c) the child’s disability or condition includes 3 or more of the following circumstances: (i) the child receives all food and fluids by nasogastric or percutaneous enterogastric tube; (ii) the child has a tracheostomy; (iii) the child must use a ventilator for at least 8 hours each day; (iv) the child: (A) has faecal incontinence day and night; and (B) if under 3 years of age, is expected to have faecal incontinence day and night at the age of 3; (v) the child: (A) cannot stand without support; and (B) if under 2 years of age, is expected to be unable to stand without support at the age of 2; (vi) a medical practitioner has certified that the child has a terminal condition for which palliative care has replaced active treatment; (vii) the child: (A) requires personal care on 2 or more occasions between 10pm and 6am each day; and (B) if under 6 months of age, is expected to require care as described in sub-subparagraph (A) at the age of 6 months. Carer Payment may also be available to a carer of two or more disabled children if the children are assessed as requiring a level of care that is at least equivalent to the level of care required by a profoundly disabled child. (2) 1 July 1998. (3) 3,767 claims were lodged between 1 July 1998 and end February 2000. (4) 2,545 claims were rejected from 1 July 1998 to end February 2000. Data by medical condition is available for 1 July 1999 to end February 2000. In this period there were 1,539 claims rejected, 32 of which were in respect of children with epilepsy. No application for Carer Payment would be rejected in respect of a ‘profoundly disabled child’ as defined under the legislation where the eligibility criteria are met. Figures may be subject to minor adjustment at the end of the 1999-2000 financial year due to data refinement. (5) Yes, a review was undertaken in 1999 by the Department of Family and Community Services with the assistance of a reference group comprising medical experts and representatives of peak organisations. The report of the review was released on 15 March 2000. (a) The review raised six proposals to refine the program’s operation. They were to: . recognise a broader range of children with impaired bowel function; . streamline the eligibility process for carers of terminally ill children; . improve claim forms and related publicity material; . undertake further work in relation to the ‘tube feeding’ criterion; . recognise children who require high-level supervision; and . allow eligibility to be granted on a discretionary basis. (b) As indicated in the government response to the report, the government has adopted the first four recommendations listed in answer (5)(a).",114,Service Enlistment Year Army Navy Air Force Total
254,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided theImmigration: Unauthorised Arrivals (Question No. 1571) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 29 May 2000: Further to the answer to question No. 1268 (Hansard, 9 May 2000, page 15328), how many, by country, of the 3484 and 1148 unauthorised arrivals by boat and air, respectively, since July 1999 had applied offshore for refugee and humanitarian visas before entering Australia illegally. Unauthorised arrivals generally do not possess documents verifying their identity. This makes accurate data matching comparing information received in applications offshore with information provided by unauthorised arrivals in Australia very difficult. When interviewed, unauthorised arrivals routinely claim not to have previously made applications before the Department. However, a manual check of a number of recent cases indicates that there have been a small number of cases where an unauthorised arrival who applied for protection onshore has been found to have also lodged a refugee or humanitarian application offshore. High Court of Australia: Migration Matters Filed (Question No. 1579) (1) How many matters were filed in the High Court registry in respect of each financial year since 1 July 1997.

256,Mr Mcclelland Asked The Attorney,"General, upon notice, on 30 May 2000:",116,Service Enlistment Year Army Navy Air Force Total
257,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Is Child Support Income the income of the parent used to calculate how much child support is paid. (4) Is income over $101 153 not taken into account for child support purposes, other than where special circumstances are established. (5) Under the proposed changes, will income over $78 378 not be taken into account. (6) Do the proposed changes to the Child Support Income threshold give greatest benefits to high income earners. (7) Will the proposed changes reduce the (a) amount of child support from $24 552 per annum to $18 301 per annum, or a fall of $119.89 per week, (b) amount of money available to children and (c) standard of living of the payee or carer parent in favour of raising the standard of living for the payer parent. (8) Under the proposed changes will there be a reduction in child support where there is contact by the payer of at least 30% or more nights per annum. (9) Will child support percentages be reduced when there is contact of at least 10% of nights per annum. (10) Is the justification for this change due to the non-carer parent’s high costs of having contact with the children. (11) Does the level of contact between the payer and child reduce the costs of the carer. (12) Do the standing costs of the carer remain, including accommodation, education and clothing costs. (13) Will a parent having 10% of nights contact with a child get in excess of a 10% reduction in child support payments if there is one child. (14) What are the benefits of the change to the child and the payees in receipt of the child support monies. following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes, however, this may be varied: by agreement of the parents; as a result of an application for departure from the administrative assessment; or by the Court. (2) Yes, under current arrangements aligning the measure of ‘average weekly earnings’ that sets the upper limit or ‘cap’ on payer taxable income used in their child support assessment with that used for the payee’s disregarded income amount will give a ‘cap’ of $78,378 compared to $101,153. (3) Yes, however, this may be varied: by agreement of the parents; as a result of an application for departure from the administrative assessment; or by the Court. (4) Yes, however, this may be varied: by agreement of the parents; as a result of an application for departure from the administrative assessment; or by the Court. (5) Yes, however as is currently the case, this may be varied: by agreement of the parents; as a result of an application for departure from the administrative assessment; or by the Court. (6) Paying parents with an income over $78,378 (under current arrangements) who pay child support will benefit from the reduction in the upper limit or ‘cap’ on payer income used in their child support assessment. (7) (a) The amount of any reduction will be dependent on a number of factors, such as the payer’s income, the number of children involved, the presence of any new natural or adoptive children in the paying parent’s household and the payee’s income. The estimated 4,000 payers affected by this measure will pay an average of around $60 per week less in child support. These payers will continue to pay an average of around $15,300 per annum ($295 per week) in child support. (b) While the measure will reduce the “formula” assessed level of child support for affected parents this does not mean that they cannot provide additional support beyond the assessed amount. (c) Child support is not designed to support certain standards of living for separated parents. Rather, child support is about both separated parents contributing to the costs of raising their children according to their capacity. (8) The proposed changes do not alter the current child support arrangements for parents who have the care of their child for 30 per cent of the nights of a year or more. Where a parent shares the care of a",116,Service Enlistment Year Army Navy Air Force Total
258,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided thetheir child for 30 per cent of the nights of a year or more, the current reduced child support liabilities will continue to apply. (9) Under the changes to child support announced in the Budget, where a child support payer exercises contact with their children of between 10 per cent and 29 per cent of the nights of the year their child support formula percentages will be reduced. For payers with contact between 10 per cent and 19 per cent, the relevant formula percentage that is applied to their income will generally be reduced by two percentage points (for example, from 18 per cent to 16 per cent for one child). Where contact is between 20 per cent and 29 per cent, the formula percentage will generally be reduced by a total of three percentage points (for example, from 18 per cent to 15 per cent for one child). (10) This change is intended to encourage parents to maintain contact with their children after separation. By recognising that parents incur costs during contact, the proposal will improve incentives for non-resident parents to maintain contact with their children. Contact with both parents is of benefit to the development of the children, and leads to a higher likelihood of payment of child support. (11) Yes, it reduces costs such as food, entertainment and clothes. However, like the non-resident parent, ongoing infrastructure costs will continue during periods in which children are with the other parent. Those costs to both parents may include the provision of a bedroom for the child(ren), bedroom furniture and bedding, toys and other entertainment items and general household materials used by the child(ren). (12) Yes, as noted in response to Question 11, as for non-resident parents a resident parent’s ongoing infrastructure costs will continue during periods in which children are with the other parent. (13) This Budget measure aligns with the current provisions that apply to child support payers with the care of their children for more than 30 per cent of the time. For example, under current arrangements, parents with care of between 30 and 39 per cent of the nights of the year have their child support reduced by the same percentage regardless of the exact percentage of care they have within that 30 to 39 percent range. In these cases the child support formula percentage is generally reduced by 4 percentage points. Under this budget measure, where a child support payer has care of their child for between 20 per cent and 29 per cent of the time their child support formula percentages will generally be reduced by three percentage points. Those with between 10 per cent and 19 per cent of the nights of the year their child support formula percentages will generally be reduced by two percentage points. Where a parent pays child support for one child, the effect of these arrangements in terms of the percentage of the actual dollar value of these reductions is that those parents with between 10 per cent and 19 per cent care have their liabilities reduced by around 11 per cent. Parents with between 20 per cent and 29 per cent care have their liabilities reduced by around 16 per cent. (14) By recognising that parents incur costs during contact, the measure will improve incentives for non-resident parents to maintain contact with their children. Contact with both parents is of benefit to the development of the children, and leads to a higher likelihood of payment of child support. Rural and Regional Australia: Bank Mergers (Question No. 1619) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, upon notice, on 7 June 2000: Has the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) the power to investigate the potential loss of economic activity in regional Australia following the merger of the Colonial Bank and the Commonwealth Bank; if so, will he direct the ACCC to take into account the likely loss of economic activity in regional Australia. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is responsible for ensuring compliance with the competition and consumer provisions of the Trade Practices Act, including the prohibition on anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions. In its assessment of the competition implications of the Commonwealth Bank/ Colonial merger, the Commission conducted extensive market inquiries. It received comments from business and farming",117,Service Enlistment Year Army Navy Air Force Total
259,Mr Hockey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:organisations, consumer groups and banking customers, as well as State Governments and State and Federal members of Parliament. After significant undertakings in relation to price, service quality and product range were provided by the parties, the Commission decided not to oppose the merger. Undertakings given by the Commonwealth Bank include a commitment to retain Colonial State Bank sites where there is no Commonwealth Bank branch within close proximity. There is also a commitment that in any country town where the Commonwealth Bank or Colonial is the last bank in the town, the branch will be retained for at least the next five years. In country towns, any amalgamated branch must also be retained for at least five years. The Commonwealth Bank also undertook to ensure that there would be no involuntary employment losses in Tasmania and rural and regional NSW as a result of the acquisition. If the Commission forms the belief that a term of these undertakings has been breached, under the Trade Practices Act, it may apply to the Court for an order directing compliance with the undertaking. Migration Internal Review Office: Applications Outstanding (Question No. 1649) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 20 June 2000: (1) How many applications lodged with the Migration Internal Review Office (MIRO) are outstanding. (2) When will the backlog of MIRO cases be cleared. (3) Will outstanding MIRO cases be given priority consideration by the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT). (4) What timeframe can applicants for review by the MRT expect for a decision to be reached. (1) Of the 2605 cases received from the Migration Internal Review Office by the Migration Review Tribunal, 1802 were outstanding at 31 May 2000. (2) It is difficult to predict when the backlog of MIRO cases will be cleared. Cases are dealt with in accordance with the agreed casework priorities, not according to whether the application was originally lodged with MIRO, the IRT or the MRT. The MRT’s caseload priorities have been determined by the Acting Principal Member of the Tribunal as follows: Priority 1. . Time critical cases as defined by legislation (ie applications for review of a decision to refuse or cancel a bridging visa as a result of which the person is in immigration detention) and . Cases to be expedited in accordance with legislation, (ie onshore visa cancellation cases, certain visitor visa cases and cases where the person affected is in immigration detention). Priority 2. . Cases where there are circumstances of a particularly compelling or compassionate nature relating to the review applicant or the visa applicant, and . cases remitted from the Federal Court. Priority 3. . Applications for the review of decisions to refuse a visa where the review applicant is also the visa applicant by date of lodgement of undecided review application (ie applications for review of onshore visa decisions), and . offshore spouse applications lodged prior to a date advised by the Principal Member from time to time (currently 1 June 1999). Priority4 . All other cases by date of lodgement of undecided review application ie applications for review of offshore visa decisions, other than offshore spouse cases included in priority group 3). Work usually commences on applications which fall within Priorities 1 and 2 shortly after receipt by the Tribunal.",118,Service Enlistment Year Army Navy Air Force Total
260,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Within Priorities 3 and 4, cases are dealt with on the basis of “oldest review application first”. MIRO cases generally fall into these categories and because of their age are more likely to be dealt with before applications made to the former Immigration Review Tribunal. There is however scope for cases within a priority grouping to be constituted taking into account the characteristics of cases where this will achieve economies of effort through dealing with a number of similar cases at the same time or to make the best use of the skills and knowledge of members and case officers. “Oldest review application” is determined taking into account the date that the review applicant first applied for merits review. The rate of clearance of the backlog of MIRO cases will depend on the number of new applications that fall within Priorities 1 and 2, and the number of cases able to be finalised by the Tribunal. (3) Outstanding MIRO cases will be processed in accordance with the Tribunal’s caseload priorities described above at (2). (4) As described above, it is not possible to predict with any certainty, when an MRT application will be decided as it depends on the nature of the case and the Priority assigned to the application.
