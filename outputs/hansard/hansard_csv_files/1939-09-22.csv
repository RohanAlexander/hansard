If so, what are its intentions ? that the credit of the nation is in fact being used for the purpose of financing our present undertakings, and I have no doubt that we shall continue to use it.

I have received complaints from some people that their usual supplies from certain firms have been refused since the commodities concerned have been included in the fixed price list. They conclude that the firms do not desire to do business on the basis of the fixed prices. W ill the Minister for Trade and Customs say what can be done to ensure that supplies are made available, and what action will be taken by the Government if specific cases are brought under the notice of the department? ment has taken power, where cases of hoarding established, compulsorily to acquire the commodities and distribute them to -consumers. hesitate to exercise that power should necessity arise. Sixth report brought up by Mr Minister consider that the ' criticism levelled at the Commonwealth Government by the ex-Premier of New South Wales, the honourable member for failure to proceed with road works for defence purposes, which he claimed had been agreed upon, can be sustained? I ask this question particularly in the interest of unskilled workers, a large number of whom are unemployed. to say that I have not read the criticism and therefore cannot say anything about it. Minister inform the House how f a r it is proposed to proceed with the business that awaits the consideration of the House, before the pending adjournment? Does the Government feel that its objective will have been achieved if approval is given to the SupplyB ill , or is there any other particular business that the House will have to discuss? ment on the matter at a later hour; I cannot answer it offhand. MUTU AL ASSURANCE SOCIETIES. last, in reply to remarks that I made with respect to certain aspects of the activities of mutual assurance societies, tbe Treasurer gave the assurance that an inquiry Would be instituted into the matter immediately.

Until the regulations establishing the organization to control prices are gazetted, tbe Minister is the authority to make price determinations with respect to those I very much regret commodities already gazetted. Acting on the recommendation of Professor Copland, I have made the following determinations :(1) The maximum price charged for cornsacks sold by importers or W ill the Prime distributors to country traders, storekeepers or users is not to exceed the landed into store cost, plus fourpencc a dozen for prompt net cash.",13,Utilizatio N Of Credit Canberra Hotels Control Of Prices

15,Mr John Lawson (Macquarie,"(2) The maximum price charged for cornsacks sold to users hy country traders or storekeepers acting as principals is not to exceed the cost into store plus fourpence a dozen for prompt net cash. ""Where the sale is arranged through a wheat agent or country agent oh behalf of an importer or distributor, the maximum margin to be allowed to such agent is to be twopence a dozen. (3) The maximum price charged for cornsacks sold on credit terms is the prompt net cash price plus interest at 5 per cent, per annum for the period awaiting payment. I wish to point out at this stage that the effect of the foregoing determinations will beto render unprofitable intersacks and woolpacks under the conditions merchant or multiple sales. (4) The maximum price charged for second-hand cornsacks is the cost into store plus fourpence a dozen. (5) The maximum price charged for woolpacks sold by merchants is 4s. 6d. a pack for prompt net cash. The margin allowed to retailers for expenses and commission is not to exceed 2^d. a pack for prompt net cash. Credit sales for woolpacks will be on the same terms as those for cornsacks. In this statement, the definition of "" importers, distributors, merchants, counMinister for Trade and Customs recognize try traders, wheat agent, country agent, country trader and retailer "" is to be, percredit sales would make it quite impossible sons who, in the opinion of the Prices Commissioner, were carrying on business as such prior to the 31st August. In the case of sales of cornsacks or woolpacks made after the 9th September at prices in excess of these determinations, refunds of the excess price charged are to be made to the purchasers. Under the determination made on cornsacks, prices will vary according to the landed cost. The Government expects that importers and distributors will make the low-priced stocks available to their customers in proportion to customers' purchases in some previous representative period. Doubt appears to exist concerning the adequacy of supplies of cornsacks for the forthcoming harvest. The Government is fully informed on the shipments proposed to be made from India to Australia, and I am satisfied that the shipping arrangements that have been made should enable farmers to secure normal supplies. The shipping company concerned with the transport of these sacks from India is making adequate provision. Steps are now being taken to obtain information as to stocks available in the hands of merchants, and the prices at which they have been purchased. I have already had discussions with some members of the trade, and shall be glad to confer with representatives of the trade as a whole, if they so desire, in order to discuss difficulties which may arise in carrying on the trade in cornnow permitted. I would emphasize the desirability of traders continuing to supply these goods to customers as required. The supply of cornsacks and woolpacks is of .such vital national importance that it is imperative that tradersengaged in their supply should make stocks available to users. Should it appear to the Government that stocks are being withheld from sale, the Government will not hesitate to use all of its powers to acquire and distribute them. cash sales allowable to cornsack merchants under the regulations are reasonable, ranging from 2 i to 4 per cent. does..the that a 5 per cent, interest margin for for many farmers to get supplies? Will thp Government provide some method by which such farmers will be able to secure supplies of cornsacks for their coming harvest even if action has to be taken to collect payment through the Australian Wheat Board? profit were fixed, having in mind adequate protection for the. farmers. If 'experience shows the necessity 'to vary these rates, or the terms of sale generally, the Government will gladly reconsider the whole matter.

As to the second part of the question, there is no indication whatever that unemployment will result from the reduction of duties. Very large additional orders are being the Defence Department.

However, I can assure the honourable member that I am anxious that the matter shall be dealt with as soon as possible, and I shall do what I can to bring that about. most important matter upon which every member of the House holds strong opinions.

86,Mr Forde,"If this money wereWe know from the debate that took place last night that a very considerable portion of this money w ill be expended on defence works. We know also that there is a very serious lag in defence expenditure in comparison with the programme for this year. It was proposed to expend £12,000,000 in 1939 at the rate of £1,000,000 a month, but up to the end of August only a little more than £6,000,000 had been expended. During the month of August only £600,000 was expended on defence works. If the lag is due to lack of administrative ability on the part of the Works and Defence departments, it is time that there was an overhaul. 200,000 could take employment of the kind which would be afforded by the defence works of the Commonwealth Government and the reproductive works of the State governments. We cannot go into recess with the feeling that all is well while unemployment statistics continue to grow from month to month. Recently in the Parliament of New South Wales the former Premier( Mr Stevens) criticized the lag in defence expenditure. He saidI do not agree that State money should be spent on works of a defence nature, and for this reason I accept these schedules that is, schedules to the Unemployed Relief TaxB ill and the Social Services Tax Billpurely as provisional schedules. The 50,000 men unemployed in this State are a challenge to our citizenship and a challenge to the instiwe are not children. We know that detutions which have a stake in the country. Mr Stevens went on to criticize seriously the lag of defence expenditure by the Commonwealth. Government at the Premiers Conference said that t h : States must expect a curtailment of loan money because of defence expenditure, but the smaller States cannot hope, in view of experience, to share in defence expenditure to the degree that they would share in expenditure on reproductive or road works. There has been a tendency to concentrate defence expenditure within a radius of 100 miles of the two principal cities of Australia. Lord announced that the Brisbane City Council was faced with the problem of having to dispense with the services of 3.000 men who were engaged on loan works. That sort of thing is a. repercussion of a policy which demands curtailment of reproductive expenditure in order to allow of expenditure on defence works. The Commonwealth has justified the policy by the statement that the unemployed will be absorbed on defence works, but in view of the limited area in which defence money w ill be expended, it knows that that cannot be so. Reproductive works such as water conservation, irrigation, water and sewerage works and certain kinds of road building give employment over a much wider range. In defence expenditure there is a strong tendency to overlook About 150,000 of the the smaller States. M i l it a r y experts have unemployed in Australia said that there is good reason to concentrate defence expenditure in the thicklypopulated States. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth will have to reconsider the attitude expressed in what it said in effect to the States recentlyWe shall have to expend more money on defence this year, and, therefore, you will have to expend a good deal less on works. But the money that we expend on defence will contribute to the provision of employment in the States. Defence work will be as good an employment maker as would be the works programme that you would normally carry out. gentleman quoting from? statements at the Premiers Conference. camera. finite proposals were put up by the Commonwealth Government and we know that the State Premiers did not submit meekly The Commonwealth to the attempt to curtail loan expenditure for ordinary services. The States are faced with the responsibility to keep in employment a large army of men on loan works. It is with some knowledge of the privation and distress that will be experienced by a large number of these unfortunate people that I appeal to the Government to allow as far as is humanly possible the State governments to carry out ordinary loan works and to reThe consider the defence expenditure with a Mayor of Brisbane recently view to spreading it over a wider field.

92,Mr Lazzabini (Werriwa) [11.42j.,"rapidly during tlie last war it was said that that was brought about because the currency of the country was inflated. rapidly now. because of monopolistic control, and not in conformity with the old law that prices are regulated by supply ""and demand. That law has been dynamited long ago by monopolistic control. too many years now the prices of many goods have been fixed, and traders dare not sell below the fixed price for fear of having further supplies cut off. This practice, which was borrowed from America and is spreading all over the world, has grown rapidly during, recent years. It is nonsense to say that prices are an infallible guide as to whether or not there is a shortage of purchasing power. Owing to the exigencies of war the Treasurer has now had placed in his hands an instrument which will enable him to impose a check on rising prices. By the exercise of the powers conferred upon him under the National Security Act, he may impose such a check as long as the war lasts. It will be interesting to see how he uses that power. The Assistant Treasurer specially singled me out as one who wishes to see the currency of this country inflated to the limit. of having said that. gentleman said that, with me, the sky was the limit. rhetorical statement. I have advocated a reform of the monetary and banking system of this country. I challenge any honourable member to point out in Hansard one word which would justify the cliarge levelled against me by the Assistant Treasurer. honourable gentleman talks about national inflation by the Government. He strains at the gnat of a safe issue of credit by the Commonwealth Bank for national purposes, but opens wide his mouth to swallow the huge inflation of private banking institutions of this country without fluttering an eyelid. So that the honourable gentleman may be in no doubt as to what I mean I propose to give him some indication of what the private banking institutions do to-day in the way of inflation. I quote from the Commonwealth Year-Booh No. 31 of 1938, pages 830 to 836. According to the ¥ earBook, the total legal currency held by the associated banks in this country is £31,500,000. On that legal currency the private banks issued spurious faked currency, which permeated right throughFor out the channels of our economic life, to the value of £2,584,730,000. Yet the Government proposes to make no effort to check this wholesale inflation by the private banking interests. It has no control over them. The Assistant Treasurer talks of the £1 note. Why, the merest neophyte knows to-day that the £1 note and the legal currency of this country do not represent 1 per cent, of the used purchasing power of this country. This is a phase of the monetary system about which the honourable gentleman and his supporters are silent, because they know that when the nation realizes the way the private banking institutions are faking the currency of the. country, it will force upon the Government a reform of the whole banking and monetary system. Sir Herbert Holden, one of the most eminent bank authorities in Great Britain, in a lecture to students at Oxford, saidam not conscious What brought about tlie depression ? Everybody knows that the depression was caused by bankers the world over in following up their time old policy of calling up overdrafts and refusing advances. That is the statement of one of the was merely a most eminent bankers in the world. It is not mine. On a legal currency of £31,500,000 the private banking institutions in Australia to-day pyramid credit by way of overdrafts and advances to the value of £308,041,359. They have only £31,500,000 to meet the current accounts of depositors available at call amounting The to £122,538,549, and fixed deposits amounting to £205,242,072. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), a former "" tragic treasurer "" admitted in his budget speech in 1925 that the bankers loaned out 17s. for every £1 held in current accounts, and received interest for it.

I cite these figures because they precede some proposals 1 wish to put to the Government with regard to what can be safely done to rectify the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. The soundness of Labour's proposals to rectify the faults of our monetary system cannot be challenged. All we say is that we should utilize our national institution, the Commonwealth Bank, to prevent the exploitation of the people and the imposition upon them of this burden of debt to the private banking institutions. To-day, the national debt stands at £1,300,000,000, and it is steadily secure its stability. growing. Interest On this huge debt has to be paid annually to the money lenders, and every twenty years the interest payments equal the f u l l amount of bhe debt. We have to face this problem and devise means of overcoming it . When honourable members opposite speak about bank credit, I wonder whether they realize what they are saying. The banks have no credit; they operate on the people's credit. Only the other day pointed attention was drawn to the deplorable plight of the wheat-farmers because of their staggering debt structure amounting to £160,000,000. The wheat industry today is bankrupt, not because of high wages and low prices, but because of the huge levy exacted fro m it by the banking institutions. When a farmer who owns freehold property of an unimproved value of, say, £5,000, goes to his bank to obtain credit because of a bad season or because a fire has consumed his crop, or, perhaps, to buy new machinery, what happens, under the present system? He asks for an overdraft, and the bank accepts as security property valued at £5,000 for an overdraft of £1,500. Yet some stupid individuals will say that the banker gave hi m credit when, in effect, the bank really charges him 5 per cent. the Commonwealth Yearor6 per cent, for the use of his own money. Let us suppose that at this time we proposed to make a heavy minting .. 122,538,549 of gold currency. Supposing I had £500 205,242,072 worth of gold in my safe, but no credit 308,041,359 in the bank. All I need to do is to open my safe and take the gold to a government institution, which would give me £500 with which to pay my debts. But what about the man whose wealth is tied up in primary production, which is more valuable than gold ? He cannot sell his crop, and if he goes along to a. banker to raise money on it he is compelled to pay an exorbitant rate of interest for the accommodation. Farmers and all others who are engaged in production should be able to go to a national institution like the Commonwealth Bank and obtain a safe advance without interest against a portion of their assets, the only charge made to them being 1 per cent, to assist towards the cost of running the, institution and to make provision for a reserve in order to No economist or banker in the world can successfully challenge the soundness of that statement. That is the approach which I make to this matter. There is one other matter that should be cleared up. When a nation borrows money, what security is there behind it? Some persons who think only in a shallow fashion would say, "" The whole of the wealth of A u s t r a l i a "" . That, too, is a statement which will not bear a moment's analysis. If any one were to tell the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the shipping companies, the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, the coal barons, and the Hordern-Baillieu group, that, their wealth is behind the national debt, they would send for the "" black maria "" and put h i m in a padded cell in a lunatic asylum. The only thing behind any loan is the annual wealth production of Australia, which can be so taxed as to draw off a certain amount to pay the annual interest accruing on the debt. Nothing else stands behind the national debt. The Labour party says that the security behind figures written in the book is as good as the same security behind figures written on a piece of paper called a bond. If the Assistant Treasurer accepts, even tentatively, that part of what I have said, I invite him to challenge in this House, or on the platform in any electorate, my specific, definite statement that for constructive wealth production the Commonwealth Bank could safely advance to the Commonwealth, on behalf of Australia unlimited, an overdraft of £50,000,000. admits that that cannot be done for war purposes. frankly, and have always done so. It is the obligation of the Government to keep this country at a high pitch of development, as well as to train soldiers. Where did Germany find itself during the last war, when its internal economy crashed to pieces? knows that that was one of the most efficient and immediate causes which brought, about the termination of the war. many had nothing to do with finance; a shortage of foodstuffs was the cause. stuffs implies the collapse of the internal economy. blockade had something to do with it. Does the honourable gentleman's answer to my question imply that we could have wholesale unemployment and that, so long as the war continued, we should merely have to train soldiers?. Does the honourable gentleman consider it to be his obligation as a Minister to keep his country at a high pitch of development during the war? The honourable gentleman has side-tracked that question. rnember asked me that question, I said "" Yes "". Commonwealth Bank can safely carry Australia unlimited with an overdraft of £50,000,000. That £50,000,000 could be used for the standardization of our railway gauges, sewerage systems, water conservation and irrigation, slum clearance, and the provision of proper housing for the people, and any other works that are essential and needful for Australia to-day. destroy. I believe that if, when man The process is a simple one. works were initiated, cheques could be drawn on the Commonwealth Bank, and that institution would carry the obligation against Australia as a purely business proposition. The usual practice is to float a loan and pay an interest rate of anything from 2 | per cent, to 6 per cent. This development would provide employment for our youths, and keep money circulating. The national wealth would be enhanced. Instead of paying an interest rate of -5 per cent., either to the bank or to money lenders, which in twenty years would be equal to the amount of the principal and still leave the principal admit, it unpaid, that £50,000,000 would be liquidated in twenty years, and if it were necessary to undertake other works which would improve the national economy, a further £50,000,000 could be issued.

The Commonwealth Bank would automatically issue and The honourable gentleman destroy £50,000,000 worth of paper money every year after the first twenty years had been negotiated.

111,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs),"essential. Our resources must be considered from tbe point of view of tbe aggregate resources of tbe Commonwealth and the States. Whilst we must bear in mind that the Government is budgeting for an expenditure in excess of £100,000,000, we must also remember that the citizens of the Commonwealth are required to provide vast sums for expenditure by State governments and semi-government authorities. The Treasurer ( Mr Menzies) observed when submitting the budget that his first essay of this nature was a record for the Commonwealth. It took the Chancellor of the British Exchequer many years to reach the record expenditure figure of £1,000,000,000 represented in the capital expenditure to be provided from budget which he submitted to the House of Commons last March. That is an enormous disbursement. When we throw the searchlight of inquiry upon the aggregate expenditure of the Commonwealth and the States budgets for the current financial year, we find that it represents for us the colossal sum of £240,000,000. This vast amount has to be provided by oneseventh of the population which finds the £1,000,000,000 to be expended by the Government of the United Kingdom. The financial responsibilities of the people of truly capital nature. Therefore, I subthe Commonwealth are, therefore, enormous. I know that any comparison of that description must 'be made with reserbuoyancy of the revenue of the Postvations, but the figures at least' suggest the very definite need for the exercise of the unpopular virtue of economy. Quite apart from the indispensable provision required for defence purposes, we must face the fact that the expenditure of governments and semi-government and local government authorities in the Commonwealth' is mounting year by year. There must be a national stocktaking in order to ensure that the requirements of strict economy are observed. Every factor must be brought under review so that we may be certain that no waste of resources is being permitted. Whilst no obstacles must be permitted to hinder the Government making every possible provision for our participation in this unfortunate war, at the same time we must husband our resources most carefully. This budget provides for increases of taxation which the public must necessarily suffer in order to provide for our Mr Fadden. huge defence expenditure, but I urge that all other expenditure shall be reduced to the least possible compass consistent with our vital needs. Undoubtedly a great deal of unnecessary expenditure is. being incurred. In this connection, I contrast Commonwealth and State policies in respect of capital outlay. The Commonwealth Government is providing this year for and local government 50 per cent, of the capital expenditure of the Postmaster-General's Department to be provided out of loan funds and 50 per cent, out of revenue. Hitherto, for some years past, the buoyant revenues of the Postmaster-General's Department have made it possible for 100 per cent, of its revenue. This has meant that the Commonwealth Government, to this degree, at any rate, has been able to avoid any participation in the allocation of loan moneys. The State authorities, however, have constructed practically all of their capital works out of loan funds. In this regard it seems to me that the policy of the Commonwealth Government has had an unwise effect. Many of the State works on which loan funds have been expended can scarcely be regarded as of a mit that -a most careful survey should be made of the whole situation. The master-General's Department has enabled it to expend approximately £25,000,000 on capital works from revenue. This also contributed to the heavy State expenditure from loans, some of which, in my opinion, was of an unwise character. Capital expenditure from revenue, which really constitutes a secret reserve, should be carefully considered in order to avoid placing any undue strain upon the general public. It. cannot be denied that our people are feeling the burden of both direct and indirect taxation. We should be using the surplus revenue to relieve taxation. I hope, on a subsequent occasion, to have something to say about our sinking fund provision in comparison with a. capital expenditure from revenue of £25,000,000 by tlie Postmaster General's Department. I do not propose, at this stage, to traverse the. various taxing measures which the Government has foreshadowed, for whilst I do not agree with all the methods that are being employed, and fear that some of them w ill result inequitably, no good purpose would be served at the moment by canvassing the position. It is regrettable that in spite of its huge expenditure from revenue on works of a capital nature, the Postmaster General's Department should have failed to supply some very necessary services in country districts. strong protest against the untimely expenditure, in my opinion, of £1,250,000 on additions to the General Post Office, Sydney. While we are considering ways and means of reducing the danger of the bombing of the Sydney General Post Office, it seems extraordinary that we .should be proposing to spend this vast, sum upon additions to the building, particularly at a time when heavy extra taxation is being imposed upon the people for war purposes. Honourable members will recognize the justice of my antagonism to this project when I point out that when representations were made to the Postmaster-Generalf or the provision of an adequate post office building in the prosperous town of Rosewood, in my electorate, to replace the present structure, which has served this prosperous community since pre-federation days, the only proposition that was suggested was the removal to Rosewood of a post office building which has recently been erected at Action of that kind does not suggest economy, for the building proposed to be removed could very efficiently be adapted for the purposes of a rural automatic telephone exchange, to which the people in the neighbourhood of Marburg are justly entitled. The present Rosewood post office, which is practically a cottage building, is in a very dilapidated state and it should be replaced by a building adequate for the service that the taxpayers in that locality are entitled to receive. In view of the need for us to use our resources to tlie utmost in the prosecution of the war, I wish to direct attention to some figures which make a comparison of our circumstances now with those of 1914 when the last war occurred. The population of Australia in 1914 was 4^900,000; to-day it is nearly 7,000,000, the increase being 43 per cent. Our overseas commerce, inward and outward, was valued at £125,000,000 in round figures in 1914; to-day its value is more than double that vast sum. The area we had under crop in 1914 was 14,700,000 acres; the area under crop to-day is 22,000,000 acres. Our agricultural production has increased by two and a half times in the 25 years. We are now proI make a. ducing double the quantity of wheat and treble the quantity of sugar that we grew in 1914. The number of our cattle has increased in the 25 years from 11,000,000 to 14,000,000 and the number of sheep from 82,500,000 to 110,000,000. Our wool clip in 1914 totalled 734,000,000 l b ; last year it totalled 1,000,000,000 lb. All classes of manufactured products show substantially increased figures now compared with those for 1914. For example, the value added to raw materials through processing in our factories has advanced fro m £59,000,000 to £188,000,000. That figure is for the financial year 1937-38, and is-the latest available. All classes of industrial production show substantial increases, the aggregate having advanced from £213,552,000 in 1914 to £486,914,000 in 1939. The improvement is thus, £273,362,000, or 130 per cent. The gain per head of the population is £27. Our savings bank deposits have increased from £90,000,000 in 1914 to £245,000,000 in 1939, the amount per head of the populaMarburg, some miles distant. tion having advanced from £18 10s. to £35. It must be admitted, unfortunately, that effective or real wages have not improved to anything like the same degree. Statistics show that, during the last war from 1914-18, wages did not advance in conformity with other factors. That brings me to the need for taking action to ensure that we do not fall into the mistakes made during the last war. I am wholly in favour of dealing drastically with profiteers. Every precaution should be taken to check their activities in order to ensure that the cost of living to the family man who, in the final analysis, must pay largely for war, does not become unduly high. Everything should be done to preserve the standard of living of the people. There is more involved in this war than the defence of the actual territory of Australia. We have to defend also our ideals of justice, our liberties and our democracy. Consideration of the mistakes of the last war prompts me to make an appeal for justice on behalf of the German-Australian citizens iu my electorate. The Darling Downs were opened up and developed by men and women who came from other lands, particularly from Germany and Denmark. They came here with broad axes and big hearts, and by their unremitting industry carved out homes for themselves. They have assisted in the development of Australia, and the progress to which I have referred has been made possible largely by the industry and good citizenship of people like them. I ask that we shall not repeat the mistake of changing the names of towns because those names were of German origin. The names of little towns should not be changed unless there is evidence of disloyalty among the inhabitants. I would not, of course, condone anything of that sort, but that is a matter that can be dealt with under the law. During the last war, the names of several settlements of German-Australians were changed. For instance Minden was changed to Fiienchton, Marburg to Townsend and Kirckheim to Haigslea. After the war the German names were restored with the exception of Kirckheim. German-Australians stated they did not wish the old name to be restored, because they desired to honour that great leader, General Haig, after whom the place had been renamed. In view of what has transpired in the international sphere, we must regard ourselves as very fortunate, indeed, that national insurance was not inflicted on the people. Those of us who strenuously opposed the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill, and were to some extent responsible for the subsequent abandonment of the scheme, have done the country a good service. It would be a very serious matter if it were necessary now for the Treasury to raise another £2,000,000 additional taxation for national insurance. There are four methods by which the Government may finance the .war-taxation, borrowing, utilization of the profits of governmental undertakings such as the post office, and the extension of credit. I Mr Fadden. maintain that, before the war has been in progress very long, all these methods will, in some determined proportion, be in use. I do not propose to discuss the general principle of credit extension, but the Government should, with the assistance of qualified persons, make a proper survey of the position in order to see to what extent this method of finance may be employed. To the extent that it is used increased taxation may be avoided, for high taxation must necessarily bring about dislocation of industry. It is an unavoidable overhead expense that is reflected in the industrial life of the community. We should be very careful before agreeing to the imposition of high taxes, especially if there is a prospect that our exports may decline in quantity and value. I hope that the Government will be jealous of the interests of Australian producers whose interests should be safeguarded in negotiations with the Government of Great Britain regarding the disposal of our products. No attempt, of course, should be made to obtain unfair profits, but we should recognize that we owe a duty to Australia first. The first consideration is to keep our industries .in operation. I trust that a spirit of tolerance and There the fair play will be manifested in the administration of the National Security Act. Above all, I-hope that humiliation will not be inflicted on loyal citizens of this country who happen to be of German descent. They are in no way responsible for the war, and are just as opposed as we are to those responsible for it. They are in all respects desirable citizens, who were prepared to go into the country districts, thus assisting in the decentralization of population, and in the production of real wealth. The figures which I have cited covering the development of Australia during the last 25 years give a picture of national progress relatively greater than that achieved by any other country. They show that we have a great deal worth fighting for, that we must develop an Australian outlook, that we must place Australia first, and that we are justified in regarding Australia as a bulwark of democracy, and the gem of the southern seas. We should shrink at no sacrifice necessary for its defence. [12.43] -In part 3 of the schedule there is a sub-division d under the heading of Territories of the Commonwealth, which refers to developmental services, and I should like to know from the Minister what it is proposed to do in this way. For the last five years I have been trying to induce the Government to embark upon an active policy of development for the Northern Territory, and I thought that at last I had succeeded. Now, however, I am amazed to see that only £13,900 has been provided for developmental services. This Government, and the previous Government, went to a great deal of expense to have an economic survey made of the territory and the money expended in that way will have been more or less wasted unless the survey is followed up by developmental work This proposed vote is a gratuitous insult to Messrs. Payne and Fletcher, who prepared the report, and to the previous Minister for the Interior, the honourable member for Indi for the active development of the territory, and was about to apply it when he vacated office. I shall have an opportunity to explain in my own electorate why that programme has not been gone on with, but the honourable member for Indi will have no such opportunity. In accordance with the recommendation of the Payne report, a lands officer, a very capable man, was appointed to Alice Springs. ""When I was 'there in March last, this officer was champing at the bit because no money had been placed at his disposal with which to assist settlement.. I had been assured by the present Minister for the Interior (Senator; Foil) that some tens of thousands of pounds would be made available with which to establish dumps of wire and posts for the subdivision of cattle country into areas suitthe blue pencil was being put through able for the running of sheep.

Wondering how Tennant what was embodied in his reportI perCreek would fare under this budget, a haps shall never know-hu t I presume few days ago, I wired the warden, Mr that his recommendations have been emasculated. The people take notice of deeds more than words, and no doubt their criticism of this Government will be caustic, in view of the fact that the former Minister for the Interior, who promised them so much, was allowed to do so little, and in view of the meagre amount that has been placed on the Estimates for developmental services in the territory. * ""What does the amount of £13,900 for developmental works mean? The small settlers in Central Australia were looking forward to a new era. They had reason to do so when after four years' representation by me a very highlyqualified man was appointed as lands officer. But that officer feels that he has been let down. He was intrigued to accept the position and to do so left a high post in New South ""Wales. Naturally, as he is an official, I have not been in communication with him, but I feel that he must be squirming under the injustices from which I am told he is suffering. I ask the Treasurer ( Mr Menzies) to review this and to see if a worthwhile amount of money cannot be spent on a developmental policy in the north, so that we may retain this officer. Good officers cannot be retained for long if they have not the money with which to express themselves in a real developmental policy. Interior should live up there for a good part of the year. is a misnomer to call him the "" Minister for the Interior"", and the department "" the Department for the Interior "".

There is a former Minister for the Interior, the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) seated in front of me now. He knows all about it. Nevertheless, there are some . places that they do not see, Hatchett's Creek, for instance. That is a barbaric place, with the look of a fowlshed. The amenities of life at Tennant Creek in the main street are not consistent with the conditions a few miles south off the main road. When the honourable member for Indi was Minister for the Interior, a road train was instituted in the Northern Territory. It was imported from South Africa for military purposes in the Northern Territory, and it was intended to solve the transport problem. I have consulted my constituents, large and small land-owners, and they would all prefer, instead of this road train, which goes through the district only once every three or four months, diesel trucks, because they know that they would get thereby a more frequent service. I do not decry what was done by the honourable member for In d i ; I congratulate him for trying to do what he was not allowed to do, and repeat my belief that his proposals were emasculated in the Cabinet room. When that road train is outworn, as it must almost be, I recommend that it be replaced by diesel trucks. Because the Government has refused to subsidize the small boats from Darwin to these areas, and has confined transport development to the provision of road trains, people living in the far northern areas around the Gulf of Carpentaria, at Surely there are more cogent Booraloola, in the Kimberleys, and in the Victoria River district, are obliged to take in stocks of flour, sufficient to last for periods up to six months.

I have dealt with that Proceeding further in an attempt tu elucidate the purposes of this grant of £13,900, I realize ithat the money could not possibly be for use in connection with the geophysical survey. As the Government has already spent £150,000 on such a survey, a sum so small as £13,900 would make no appreciable difference and would not last long with this spendthrift government.

Queensland has no less than 24 field stations, and the Government of that State has had the wisdom to send officers to Singapore, and other tropical centres, for trainduring my term of office as member for ing. Such was the case with Dr. Kerr, who is one of the hest qualified agriculturists in Australia. Queensland also trains field experts at its own agricultural station. Government cannot devise its own schemes, surely it can follow the example set by the Queensland Government. The agricultural problems of the Northern Territory are even greater than those of Queensland. I am hopeful that a comprehensive scheme for the agricultural development of the Northern Territory will be introduced, and that a superintendent of agriculture will be brought from New Guinea, where there are many highly qualified officers with a thorough knowledge of tropical agriculture. I am waiting to see if an interest is to be taken in the growing of cotton, in the Katherine River district. been sent up there by boat. Government officers so humbugged and delayed this matter that, without waiting for government action, the seed has been sent to the farmers, who will endeavour to grow cotton in spite of what the attitude of this Government may be. I appeal to the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior to see if some assistance canout and cut the timber and pay for haulnot be given by the Government to the cotton industry in the Northern Territory in the same way as assistance has been given in Queensland. All that is required is a one-strand ginning plant at Darwin. No attempt has been made to utilize the vast potentialities of the Katherine River. There is an ample supply of cheap diesel oil in Darwin. at the paltry price of 4d. a gallon, and if they take it outside the 3-mile limit they get it for about Id. a gallon. The establishment of diesel engine plants along the Katherine River would greatly facilitate the cotton, induswe desire to keep our men in employment. try there. Possibly that is what the Minister has in mind in making available £13,900 under this bill, or perhaps Mr Plain. he merely intends to send an anthropologist to Arnhem Land, or has some other equally crazy idea. Reference is also made in this bill to forests. I am particularly interested in forestry, and I have delivered two speeches in this House on that subject the Northern Territory. The sum provided for forestry under this bill is £2,270, which, in my opinion, is far too little, and quite insufficient to carry out If the Commonwealth the work which the forestry department is expected to do. That department carries out a considerable amount of research work, and acts in an advisory capacity to the State Forestry Bureau. I am particularly interested in the work of the Australian Forestry School at Canberra, and I should like to see its activities not only continued, but also considerably expanded. I ask the Minister to give special attention to the timber industry, because hitherto the Commonwealth's policy in regard to timber has, in effect, merely been that when too little is imported too much is cut in Australia. The seed has already I ask tlie Minister for Trade and Customs to make a searching survey of our stocks of all the hardwood timbers held in the capital cities. There are large stocks of second-class timbers in the various capital cities, which, because of some flaw, cannot be classified as first class, but which, I contend, could be successfully used for building purposes. It seems a pity that timber men should go ing it to the cities only to find that a building contractor has the right to veto it if, in his opinion, it is not of first-class quality. I have examined in Sydney numerous stacks of really good timber classed as second-class merely because it has a small sappy vein running through it. In view of the ruthless depletion of our forests we should make' a very careful It is sold to the pearlers survey of all stocks of hardwood throughout Australia, particularly in the capital cities, with a view to inducing contractors to use second-class timber in specified areas. ""We import timber in order to preserve our forests and, at the same time, The question that confronts us is how to strike a balance. We should ask our forestry experts to devise a scheme whereby all buildings should contain certain proportions of imported wood and Australian hardwood. That is only reasonable. I suggest that the proportion of imported timber should he made as low as possible and also that second-class timon the National Security Act and the ber should be used where possible. 1 know that there are a number of people who say that we must have oregon for certain building purposes; I am inclined to agree with them; but at the same time. I suggest that the importation of oregon should be limited to bare requirements. We should do everything to keep our men in employment, and at the same time preserve our forests in perpetuity for the nation. desire to bring to the notice of the Parliament a matter which I consider to be of great importance to the members of the Opposition and to workers generally throughout the Commonwealth. This matter has been brought to my notice only within the last few hours. It is regrettable that, in the closing hours of these sittings, we should find that the Government is beginning to use its powers under the National Security Act to suppress freedom of expression. Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the members of the Government when dealing with the National Security Act said that the Government would administer the regulations made under it in such a way as to cause as little friction as possible among the people of this country. Honourable members supporting the Government argued that these powers were necessary because we were in a state of war, and that the Government should take to itself full and complete powers. One of the powers which the Government took to itself under the authority of the National Security Aot was the right to exercise a strict censorship over the disinvoked by it in a compaign against the semination of news throughout the Commonwealth. It can be argued with a certain amount of reason that it would be a. reasonable exercise of this power to prevent the dissemination of news likely to be of advantage to some nation with which this country is at war; but we find that the Government has already availed itself prevent the free expression of opinion of political organizations opposed to it. That is a very serious matter. The Miners Federation publishes an official organ know as The Common Cause. In a contributed article emergency regulations, the editors of that journal have come into conflict with the authorities, not because of violent language used in the article, but simply because it contained statements that the Menzies Government is a minority government and that Labour unions and the Labour movement generally should organize to bring about its defeat at the earliest possible moment, and that the Labour movement should resist the operation of any of the regulations which infringed their civil liberties. Nobody would suggest that statements such as these would be of any assistance to an enemy of this' country. This is one of the passages which was excised from the article by the direction of the censorThe united efforts of the Labour movement must be directed towards the defeat of the minority Menzies Government, and the return of a Labour Government which would have the interests of the Australian workers at heart. It will thus be seen ithat already we have The evidence as to what is likely to happen by the abuse of emergency powers granted to the Government. This instance supports the fears expressed by honourable members on this side of the House when the National Security Bill was under discussion. Next year we will be faced with an election and honourable members on this side of the House through their various journals will be claiming that the Menzies Government is a minority government, and urging the electors not to return the Menzies Government because of its many political sins. No doubt the powers conferred upon the Government under the emergency legislation will be Labour movement to prevent Labour spokesmen from presenting their side of the argument. The Prime Minister, speaking with regard to the necessity for protecting the democratic rights of the people, said that the people should have the right of free speech and expressions through their various newsof this power to papers and journals. Here is evidence, at a time when this Parliament is about",33,Supplybill N O 2 1939 40 Second Reading
127,Mr Wabd (East Sydney) [2.33],"Ito go into recess, of the excess to which the Government may go under the powers conferred upon it only recently. It is well to remind honourable members what may happen if these powers are not wisely and justly used. We all know what happened during the' last war. when the Government was given similar powers under the War Precautions Act. It will be remembered that twelve members of the Industrial Workers of the World were arrested and thrown into prison during the height of the conscription campaign. They were not immediately charged before a court because that did not suit the Government's purpose; it wanted* to get as much political capital out of the circumstances as was possible. When the men were 'finally brought to trial and the charges of the prosecution were laid, the whole of the evidence for the prosecution was taken, and then the cases were adjourned until after the conscription referendum had been taken. The government of the day abused its powers under the War Precautions Aot, just as this Government is already commencing to abuse the powers granted to it under the National Security Act. Ever since the Government first announced its new defence plans at the' outbreak of war, it has made appeal after appeal to the Opposition not to do anything which might be considered to be critical of its actions It has constantly adjured the Opposition to support its actions in the national interests, saying that only by unity in the Parliament could the war be waged to a. successful conclusion. I say to the members of the Opposition that, if they are not very careful, they will see brought into being in this things against which they are asked to fight. We know that in Germany"" political and industrial organizations have been suppressed. commencement of a similar paign of oppression in this country. The Government first of all commenced by asking the Labour party to join it in the formation of a national government. That appeal was made in order to endeavour to prevent any criticism of its present or past activities. failed to secure that measure of co-operation from the Opposition, it began to use Mr Ward. the powers conferred upon it by the National Security Act to prevent the free expression of Labour opinion in this community. I ask honourable members of the Opposition to consider what is likely to happen to them in the near future if this sort of thing is allowed to go on unchecked. Each one of us will be returning to his electorate within a few hours and with an election looming on the horizon next year will place before the people his views regarding the sins committed against the interests of the people of this country by the Government. No doubt if we do so we shall expose ourselves to a great deal of personal risk, and if anj' of the journals under our control publish statements derogatory of the Government, this unscrupulous Government will swoop down upon them. 1 enter my emphatic protest against what has happened in the case of the excision of what I regard as fair comment from The Common Cause. I ask the Assistant Minister( Mr Holt) whether this action was taken by the censor at the instigation of the Government, and, if not, to give an immediate assurance that there will be no repetition of this sort of thing and, further, to take appropriate action to see that no steps are taken either by the censor or by the Government to suppress freedom of thought and freedom of speech in this country. That is a principle for which the Labo'ur party is prepared to fight and to take whatever risks are necessary to maintain despite what, regulations are made. We regard it an inherent right, of the people of this country. If the Government continues this policy it may rest assured that it will have in this Parliament, and out of it,, country the very the sternest opposition from the members of the Labour party. This is the mind, in common with that of other camhonorable members, is exercised in regard to the administration of the different departments, the paramount one being the Defence Department, of which I have complained in days gone by. It is pleasing to find that considerable advancement has been made in the organization When the Government of that very important department. It is not many months since I referred in this House to the lack of co-ordination",35,Supplybill N O 2 1939 40 Second Reading
128,Mr Collins (Hume) [2.45],"M yand co-operation in the various branches of the Defence Department, without which complete harmony and correct administration cannot be assured. I had occasion to draw attention to the fact that the Minister was issuing one statement and departmental officers definitely opposite statements. This condition of affairs existed also in connection with works. I blame, not Ministers, but the lack of administrative capacity and co-ordination in the different branches. I drew attention to the fact that the Minister for Defence( Mr Street) had told me one thing in connection with the proposed formation of infantry units in certain towns and that, upon inquiry, I had found that the direct opposite was the ,case. The Works Minister advised me that certain promised works had been carried out, and when I made inquiries and inspections I found that that was not the case. Under the present Administration, a very pleasant state of affairs exists. report issued by the Minister for the Interior (Senator Foll) in connection with works that are needed to meet the urgent requirements of the Defence Department and other departments. I am sure that the present efficiency in the departments is welcomed by honourable members as well as by the people of Australia generally. This report readsA staff of architects, two of whom are very senior in the Service, has been established in the Defence Department at Melbourne. These officers are assisting the defence officers in the preliminary preparation of plans. Their presence in the Defence Department has eliminated all correspondence between Canberra'njicl Melbourne in regard to details, and has resulted in a considerable saving of time. Preliminary plans are now received in tlie central office in Canberra in such a state that the working drawings and specifications can bo proceeded with at once. The fullest possible measure of co-operation has now been established between the Defence Department and the Department of the Interior to the advantage of both. The Works Director, Melbourne, is also working in close liaison with the Defence Department. In the other States, the Works Directors are in close touch with the military authorities and as a result defence works have been greatly speedcrl up. In the central office in Canberra, administrative staff, which it was found possible to release from the Immigration Branch of the Department, has, with the approval of the Public Service Board, been allocated for duty with the Works Branch. This has considerably relieved the pressure on the administrative staff and has resulted in the expeditious handling of works requisitions, contracts, &c. The staff of the Surveyor-General ancl Chief Property Officer has also been increased to meet the heavy demands for the acquisition of land for Government purposes. A t the close of the last financial year, works to a total of £4,558,515 were authorized, of which approximately £3,200,000 will be carried out this year. Since the 1st July last, an amount of £322,402. in addition to the sum previously mentioned, has been authorized. It is estimated Chat the amount of work that will be authorized this financial year w ill be £8,000,000, of which it is expected £5,000,000 will be completed at the end of the financial year. In June last the Government appointed a panel to advise the Commonwealth on matters relating to the execution of defence works. The members of this panel consist of Sir Archibald Howie, Mr T. R. Hall and Mr. A. G-. Gutteridge. These gentlemen, whose services have been made available to the Government in a purely honorary capacity, have thoroughly investigated the defence works in hand and contemI have received a copy of a plated in each State, and have furnished recommendations to the Government which must lead to earlier completion of the works programme. Earlyi n August last the members of the panel took the opportunity of meeting thr> Commonwealth Works Directors from each State and not only discussed the programme but also investigated the problems and difficulties associated with the execution of works, particularly in distant localities such as Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Since the appointment of the panel a keen desire to be of assistance has been evinced by the Master Builders' Associations throughout Australia, and those connected with the building industry. Immediately on the outbreak of war, the provisions of the Commonwealth War Book in relation to works were put into operation. The value of the careful consideration given to this matter during peace time has resulted in a complete absence of confusion and the expeditious execution of the pre-arranged plans. The Minister added that he was delighted to be in the position of stating that the Works Branch of his Department is now working smoothly, efficiently and expeditiously, and that complete liaison had been established with the departments, particularly the Department of Defence, for whom the works are being carried out. I need only mention that on one occasion the Defence Department made a request in the morning for certain urgent works to be carried out, and that-evening all arrangements were completed for a contractor to begin them immediately. The present Minister is partly responsible for the improvement that has taken place; but it is due also to the wisdom of the people in desiring to see that complete co-operation exists between the departments and private enterprise which is offering its services in an honorary -capacity for the purpose of carrying out work that is so essential to the satisfactory and successful prosecution of the war into which this nation has entered. Another matter to which I desire to refer has already been eloquently dealt with by the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Padden). For a long time. I have complained of the failure of the Postmaster-General's Department to provide adequate services in country districts. I have made representations on behalf of various country centres, and an almost pauperized state of the finances has been the excuse for failure to carry out essential works. I had the privilege of visiting a small village in the electorate of Darling Downs, in which I saw three telegraph poles standing in the street about ten feet from the pavement. Prom time to time representations have been made for their removal, but the department could not decide whether it would be less expensive to remove them than to remove the town. Apparently it has decided to take no action, and they are still standing on the highway. fairness to the civic pride of the people of that town, those posts should be removed. I have applied for favorable consideration to be given to requests for new post offices, trict. The development of the country alterations to existing post offices, and other improvements in country centres, but promises are all that I have received. The fullest consideration should be given to the provision of post offices and other services for the benefit of those who are providing the revenue of the department. Compare the case referred to by the honourable member for Darling Downs with the improvements and additions that are being made to the General Post Office-in Sydney. I make no complaint in respect of those additions and the provision of greater facilities for the staff at Sydney General Post Office, provided that similar privileges are extended to their fellow employees in country towns who do exactly the same important work but under far less favorable conditions. I object to the Mr Collins. excuse of poverty being advanced whenever representations are made to the department for services of this kind. For the last five years I have appealed to the Government to provide a post office at a small town named Walla Walla in my electorate. The ex-Postmaster General, now Leader of the Country party ( Mr Archie Cameron) visited that town with me, and expressed the opinion that the existing post office and residence were in an absolutely appalling condition, and that the prevailing conditions at many other places could be described only in similar terms. The present Postmaster-General( Mr Harrison) also paid a visit to that town, and knows full well how essential it is that a new post office should be erected. .The department quibbles over small matters, such as the payment of a. rental of f l a week. Where civic pride leads people to put their towns in order, the Government should at least provide decent post offices, and residences for their employees. I am sure that the Postmaster-^Genera! is sympathetically inclined towards the request that I am now making. The exPostmaster-General was so disturbed when he examined the position that he said to me "" I promise you definitely that if I am Postmaster-General next financial year that post office will be built"". I look to the present Postmaster-General In tp redeem, that promise of his predecessor, in the interest of those who are doing their share towards the advancement, and development of this country disadds materially to the progress of the city and the nation generally. In one town where there is adequate space for the erection of a new post office, the present building is so antiquated that there is not sufficient room for the servants of the department to do their work efficiently and under comfortable conditions. The mailmen, who have to carry mails into the country, are obliged to kneel down in the yard under bags in wet weather to do the sorting. I hope that the conditions wilPbe improved in the future. Temporary linemen who have been employed for some considerable time are being dismissed when the interests of the nation would be promoted, and the business of the department would be more . efficiently conducted, if their services were regular and adequulu supplies of oils' of retained, instead of being dispensed with because they may qualify for permanent appointment. Another matter to which I feel I should direct attention is the preparation that is being made by the major oil companies for adequate supplies of oil fuel in Australia. While time is yet available to them, they are securing as much as possible for storage in Australia. occasion some time ago to examine the position. I then found that Australia is rich in most of the raw materials, but is sadly lacking in the discovery of oil. The Government has done its part in providi n g money for 'operations designed to locate sources of oil supply, but so far no wells have been discovered to which we can look to meet our requirements. The latest figures issued last year show that about 300,000,000 gallons of motor spirit and 14,000,000 gallons of lubricating oils are used annually in Australia. With the exception of a very small quantity, this is imported from overseas. It is not generally known that the bulk of our oil supplies is obtained from the Netherlands East Indies, which are about sixteen days from Sydney by steamer, and, of course, closer to our northern ports. The use of oils and petrols is of extreme importance to Australia at any time, but particularly so in war-time. I hardly need to remind honourable members of the extent to which these fuels are used to-day in mechanized units on farms. Tractors have to a very large degree displaced horses in field operations, and we know very well that the old farm waggon has practically disappeared, together with the spring dray. This has meant that draught horses, as well as horses of lighter types, are relatively scarce on our farms. Years ago, quite a substantial proportion of the farmer's operations were designed to provide fodder for his stock; but those days have gone. Petrol and crude oils are used nowadays to the almost complete exclusion of horses. I do not suggest that there is anything wrong with that policy; it is merely in accordance with the trend of the times; but the point serves to illustrate the urgent, necessity to ensure C301 various kinds. To this end, the Government should be using every endeavour to discover any possible supplies of oil in Australia. Now that we are using motor lorries and trucks in place of the old waggons, we must ensure that petrol is available to drive them. If , by any unhappy circumstances, our oil supplies should disappear, we should certainly not I took have sufficient horses in this country to maintain our agricultural operations. This would be exceedingly serious. I therefore reiterate that the Government should do its utmost to examine all possible natural supplies of o i l . Another matter that should receive the closest attention is the reserving of adequate supplies of wool. I have been interested in this subject for a long while. On the 4th A p r i l, 1938, I wrote to the late Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) on the subject in the following terms:Having regard to Great Britain's defence policy and the proposed expenditure of millions of pounds towards that end, with one eye on the interests of Australian wool-growers and the other on the Empire's defence plans, I am wondering if Great Britain has con-, sidered in the scheme of thingB the storage of adequate supplies of wool, as Japan has done and is still doing. In case of war, and the possibility of interference with trade routes, great difficulty may be experienced in securing the necessary supplies of wool for uniforms, &c, unless provision has already been made for the storing of reserve supplies. Wool, as you are no doubt aware;can ibe kept indefinitely without deterioration. I have little doubt but that the necessary attention has been given to this aspect of the scheme, but, if not. in my humble opinion, it would be wise to have the reserves on hand. The authorities may be depending on the manufacturing firms to hold sufficient quantities in stock, but, owing to the unsteady markets that we have experienced this season, it is hardly likely that any firm would purchase more than requirements. I should like to know if the matter has occurred to you, and, if not, might 1 suggest that it would be advisable to have inquiries instituted with a view to ascertaining just what the position is regarding such reserves. I received a reply to the effect that inquiries would be made into the subject; but I have not had any further communication to indicate the result of the inquiries. However, the following report appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald care w ill be taken to ensure that injustice -five days after my letter was written:British Government's Inquiries.

The Yorkshire Observer declares that it may solve the carry-over problem in a disastrous The so-called national health and pensions manner.. Wheat prices are higher, as a result scheme therefore became a sectional of the reports. This shows the importance of the subject. I now direct the attention of the Government to the position of persons resident in Australia of the same as the nations with which we are at war. Many Germans in this country, and also people of German origin, are excellent eitizens who have played a notable part in the development of our resources. are law-abiding in every sense of the word, and are entitled among our finest citizens. mind the injustices that were done to such people during the last war, when many of them were interned without any just cause whatsoever, I think it proper to urge that the Government should on this occasion take care to deal justly these people, who, in the great of cases, are discharging their obligations as eitizens as well as are the people of our own race. We understand that some internments trust ihat principles upheld. The Great Charter was designed to protect people against the rapacity and tyranny of the Crown, and to ensure that injustice would not be inflicted upon the innocent. It is not the fault of the folk of German extraction in Australia we are at war to-day with the Nazi regime, and due regard ought to bo had to the unfortunate position in which they find themselves. Mr Collins. shall not be perpetrated. I take this opportunity to make my position in relation to national insurance quite clear to honourable members and the country at large.

I ask the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) whether he will obtain copies of that bluebook, and circulate them to honourable members, so that we may be fully informed on these matters, which are of such significance to the whole nation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. Bill received from the Senate and (on first time. Debate resumed from the 21st September (vide page .1006), on motion by Mr unfortunate persons who have been out TOHN LAWSONThat the bill be.now read a second time. do not intend to oppose this measure, the purpose of' which is to authorize an extension for five years of the bounty payable in respect of tractors of the internal combustion type, produced in this country. The rates of bounty are similar to those provided in the Iron and Steel Products Act 1922-34, as amended by our financial emergency legislation in 1931. The provision that not less than 90 per cent, of the material and parts should be of Australian origin is a most commendable one. The bounty was first granted in 1922, when the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act was passed. The bounty system, instead of a duty, was employed to encourage the industry, so that British tractors might still be admitted duty free, while tractors from foreign countries would be admitted under the intermediate tariff at a duty of 10 per cent. This industry has developed substantially since a bounty was granted. In 1938-39, the number of tractors produced in Australia was 334. There is still a wide field for expansion, because 4,377 tractors were imported in 1938-39, while in 1937-38 the number was 11,026. The report of the Tariff Board shows once more the efficiency that has been reached in many Australian secondary industries. Referring to the manufacture of tractors, the board compliments the manufacturers upon their efficiency, and remarks that the industry is rendering good service to the community. The Labour party has always insisted that, in measures of this kind, there should be a clause requiring the recipients of a bounty to observe award rates and conditions in their factories. That provision is missing from this bill, and I should like to know why. I take it that no federal government desires to stabilize an industry that sweats its employees. We know, unfortunately, that in some backyard industries there are employers who resort to all kinds of shifts to avoid observing awards. They even go so far as to get their employees to sign for award wages, and then pay them something less. During periods of unemployment, gome of work agree to work for less than award wages. The Government should not allow exploitation of that kind to take place. The employees, as well as the proprietors, should be considered in an industry of this kind. Because of their economic condition they are sometimes unable to help themselves. If they open their mouths to protest against injustice they are given a week's notice. Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.20]. -in reply-The provision requiring the recipient of a bounty to observe award rates and conditions was omitted from these measures on the advice of the then Attorney-General, the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), who considered that, it was unconstitutional, having regnrd t<> the decision of the High Court in the Harvester case. Since then efforts have been made to devise means to protect the employees, but so far the Solicitor-General has been unable to hit upon a satisfactory method. However, ail employees in this industry are working at full award rates, and under award conditions. In the circumstances, I think the Deputy",40,Storing Wool In Wab

Debate resumed from the 21st September (vide page 1009), on motion by Mr which is £12 less than the price quoted JOHN LAWSONThat the bill be now read u second time. havp to be kept in mind by the Minister This is another Government measure which the Opposition finds itself able to support. I have been impressed by the rapid strides made by the wire netting industry since it was established in Australia. It now employs 500 persons, and pays -wages each year amounting to £125,000. Over tbe last five years the average production amounted to 16;000 tons, and there is a steadily increasing export trade of an average value of £1,600. That is what we should aim at-the raising of the standard of efficiency to such a degree thai we can not only supply ourselves with an article as good as can be produced in any part of the world, out also find markets overseas. The establishment of this industry has been made possible because of the protectionist policy which is accepted by an overwhelming majority of the people of Australia. The Tariff Board has expressed the opinion that the industry has now become so firmly established that the bounty could be abolished The manufacture of wire netting was recently commenced in Western Australia. We are not parochial, and we desire to see secondary industries established in all of the States of Australia. Probably the people in some of the more distant States would take a more tion if industry were decentralized. This bounty will apply exclusively to the new company established in Western Australia because profits are limited to 6 per cent. Representatives of Lysaghts and Rylands advocated the return of the full bounty of cent, profits as in the original bounty act. but their claim was excessive, and, indeed, bordering on the ridiculous. I am glad to see that Australia to-day is producing wire netting at £A.34 Is. 6d. a mile, compared with the British price for home consumption of £35 19s. 8d. sterling. Figures weTe submitted to the Tariff Board showing thr low prices quoted by British manufacturers in order to secure orders in Australia and New Zealand and other countries.

Debate resumed from the 21st September (vide page 1012), on motion by Mr tricts of Queensland and to confer with JOHN LAWSONThat the bill be now road a second time. am sorry that on this measure there will be considerably more talk than there has been on the measures just agreed to; because the Government has not done justice to this industry. uutil we have consulted the Ministry. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr John Lawson) is to see a deputation. appointed at this proposal, which, if it is put into effect, will have a disastrous effect upon a great primary industry in Queensland. To prove my contention, I 3hall read what Mr Young, the general manager of theQueensland Cotton Board, has sent to me by telegramliaw cotton bounty payments announced by Government as 3id. per lb. with maximum payment in any year of £130,000 is a reduction of Id. from present payment, and will limit production to 15,000 bales though there carried on in anything like the proportion is market here for 35,000 bales. New cotton bounty payments will definitely mean the extinction of cotton-growing in Queensland. Lam gravely alarmed at the action of the Government. It took longer than was necessary to make its decision; and now the decision is a bad one. It referred the matter to the Tariff Board in September of last year. The board considered it until April of this year, and submitted a report, which has been in the hands of the department and the Minister ever since then. I stressed the importance of an early pronouncement as to what 'the Government intended to do hy way of increasing or continuing the cotton bounty in order to encourage cotton-growing. The Minister said that he was giving the matter consideration. The matter was put off from day to day, until now in the closing hours of Parliament a measure is brought down which, in the opinion of the general manager of the Queensland Cotton Board, will mean the extinction of the industry in Queensland. I do not think for a moment that the Minister wants to bring that about. The time has arrived for the newly-appointed Minister to visit the cotton-growing disthe Cotton Board personally. I shall be glad to accompany him, as I have accompanied his predecessors. When I say that I know that I am voicing the opinion of all of the honourable members from Queensland. I wish here emphatically to protest against the failure of the Tariff Board, appointed some years ago by a government of the same political brand as this and consisting of gentlemen from the southern parts of Australia who had no idea of the important ramifications of this industry, particularly on the practical side, to visit the big cotton districts in Central Queensland. Certainly members of the Tariff Board did on one occasion intend to go up through Rockhampton and across to the Dawson, Callide and Burnett districts, but excessive rains made transport difficult and the visit was abandoned. Instead, they visited the relatively small cotton-growing area at the back of Maryborough, where the industry is not it is being developed at Callide, Upper Burnett and Dawson Valley. They did not get a true impression of the great importance of this industry, in conjunction with the dairying industry and the pig raising industry, to the closer settlement of Queensland. I say to the Minister that before he gives this measure the imprimatur of Parliament, and asks honourable members to agree to a sharp reduction of the rate of bounty from 4^d. to 3£d., he should give further consideration to the whole matter and receive a deputation from the Queensland Cotton Board. He should also pay a visit to the cotton growing areas and confer with the Queensland Government. Negotiations",43,Second Reading

TheW it h in a few miles of the Callide Valley is the Theothe the problem of growing sufficient cotton If these In near future, be able to cope with the deimportant to-day. Minister for Trade and Customs might be able to tell us what sum of money the Queensland Government has offered to spend on irrigation in the Callide and Dawson valleys if the. Commonwealth Government will re-enact the existing raw cotton bounty legislation passed in 1934. I spoke to the Premier of Queensland by telephone yesterday, and he is very keen that the Pederal Government should play its-part and pass legislation to give an adequate measure of .assistance to this industry. The whole scheme will fall to the ground if the Pederal Government does not give more generous assistance to rhe industry than is provided for in this bill. In the Department of Trade and Customs there are experts who could accompany the Minister to Queensland and make personal investigations of the nconomics of this industry. These people could submit a very much more reliable report than that submitted by the Tariff Board, because they have made a study of this industry over a period of years and are conversant also with its secondary branches. I would have much greater confidence in a recommendation made by such officers than in one made by the Tariff Board which is overburdened with a multiplicity of requests to inquire into a hundred and one different industries. I again point out that members of the Tariff Board failed to inspect the major cotton growing districts of Queensland at a time when it should have made itself thoroughly conversant with the economics of this industry. We must bear in mind that, although Australia to-day utilizes only 35,000 bales of raw cotton a year, that quantity will grow year by year as the protective incidence of the tariff is widened to cover an increasing number of cotton goods which to-day are imported from other countries and which, as I said, represent an equivalent of 350,000 bale:; of raw cotton a year. an almost unlimited market in Australia for locally-grown cotton. 1 was fully cognizant with the value of this became Minister Customs in 1930, and during my term of office I took a very keen interest in all primary and secondary industries which came under my purview. A retrospective examination of the cotton industry reveals that cotton-growi f r . Ftyrde. ing has been carried on in Australia since 1870, hut it was in the doldrums until the Queensland Labour Government in 1920 guaranteed a price of 5£d. per lb. . for a period of three years. Later the industry was taken over on a national basis by the Commonwealth and assisted by bounty legislation passed in 1930, which placed cotton-growing on a solid footing. As a collateral part of that bounty system the Commonwealth Government undertook to increase the protective incidence of the tariff to cover an increasing number of items of' cotton goods and thereby to increase the home market for locally-grown cotton. Every industry has its ups and downs within the first tenor fifteen years of its existence, and in the case of cotton growing, owing to the uncertainty of seasonal conditions over which the growers have no control, there are times when only a half or quarter crop can be gathered. Such failures would be almost completely eliminated by the establishment of suitable irrigation schemes. One of the Queensland Cabinet Ministers, the Honourable T. A. Foley, M.L.A., who represents a large part of my federal electorate which is engaged in cotton-growing, has been indefatigable in his efforts to assist the cotton industry, and I appreciate the part that he has played in conjunction with his leader, Mr Forgan Smith, in the introduction of irrigation and water conservation schemes in cotton-growing districts with a view to increasing production. At afcimelike this, however, when there is such a drain on finances, Queensland cannot afford to incur increased expenditure by entering upon schemes of water conservation and irrigation if the Commonwealth Government There is allows the bottom to fall out of the cotton industry by withdrawing the bounty necessary to keep it alive. The size of the cotton-growing, industry may be readily appreciated when one industry when I realizes that to-day there are 3,600 cottonfor Trade and growers and 2,000 seasonal workers. It is the very backbone of districts like Biloela and Monto, in which areas there are to-day approximately 6,000 settlers, whereas, fifteen or sixteen years ago, there were only twenty or 30 people engaged in pastoral pursuits. This closer settlement was made possible by tbe establishment of the cotton industry, because, when the timber was feiled and burned out, cotton seeds were planted amongst the stumps and a crop was produced immediately thus enabling the settlers, who previously were engaged in manual work ami lower-paid occupations such as farm work, mining and railroad work, ancl had very little, if any, money to set up their farms and purchase the necessary machinery, implements, and livestock. With the proceeds from the cotton crop, they acquired an additional ""equity in their property, and were able to purchase cows, as well as to borrow There is a. Minister in charge of this money from the Agricultural Bank to extend their dairying and pig-raising operahis control who can give him a much tions. Are these people to be given the setback which this decision will give them? farmers of this country, and in the interI have no axe to grind. The only personal interest that T have in cotton-growing is that the growers are my constituents, and are Australians. As members of this Australian Parliament, we cannot afford to give a setback to these 3,600 cotton farmers just as the war has broken out. A large number of them are returned soldiers from the last war. Many of them went on the land as young men, and now, after 15 or 16 years, they have sons and daughters growing up who are assisting them on their properties. The aggregate income enables the' boys and girls to remain on fhe property. Surely that is what we want! We do not want them to flock to the capital cities to accentuate the unempicking of cotton ployment problem. To-day. there is quite a substantial acreage under cotton. In Central Queensland, 43,954 acres are planted, the remaining 21,000 acres being in the Burnett and other southern cotton growing areas. The Callide Valley, in Central Queensland, has 20,000 acres under cultivation. There is no reason why this industry should not become one of the major industries of Australia. Conper lb. That means a reduction of 14d. sider the important part played by it in Egypt and the United States nf America. The total world production of raw cotton is 36,000,000 bales, of which 18.000,000 bales are produced in the United States of America and IS,000,000 bale« in other countries. Before the commencement of the present conflict in the East, Japanese bounty sh^nld not in anv case exceed aid. cotton mills used practically 4,000,000 [40] bales of raw cotton annually, one-half of whicn was purchased from the United States of America. I am astounded that the Government should make this ill-considered decision on the eve of closing up Parliament for a recess of a couple of months. I do not question the integrity or the honesty of the members of the Australian Tariff Board, but T do say that those gentlemen have made an honest mistake, which, I hope, will be soon rectified. I do not believe that the Government should be bound willy-nilly to follow the recommendations of the board in this matter. department, and he has experts under better recommendation in the interests of ests of the unemployed who depend upon this industry for seasonal employment. It is an industry which fits in witU canegrowing. Por several months, 2,000 odd workers pick cotton, and when that work is finished they go into the canefields to cut cane. If this industry goes out of existence, those 2,000 seasonal workers, so we have been told hy Mr Young, the general manager of the Queensland Cotton Board, will be deprived of a livelihood for a substantial part of the year. The sugar industry engages them for only six months, and they have to find some means of livelihood for the remaining six months of the year. What will happen to them if they have not the cotton fields in which to obtain employment in the I ' find no fault with the proposed duration of the bounty. Although the Queensland Cotton Board asked for a period of ten years, the Minister has agreed to its operating for a period of five years. The basic rate of bounty is to be 3id. per lb. when the Liverpool spot price of American middling raw cotton is 6d. per lb. The raw Cotton Bounty Act of 1934 provided for a bounty at the rate of 4Jd. when the L'verpool middling spot price was 6d. per lb. or .Old. per lb. more or le*s than 4fd. per lb. for every .Old. per lb. by which the price was more or less than 6d. per lb., but so that the rate of per lb. That was the formula by which the Government arrived at the rate that would apply at any given time. Mr the industry, cleared the land-cu t a farm Young, representing the Queensland Cotton Board, in evidence before the Tariff Board, asked that assistance be granted to the cotton-growing industry in the form of a direct bounty on the production of raw cotton, and, in addition, a customs duty of at least Id. per lb. on all importations of raw cotton from any source. Another request was that the assistance granted be equal to the difference between the cost of efficient production in Australia and the cost of production in overseas countries, ""including cheap-labour countries, such as India. That seemed a very reasonable request. A bounty for ten years was sought in order to give stability to the industry, so that an opportunity would be afforded for the expansion of the cotton ginneries and oil-mills, and the farmers would be able to lay down a long-range policy. Mr this country. If he pushes this measure Young, in asking for a customs duty of Id. per lb. on all imported raw cotton, made it clear that he did not also ask for the present rate of bounty; the result of that duty on imported raw cotton would be the reduction by Id. per tb. of the bounty which otherwise would be payable. He urged that the principle of the adoption of a home price for Australian products sold locally was generally accepted by the Commonwealth Government and the people of Australia, and said that he looked forward to the time when the grower would be protected by this means rather than by means of a bounty, which he regarded as something of a temporary nature; and I support him in his view. I have received the following telegram from Valentine Plains, in my electorate :Proposed bounty legislation al present before first-hand information in the cottonthe House will mean the extinction of cotton growing industry and the Callide Valley as a closer-settlement area. Only increased assistance over present rates of bounty will assure expansion. Suggest no maximum limitation nf funds for bounty payments. Proposed legislation means limiting the crop to 15,000 bales. (.Sisrned'l Fleming; Member Queensdiinn1 Cotton Board. Mr Fleming is one of the largest cotton growers in Queensland. He lives in my electorate, and I know him personally. He would not send such a telegram if he did not believe that its contents were true. Mr Fnnte. He is one of the young men who entered out of the scrub, as it were-and by tireless work over a number of years, developed his property. He is bringing up a good Australian family, and is typical of thousands of others. Can we afford to throw out of this industry men of that type, when approximately 200,000 of our people are out of employment in the cities of Australia? This is a time when not one additional man should be put out of work. On the contrary, we should make every effort to keep in employment every man who is now engaged. I make no charge against the Minister of being unsympathetic. He has only recently been installed in the Department of Trade and Customs, hut he has had some experience of primary production and has followed a profession which brought him very largely into touch with the primary producers of through to-day, hundreds of farmers who are clearing land and intend to put it under the plough with a view to planting cotton in ithe next few weeks will be disappointed, and there will be a substantial reduction of the acreage under crop, with the result that we shall not grow this year even what we grew last year, namely.. 12,000 bales out of an Australian demand for 35,000 bales. I regret that the Minister did not bring forward a more generous measure. Thi^ falls far short -of-what is necessary. I appeal to him not. to try to push.. it through the House by weight of numbers, but to agree to meet a deputation of the Queensland Cotton Board and Queensland members, and to pay a visit to Queensland during the recess to see the ginnery and the oil mill and to obtain growing districts. If he does that, with the assistance of his departmental experts.. 1 am confident that he will do justice to the Queensland cotton industry. I hope that he will do the right thing by this industry, which has played such . an important part in the development of the more recent closer settlement areas in Queensland. this proposal be proceeded with in its present form, from information that 1 have received, I can say that the industry",44,Second Reading

The establishment of new industries and the extension of existing industries has prompted the Tariff Board to recommend the provision of protective rates of duty on a number of lines. One of the most recent contributions io our industrial fabric is the production of fine printing and writing paper at Burnie in the north of Tasmania. The ilu ties proposed represent an increase on tine printings which will account for three-fourths of the mill production but practically no alteration on writings. .Protection granted on importations of cotton drills, dungarees and jeans weighing over 6 ounces por square yard for use in making malo outer clothing has been extended to lighter weight fabrics weighing down to 4 ounces per square yard I moveThe protection will however be at a lower level than previously. The protective duties at present applicable to laundry washing machines in the medium priced and cheaper ranges wiil now be charged on machines valued for duty purposes up to £600 each. An Australian manufacturer of metallic capsules for bottles has endeavoured unsuccessfully to make headway against foreign competition with little or no duty assistance. The protection granted in the schedule should turn the scales in his favour. Provision is made for deferred rates of duty to apply to motor vehicle radiators. Such rates will come into operation when the bounty on Australian-made radiators expires in December, 1940. The industry has made little progress under cover of the bounty, and the insertion of deferred duties will serve as an indication that, the Government is earnest in its desire to see this industry established on a proper footing. Reductions of duty arc made on hydroox tractors and iu the alternative fixed rates on variable resistances. This schedule, small though it may be. typifies the sympathetic attitude of the Government towards the establishment of new industries in Australia. Progress reported. SHIP BOUNTY BILL 1939.

The question how we are to achieve that end has exercised the minds of this and previous Governments. The planning of a course of development has necessitated an examination of many phases of the problem, among which are(a) The employment likely to be provided and the utilization of Australian raw materials; (o) the re-opening of idle shipyards; or the bringing into use of idle plant in shipyards at present operating; (c) the need for keeping costs within reasonable limits in view of the effect that high costs of production would have on freight rates and on the ability of shipowners to purchase vessels under such conditions; (d) the. amount of assistance which the Commonwealth Government could make available. These are important points, not one of which can be dismissed lightly, it is quite obvious that the present method of assistance, which provides for protective duties only on vessels up to 500 tons gross register, has not succeeded in establishing shipbuilding on a satiscommittee (Consideration of factory footing. Very few vessels within the protective duty range have been built in Australia within recent years, and it is a long time since any commercial vessels exceeding 500 tons gross register have been built here.",49,Tarif F Proposals 1939 Import Duties

158,Mr John Lawson (Macquarie,"The Tariff Board points out that a duty high enough to exclude the hulk of imported vessels would react against the best interests of both the shipowners and the community and that the wisest course would be to remove the duty and provide a bounty in respect of vessels capable of economic construction in Australia. The Tariff Board's proposals, which the Government has accepted with one variation, provide for the following:(o) Tlie payment of a bounty on iron or steel vessels (other than war vessels) over 100 tons but not exceeding 1,500 tons gross register. (6) The rate of bounty to be £12 10s. per ton on vessels over 100 tons but not exceeding 750 tons. Surli rate to be gradually reduced so that on vessels of 1,500 tons gross register the rate would be £10 per ton. (c) Bounty payments to be limited to £50,000 per annum. (d) Machinery, boilers and auxiliaries required in the construction in Australia of vessels eligible for bounty to be admitted free of duty from United Kingdom nnd at 15 per cent, from foreign sources. (e) 'The duties on vessels of the type eligible for bounty to be fixed at free (B.P.T.) and 15 per cent. (G.T.). (/) The matter to be reviewed by the Tariff Board after the bounty has been in operation for a period of three years. The variation to which I have referred is in respect of machinery, boilers and auxiliaries. that, subject to consultation with the Government of the United Kingdom, such equipment should be admitted free of duty irrespective of the country of origin, whereas the board recommends admission at rates of free British and 15 per cent, general. The Government's proposal with respect to this equipment is the same as that adopted by the Government of the United Kingdom in connection with its scheme of assistance to shipping. I am quite aware, from the letters that I have received, and from the deputations which have waited upon me since the Government's proposals were made public early in August, that many people, directly or indirectly connected with shipbuilding in Australia, consider that the Government's scheme will not provide sufficient stimulus to the industry. The Government freely admits that its proposals will not result in the construction in our shipyards of every vessel that may he required by Australian shipowners. Proposals of that kind would Mr John Lawson. be over-ambitious at the outset. ""What the Government desires, however, is to take the industry out of the doldrums and to see it gradually expanded. This view is exemplified in the decision to limit bounty payments at the outset to vessels of up to 1,500 tons gross register. If the industry concentrates on vessels up to that tonnage limit, the question of the construction of still larger vessels can then be determined in the light of experience. Again, the question of government finance is an important one in a consideration of the amount of assistance which can . be given to the industry. The Government's heavy war-time financial commitments place a limit upon the assistance it can give to any individual industry. The provision of a sum of £50,000 per annum for shipbuilding is, I claim, very creditable in the circumstances, and I cannot promise, at this stage, that that amount can he increased. Another point upon which the Government has been criticized is the proposal to grant free admission of machinery, boilers and auxiliaries required in the construction of vessels on which bounty will be paid. This criticism is levelled on The Government proposes the ground that the free admission of such equipment will not result in additional employment being given in the appropriate industries. Both the Government and the Tariff Board are fully seized of this fact in principle, but the important consideration that cannot be avoided is that if shipowners are to be induced to purchase vessels of local construction and if freight rates are to be kept within reasonable limits, costs must be kept as low as possible. The decision to admit this equipment free of duty cannot result in the loss of employment in the hoilermaking and engineering industries for the reason that vessels required by Australian shipowners are at present, purchased overseas. On the contrary, some additional employment in the engineering industries must result from a building construction programme. The Government and the Parliament are faced with the position that duties have not succeeded in the purpose for which they were imposed. The alternative approach is by bounty, and the Government's proposals provide assistance by that means over a much wider needed stimulus to the ship-building tonnage range than was covered by duties. industry. The Government considers that, within House. the limits of the funds at its command, the bounty proposals will give a muchadjourned.

163,Mr Spender (Warringah,"Assistantapproved in another place. The Government has given consideration to certain criticisms that were made on the original measure with a view to submitting amended proposals. Unfortunately, time does not permit of detailed measures being submitted by way of amendment of those previously introduced. vernment regards it as important that there should be no delay in the collection of some form of tax on the recent unearned increment of gold prices due to the outbreak of war and the consequential depreciation of sterling in terms of United States of America dollars. The modified proposals will, therefore, take the form of an excise duty in lieu of a tax, and the proposals just announced give effect to the Government's plan, modified in the light of criticism which has been directed to it in this chamber and in another place. The necessary machinery to give effect to the proposals of the Government as announced will be done by the making of a regulation under the National Security Act, which will be tabled in due course.

The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has just spoken to me across the table about the prospective date of resuming our sittings. At this stage it ia difficult to say with precision when we shall resume, but I have in mind that we shall meet once more this year, in the The Gosecond week of November. AlthoughI have suggested that date to the honourable gentleman, I do not wish to be tied to it. The House may, however, take it that that is about the date I have in mind. As to the sittings of the House generally, it will no doubt be clear to honourable members that the usual long sittings and normal legislative programmes may not be altogether easy to accomplish. But I do feel that the Parliament should be given the opportunity from time to time to exercise its critical powers in relation to whatever the Government may be doing, particularly having regard to the fact that the Executive will be exercising a great deal of power under regulations. I have in mind that the sittings, even if shorter, will be somewhat more frequent than has been the case in the past, the idea being to give to the Parliament reasonably frequent opportunities to deal with the matters to which the Government has given attention. The honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen) asked me earlier to-day about the Mortgage Bank Bill. All that I can say on that subject at the moment is that the Government desires to go on with it ; but, of course, no one can predict in the next, month or two, so that whatever is said now must be subject to those circumstances. With that qualification, I hope to he able to go on with the measure when the House resumes in November. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has raised a matter in here at the time, but I understand that it was suggested that the censorship had been used in relation to a journal called PASby excising a political comment or attack on the present Government. I have not seen the journal, and I know nothing of the facts other than what has been told to me. I can say, however, that the Government does not desire any censorship on that ground.

Some men who will attend the camps, especially those who belong to technical units, will suffer considerable monetary loss, amounting in some cases to as much as £10, being the difference between their civil and military pay while in camp. If compulsory military training were in force these men would realize that as all other men similarly situated would also lose pay there would be equality of sacrifice; but in the circumstances that prevail it seems a lot to ask the men to suffer this substantial loss.
