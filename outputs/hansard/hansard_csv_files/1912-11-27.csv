The answer to his question is as follows: As intimated in various editions of the printed schedules issued to members, the question of -afforestation has been continually kept in mind. A nursery has been established at Acton for the propagation of trees, plants, and shrubs.

14,"(For Dr. Maloney) Ing A Federal Council, To Deal With Aus","meeting of the Council, the Parliaments refused to ratify what had been agreed upon, and nothing was done. After several changes the people took the matter in hand, and determined to establish the Federal Constitution as their own act. A conference of various bodies, of which not the least was the Australian Natives' Association, assembled at Corowa, and there the foundation of Federation was laid on the surest basis possible-the people's will. The honourable member for Bendigo was then prepared to trust the people, and on his motion it was resolved to take the matter out of the hands of the politicians, hands of the people, allowing .. them to elect representatives to a Convention for the framing of the draft Constitution to be submitted for the popular acceptance. I was one of those who advocated that course, and advised the acceptance of the Constitution. The honourable members for Parkes and Bendigo, and others who now make so much of the legal position, then adopted a different attitude, and the questions which the people were asked to consider were very few indeed. most to do with bringing about Federation was the fact that the colonies, especially New South Wales and Victoria, were gradually becoming hostile to each other as the result of the operation of Customs Tariffs. giving freedom of intercourse and trade and commerce throughout Australia, and protection from the commercial assaults of the foreigner outside, would remove this feeling. inbringing about the Union. factor was the desire to insure common preparations for the defence of Australia.

34,Mr Chanter,"I told them, and theagain, would the honourable member ask them a third time? to ask them a thirtieth time. ^50,000 every time? be a puerile argument. The honourable member contends that, because the people when asked to do a certain thing did not agree to do it, they are never to be asked again, and the defective condition of the Constitution is to be allowed to continue for all time. Section 51 of the Constitution provides thatThe Parliament shall, subject to this Congot into such a terrible state that we can stitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth, with respect to1. Trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States. The honourable member for East Sydney said something about lawyers, and, while I have some respect for lawyers, I believe that in the framing of our laws we have depended too much upon lawyers, and we know that members of that profession frequently differ. The honourable member for Parkes differs from the honourable member for Angas, and also from the honourable member for Flinders. lawyers will continue to differ -we have not the power to deal with corsionally lavmen, also differ. from a fairly lengthy experience, I have matters within a State, or any part of a come to the conclusion that when lawyers State, in order to be in a position to prodesire to frame a provision in such a way tect the interests of the people.

In these circumstances we propose to ask the pepole to give us the power to protect their interests. This is not a party matter. It is immaterial so far as this matter was supported by the honourable member is concerned whether the Labour party, or honourable members now in Opposition occupy the Treasury bench. Labour party want the power for. Labuor party want it for, but the honourable member does not. We want this power to protect the people in their lives, in their health, and in their homes, and not for the ridiculous purposes assumed by the other side. We are not such lunatics as to do what honourable members opposite suggest it is our intention to do. It is singular how differently matters are viewed from various parts of this House. When the Deakin Protectionist party were in power, and supported by the Labour party, a few honourable members, whose names I could mention, saw eye to eye with me on this matter. They saw that the people were being seriously injured in their commercial and industrial interests, and believing at the time that we had 'power to do so, we took steps to protect the people in that way. What is the new Protection but a section of trade and commerce? was found that in certain industries, and in one in particular, the employees were not being justly dealt with. It was found necessary to protect them against that injustice, and to regulate and control these trading corporations. words, many honourable members of the present Opposition then approved of the very course which we are now seeking to take. larat, then Prime Minister, brought in a Customs and an Excise Tariff Bill practically declaring that the farmers were being robbed by manufacturers of agricultural machinery oversea, and that the Parliament intended to protect them. Those Bills regulated and fixed the wages to be paid to the worker in the local industrial establishments and the prices to be paid by the consumer of the implements manufactured. The present Leader of the Opposition, who intimated last week that he intended to recommend the electors to opliament power to control and regulate corporations, was the Leader of the Government who brought in the legislation to which I have referred, with a view to controlling and fixing prices. He for Kooyong, Sir Robert Best, who has since changed his mind, the right honourable member for Swan, Sir John Forrest, the honourable member for Darling Downs, Mr Groom, the honourable member for Mernda, Mr Harper, the honourable member for Bendigo, Sir John Quick, the honourable member for Laanecoorie, Dr. Carty Salmon, and the honourable member for Balaclava, Mr Agar Wynne. member name any Act passed by this Parliament which attempted to fix prices for the consumer ? legislation to which' I have just referred did so. The Customs Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, passed in 1906, contained a schedule fixing the price of such machinery, and was supported by members of the Opposition who are condemning the proposals now before us. ber propose to use the power now sought to fix prices? drawn from the interjection made by the honourable member for Parkes is that he thinks my statement will be useful during theapproaching campaign. Let me elaborate it a little. Is it better for the In other people of Australia that the National Parliament should fix the prices of commodities, and save them from being robbed, or that the greedy rings and combines The honourable member for Balshould do so? Every one knows that prices are now being fixed by rings and combines all along the line-and fixed so high that many commodities cannot be obtained by the poorer sections of the community.

I have my own opinion as to whether the Court is right or wrong, but it is indisputable that the Court had evidence before it to show that the price of coal was raised to such an inordinate degree as to be severely felt by the people.

This, then, is the position in regard to the Coal Vend. There are in existence other combinations of a similar character. It is idle to deny it. Only one member of the Opposition has had the courage to openly avow that he is in favour of trusts. The honourable member for Moreton unhesitatingly declared that the introduction of the Beef Trust into Queensland was a good thing for that State.

The honor-,the honourable member for Riverina for the consideration he has exhibited in not publishing his views concerning the recent judgment of the High Court in the Coal Vend case. No doubt he was restrained by the consciousness that if he had published those views the faith of the people in the decisions of that tribunal would have been seriously shaken. Another observation which he made in relation to the proposed fixation of prices rather amused me. With an airy wave, of his hand he dismissed the law of supply and demand, which has hitherto regulated human affairs, and the theories of all political economists by a reference to what I understood to be the "" q u i p s "" of supply and demand. is a living example of the law of supply and demand. If there were not a demand for the sort of political rhodomontade with which he regaled the House on the subject of trusts, I do riot suppose that there would be any supply of it. Some demand must exist for it amongst his owrf constitutents as well as elsewhere. I feel the same difficulty as was experienced by the Leader of the Opposition in attempting to discuss this series of proposed amendments of the Constitution in the short space of an hour and five minutes. As I previously remarked, it is practically impossible for any honourable member to do so. The only course open to us is to take certain portions of these proposals which are correlated, and discuss them separately, relying upon opportunities which will subsequently present themselves when other Bills are under consideration to supplement what we say now upon what, after all, is one large I . therefore, propose this morning to confine my attention mainly to the proposal to amend the commerce power, and with it the provision intimately connected with that, and the last"" of the series, relating to the determination or settlement of disputes on State railways. amendment of the commerce power my views are pretty well known; they have been published in Hansard, arid some honourable members opposite have done me the honour to reneat them more than once during the debate. stuff.

I desire to say that I do not wish to withdraw one single word; and honourable members opposite may make any use of my previous speeches that they like. I had carefully given the fullest consideration to the subject, and there is no indefiniteness about the expression of my views. I do not expect that honourable members on either side will desire to have them repeated in this debate ; and they may be accepted as being still the views I hold on the amendment of the Constitution with regard to the commerce powers.

If party is a bad thing on this side, why is it not a bad thing on the Opposition side? Mr W. H . IRVINE -The honourable member seems to be good at putting conundrums, and I shall leave him to answer them himself. It would be quite impossible to even refer to the various alterations which have taken place, or, rather, to the various steps that have been taken by the party who sit on the other side of the House, since this matter was discussed before; but I shall mention one instance of n most important kind. snay assume that the Attornev-General, if not the leader of the party, is the leader of its fighting battalions in connection with .these amendments, and also in connection with their policy generally. ney-General is not Prime Minister; but .he has pledged his party, so far as any person in his position can pledge them, to the adoption of a policy which would mean, in itself, a confiscation of many existing rights of property, and a total -dislocation of the whole machinery of production, industry, and distribution. refer to the announcement made by him some, months' ago, and never withdrawn or modified by any of his followers, that the Labour party would add, as part of their policy, the fixation of prices and profits. Honourable members opposite do not even now dispute for a moment that part of their policy at the next election will be the determination of prices and profits. In this connection I shall read an extract from a report given by the Age of a speech made by the Attorney-General on 19th July, when fie was, I think, addressing the Victorian Railways Union. The honourable gentleman saidUnless the Federal Parliament was able to -regulate and control prices, the .mere ability to regulate wages was of very little value. Therefore, the CommonweaUh Parliament would have to regulate prices and profits. the beginning and the end of the whole thing. Bring down.prices, profits, and rents, and everything else would come down with them. that.' Mr W. H . IRVINE -As the honourable member interjects, there is no doubt about that. We on this side of the'House owe, I think, as much to the cynical frankness of the Attorney-General as we do to I shall now the unrestrained circus-play of the Minister of Jlome Affairs-bot h are valuable assets. Here we have the statement not withdrawn, but uncontradicted and unexplained, that if prices, profits, and rents are brought down, everything else will come down with, them.'

I ,do not think that any man in the House knows better than does the Attorney General that this talk about the policy of fixing prices and profits, unless it forms part of a general scheme for the nationalization of all means of production and interchange, is of absolutely gossamer conI struction-as fragile as a cobweb. It may 1 serve to entangle the wings of some of the voters, but it will be destroyed almost immediately afterwards in their struggles to free themselves. It is impossible, not to attempt, but to carry through, as I feel sure the Attorney-General himself knows, any scheme whereby it is proposed to say to the man who sells bread that he shall sell it at a particular price, unless he is also told that he shall have his flour at a particular price. Then, when we tell the baker that he shall have his flour at a particular price, it is impossible to tell the milleT that he must, sell his flour at a particular price, unless he is assured that he will get his wheat at a particular price; and it is impossible to say to the wheat grower that he must sell at a particular That was price unless he is enabled to have his rent and the interest, on his mortgage fixed: Further, wages must, be fixed, not by a minimum, but by a maximum.

To any one who views this question from any other stand-point than that of attempting to make a show platform for the elections, this policy has no substance in it . The fact is, as the Attorney-General well knows, and as honourable members opposite well know, we are approaching a very serious and critical position in our industrial affairs.. It is already patent that we have hitherto endeavoured by all kinds of artificial means, not to destroy what used to be called sweating, and not to fix a' minimum or living wage, but to determine or fix wages far above a living wage. If you fix the rate in any particular grade of the industrial scale at 7s. or 8s. a day aa a living wage, and give ios., 12s., and 1:4s. for other grades, those rates are more tharo the living wage.

Mr W. H . IRVINE -Does the Honorary Minister deny that that is the policy of his party? I assure him that therehave been several such interjections. Perhaps he has only just entered the Chamber, or has not been listening to the debate. MT. ROBERTS -I have heard every word' spoken during the debate. ^ Mr W. H. IRVINE -The Attorney General, speaking a few months ago in the most measured language, said that--.

98,Mr Roberts,"We might try to makenamely, verbal consistency. I have often changed my mind, and shall often do so again. But on the point which I am now discussing I have never had but one idea, and never expressed but one view. A man with the experience and ability of the Attorney-General cannot help knowing that unless the Labour party is prepared to take the responsibility of nationalizing the whole means of production, exchange, and distribution, it cannot regulate prices. He knows, too, that those who follow him will give to his vgprds the devoted acceptance with which the words of some mollah are heard by the wandering tribes of India, who swallow his promises of Paradise, as the honourable gentleman's supporters swallow the promises he holds out on the eve of an election. He knows that if in this way he can gain their assent to his policy, things will somehow or other right themselves afterwards. There is another aspect of the case. For some years the nationalization of monopolies has been the policy of the Labour party, but I ask if any honourable member on that side of the House can give an intelligent definition of monopoly. monopoly. MI . W. H . IRVINE -An instance is not a definition. defined. Mr W. H . IRVINE I know that. Honourable members therefore propose to put into the Constitution a word that cannot be defined. It is that to which I object. The honourable member for Hindmarsh is fond of speaking of judge-made law, and he has objected to lawyers' interpretation of the Constitution. For some reason he professes great abhorrence of Law Courts and lawyers, but 1 would remind him that the surest way of compelling the creation of judge-made law is to put into the Constitution words incapable of definition. This creates the necessity for judgemade law. It is difficult by using the most precise and best known words to define one's meaning exactly, and thus avoid throwing on the Judges what is practically the exercise of the legislative power. opposite tell us that they are going to nationalize monopolies. over trade and commerce in their hands will be used as a power for practically rendering impossible any trade and commerce other than that which can be taken over by the State. The whole object of the party on the other side, as it seems to me, is now clearly apparent, and it is to ultimately nationalize the whole of the means of production and exchange. The Federal political platform of the Labour party has been referred to more than once, and when honourable members on this side have said that this or the other was part of the platform of the party, they have been met with such interjections as "" That was not adopted,"" or "" That was. rejected,"" and in many instances these statements have been quite true. But a study of the speeches made at the conferences at which the platform has been decided upon, and the reasons why certain proposals were not adopted or were rejected, is not without its uses as throwing some light upon what is really the policy of the Labour party. I find that with regard to this very matter of the nationalization of monopolies, that that term, incapable of definition as it is, has been adopted expressly because it is incapable of definition, and because it is understood to mean a great deal more than it says. Honourable members opposite are well aware that f.t the Hobart conference there was a debate as to whether the Victorian or Queensland objective in the matter of nationalization should be adopted. It was suggested that what should be adopted wasThe securing of the f u l l results of their industry to all wealth-producers by the collective ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, to be attained through the extension of the industrial and economic functions of the State and local governing bodies. That proposition was, of course, the clearest possible exposition of the subject of nationalization, and covered the nationalization of all means of production, distribution, and exchange. Nothing could be clearer than that. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes, that is clear. Now, why was not that exposition adopted? Let us hear what Mr Watson had to say about it. He saidThen, again, the Federal objective asked for the extension of the industrial and economic functions of the State and municipality. There was no limit to that sphere of activity. But now honourable members He did not see that there was anything to be gained by an alteration being made, and no The power reason had been advanced in favour of any alteration.

It can never be forgotten, in dealing with questions of constitutional form, that it is impossible to leave out of consideration what is behind, all constitutional forms, namely, the active living forces which are at work in every community. We have examples from nearly every country in the world of forms of government that are of comparatively secondary importance since they are used by organized forces of various kinds for their own purposes. In this connection some very striking statements were made quite recently -by a gentleman whose words will be respected by most Australians. ham Clarke. Whether his political views He is a man with a very wide outlook on general, social, and political questions. I propose which he delivered to show how in his The illustrious founders of the United States, men who had recently revolted against what they regarded as autocratic rule, intended guard their country carefully against mob however, of the care bestowed upon it , the Constitution of the United States has failed and has even developed features which they would have abhorred. Politics in America are Honourable members will recognise that this It is the language of a man who, as I said, He went on to sayThe tyranny of wealth has attained such proportions in no other land, and has never before exercised such a sinister influence on the life of a great nation, sapping the foundations of liberty and spreading corruption broadcast. The dominance of the boss in political and municipal affairs has tended to cause the best citizens of America to stand aloof from public life, and I shall say, further, that that thus to lower the standard of political morality. Already there are plain signs of a growing demand for the restoration of civic liberty, and this century will, I believe, witness far-reaching political changes in the great Republic. So much for America, where he shows that forms of government have little to do with the real forces operating in the public life of the country. He then deals with France, and he saysFrance, from the theoretical point of view, has said almost the last word in Democracy; but political contentment has not resulted, and Socialist and syndicalist movements subversive of all constitutional principles threaten the national stability. Democracy in France has developed group politics to a surprising extent. Nine distinct groups contend for power in the Chamber of Deputies, and successive Governments are compelled to bid for the support of I have as many of them as will secure » working majority for carrying on public business.

We have been made aware from other .sources that the syndicalist movement threatens to break through the existing provision for the maintenance of order and good government. -Britain, he saysIn Great Britain, new forces are making themselves felt in ways not generally expected. While we have not at present reached adult suffrage, our political system may be claimed as distinctly Democratic. What most strikes me at «he present time is that constitutional methods, for which there are free opportunities, do not appear to satisfy the enfranchised population. -With us, as in France, Socialism and syndicalism «eem to make way, while the amalgamated organizations of workers in industries upon which nhe life of the people depends, claim the right to paralyze government and to starve their fellow -citizens. ' Whether this is a passing phase or »n impending danger, time alone can prove; but, jit least, it is the flat negation of Democratic .principles, and we may fairly infer that certain recent political movements indicate the failure -of Democracy to secure the expected benefits. I cite those passages as showing the opinions of a man of very considerable wisdom .and observation. We cannot disregard all living, active forces when we are dealing with tlie constitutional form in which they .are to find expression, and those forces are sometimes such as to compel men, where the pressure is very high, to submit to, and even to advocate, constitutional changes with which they would not in theory agree. By that means occasionally revolutions have been avoided. They also justify men, if they are wise, in sometimes resisting political changes where the forces are such as to render those political changes, in their opinion, dangerous. There is a time for all things. The time for largely increasing the political powers of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia is not,' in my opinion, when that Parliament is absolutely controlled, as it is now, and possibly may be next year, by a party which has the objectives that I have been endeavouring to place before the House. constitute an attack upon adult suffrage, since we are here by virtue of the votes of the people? Mr W. H . IRVINE -We are here to -do our best and to form our wisest conclusions for the benefit of the people who have sent us here. We are here to advise them and to use our own judgment, rather than to say, ' ' We have no minds of our own; vote; Nevertheless, in and we shall follow."" We are here, if we are worth anything, as men who are best suited to form judgments on political sub° jects. has advised the people one way in one vear, and another in another year. Mr W. H . IRVINE -On the last'ocDealing with' Great casion I advised them to vote against the referenda. honourable member advise .them to vote both ways on the last 'Occasion? Mr W. H . IRVINE -No. I advised the people to vote against the whole of the amendments, and I did so because, as I have said already, they included two provisions-that relating to corporations and that relating to railways. In the general scheme of constitutional amendments we find a rather curious anomaly. I give the Attorney-General, who is in charge of this Bill, credit for being able with every honourable member to find the political latitude and longitude, but I think that he has misread his chart on this occasion. It will be observed that this Bill, unlike that before us on the previous occasion, provides that the power sought in respect of trade and commerce is not to includetrade and commerce upon railways the property of a State, except so far as it is trade and commerce with other countries or among the States. That is a very half-hearted way of .dealing with the subject. If honourable members wish to obtain the power to control commerce, they must obtain power to control the movements of goods. If they want a general control over commerce, they must have a general control over commerce on the railways. The great bulk of Intra-State commerce is carried on the railways, and if we exempt commerce on the railways from the regulation of trade and commerce by this Parliament this proposed amendment of the Constitution will be practically lame in one leg from its birth, and that, if I may use an Hibernianism, its best leg. lic and the other a private instrument. Mr W. H . IRVINE -It may be doubtful whether we could pass an Act to control freights and fares upon the railways of the States, for, as the honourable mem-, ber has just suggested, they might be held to be a State instrumentality, notwithstanding'the provisions of section 92 of the Constitution.",28,Moloney Ver Y Good Once That With Regard To This Amendment

IRVINE -The honourable member must recollect that we areasked not to pass an Act of Parliament to reguJate such matters, but to agree to a Bill to provide for additional powers to enable us to do so. could not now take the step to which I havealluded, but when the Attorney-General invites the Parliament and the people, as he does, to give this additional power to the Federal Legislature, the argument of the honourable member in regard to instrumentalities has no application whatever. If it is desirable that this Parliament should control commerce, surely it is desirable that it should control commerce on the railways, because the bulk of commerce is carried on the railways. respect not of commerce on the railways, but of other commerce. Mr W. H . IRVINE honourable member that the ostensible purpose for which this House is invited to seek extended powers to deal with trade and commerce is to enable us to control trusts and combinations. I am inclined to agree with the honourable member that in America many of the trusts and combines rest very largely on their power to regulate transport. That is not the case here. America is rebates, and the honourable member knows it. Mr W. H . IRVINE I do not object to interjections, but I think it is a pity that honourable members should tack on to their interjections, "" And the honourable member knows it . "" for Hindmarsh gives the honourable member' too much credit. Mr W. H . IRVINE I am merely expressing the views that I hold. Rebates and all sorts of concessions, as well as various other matters, constitute some of the foundations upon which trusts and combines are based. The power to regulate and control freight over the great transport systems of America is by far the most important element in the formation of a combine. That power does not exist here, and therefore the power to control trade and commerce over the railways of the States, even if we possessed it, would probably not be exercised to a very considerable extent except to prevent anomalies in freights and fares as between the States. Buti f we wished to control combinations and combines as far as we could do sounder the commerce power, we should do so by controlling the movements of the goods, apart from the rates or freights paid in connection with their movement. In that case, if we are going to take this power It is highly probable that we in the form now sought, it will practically be hamstrung. We could forbid the movement of goods and use our commerce power to deal with combines, which honourable members opposite say is their main objective, provided that we did not deal with the movement on the railways where the great bulk of trade and commerce movements take place. Now, whilst it is not proposed to seek from the country the right to control any portion of that which is practically the greater part of Intrastate commerce, namely, that which passes over the railways of the States, on the other hand, the Government propose-whils t making what I cannot help calling a merely I agree with the plausible concession to the States in that direction-to interfere with the autonomy of the States in another direction; because they propose to hand over to the Federal Parliament the whole control of the State railway services. We have heard a great deal about Unification and Federation. Some statements of my own have been cited. Those statements, with others, I entirely endorse. I agree with them now. But I say that when you come to deal with this proposal, then you are directly bringing, about Unification. As long as you have the several States in complete independence in their government, you adopt a scheme which is consistent with the Federal idea, and therefore is not Unification. But when in effect you give this Parliament complete control over the acts of administration of the most important functions of the State Governments, you are bringing about Unification. You are not tending towards it, but creating it. We are to have a division' of constitutional powers which has the effect of leaving it to one Parliament, one agency of the people, to direct what should be the terms of employment, whilst another agency of the people, another Parliament, has to find the money for paying the wages so fixed. That is a scheme which might find its place in one of those musical comedies which we sometimes go to see, but not, I should think, in any sober scheme brought forward by earnest and thoughtful statesmen.",29,Moloney Ver Y Good Once That With Regard To This Amendment

111,Mr Roberts,"The honourable membererates with regard to private employment now. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Of course it -does; but I am pointing out that if you are going to place the State Governments an the position of private employers you deprive them of autonomy. which can dictate to the State Governments now what they should pay to employees. Mr W. H . IRVINE -It is quite possible that a State, in the exercise of its own monwealth is to have a power in regard discretion, may authorize any tribunal which it may create to determine the wages which it should pay to certain employees. some cases State Governments may have done that. They have done so. At any moment they may withdraw that power. They may act in this manner without forfeiting one ounce of their own power. But to allow another power to come in and dictate to a State the wages it shall pay, is to strike a blow at the very root of the independence of the States. It has often struck me that one of the problems which presents the greatest difficulty in Democratic forms of government has relation to public finance. If we are ever to have sound and permanent relations at all in the government of this country, or in any country in which there is Democratic representative government, there is one principle above all that must be adhered to, and that is that there must be an inseparable connection between the spending of 'money and the finding of the money to spend. But what we are attempting to do here is to create practically a judicial separation between power and responsibility. follow from that must be apparent. The immediate effect is to deprive the States, which under any Federal scheme are supposed to be autonomous within their own spheres, of the management of their own finances. I can only quote a few figures which show the enormous angle which the administration of the States subtends. Mr Knibbs at page 814 of the Commonwealth Year Book, points out that the whole of the revenues of the States from all sources, including the amounts paid over by the Commonwealth, is .£37,365,000. Out of that the public works revenue is £21,951,000. The great bulk of that is railway revenue. railway £19,000,000 or £20,000,000, or more than half the revenue of the whole of the States. So that from the point of view of ordinary business finance, and from the point of view of preserving the Federal character of our scheme of Government, this is a very serious proposition. But there is another aspect of it which is still more serious. The end to be achieved is, as I have pointed out, fraught with considerable danger. The road by which we are going to approach that end is more dangerous still. The very words in which the amendment of the Constitution is proposed are that the ComtoConciliation and arbitration for the prevention In and settlement of industrial disputes in relation to employment in the service of a State. Whatever may have been thought in 1901, when this Constitution was effected, there can be no doubt whatever as to tlie meaning of those words now. They mean now that we are going to recognise the right of the Public Servants of a State to strike; that we are inviting them to strike; that we propose to create a tribunal which will say to them, "" If you create a dispute which extends beyond the limits of one State, to the railways of various States, we will settle your wages Tor you."" Mr J. H . CATTS A dispute is not necessarily a strike. Mir. W. H . IRVINE A dispute, it is true, is not necessarily a strike, but those words bear a definite meaning. It is now held-althoug h it is almost impossible to define exaith what a dispute is -that the demand of conditions is not a. dispute. Mr J. H . CATTS -I s it not a demand together with a refusal? The disastrous results that will Mr W. H. IRVINE -No. But if you have a demand and a refusal, and the circumstances are such as to bring about a dislocation and a disruption in the relations between employers and employed, and it is likely to lead to serious trouble, you have a dispute. That is the very condition which you are inviting the railway servants of the various States to bring about. The right to strike, of which we have so often hearda term which honourable members opposite are so fond of using-is a right which cannot be said to be of general acceptance even in regard to private employment. I do not say that my honourable friends opposite will not urge that it We may say that the has a general acceptance. But I say that revenue would be about it has not. I would point out that that right has been recognised for very many years in the legislation of many of the",30,Moloney Ver Y Good Once That With Regard To This Amendment

113,Mr Riley,"There are Wages BoardsAustralian States as well as of other civilized countries as a right which cannot be maintained under certain circumstances, even in the case of private employers. There is legislation, I think, in a great many countries, including most of the States, which makes it an offence for persons to conspire by means of a strike to cut off, for instance, the gas supply of a city, or other public utilities which are in the hands of private employers. So that the right of strike which in some cases may be the only effective weapon of employees is a weapon which in other cases they must not use, because their action would constitute an attack on the whole community of which they are a part. the right to strike against the Crown, which represents the whole community,both in form and deed, is a claim to mutiny. I desire to emphasize as strongly as I can the fact that if we are going to couple with the extension of the functions of government in other directions the right of persons in State employment to strike against the Government which employs them, and against the Commonwealth, which sees that they get proper conditions of employment, we shall destroy the whole fabric of government. means that civil servants have no rights.

Mr W. H . IRVINE T h a t is a very cheap sort of criticism, and I do not intend to enter into a dispute with my honourable friend by replying to it. The reai difficulty is that it is beyond the wit of man to forecast all the contingencies which arise in the complex affairs of life. That is why we cannot determine these things more accurately. I will not say any more upon this subject now, but I shall have to say something upon it during the second-reading debate upon the other But Bills. This enlarged commerce power is coupled with the avowed intention on the part of honourable members opposite-that intention has been stated in the most distinct terms by the Attorney-General-to deprive the States of their real control over their own servants. I hope that it will be safe at some future time to extend the trade and commerce power of this Parliament, but I say emphatically that it is not safe to do so at the present time.

In Australia Some two years ago when they were submitted for consideration they were to an. extent coupled, and that fact was seized upon by several honourable members oppoWe ought not, site as an excuse for their opposition to them.

116,Mr Roberts (Adelaide,"Honorarychanged his opinions-we can only conclude that all efforts put forward in extenuation of his attitude are merely the struggles of an individual who is attempting to make the public believe that the ties upon him are to his own liking, and have not been imposed against his will. Consequently, his remarks are seriously discounted by his opening statement that, although his opinion in respect to the trade and commerce powers of this Parliament has not changed, he intends to change his vote. I do not allege that there is any caucus domination on the other side of the chamber, or that there have been influences at work which honourable members opposite dare not make public. But the astounding fact remains that in respect of this Bill there has been a complete somersault on the part of the brainiest member of the Fusion, without a scintilla of excuse, other than that there is a Labour majority in this House, and that that majority will not administer'any particular Act in the way that he thinks it ought' to be administered. I come now to his peculiar statement that at some time extended trade and commerce powers may be given to the Commonwealth, but that the present time is not an opportune one, because a Labour Government happens to hold office. We are here by virtue of the votes of a majority of the people of the Commonwealth, and because our pledges to our constituents were approved by them. To assert that this Parliament has no right to be clothed with a particular power because the electors have expressed their approval of the Labour party in a constitutional manner, is an attack upon the grand principle of adult suffrage. While honourable members opposite may prate of democracy, this is, nevertheless, the second attack which has been made from that side of the chamber -the the Deputy Leader of the Opposition -upon the principle of adult suffrage. Is it not an insult to the electors to say that in their choice at any particular election they should not have the right or power to carry into effect the desires of the majority? I doubt whether the ideas of honourable members opposite will receive the support anticipated when the position is properly explained to the community. It is contended that a minority section of the community shall have greater power of legislation and administration than shall the majority; and surely this is a great Mr Roberts. falling away from the ideal to which we have been living up, or attempting to live up to, during the last few years? It certainly evidences a very dangerous trend on the part of our political opponents. It indicates that if by some catastrophe or mischance they ever again secured power in this Parliament, they would so administer, and possibly legislate, as to destroy rule by majority-to destroy the power of the people, and retain it in the hands of a small section Which arrogates to itself the greater brain power and knowledge of the legislative requirements of the country. I regret very much that there should be this desire displayed to place all the power in the hands of those whose work in the past has not been such as to commend it to the majority. Another proposition of the honourable member was of a most peculiar character. He quoted a statement made by the Attorney-General, and contended that because it was made by that gentleman it constituted a statement of the policy of the Labour party. Mr W. H . IRVINE I did not say so. ber stated that it constituted a policy by which the Labour party was bound, and endeavoured to show that interjections from this side supported that view. The honourable member, however, has a copy of a programme of the policy of the Labour party, and is as well acquainted with it as any one in the Liberal ranks. He knows that the words of any individual member of the party, unless it be the Prime Minister speaking as such, do not commit honourable members on this side of the House. It is an astonishing assertion on the part of the honourable member that a statement by the Attorney-General or myself-if it suits his view at the moment, though views change rapidly in certain cirfirst having emanated from cumstances-commits the -whole of the Labour party, which is Australian in character and formation, while a statement by the Leader of the Opposition, that the policy of the Liberal party is one of "" bold contour "" and "" vital comprehensiveness,"" and so forth, does not commit the Opposition in any shape or form. I suppose that if the honourable member for Flinders himself describes the same identical Liberal policy as a ""gelatinous compound"" it is merely an expression of personal opinion, and does not commit his party in any way. Let us be logical-let us be honourable. If a statement by the Attorney-General cn",32,Moloney Ver Y Good Once That With Regard To This Amendment

Personally, I am not interested in this little matter further than farmer of the West shall receive for his cattle to expose, to the best of my ability, the -Curious line of argument adopted by the honourable member for -Flinders, not be-cause he believes in it, or thinks it fair -and reasonable, or that it accurately displays the position, but because, having turned a somersault of a most complete character in regard to the proposals, before us, he sees the necessity to cloud the issue by references of a character that will not bear examination. Let me, however, refer to this subject of the fixation of prices. The honourable member endeavoured to cast ridicule on the assertion that prices must be fixed in the future-o n any attempt by -the Legislature in this direction-and ' I think there was a touch of scorn in his manner at the time. If prices are to be fixed, who shall fix them? Shall they be fixed by a Government elected by -the people in fair and open combat, knowing what they are doing, and whom they are electing, and understanding the intentions of the persons elected? There are two powers, and only two, which can control prices-the Parliament of the country, and the commercial organizations. -are gradually coming together, and it will depend on the intellect, the patriotism, and the national life of the people whether they will govern themselves or supinely go down under the control of commercial -organizations. These organizations are -controlling prices in every direction, and will, unless checked, continue to more rigidly fix prices to suit themselves. If it farmers of South Australia, however, if be incontrovertible that there are these two forces, one or other of which must fix prices, which is the preferable? Is it the people's representatives, elected openly in honour, who shall do this in their interests, -or shall we submit to the domination of corrupt trusts-to institutions of the characState by its method of fixing prices. If ter that have ruined thousands, nay, scores of thousands, in other countries, and are raising their heads in no uncertain way in this land? Charles Edward Russell, in his recent book, The Greatest Trust in the World, tells us all about the Beef Trust, which the honourable member for Moreton' aays he would welcome in Queensland. By the way, are we to take that expression of opinion of the honourable member as committing the whole Liberal party to his views? Mr Russell in his book says of the Beef TrustIt fixes, for its own profit, the prices the and hogs, and the prices the butcher of the East shall charge for his meat. It fixes the price that the grower of California shall receive for his fruit, and the price the labourer of New York shall pay for his breakfast. It can affect the cost of living in Aberdeen and Geneva as easily as in Chicago and New York. It has in the last three years increased for its own benefit the expenses of every household in America. It controls or influences the prices of one-half the food consumed by the nation. It has its share in the proceeds of more commodities of daily consumption than all other trusts, combinations, and monopolies together, and the prices of these it seeks to augment for its own profit. It can make, within certain limits, the price of wheat, of corn, of oats, what it pleases; it will shortly be able to control the price of every loaf of bread. Sitting suspended from 1 to' 2.JO p.m. ber for Flinders sought to pour ridicule upon the suggestion that prices may in the future be regulated. WhatI have read from a book, entitled The Greatest Trust in the World, indicates very clearly that prices are being regulated, and that they are being fixed to the injury of a whole nation. What is more, the trust referred to is making its These two forces operations international, and, as it has robbed and murdered in its own country, we may safely assume that it will rob ana murder as ruthlessly in other countries to which it owes 110 allegiance. Efforts will be made, especially when the farming com-' munity is being addressed, to make it believed that there will be an attempt to regulate prices to their detriment. Ask the prices were not fixed to their detriment. A wheat ring, composed of a few merchants, strong opponents of the Labour party and of the referenda proposals two years ago, in one year stole £170,000 from the wheat-growers of the prices are to be fixed, shall they be fixed by a wheat Ting which cares not an iota for the farmers, or shall they be fixed by the farmers by means of the public institutions of the country? A little while ago I read in the press a two-line advertisement, stating that on and after a certain date the price of sugar would be increased. There was no indication of the extent of the increase, no signature, no name or address, yet the consumers had to pay the",33,Moloney Ver Y Good Once That With Regard To This Amendment
118,Mr Roberts,"The honourable memincrease, to justify which there had been no raising of duty and no legislative or industrial act. The power which fixes the prices of sugar said that there should be an increase, and there was an increase. Ask the consumers generally whether it would not be better for them to have a hand in the fixing of prices than to have prices fixed by unseen commercial organizations whose members are utterly callous of the public welfare. A short time ago I read in the Age a statement by a gentleman named Peacock, representing the jam manufacturing industry, to the effect that the purchasers of sugar are required to pay 30s. a ton more for imported sugar than they could import it for, or else a penalty of ios. a ton on the Australian sugar they buy. It is necessary for them to take the Australian sugar in order to obtain rebate on the. exportation of jam, and therefore they are forced to pay these extra prices. Let me read some of the evidence given before a Royal Commission inquiring into Tasmanian matters by a witness named Alexander C. Gillespie, a miller, of Burnley. His evidence in reply to question 7415 and succeeding questions wasIs there a Flour-Millers Association in Melbourne ?-Yes. Does your Association regulate prices?-W c try to. The price at which you shall sell in Victoria principally?-Yes, not outside at a l l . You have a free hand outside Victoria?-Yes, absolutely. Therefore, we are to understand that in Victoria flour is sold at so much per ton, as the Association of millers agree?-Yes, that is right; but I must add, that we have not all the millers in our Association. You can easily understand, therefore, that our Association has not very great strength. Does the Association include some of the most prominent millers in Victoria?-Yes, all the largest millers. I ask honourable members whether it is better that the Millers Association should fix the prices of flour than that Parliament should do so? Let me again quote from Russell's book, The Greatest Trust in the World. Attempts will be made to deceive our farming community into voting against these proposals, which are being put forward for their protection, and to give them greater powers of self-governmentListen to what the farmers of America have been subjected to by the Meat Trust, which is slowly, but surely, spreading its tentacles over other parts of the worldThe total losses of the cattle-feeders in Iowa in 1904 are computed at $12,500,000.

Even in time of national business depression and panic there has been no such record as this. Do the graziers of Australia wish to be ruined ? Do we wish to see our smaller banks closed by those institutions? Or, shall we alter the Constitution so that Parliament may have the power to control the depredations of the trusts? On page 114 1 find this passageAnd is this the f u l l tale of the evil done to the producing industries of the West? Good sir, it is no more than a sample. The ruined stockmen and looted farmers, the bankruptcies that ran into the thousands, the suicides, the wrecked families, the unhappy homes, make up a sum of iniquity destructive to any optimism. The optimism of honourable members opposite is such that they would permit these institutions to establish themselves in this country, rather than give the Federal Parliament power to restrict tlieir wickedness. Let me quote again from the same workHere is a great criminal organization, utterly illegal in its inception, utterly illegal in its operation, defying the courts, an active and pestilent public enemy. The works of this organization are to increase to every household the cost of living, to decrease to a very large number of producers the normal income from their toil. May I give two more quotations which are significant in the light of what transpired during the investigations of the Sugar CommissionIn 1896 the contribution of Armour and Company to the Republican National Campaign Fund was $400,000 in three checks Some day we shall see that the smugly-disguised treason that accepts from the public enemy benefits, position, and campaign subscriptions, is far more hateful and far more perilous than the treason that fires upon the flag. The attempt was made to pour ridicule on the remark of the Attorney-General that if you bring down prices, profits, and rents, you will be doing fhe right thing. When I pour ridicule on a statement, it is because I am opposed to it, because my views are contrary to those of the speaker. Are we to suppose that the honourable member for Flinders, and those with him, wish to raise prices, profits, and rents? I know from bitter experience, platform statements notwithstanding, that the underlying intention is to reduce wages and the remuneration given for the exercise of brain or muscle. If ridicule is poured on the suggestion that it would be well to bring down prices, profits, and rents, does that mean' that it is the intention of the Liberals to increase them? If so, it is well that the people should understand the position. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The honourable member should keep this stuff for the platform. ber was cool and calm when he spoke; he should remain cool and calm when the natural rejoinder to his utterances is being made. the people now suffering enough from high rents? charging higher rents ? tification for the extortionate profits which are being made and for the prices that are charged on many articles? this side be subjected to ridicule and contumely because a member of our party suggests that the tendency to increase prices should be checked by legislative action? To pour ridicule on that suggestion is to pour ridicule on the Leader of the Opposition, who was the first man in the Federal arena, not merely to suggest or propose, but to have placed on the statute-book, a measure fixing prices. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Conditionall y on a benefit being given by the State. jection. marks of the Attorney-General to suggest that he would not accept conditions? What he said was torn from its context and distorted for political purposes. one sentence to be torn from a public addross and misrepresented, with a view to inflaming the minds of the people? I hope that the standard of our public life will be too high to permit that, and that in the approaching electoral contest we shall not drag issues in the mud, but shall discuss them openly and fairly. I shall have no fear of the result. Notwithstanding all the eloquence that may be used by our opponents, notwithstanding all the contributions that may be made by the trusts to support them, notwithstanding all the literature that has been put under the doors, the people will recognise that in taking this power they"" are taking greater powers of self-government than they have now, and powers that it is essential to their own interests that they should exercise. Argus of a gentleman in this House descending to spade work. member for Flinders will know what the reference meant. should have been an attempt to descend to what might be called petty [218] Police Court practice in dealing with the use of the word "" monopoly,"" by first obtaining from an honourable member by way of interjection the statement of fact that no one man can accurately or properly define the word "" monopoly,"" and then by turning round and saying to the Government and their supporters, "" Y o u are proposing to put into the ConI n the name of Heaven, are not stitution a word that you cannot define, and the meaning of which you do not Is there any justification for understand."" Eveni f these proposals b t Is there any jusapproved we shall not put into the Constitution the word ""monopoly."" Such an inference as that sought to be drawn should Shall we on be beneath the dignity of any member of this House, much less one who has had so much experience as the honourable member for Flinders has had in the higher Courts, where, he knows f u l l well, such an attempt to mislead would be to no purpose. It is not even suggested that we should place in the Constitution the word ""monopoly."" What is proposed is that the Commonwealth Parliament in the future, however it may be constitutedwhether the Labour party be on this or the Opposition side of the House, exercising I accept the interwhat should be its inalienable right-shal l Was there anything in the rehave power by resolution carried in both Houses in one and the same session to define what a monopoly is. Then, and only then, can a clear and unmistakable deIs finition of the word be given by a majority of the representatives of the people elected to this Parliament by the vote of the people in a constitutional way. Circumstances may then arise to affect the opinions ot even honourable members of the Opposition to such an extent as to enable us to get in both Houses an absoI f that is done, lutely unanimous decision as tp what is a "" monopoly."" Buti f that position were to arise to-morrow morning-if every member, of this Parliament decided that a certain calling or industry was a monopoly inimical to the welfare of the community,the National Parliament would be absolutely impotent. We should have to go about our ordinary avocations and see the people injured, robbed, and fleeced without power to extend to them any protection. All that we are asking is that We read the other day in the in the future a majority of the members of this Parliament shall have power to deThe honourable cide that a particular calling or industry is a monopoly injurious to the public, and I regret that there then, and not until then, will it be possible for that industry to be taken over by the",34,Moloney Ver Y Good Once That With Regard To This Amendment

I hope that we shall not be subjected again to such references. Mr W. member is misrepresenting what I said. the honourable member's correction. Mr W. H . IRVINE I invite the honorment, acting under a power conferred upon able member to look at the Bill entitled, !

If his reference had relation to the Bill under which we seek power to control monopolies, then the position must practically remain unchanged. thing that is of use to the country? The honourable member himself has declaimed in very specific terms against monopolies. Mr W. H . IRVINE That is another matter. me of misleading the House, and will not withdraw the statement. gret. explanation that in speaking of the impossibility of defining the word "" monopoly,"" he had reference to its use in the Bill relating to the control of monopolies. Is that correct? Mr W. H . IRVINE -No. used in the Bill are "" trusts, combinations, and monopolies in relation to the production, manufacture, or supply of goods or the supply of services."" It was that provision to which I referred. ber says that his reference was to the prdposal to add words to our Constitution giving this Parliament power to legislate for the regulation of trusts, combinations, and monopolies in relation to the production, manufacture, or supply of goods or the supply of services. well that the Constitution must be read as a whole, and not in individual parts. What must be the natural outcome of this proposal ? Eveni f the Parliament decided that a particular industry was a monopoly, it would still be possible for it to say, H . IRVINE The honourable "" Although this is a monopoly, we should not be justified in nationalizing it, but we shall more effectively control it . "" The definition would be precisely the same. It does not follow that because this Parliait by the Constitution, declared that a certain industry was a monopoly, that it must proceed to nationalize that monopoly. The position is merely that if this power be granted to us we shall be able to nationalize a monopoly if the people desire that course to be followed. It means that we may declare an industry to be a monopoly, and, that having done that, we shall have power to control it. Will the honourable member for Flinders say that monopolies are beneficial, and should be left uncontrolled? Will he say that a few .persons calling themselves capitalists ought to have power to come together and to completely control The honourable member undoubtsome manufacture, and that the Parliament of the nation should have no power to interfere with them, although they might be operating just as do the iniquitous trusts to which I have referred? Is this ParliaIs a monopoly somement to remain impotent while the people are being interfered with in this disgraceful manner ? I venture to suggest that the people on this occasion will give a vote vastly different from that which they gave when this question was submitted to them The honourable member accuses a little while ago, and that they will do so, notwithstanding that some members of the Opposition have decided to change their votes, although they have not changed their I accept the honourable member's opinions. I wish now to refer briefly to references that have been made to opinions expressed by Mr Bryce. A quotation was made from his excellent work, Studies in History The words and Jurisprudence, with the object of conveying the impression that that distinguished gentleman had said that the Commonwealth of Australia had greater power than had the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada. When the quotation was made. I said. that only one sentence had been quoted, when two should have been given. I said then that it was an abuse of quotation, but the same sentence was quoted by another honourable member of the Opposition.

There the quotation ended, although those who made it knew that it was a reference not to the actual, but to the enumerated powers of bhe two Parliaments. might possess twenty enumerated powers, and yet not be nearly so powerful as a man possessing one actual power. members of the Opposition knew, in making this quotation, that they were offering a gross insult to one of the Empire's greatest men. which shows that the reference was to the enumerated powers, readsI need not enumerate the powers grantedforty-two in number-for they will be found in sections 52 and 53 of the Australian. Constitution. We have forty-two enumerated powers, whereas the Dominion Parliament has but twenty-nine. The reference was to that fact. If the Opposition desired to be fair, why did they refrain from quoting the f o l lowing passage, which appears at page 529 of the same workAustralia leaves to the States all residuary powers (i.e., powers not expressly granted). Canada withholds them from the Provinces, and vests them in the Dominion. . . . Australia gives to the Federal Government no right whatever to interfere with State Statutes. Canada invests the Dominion Government with a veto on Provincial legislation by placing the Governor General, as regards such legislation, in the place that our proposals, if carried, will widen which the ""Queen holds as regards Dominion legislation. Mr W. H . IRVINE able member would not look at me when he makes that quotation. I did not make the quotation in question. friend's references were drawn from his imagination; I am quite sure-tfiat he would not descend to misquotations for any one. If further proof be needed of my statement as to what Mr Bryce desired to convey,' it is to be found at page 530, where we have the statement that in Canada the Federal Government has more power-o r at least a wider range of action-tha n has the Parliament of the Commonwealth. It is to be regretted that the Opposition should be so devoid of argument that they have to descend to methods of this kind-method s which, I shall not say would be discredited in a fifth-rate debating society, but which -would not be tolerated by any debating society. .We federated some years ago to widen the powers of self-government possessed by the people of Australia, and it cannot be denied that in the measures that [218]2 we are submitting to the people for their acceptance there are embodied proposals which must undoubtedly widen our powers of self-government as a Commonwealth people. In addition, we shall be able to exercise a power of self-government which A man tlie people in the States at present cannof exercise.

The succeeding sentence, attention of the Opposition, but I know from long Parliamentary experience that if the Opposition could fire a bullet into my argument, or pierce my armour by an interjection, then, no matter how vivid the imagination that suggested it, an interjection would be made with lightning-like rapidity. I am justified in the circumstances, therefore, in calling attention to their silence. Their silence indicates that there is no possibility of refutation of my statement. If it can be refuted, let it be refuted here rather than at Aspendale, the Tweed River, Horsham, or elsewhere, where honourable members of the Opposition address audiences, who, because of their excessive labours in other directions are unable, perhaps, to arm themselves to reply to their statements. Here is the place, and now is the time, for them to refute my statement if they can.

When he was asked by the authorities in South Africa what form of federal government should be adopted in that country, Mr Garran was instructed to draw up a memorandum on the subject. He did so at the dictation of the then Attorney General, the honourable member for Darling Downs. That document clearly said an effect) "" ""Refrain from these delimitations because of the impossibility of working satisfactorily under them, and take for your federal union the full power over trade and commerce."" When the memorandum was submitted to the Attorney General of the day-the honourable member for Darling Downs-h e wrote a footnote to it stating, "" T have carefully perused this document, and I entirely agree with it . "" After it had received that approval, the memorandum was forwarded to the IPrime Minister, the honourable member for Ballarat, who, as the Leader of the Government, despatched it to South Africa as his opinion after eight years' experience of /the working of our Constitution. But yesterday the honourable member repudiated it in circumstances that cannot be other than discreditable to him. When these Bills dealing with proposed alterations of the Constitution were submitted a few days ago, there at once arose a solid -phalanx of legal gentlemen in opposition to them. There arose the honourable member for Ballarat, who is a lawyer; the honourable member for Darling Downs, who is -a lawyer; the honourable member for Angas, -who is a lawyer; the honourable member for Bendigo, who is a lawyer; and the honourable member for Kooyong, who is a lawyer.

NeedI remind honourable members' that Canada and South Africa possess this trade and commerce power? If we look to Germany and Switzerland, we find that they possess it, too. Yet chaos has not overtaken them. Those countries have not been devastated because their Parliaments have this power.

The sum of £46,500 was spent in obtaining the opinion of the people on these proposals two years ago, and a majority of 250,000 rejected them. If we adopted the reasoning of the Attorney-General, we might see no harm in these proposals, but the real effect of them must be looked for elsewhere. Last night the honourable member for New England addressed the Trades Hall Council on the high cost of living. He said that the consumers were paying the rents of thousands of shops, when a delegate interjected, "" We have to pay members of Parliament big salaries, too."" The overlapping of When he had recovered his breath after that interruption, the honourable member went on to sayCo-operation was the method by which the high cost of living should be dealt with, but he had come to the conclusion that the voluntary system of co-operation was too slow. There was a better machine-the referenda. Australians were really a co-operative society, and ' if they decided to do their own storekeeping there was nothing to stop them. If they were to free themselves from the curse of the high cost of living, if they were going to say "" Hands of f "" to the waste, which was the biggest thief of all, they must take over the steam-boat services and obtain control of the whole means of distribution within the Commonwealth. That is the whole aim of the Labour party. It wishes to obtain control of the whole means of distribution throughout the Commonwealth. Everything will have to be nationalized. It was a straightforward, honourable thing for the honourable member for New England to say this plainly. press his own views. I stand for it. George Graham, the Victorian Minister of Agriculture, advocates the establishment of a line of State-owned steamers. posal to nationalize the whole means of distribution, and it explains the object of Labour troubles itself 'little the Labour party in seeking these powers. Their desire is that Socialism shall be at once brought about. In seeking for the motives of the Government in submitting these propositions to the people, we have to look to other than the diplomatic leaders for information, and it is from such an outspoken statement as that made by the honourable member for New England that we gather the true inwardness of things. Here we have a scheme to bring about Socialism' in our own time. Honourable members opposite also desire to extend to every enterprise the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court. Even the State railway employees are to come within its scope, so that while the States will fix freights and fares, the Commonwealth will practically fix the wages to be paid.

The appearance of the American Beef Trust in Brisbane has. caused a flutter in the trade. We are told that the influence of that Trust in the United States of America has been of the very worse character. I dare say that it has been, but a friend of mine who managed large meat works for us at Rockhampton tells me that since the American' Meat Combine commenced operations here owners of sheep and cattle have obtained immensely better prices than they could There is secure before. The operation of such a combination must, of course, be carefully watched. It has been said that there is a, combine amongst those at present engaged 1 in 'the meat industry in Australia. If there is, I can only say that none of them have made big fortunes out of the business, whereas they have certainly done the country a great service in providing our farmers and producers with another market. bines constitute part of the stock arguments of the other side. the position. We are constantly being told that monopolies and combines exist here, but it is difficult to find any trace of them. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company might, perhaps, be regardedi as thenearest approach to a monopoly that we have in Australia, but the sugar planters do not seem to throw much dirt at it. We sugar in an exotic sort of way, since we are producing sugar by white labour to compete with that grown by black labour at much less cost.

Some of them may be based on fact, but they are grossly exaggerated. I fail to see why more powers are required., unless it be for some such sinister purpose as I have indicated, and which the honourable member for New England has admitted. If combines exist in Australia, why do we not exhaust our present powers to deal with them before we seek for any extension? tice Isaacs held the Coal Vend to be a combination to the detriment of the public, but the High Court, on appeal, declared that it was not, and that, instead of being a bad, it was a good thing. The Attorney-General complained that we had no power to deal with this iniquitous Vend. -We have first of all to consider whether at is an iniquitous Vend. that it was. far as I can ascertain, our powers are ample.

People oversea were surprised at their action. The honourable member for Bourke has affirmed that this Parliament has reached the end of its usefulness, unless it secures an extension of its powers. But I would point out that the taking over of the State debts is in itself quite a sufficient work to occupy us for the term of a whole Parliament. Let us make a determined effort to deal with that problem.' Let us devise a. scheme for the purpose, and throw upon the State Government which"" will not agree to it the responsibility for its aotion. But instead of doing that, we are told that the States will not give us this and will not give us that. The fact is that they are afraid of the present Government. The Labour party has pracIn the only tically been in power ever since the inception of the Federation, with the exception ' of a couple of lucid intervals when Sir George Reid held office, and when the Fusion Government were intrusted with the control of the affairs of this country for a brief period. It is the fear on the part of the States that they will be wiped out by this Parliament which has ..alarmed them. Their alarm is, in my opinion, well grounded. We know perfectly well what happened recently in connection with their Savings Banks. Nothing was working better in the interests of the people than the State Savings Banks. Then the Commonwealth established a Savings Bank of its own-. It said to the States, "" We are going to take over the savings of the people, but we will make an arrangement with you.""My advice to the electors will be to vote "" No "" to every one of these proposals, because the powers which they seek to confer upon this Parliament are not required. The people of Australia do not desire the means of distribution to be nationalized. They want to be permitted to do their work in their own way. They do not wish to be dry-nursed in any direction.

210,Mr Wise (Gippsland) [4.8],"In subnow dealing have been incorporated in six Bills, in order to meet an objection which was raised when only two measures claimed our attention. On that occasion I stated that it would make no difference whether the proposals to enlarge our legislative powers were embodied in four Bills or in one, because the Opposition would counsel the electors to reject the whole of them. Their attitude now affirms the accuracy of my. forecast. It is very difficult to please themWhen proposals to amend our Constitution were embodied in one Bill, the Leader of the Opposition told the electors that the Government were seeking to bulldoze them. Now that they have been incorporated in six Bills, we are told that the Government have '' put the Opposition in a hole-"" It appears to me that if a Ministry are of opinion that amendments should be made in our Constitution, it is their duty to ask the people to sanction those amendments. Should the electors reject their proposals, the Government will then be able to say that they have done all that it was incumbent upon them to do. But this Government say that on the last occasion the electors rejected their proposals because they were misled, and that consequently another opportunity should be afforded them of saying "" Yes"" or "" No"" to those proposals. To my mind, there is a very great deal to be said in support of the contention that the position was misrepresented on the last occasion. I have closely followed every general election in Victoria during the past forty-five years, and I have no hesitation in saying that never before was such gross misrepresentation indulged in as was indulged in by the opponents of the Government proposals at the last referenda. I will mention only two or three examples. Speaking in South Gippsland, upon the Constitution Alteration (Monopolies) Bill, Mr Livingston, M.L.A., saidI f this Bill were passed the Government could take over a man's land or business, recompensing him as it thought fit. He completely ignored the fact that the terms upon which the Commonwealth could take over any business must be ""just terms,"" those words having been inserted at the instance of the honourable member for Flinders. Mr Livingston further saidShire Councils would be under the control of the Federal Parliament. to ask the Shire Councils where they are going to get their grants from ? Fancy sending a deputation to Yass-Canberra. Mr Wise. governed by a body of men who will sit thousands of miles away. Of course, that was a wild exaggeration, especially in view of the fact that Gippsland lies closer to the Federal Capital than does any other portion of Victoria* He continuedYou would be abroad so long that your w if e would have reasonable grounds for a divorce. These were the sort of statements that were made for the purpose of deceiving the public. ThenI find that one of the lecturersof the Women's National League, Miss Maize, in speaking at Camperdowngave a harrowing picture of what would happen if the referenda were carried. She warned her audience that there would be a great deal of impersonation as some of their opponents would probably vote eight or nine times. If such a dreadful thing as the referendum proposals were carried, I would not be' surprised if it resulted in civil war. Under Socialism the home would' be broken up and the children taken away from, the parents by the Government. What a very different way that was o£ dealing with the matter from the way which was suggested by the honourable member for Angas, who, in speaking in this. House, saidI t is our duty to keep clear of party prejudice, in our endeavour to educate the people upon, the subject. I believe that they invariably actright when they apprehend correctly. They do not always apprehend correctly because we dc* not allow or help them to do so. That was a fair admission which the honourable member made in his place in this Parliament. He had previously made the same statement in addressing an audience in AdelaideWe must endeavour to put the issues fairlyand as clearly as we can before them. When I discussed this matter on a former occasion, I absolutely refused to view it from a party stand-point, and I decline to do so now. I held the same opinions then? as did the honourable member for Flinders, and I hold them now I have not been brought under the lash of any whip to induce me to change my views. On that occasion, the honourable member for Flinders said we ought to approach it without regard to politicar prejudices or the state of parties in this. HouseI t is our duty to put out of our minds who sits on the Government benches., and who on the Opposition. Mark what is the result if we do notI f we f a i l to do so we shall f a i l in our performance of the most sacred trust delivered to. . . He would like us by the people. What did the honourable member do toYou will be day? He went a little bit further on this subject when speaking in this House on the last occasion. He repeated these words more strongly in Committee; and it is specially desirable to quote them after what he has said to-day. Referring to the Unification question, he saidThat is sufficient in itself to show not only that the power over trade and commerce, which this clause purposes to give, is not Unification, or an element in Unification, hut that it is not a step towards .Unification-that we should have to go very much further on the road before we even approached the position in which Canada now stands; and it is admitted that the Canadian Government is not only a Federation, but one of the most successful Federations of the world. So much, then, for the argument that in itself this proposal is a step towards Unification. These are the words to which I particularly desire to call attention, in view of the honourable member's remark to-dayI have nothing to do with the motives of honourable members, or some of them, on the other side, who support this measure, and who say that they are in favour of Unification, or think that this is a step in that direction ; we have to even with limited powers let us have it . Theredo with the effect of the constitutional change proposed, and with nothing else. sidered on its merits. Mr W. H . IRVINE -We ought .to deal with it on its merits, and not allow party considerations, or what we may suspect or believe to be the motives of some honourable members opposite, to influence our true and direct decision according to our own judgment. Could any condemnation of the position which the honourable member has taken up to-day be more emphatic than that contained in his own words ? When the honorAgain he saidable member for Darling Downs was speaking at Toowoomba, he saidThe proposed alterations of the Constitution sliould not be made a party question. A nation like this should arise superior to party considerations. The Constitution or machinery of Government was not framed merely for party purposes, it was framed for the welfare of the nation. Therefore, when we are asked to deal with the Constitution, patriotism, and statesmanmust necessarily be constitutional changes suited ship alike suggest that we should consider the proposals from the point of view of how they will affect the Government under which we live. These were positions one and I certainly did admire them, and they were the recommendations that I folto allow of any necessary development that may lowed. simply whether the Federal Parliament, as the Australian agents for the Australian of being amended. population, should be intrusted with the exercise of the powers embodied in the Sir R.

In the first place, we have honorward form may remain the same. able members like the honourable member for Bendigo, and, to a certain extent, the honourable member for Ballarat, who regard this Constitution as something sacred, which should hardly be touched-a t any rate, the beautiful Federal idea should nor, in their opinion, be interfered with. It is notorious that, from the time that Federation was first spoken of, it was recognised that we had to attain our ends step by step. At the Melbourne Conference in 1890, the present Chief Justice Griffith"", referring to the Federal Council and what it had been able to do, saidWe did then all that we could see to be practicable and desirable. . . . NowI have no doubt of it being desirable, and I believe it to be practicable to do more. . . If we cannot get all let us get as much as we can. Every step in advance is something gained. If we get a Federal GovernmentI wish to emphasize the word "" Federal ""fore I would desire to go en as far as we can goMr Deakin saidI t is perfectly true that there must be a division of authority, that some of the powers of the local Governments will have to be transferred to the Federal Government, but the judges of the powers to be given to either body must not be either the local Governments with their jealousies, or the central Government, with its ambitions. The judgment must come from those whom both exist only to serve, from the people themselves. Yet the Constitution will, after all, however admirable, not be a final Constitution. . . . Let that Constitution be what it may, if in any respect it fails to meet the needs and wishes of. the people of Australia, they will still have the right, and certainly should be specially endowed with the power, of moulding it from time to time, more and more into harmony with their views and desires.

213,Sir Samuel Griffith,"Everythin g i""s capabltThen, turning to the actual Constitution, we find that, at the last sitting of the Convention, when it was adopted, the leader, Sir Edmund Barton, and also the honourable member for Ballarat, spoke on the final motion. The honourable member for Ballarat saidIn this Constitution, although much is written, ing the honourable member for Ballarat much remains unwritten, and has to be supplied out of our experience of our own people and our working methods in political affairs. Can we have any doubt as to how and whence the forces of union will be supplied. . . . . After all, and much as it accomplishes, this Constitution is but the framework and ground plan of the nation that is to be. It is, perhaps, by a wise discretion, that we have insufficiently and inadequately dealt with the difficulties with which we are at present perplexed. It is enough that we have provided the means of enabling those to deal with them who will be far better -qualified for the task than we are. 'That is a very candid admission that we must expect amendments to be made in the -Constitution. amendments be made? We have the distinct statement by all those I have quoted that the document could not be perfect-that we had taken as much as we could get, and had given the public ample power to amend-as Sir Richard Baker said, "" mould and modify ""-the Constitution to suit their views and sentiments at the moment. Nobody could have imagined for a moment that amendments would be of a restrictive character-that Federal members would go to the people and say, as the honourable member for Swan, in his days of nationalism, put it, "" Take back the power or any of the powers that you gave us."" Every amendment must be in the direction of giving more power; and this was contemplated -.by the framers of the Constitution. It is very remarkable that this extra power over industrial matters was asked for in the 'very first session of the Federal Parliament. That, I think, is a strong piece of evidence that, from the start, this Parliament was dissatisfied in this respect. BeforeI come to that point, however, I should like to say that many of those people who are complaining about the proposed amendments, complained, when the Constitution was framed, that there was not greater freedom to make amendments. At present, any proposed amendment must be carried by an absolute majority in both Houses; but one of the last proposals made at the last Convention was one by the present Mr Justice Isaacs, to the effect that, if au amendment of the Constitution passed one House, and was even rejected Mr Wiie. by the other, it could go to the people, and, if accepted, would become law. Who were the members of the Convention who voted for that proposal? Amongst them were the honourable member for Bendigo, the honourable member for Ballarat, Sir George Reid, and the late Sir Frederick Holder. Could any of us imagine to-day, on hearand the honourable member for Bendigo protesting so strongly against the proposed amendments, that their grievance, when the Constitution was framed, was that an amendment could not be carried without the consent of the other Chamber? But the Constitution has never been treated as sacred. The very first amendment was made at the instance of the honourable member for Ballarat ih 1906; and a very trifling amendment it was. It was simply to provide that the elections for the Parliament should take place in the In what direction would first half instead of the second half of the year; and that was merely to benefit a certain part of the community in the southern parts of Australia, while simply ignoring those in the north. Then, in 1907-8, there was a proposal made by the honourable member for Ballarat to adopt what is known as the new Protection; and, again, in 1910 there were two proposed amendments submitted by the Fusion Government. One of those amendments, in connection with the payment.of 25s. per head to the States, was absolutely unnecessary; and, therefore, I may say it was a wanton exercise of the power of amendment. We find from the pamphlet prepared for the Fusion Government by the honourable member for Angas, which saw the light for the first time two years ago, that he actually advised two further amendments; and it is, therefore, nonsense to talk about the Constitution being something that should not be lightly tampered with. There is a great cry made about the Federal ideal; and when speaking on the subject, two years ago, the honourable member for Ballarat saidA Federal Government in the true sense of the term is the most complex and delicate form of Government yet devised by humanity. It represents the highest ideal, and requires the most political culture of the most civilized races of the world. I am afraid that the people who could work such a piece of machinery do not exist anywhere in.the world; at any rate, in my opinion, it is ""too complex for, the Austra-. lian of the twentieth century. The honor : able member for Flinders made reference to' the question of Unification. I entirely agree with that honourable member that there is no magic in the words "" Federation "" or "" Unification."" We are told to-day that we must uphold the present Constitution, but two years ago the honourable member saidI cannot think of any better way of upholding the Constitution than by rationally, sanely, and after f u l l consideration, using the powers which the Constitution gives us. It appears to me that what we require is a Constitution as simple as it is possible to make it-on e that the people are able to understand, and not one that even lawyers are unable to understand. whether our Constitution is broad or narrow, depends entirely on the way in which it is construed by the High Court, and that depends on the trend of thought of those who for the time form that Court. It is admitted to this day that the American Constitution would have been absolutely unworkable if it had not been for the daring decisions of Chief Justice Marshall, who practically legislated for the people without any responsibility. Such a Constitution as that is, to my mind, most objectionable. It is far better to trust the Parliament, which is responsible to the people, with all the necessary power, than to trust to the accident of the occupancy of the High Court Bench, and its trend of thought, without legislative responsibility. That position was put forcibly at the time of the last referenda by Mr Watt, the present Premier of Victoria, in the following wordsYou cannot separate responsibility and power, for power without responsibility leads to tyranny. . . I am confident you will say, "" We believe our Parliamentary institutions, responsive as they are to the popular will and welfare, may best be trusted rather than judicial institutions from which in the past the people have had to wring their freedom step by step from reluctant Judges. . . You will find that Judges are just lawyers, with a little more education, and you cannot rely on getting absolute justice from Courts. You get law, which is not always the same as justice. We want such a Constitution as will enable the people to achieve, so far as they can by legislation, the ideal contained in the words of Ruskin, who saidThe world is so regulated by laws of Providence that a man's labour well applied is always amply sufficient to provide him during his l if e with all things needful to him, and not only with these, but with many pleasant objects of luxury, and yet farther, to procure him large intervals of healthful rest and serviceable leisure. There is another matter that should not be lost sight of. These proposed amendments are only grants of power. There ajre two kinds of amendments-on e is what we may call legislative amendments, which take effect at once, as the Financial Agreement would have done; while the other gives grants of power, the exercise of which, to a greater or less extent, depends on Parliament at a later day. An objection taken to the proposals of the Government is that the powers which are asked for will be abused. The honourable member for Flinders stated that objection very strongly. But to say that a power may be abused At present, is not to give a sufficient reason for refusing to grant it. The Parliaments of the States have all the powers for which we are asking, and what protection have the people against their abuse? The protection that they would have against our abuse of those powers. Should this or any other Parliament abuse its powers, or use them in a way of which the public did not approve, the majority in office would be unseated at the next election, and another majority more in accord with the popular feeling would take its place. What an enormous amount of misrepresentation there would be at the present time if we were asking for power to make laws in respect to divorce and marriage ! Yet we have that power in the Constitution, and, to our shame be it said, we have never exercised it, although we have possessed it for eleven years. The trade and commerce power, as has been said by the honourable member for Flinders, and by Mr Wade, in New South Wales, is the key to the other powers, and without it their usefulness will be much restricted. As the honourable member for Flinders said, we cannot divide an organic whole, especially when it is one of increasing complexity. When last night the honourable member for Bendigo said that no case had been made out for the proposed amendment, I interjected that the honourable member for Flinders had made out a very strong case, and the honourable member for Bendigo evidently knew bhat that was so, because he replied in a very snappy and ill-natured manner. The honourable member for Angas, in a paper which he wrote for the Fusion Government, saidA question that sooner or later may have to be reconsidered in the light of judicial decisions and the new conditions is the apportionment of the commerce and industrial powersHe then proceeded to quote Professor Governor General, and thence to the SecreWoodrow Wilson, the new President of the tary of State for the Colonies, and so to United States of America, who is a strong the Governor of the Transvaal, and to the States Righter, but who has, nevertheless, public men there, contained statements of had to admit thatIt is now no longer possible to frame any simple imagined that he signed that document or comprehensive definition of commerce.

How that admission differs from the statewrote to the honourable member asking him ment of the honourable member for Benfor information on the subject. His letter digo last night, that there are two clearlyis dated 3rd July, 1908, and is in these defined jurisdictions, that of the States, termsand that of the Commonwealth. The honDear Mr Deakin, orable member for Angas goes on to sayBut the facts have to be faced. The division of a particular power may lead to indefiniteness as to sphere, harassing litigation that establishes no guiding principle, duplication and clashing of machinery, continual strain on the relations between commercial organizations and the State, and between capital and labour. A most striking fact in this connection is one to which reference has already been made, namely, that the Deakin-Lyne Government recommended the people of South Africa to give an unlimited trade and commerce power to the central Government When the honourable member for Ballarat was speaking the other day, the honourable member for Adelaide interjected, "" Is that why the honourable member advised South Africa to adopt these terms?"" and I was astonished to hear the replyI did not so advise South Africa. imprimatur of the honourable member's Government, and through his office. But it was neither drafted by me nor revised by me. At this distance of time. I shall not say it was read. I hope it was. If so, it did not catch my eye. The first time my attention was directed to the phrase in the document I objected to it absolutely. It was so unlike the honourable member for Ballarat to disclaim responsibility in the matter, because if he has a fault, it is that he is too ready to assume responsibility that is not his. We have known him here to accept responsibility for most trivial occurrences for which he was not responsible; for instance, the wretched supper and cab incident, with which he had nothing to do, not being here at the time. It would not have occurred had he known anything about it. because he was head of the Government at the time. Yet he deliberately says that a document which went from him to the Mr Wise. which he had no knowledge. Can it be Not only was there a formal request nels, but the Premier of the Transvaal You will , no doubt, have observed the references in the public press to the resolutions adopted by the recent Intercolonial Conference in Pretoria on the subject of the closer union of the British Self-governing Colonies of South Africa, and the proposal to appoint a National Convention to consider and report on the most desirable form of South African union, and to prepare a draft Constitution. The resolutions have been adopted by the South African Parliaments, and the Convention will probably meet in Durban about the beginning of October. I am very anxious to obtain the fullest information possible, and with this in view,. I cabled you to-day, requesting you to inform me f u l ly upon any matters concerning the Commonwealth and State Constitutions of Australia, which, as a result of experience, are likely to call for special consideration in the drafting of any form of Constitution' of a United South Africa which may be agreed upon by the Convention. It is difficult at the present moment to foresee what the line of discussion will be, or whether the consideration of the question will be in the direction of unification, or a form of federal union somewhat analogous to the Commonwealth of Australia. It went through my office. There are, no doubt, many points on which the experience gained in the various States forming the Commonwealth of Australia will be most helpful in considering this question of South African union, and I shall esteem it a. great favour if you iwill send me all available information on the subject.

The dethe corporation power should also prevent the misrepresentation that we desire to control the municipalities. By misrepresenting the position in regard worth, the Opposition wereable to induce municipal councillors, not only to vote against the proposed amendments, but to ground of desertion. That is the sort of misrepresentation that was indulged in by. men holding official positions. amendment of our power to deal with corporations is absolutely necessary. As has been pointed out during the course of this debate, we believed, until a few years ago, that we had full power to deal with corporations. Darling Downs, when he held office as Attorney-General in the Deakin-Lyne Government, behind which I sat, drafted a Companies Bill for Australia, but after the decision of the High Court in the Huddart Parker case, that Bill had to be dropped. We found that we had not the power that we believed the people had given to us Coming to the proposed amendment of our industrial power under the Constitution, I may say that I am particularly pleased that the Government have seen fit to deal with these questions separately, and that they have separated the question of the Federal control of the industrial conditions of railway servants from the general industrial power sought to be obtained. The first amendment of the industrial power possessed by us was proposed by the honourable member for Ballarat in connection with the new Protection. In one of his memoranda on the subject, he wrote as followsThe electors will be invited to empower the Commonwealth to determine the employment and remuneration of labour in protected industries. The honourable member for Darling Downs, when the Deakin-Lyne Government went out of office, published a pamphlet entitled, Nation Building in Australia, stating what had been done by the Deakin Government, and referring to the proposed amendment of the Constitution, he saidAs the power to protect the manufacturer is national, it follows that unless the Parliament of the Commonwealth acquires power to secure fair and reasonable conditions of employment to wage-earners, the national policy of protecclaim,, but we propose to establish protection tion must remain incomplete. The Government accordingly proposed to invite the electors to amend the Constitution to endow the Parliament of the Commonwealth with a .grant of power to do economic justice in protected industries, with due regard to the unity of the Commonwealth and the diversity of local circumstances. When the honourable member for Ballarat with its Wages Board. was speaking at Toowoomba a few weeks That is the policy of the Opposition; and before the Fusion party was formed, and he proceeds to saywhen he would have nothing to do \vi the proposed Fusion, he saidWe added to that protectionist Tariff the new of the States, taking care that no State suffers Protection, which secured to the employees fair Wages. In this particular the Prime MinisterMr Wise. proposes to go a great deal further than that. I am not prepared, until we see it definitely set out, to say how far he is prepared to go, but Mr Fisher appears to aim at assuring something like the regulation of the whole of the industrial operations of the Commonwealth. For The honourable member for that we believe there is not a present demand. We feel that if we deal with the protected industries and justify its application to them it will be time enough to consider the .extension. The OppositionistThe reference was to the honourable member for Parramatta's party, who now comprise the great bulk of the OppositionThe Oppositionist, on the other hand, in the matter of the new Protection, appears to offer us nothing but to promise inquiry and persuasion to be exercised by the Commonwealth upon the States. Judging by the results of persuasion in the past in that direction the prospects were not. extremely hopeful. The present Leader of the Opposition then proposed only to deal with the protected industries, and he was disposed to object to Mr Fisher's proposal to go further. As a matter of fact, however, he has since gone further. The platform of the present Fusion party, as voiced by the then Prime Minister, the honourable member for Ballarat, at the last general election, proposed to extend the new Protection to all industries whether protected or not. I commend the following words to honourable members who are now protesting against the creation of Wages B'oardis and their application to rural workers. The honourable member for Ballarat saidI must now pass on to the great issue relating to new Protection, and which relates very intimately to the ascertainment of all the facts surrounding our industries. New Protection, as you know, means securing fair conditions to all those employed in industries which receive the care of the State, and I use the word "" care"" in a wider sense than "" Protection"" in the ordinary sense, because we propose that what is called the new Protection shall not be limited to protected industries. They have, perhaps, the first in all industries in Australia, whether subject to fiscal protection or not. The securing of fair hours, fair wapes, and fair conditions of employment is now seen to be, as it has long been felt to be, a matter of grave national concern. My hope is to see every industry in Australia. I want to see an arrangement to prevent industrial competition as between possiblv differing verdicts of differing Wages Boards in each because of its establishment of Wages Boards by the conditions of employment in other",51,Moloney Ver Y Good Once That With Regard To This Amendment
216,The That Was Mr Fisher,"States, or because of inferior conditions elsewhere. . . . The States have offered of their own volition to connect their Wages Boards so as to accept the jurisdiction of a Supreme Court tribunal. Amongsb many misrepresentations that were made at the last referenda was one contained in a book entitled, The Speaker's Handbook. speaker who used it at a meeting attended by any one who knew the facts. The statement is as followsThere is no necessity for arbitrarily wresting from the States all powers they possess for dealing with industrial matters, as these Referenda Bills propose. Any additional powers the Commonwealth Government requires for dealing with industrial affairs was voluntarily offered by the States. There is then set out the agreement made at tlie famous secret Conference, when the rights of the nation were sold under the Financial Agreement. The statement conmember think that the offer of the Premiers cludesHere was a generous extension of Federal Government ? powers, freely, voluntarily, and unanimously offered by the States. This extension of power sent with the offer of the Premiers. was in harmony with the principles of the Constitution which serve to preserve, not destroy, the deed of partnership under which the States Whole point. retain such sovereign powers as are not inconsistent with the Federal compact. Conflict which that, at the last referenda, the public were has arisen, and which has caused so much disappointment, can be cured 'without destroying told by the Opposition that there was no the authority of the States in matters of purely necessity to ask for these powers, since all local concern. Then comes a recital of what was agreed to voluntarily given to us by the States. Then at the Conference, and the further statethe present Leader of the Opposition said ment thatTo give effect to these resolutions, it was proquisite powers they would ask the people posed that the Inter-State Commission, which direct for the authority to do that which the Federal Constitution already gives power to they desired to do. create, should be established.

State had taken a step to grant the Federation these powers, nor was it mentioned able member's party have been speaking that the Inter-State Commission Bill was while he has been absent. abandoned some four or five weeks before the Parliament prorogued. The honourable Angas, in his pamphlet dealing with the member. for Ballarat, after setting forth industrial powers of the Constitution, made his policy in regard to the new Protection, made use of the following words which, to the statement thatmy mind, are at this juncture very imreciprocal pressiveWe have every hope that the change will be effected this Parliament. That is to say, during the life of the present ParliamentI f it is not, we shall then ask the people to give us that authority direct. That then was the policy of the Opposition in respect to the present Parliament. They declared themselves to be in favour of the new Protection for all industries. The present Leader of the Opposition said that he hoped to see a Wages Board! in connection with every industry, and that if the necessary power were not given by the States to the present Parliament, then, at I pity the unrortunate the next general election, they would ask the people to give them direct the required authority. The States have not merely failed to give us this necessary power, but have absolutely refused to do so. Mr Watt, the Premier of Victoria, knowing what the effect of that failure would be, did his best to induce the State Premiers to agree to give the Commonwealth some grant of power, but he could not persuade them to hand over any power to the Commonwealth. of the States would satisfy the present that were necessary were to be freely and that if the States did not give them the reThe Opposition now It may be that the wider questions of the operation or overlapping of the industrial powers of the States and Commonwealth respectively will sooner or later have to be considered in the light of the recent judgment of the High Court in the Woodworkers' case.

223,Mr Wise,"The honourable member forseveral. The industrial development of a community must not be impeded by the .weight of the regulative machinery. The honourable member for Flinders was equally emphatic. He said in this HouseThe people of the country properly demand that the experiment of attempting to regulate ways and conditions of labour shall be honestly and fairly carried out on all sides. That being the desire, we ought not to impose technical objections to prevent it from being carried out. Let us give to that governing body which can effectually and best carry it out the power to do so. And he addedBut whatever legislation we may pass, we cannot, unless we give the central Parliament the final and super-eminent control, deal effectually with all the cases which may arise. Therefore, I say, again, we should amend paragraph 35 of section 51 of the Constitution to give this Parliament a wider and more general power than it has to deal with conditions of employment. I'have already said that so far this debate has been marked by only one incident different from those associated with the debate on similar proposals two years ago. But it is an incident which I very much regret. I refer to the speeches made by the honourable member for Wimmera and the honourable member for Flinders, and to the attitude which they now take up. On the last occasion, the honourable member for Flinders took up a bold, statesmanlike position, and many of us knew that more than two or three members of the Opposition shared his views. He was followed by the honourable member for Wimmera, who, speaking from his own practical experience as a member of the Harvester Commission, supported an extension of our powers to enable us to deal with commerce and industrial later, however, the Argus lashed these honourable members for helping, as it said, the Labour party, and the result was that, when the division took place, the only other member of the Opposition to cross the floor with them was the late Mr because, as he declares, the Labour party G. B. Edwards. What has since happened ? The honourable member for Wimmera told us last night that he had practically changed his views, and that he intended to retract all that he had said on the last occasion. He told us that he found that the views that he expressed on the last occasion were not reliable, and that he now holds a different opinion. The tone of his speech, however, was infinitely better than that of the speech delivered to-day by the honourable member for Flinders, who said that he held exactly the same opinions that he entertained two years ago, but that, because Mr Wise. of the ultimate objective and. motives of the party in power, he was not prepared to give them the powers for which they asked. As against that, we have the statement by him in the speech which he made on this question two years ago, that he had nothing whatever to do with objects or motives. It was his duty, he said, to support whatever extension of the power of this Parliament he felt to be necessary. No wonder there was a slashing and stinging comment in the Age of to-day upon the subserviency of the honourable member for Wimmera to party. Every word of that comment was richly deserved. I do not know what that journal will say of the honourable member for Flinders to-morrow. His speech afforded us another instance of the wretched cant that we hear from honourable members opposite when they speak of their party as the party of freedom. orable member, who is disciplined by a Caucus, to make such a charge against any honourable member? There is no justification for it. His statement is a deliberate misrepresentation. public may draw their own conclusions from the facts. I say now what the honourable member for Flinders said last year when he was being cheered by honourable members upon this side of the chamber, and when he was reminded of the fact by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, "" I am not concerned with their cheers, but only with my own position."" It is very well known that both in the House and on the public platform I have expressed my emmatters. A day or two phatic dissatisfaction with the system of party governmenta system urider which men enter Parliament and support measures of which they do not approve, just as the honourable member for Swan did when he was a member of the Deakin Government,, were "" pushing "" them. On the other hand,, there are members of the Opposition who are deliberately opposing measures in whichthey believe because those measures are put forward by the Labour party. Is anything, more calculated to engender disgust with the parliamentary machine? If the people are to believe us when we appear on public, platforms, surely they have a right to expect that what we say here is the result of conviction? If they have not, the sooner they throw us out of public life the better.. If they are to believe what we say on the platform, it is our bounden duty to support",54,Alfred Deakin
224,Mr Sampson,What right has the hon,55,Alfred Deakin
225,Mr Wise,"I know that it hurts. Theany proposal in which we believe, no matter from what quarter it may emanate. It was a pitiable exhibition that we witnessed last night. The honourable member for Wimmera spoke in a halting tone, as if he expected Hansard to be thrown at him at any moment, and when it was thrown at him he looked as though he was relieved. To-day the honourable member for Flinders, in speaking upon this Bill, played the party game, just as the other day when he called for a quorum at 1 o'clock in the morning, and did his share of "" stone-walling,"" he was content' to do what the Argus described as "" spade"" work. As a Minister remarked on that occasion, he thought that "" he was a bigger man."" So did I . We know that not long ago he lashed the Opposition and their programme very severely, and we can only conclude that he has been taken to task for his action, and that he is now prepared to play the humblest part by assisting to reject proposals which he says he believes are absolutely necessary. I would remind honourable members that on the last occasion these questions were not being put before the people at a general election, and that if the people vested this power in the Commonwealth Parliament they would have been intrusting it to a Government which could not be displaced for two and a half years. But on the present occasion I would point out it is within the power of the electors to confer that power upon this Parliament and at the same time to elect another party to exercise it. Is not his attitude to-day a confession that honourable members opposite cannot expect a victory at the forthcoming elections? As I have previously remarked, the Labour party owe their seats on the Treasury bench to the conduct of members of the old Liberal party, some of whom are now sitting in Opposition, and they will probably owe their seats again to the Opposition, who, not only cannot agree amongst themselves as to a programme, but who, individually, will not to-day stick to the views they held yesterday. I regret that time will not permit me to deal with other questions, but I shall take an opportunity of expressing my opinions later upon at least two pther Bills: I have not national stand-point? The explanationchanged my opinions, -and in regard to the measure relating to railway servants, I shall express the same views as I expressed in 1903, and also two years ago. But upon this occasion, I shall have an opportunity of voting against that Bill. ing the address of the Independent member for Gippsland, who has made oneof the strongest party speeches that we have heard upon this Bill, he said it was a pity that it was impossible to deal with it from a non-party stand-point. I join with him in expressing, regret that it is not possible to approach the consideration of proposalstor an alteration of our Constitution in a national spirit. The Federal Convention! which gave to Australia that exceptional charter of liberty was a non-party Convention, and it cannot be urged by any honourable member that there is in our Constitution anything which is suggestive of party advantage.

The general movement in Australia must, from time to time, suggest the necessity for alterations in the Constitution. We of to-day may think it desirable to alter the Constitution in one direction, while the people who come after us will, no doubt, as the occasion arises, see necessity for extending it in other directions. Amendments of the Constitution should always be submitted without regard to party gains. But we cannot approach the consideration of these proposals without realizing that they have been brought forward largely at the behest of outside organizations, and to enable the Government, should it retain its position on the Treasury bench, to give fuller effect to the platform of its party. member's language is very moderate. The outside organizations ordered the Government to submit these proposals again to the people. matter without party bias. Naturally honourable members opposite must take notice of those whom they seek to represent in this Chamber, just as we on this side claim the right to have regard to public opinion. We have been reminded on more than one (Occasion during the discussion that in the .amendment of the Constitution we can take a lesson from Switzerland. Distant fields are always green. I remember the time -jn South Australia when, if it was difficult to back up an argument, there was generally recourse to the example of New Zealand. In those days everything that New Zealand had done was right, and it was thought sufficient to support an argument ""by instancing the experience of that country. Switzerland. But let us consider the attitude of the people of Switzerland towards proposed amendments of the Constitution such as those now before us. In one of the series of articles dealing with "" The Initiative Referendum and Recall,"" which recently appeared in the Age, it was stated thatThe Swiss electors when appealed to by the referendum have invariably refused to sanction any proposal of concentrating power in the Federal Assembly. The rule seems to be that the people are determinedly adverse to any encroachment on the domestic functions of the State Parliaments by the Federal Legislature. They vote almost invariably against measures which have' a tendency to centralize authority, however admirable, in other respects such proposals may be. » In Switzerland proposals such as those submitted to our electors, in April, 1911, have almost invariably been rejected. The people of Australia have in the past fought hand for the right of self-government, for the right to keep the control of their affairs close under their own eyes; and when these proposals are again submitted, they will hesitate as to the wisdom of giving to the Commonwealth Parliament, although representative of the whole continent, powers which will be exercised at some remote part of the Commonwealth. Honourable members on both sides have admitted that there could be no subject demanding more thoughtful, dignified, and calm consideration than the proposals now before us. We are unanimous as to their importance. The Attorney-General spoke --""tremendous powers."" Others have referred to them as pointing to the parting of the ways, as bringing us to a time when we must decide whether our Constitution shall remain Federal or be a modified Federal Constitution, or whether the system of Unification shall be adopted. Other honourable members have referred to the proposals as equivalent to a demand on the States by this Parliament for a blank cheque, to be filled up as the occupants of our Treasury bench may hereafter consider advisable. It is admitted inside and outside the House that the amendments if made will -alter the character of our Constitution, and possibly .lead us in the direction of Unification. Federation implies a system of government under which the National Parliament exercises national functions, the States retaining sovereign powers in respect to domestic legislation reNow it is popular to fly to little served to them. Whether the Labour party is or is not in favour of Unification does not now concern me. But remembering how some of them opposed the adoption of the Federal Constitution, I am> surprised that they should resent any reference to themselves as being in favour of a unitary form of government. The honourable member for Indi yesterday quoted a resolution of the Hobart Conference against Unification, and declared that Unification had never been publicly recognised by the Labour party, but I . know that for several years the Labour party of South Australia had this plank in its general",58,Alfred Deakin
233,Mr Bruce,,59,Smith Th E Honourable Of The Proposed Amendments As Conveying
234,Mr Gordon,"I wish to discuss theplatform"" The unification of the Australian States."" I suppose that we have the right, therefore, to assume that Unification was the policy of the party there. It will be fatal to our system of government if we strip the States of their self governing powers. Whatever may be the intentions of this Government, it must be admitted that the proposed constitutional alterations mean a distinct movement away from Federation. They give, not partial powers to the Commonwealth in respect of trade and commerce and other matters, but absolute powers. It is vain for honourable members opposite to say that these powers will not be used. The American Constitution, upon which ours is largely based, has stood a test of over 100 years, during which time the population of the country has grown from 4,000,000 to over 90,000,000, and the number of States in the Union has increased from thirteen to forty-eight. It is extraordinary then that a handful of people scattered over a continent like Australia should require for its central authority powers which are not needed by the central authority of the United States, where the population exceeds 90,000,000. It is a pertinent question to ask why are these alterations of the Constitution submitted at the present time? Is it because under Federation we have been less prosperous than we were in pre-Federal days? On the contrary, the Attorney-General showed that the annual wealth of Australia has increased in twelve years under Federation . from ;£ri4,ooo,ooo to ^187,000,000, and that our trade has grown from ^92,000,000 to ^146,000,000; that our banking assets have increased from ^121,000,000 to 1 ^165,000,000, and that our bank deposits have .grown from ^91,000,000 to ^149,000,000. It cannot then be said that Federation has kept Australia back! Indeed, we never knew such prosperity in the pre-Federal days as we have enjoyed during the last few years. We have had it said in this chamber and from various platforms that under this Constitution we have seen a young party come into power, and that that party is responsible for most of this prosperity ! Early in October the Prime Minister told a public meeting in Sydney, in justification of these proposed amendments of the Constitution, that "" we want more ipower,"" and it is remarkable that in the newspapers in which that -utterance was reported, there appeared a cable from London conveying the information that Mr Ramsay Macdonald, the Leader of the Labour party in the House of Commons, had stated that I t is necessary to decentralize the parliamentary authority' and give local governing bodies more power. It is, to say the least, remarkable t h a t t h e leaders of these two parties, having somuch in common-having , in the main, the same objectives-shoul d differ on so vital a principle, and be seeking to lead their followers in opposite directions. Here in Australia, where we have fought for and won the right of self-government-wher e we have developed the system to an almost perfect state, bringing the governing bodies close to the people, we are asked to givemore and more power to the Central Government at the expense of the States. It is significant that the movement in England in the interests of the Labour party, as represented by Mr Ramsay Macdonald, should be in the direction of decentralizing legislative functions, whereas in Australia to-day the Leader of the Labour party seeks to take from the States in order to give to the Federal authority. I propose to make one or two quotations which afford an indication of the opinions of public men in the United States of America, the Constitution of which is somewhat similar to -our own. Mr Taft, the President, has made this public statementIn these days there is a disposition to look toomuch to the Federal Government for everything. I am liberal in the construction of the Constitution with reference to Federal power, but I am firmly convinced that the only safe course for us to pursue is to hold fast to the limitations of the Constitution, and guard as sacred the powers of the States. Then we have Mr Maurice Low, admittedly an authority on American affairs, declaring that to -the American ""the sovereignty of the State is the pivot of his political system,"" and addingThe menace of an autocratic central government, which is what Americans fear, can only be prevented, Americans believe, by the States being strong enough to hold in check any encroachment or attempted usurpation of power by the central Government. So long as the Government of Washington is kept within limits little danger need be apprehended, but when the long arm of the Government stretches from Washington to the far corners of the Union, when through the taxing power it exercises an espionage over every activity,'when it regulates trade and the instrumentalities of commerce, the American sees danger ahead and begins to tremble for his liberties. Then, again, Secretary Elihu Rcot has who is prepared to make a sacrifice for the saidThe nation cannot reform the functions of Nielsen, when a Labour Minister in New the State Sovereignties. If it were to perform those functions it would break down. machinery would not be able to perform the duty. The oressure is already too heavy for the national machinery to do its work. During the present debate honourable members opposite have read long extracts from speeches made on different occasions by members of this party, and have justified their action on the ground that opinions expressed by members of the opposing camp in the direction which they desire must be of more telling force than any argument which they could possibly use. I quite agree with the tactics of honourable members opposite when they seek to confirm their arguments by quoting the opinions of their political opponents, and I propose briefly to follow their example. Men who are as prominent in the Labour movement in Australia to-day as are honourable members opposite have gone out of their way, at considerable political risk to themselves, to warn the wage-earners to beware of these -proposed amendments, and to reject them. For instance, on the occasion of the last referendum, the present Attorney-General of New South Wales, Mr Holman, saidThe argument-if I dignify it with the name Wales, referring to the last referenda proof argument-that because the Federal Parliaposals, saidment imposes the Tariff it should have charge -of all industrial legislation, will not stand in-' vestigation. This step, as suggested, will mean possibilities, and, if carried, will result in endthe end of State Labour parties. member for Ballarat who first said that since we had the power to frame the Tariff .we should have the power to determine industrial conditions. able member the references to all the speeches from which I am quoting. Mr peace within our borders. I find that Mr Beeby, Minister of Education in the Labour Government of New South Wales, de'nounced the Federal referenda proposals in 1911, and has the courage to -continue his opposition to them. He said, on that occasionAn attempt was being made practically to -graft a united system of government on the South Wales, referring to the advocacy of Federal Constitution. He contended the subthese proposals saidmission of the questions now before the country was a mistake and .against the best interests of the Commonwealth. Mr Beeby out. -only martyr to political convictions in Australia. sake of principles that he holds dear. Mr The South Wales, saidI do not believe in depriving the State of its functions one by one, and thus aggrandizing the Commonwealth Parliament. Whilst the State Parliaments retain f u l l control of the matters within the State, and is under the Federal Constitution, I shall strenuously oppose any encroachments under State rights by the Federal authorities. I can only regret that Mr Nielsen is not in Australia to-day to help us to holrj up the Federal flag. ber would find him a good fighter. man saidI am one of those possibly misguided individuals who regard the right of every people in every locality to self-govern themselves as one of the fundamental principles of progress and liberty. I don't believe in it being taken up to-day and put down to-morrow, as the exigencies of party fortunes or warfare may dictate. It is the rock upon which I build my church, and against which the gates of hell shall not prevail. These amendments are . fraught with_ grave less confusion and conflict between States and I am<. sure that it is the desire of every honourable member, whether he supports Ihe Government or sits in Opposition, that we should avoid conflict andi confusion as between the Federal and the State Governments. We all desire to have political Edden, Labour Minister for Mines in New South Wales, urged the electors to vote "" No,"" contending that, in the interests of the wage-earners, industrial power should be retained by the State.

Mr W. H . IRVINE -That right was refused to hifn by the State Labour Conference? ment, it must have been. The report continuesMr Beeby submitted that the alteration of the Federal Constitution was a step which would have a serious and marked effect on the future development of the whole of Australia. what I say. ister, and his Labour colleagues in the State Ministry of New South Wales, are on different sides of the fence with regard to this matter. While we are warned by -these authorities on the spot to hold fast -to the Federal system, we have outside authorities, unbiased by party considerations, telling us what a splendid instrument of government we possess. I need not go outside for authorities in support of my position, for those who heard the memorable speech delivered .by the Minister of Home Affairs at Port Augusta on the occasion of the turning of the first sod of the transcontinental railway, will remember that he referred to the political'liberties that we enjoyed under what he described as in the palladium of our liberties. I do not I propose now to quote Mr The range of powers granted to the National or Commonwealth Parliament is very wide, wider than that of Congress or of the Swiss National Assembly, or even of the Dominion Parliament in Canada. . . Technically regarded, the Constitution is an excellent piece of work-the arrangement is and precise. . There is no such effort as in America to secure that questions of State law shall be determined solely by State Courts, for such cases may be appealed from State Courts to the Federal High Court. Thus, the nation looms large over the whole instrument, overshadowing the States. What is the objective of these proposals? I have The Prime Minister, speaking on behalf of his party, said, in effect, "" We want more power."" The Attorney-General, in a letter to the Hobart Labour Conference, said, "" We want tremendous powers."" Putting the fairest possible construction on these .proposals, it seems to me that fhe Labour party has issued broadcast throughout Australia so many political promissory notes, and that the time has arrived, not for their redemption, but for their renewal. The members of that party are therefore sparring for time. They are saying to their followers, "" We have done all that we possibly could for you. We have created artificial conditions in regard to the wages system and in regard to other industrial activities."" In passing I wish to observe that in creating those artificial conditions they have been greatly aided by extraordinarily good seasons. But when their followers ask them, "" How do we benefit by receiving increased wages, seeing that simultaneously we have to face an increase in the cost of living? "" the reply of honourable members opposite is, "" We have . done all that we can for you up to the limitations imposed by the Constitution. We now ask you to alter that Constitution, and if you do that we promise to give you still better conditions. If you do' not alter it we shall be handcuffed, and will be unable to give effect to our political promises to you."" What is the objective of these referenda?

My honourable friends opposite believe that if they can bring down prices, profits, and rents,' everything else will come down with them. What a beautiful dream ! When the honourable member for Flinders inferred from interjections that that was the accepted policy of the Labour party, the Honorary Minister took strong exception to his deduction, and immediately proceeded in a lucid and forceful manner to absolutely support the very sentiments which had been expressed by the Attorney General. It seems to me that it is a fair deduction to draw from their utterances that one of the objectives of the Labour party is to take to itself the .power to fix prices and to regulate profits. ber wants trusts to regulate them. Interjection. I want nothing of the kind. T am as much opposed to the growth of industrial Frankensteins as is the honourable member. I am prepared to give this or any other Government all the power that may be necessary to enable it to control and regulate combines and trusts. But it is not the control or regulation of combines with which my honourable friends are concerned. . What they desire is the power to nationalize industries and monopolies. That is perfectly apparent when one reads in the report of the Hobart Labour Conference that the nationalization of one industry after another is the platform of the party. nationalize and the proposal to control are contained in two separate Bills. Honorary Minister may be a magician. But he will pardon me if I doubt his ability or that of his colleagues to do anything effectual in the direction of fixing prices and profits. They might just as well promise to adjust the law of gravitation ! If the power to fix prices, profits, and rents is one of the objectives of the Labour party, I would like some explanation of how they are going to realize their beautiful dream. prices and profits high so as to suit the manufacturer and his employee's, or are they going to fix them low in order to suit the farmer and the consumer? . them on a high scale so as to favour the producer, or will they fix them on a uniformly low scale so as to oblige the consumer ? The That is the beginning and end other day the honourable member for South Sydney instanced the price of a number of commodities to which I should like to refer in detail if time permitted me to do so. He said that, owing to the rejection of the Government proposals by the people in 1911, certain monopolists had put up their prices, and, in this connection, he instanced jam. I ask honourable members opposite how they are going to fix the price of jam ? Last year, the jam-makers of Australia were freely buying all the apricots they required for £ 4 per ton. This year they cannot obtain them-, although they are offering ,£18, and even ,£20 per ton for them. How, then, are my honourable friends going to fix the price of jam? Will they make it on the basis of £ 4 per ton or on the basis of £ 2 0 per ton for fruit? How ridiculous it is for them to claim that they would be able to determine the price of bread? As the honourable member for Flinders pointed out this morning, in order to fix the price of that commodity it would be necessary for them to fix the price of wheat in Mark Lane. Then other honourable members opposite have contrasted the prices obtained for our butter in England with those obtained in Australia. Do they mean that we should cease to export? At the same time, Ministerialists are advocating the establishment of a Federal line of steamers to the Old Country in order that those vessels may carry our produce, and thus assist in keeping up prices in the Commonwealth.

If this is not being "" brought to heel,"" I do not know what "" brought to heel "" means. the honourable member for Perth can say my statement is not correct, in view of what The last referenda were made when there we have witnessed during this debate. When the last referenda proposals were before us, fact, I believe a much larger vote would we were told by the Leader of the Opposition that the various questions should not have been combined, and he said that had they been separated he would have supported some of them; but now that the questions are separated, we find that he is not prepared to support any. A similar attitude has been taken up by the honourable member for Flinders, who, on the last occasion, was favorable to the proposals up to a certain point. It is to the honourable member's credit that he does not flinch from the attitude he then assumed; but in regard to the present proposals, he thinks it his duty to advise the public to vote against any of them.

There is not sufficient interest in such questions alone to attract the people to the public meetings, or induce them to attend the polling booth; and 1 undertake to say that 50 per cent, of those who voted had never heard an explanation of the proposals. No matter how able were the speakers on either side, it seemed impossible to get large audiences; and, under ""the circumstances, the people, not having been educated on the point, and not knowing the merits of the questions, were perfectly justified in voting in the negative. member regards the people as educated when he has put his view. prepared to let the honourable member for Parramatta put his view, and then for me to put my view, and allow the people to decide. The press of Australia, with very few exceptions, were on the side of the "" Noes"" at the last referenda, and the press is the only medium through which people can obtain the information necessary to give them a grip of the issues. I quite agree that no one is justified in voting for an amendment of the Constitution unless he is absolutely satisfied that an amendment is necessary. The Constitution is an instrument that cannot be played with. There must be solid ground for any alteration, and we cannot expect the people, in the absence of solid ground, to vote for any particular amendment. The proposal to submit these questions again to the people represents the only straightforward action that the Government could take. If the Labour Government allowed themselves to be returned once more to power knowing their inability to pass desired legislation under the Constitution as at present, they would be open to the charge of simply hanging on to the Treasury bench. tion, instead of being afraid, ought to regard it as an advantage that the proposals are to be re-submitted to the people, because, from their point of view, this fact ought to place the return of Labour candidates in jeopardy. In any case, I contend that the Government would not be acting in a manly way if they returned to power knowing they had made no effort to give effect to the people's wishes. The findings of the High Court in regard to some Commonwealth legislation leaves the Government no other choice. AndI go further, and say that, in the event of these proposals being rejected again, and the present Government remaining in power, as I feel they will, it would be their duty, at the first opportunity, to once more go before the country, and point out the defects in the Constitution. honourable member declines to accept the popular voice? that we are setting out on propaganda work, and it is our duty to educate the people.

For years Labour men went before the country, and were repeatedly ""turned down."" But we went again and again, knowing our cause to be a good one, and the result is that we are now returned to this House in a large majority. I contend that the same policy should be pursued in relation to the referenda proposals, which I regard as the most important that could come before this Parliament. In order to ascertain whether the proposed amendments are justifiable, it is necessary to briefly trace happenings since the beginning of Federation. Representatives from the different States were sent to a Convention to draw up the Constitution ; and there is no doubt that those representatives were, to a certain extent, controlled by the States. Anxious as they were to bring about Federation, they knew that if too much power were given to the Central Government, there would be no hope of the States joining. Consequently, the Constitution, as we have it, is, in a large degree, a compromise. for Bendigo says so in his book. those who assisted in drawing up the ConI should say that the Opposistitution evidently did not expect that it would altogether meet the position, and they wisely made, provision for amendment at any time the people so desired. cepted because of that provision. yet we are told by honourable members who supported that provision, that we should not interfere with the instrument. Having accepted the Constitution, we set about legislating; and with what result?

Andthe Government of which the honourable member for Bendigo, the honourable member for Ballarat, the right honourable member for Swan,' and the honourable member for Angas were members. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. members whom I have mentioned were members of the Convention which framed the Constitution, they were not aware that it prevented Parliament from passing the legislation which they introduced. I presume that they believed that Parliament had the constitutional power to pass that legislation, because had they thought otherwise they would have known that the time of the country was being wasted on its consideration. introduced to protect the interests of the people, and, if necessary when introduced, is still more necessary now. High Court held it to be ultra -vires. Surely that in itself is a good and sufficient additional powers, two of them' being prereason for the amendment of the Constitution. When legislation tiiat the framers of the Constitution thought that Parliament had the power to pass was declared invalid by the High Court there at once sprang into existence good ground for asking the people to amend the Constitution. When that instrument was framed, no one considered it to be perfect, and indeed those who framed it knew that it was not. The defects of legislation can often not be discovered until it has been put into operation, and when discovered they are generally remedied. The Constitution itself provides for the remedying of its defects by a certain course of procedure which we are now following. It is the members of the Opposition who themselves have shown reason for the amendment of the Constitution. Furthermore, the State authorities have admitted that the Commonwealth should have additional powers. In January of this year there was a Conference at which five of the States were represented. Two of the States proposed that the Commonwealth should have power to control all industrial disputes, whether local or Inter-State, the regulation of wages in protected industries, the regulation of prices of protected goods, and the regulation and nationalization of Inter-State monopolies. But when those proposals were put before the Conference they were modified, and it was agreed that the Commonwealth should control industrial disputes of an Inter-State character with power to make a common rule, the nationalization of monopolies when declared monopolies by the High Court would never do that. ment on appeal of conflicting industrial decisions ' creating unfair competition between State and State. The representatives of the five States-South Australia was not represented at the Conferenceagreed that the Commonwealth should be given additional powers, with the limitation in regard to the High Court which we could not accept. They realized that it is necessary to extend our powers. But when South Australia was asked whether she would fall into line, and agree to the proposals of the other States, she said That legislation, too, was that she would not give the Commonwealth any additional power, and as the result nothing has been done. The posiBut the tion, therefore, is that the authorities of five of the States are prepared to give us pared to go further than the other three, but the sixth State will not give us any additional power. That we need additional powers, and that therefore the Constitution should be amended, is proved, as I have shown, by the action of members of the. Convention who framed the Constitution in introducing invalid legislative proposals, not knowing that they were beyond the power of Parliament to pass, and by the resolutions come to by the Conference of Premiers to which I have referred. What, then, can this Government do but appeal to the people, the masters of both the Federal and the State Parliaments? It is our duty to point out to the people-the defects in the Constitution, and ask them to remedy those defects to enable us to pass the legislation which their interests require. be a difference of opinion as to the extent of the powers required by the Commonwealth. a reasonable difference of opinion among honourable members. But when the party cry is raised, some honourable members, who of themselves think that the Commonwealth should be given certain additional powers, sink their opinions, and say that they will recommend the people to vote "" No"" in regard to the proposals of the Government.

The man who thinks that certain powers should be granted, but asks the people to vote "" No"" to the referenda proposals because these proposals come from the Labour party is not serving the best interests of the Commonwealth. about the cost of living and its application to these proposals. Many persons, whenever they get the opportunity, blame the Labour party for the increase in the cost of living. which is not a Labour Administration, appointed a Commission to inquire into the cost of living and the value of a sovereign in the years 1901 and 1910, for the sake of comparison, and that Commission discovered that in 1910 the purchasing power of a sovereign, speaking from memory, was about 3s. 4d. less than it was in 1901. That reduction in purchasing power could not be attributed to the advent of this Labour Government im 1910. The Governments that were in power during the years in which the sovereign had been declining in value were Liberal Governments, and the inquiry was made by a Commission appointed by a Liberal Government. The facts speak for themselves. The increase in the cost of living is due to the fact that fair and reasonable competition is almost a thing of the past, and that to-day combinations are more general. There was a time when only the industrial workers thought about unionism and combination. But things have changed. lesson has been learned. Every one now realizes that it is to his advantage to combine with others; and combinations exist to control the markets, with a view to extorting as much as possible from the consumers. The honourable member for Flinders said this morning that the workers are getting more than a living wage; but in 1901 the ordinary labourer's wage was 7s. a day, and now it is not more than 9s., and generally only 8s., whereas a sovereign is worth 3s. 4d. less than it was then. I am at a loss to understand how the workers, considering the wages they receive, can provide for their families; prices and rents being so high. I do not say a word against combination; it is a good thing, if properly managed. But combination should not be for the benefit of the few. There should be economy in working, but not to enable the few to become wealthy. If there is to be control by combinations, let that control ue exercised by the people of Australia. Let the people Mr Charlton. control production, and get the benefit arising from that control. The alternative is to re-establish fair and reasonable competition, but that, I fear, is gone for ever. It behoves us, therefore, to look to the interests of the people, and A good deal has been said by legislation to prevent a few individuals from combining to control commodities, and thus to fleece .the consumers. We have to consider whether we should protect the people or leave them entirely The Victorian Government, at the mercy of those who enjoy the benefits of combination. We have been asked, "" Is there a Meat Trust in Australia? "" Whether there is or is not we ought to take time by the forelock. We ought to realize what has happened in America. We should recognise that tHfere exists here the same conditions for the operation of a Meat Trust as prevail in America, and we should) pass legislation to prevent such a trust obtaining a hold in Australia. At the break' up of the drought in 1903, and even Before then, meat in Australia was cheaper than it has been since, although since that time we have had some of the best seasons known in the history of Australia. I have figures here showing that the price of our meat in London is a little less than it is in Australia, and when we recollect that it costs about i j d . per pound to carry it to the Old Country, we are naturally led to ask, "" What is the reason for the difference?"" The honourable member for Boothby asked the honourable member for A South Sydney the other day, ""Would you put on an export duty?"" That question is usually addressed to us when we deal with this matter. My reply is that I would not do so, but that I think that we should have under the Constitution power to inquire into the reason for the high cost of various commodities and authority to pass legislation to regulate an industry where we find that the people are not getting a fair deal. On the other hand, the Opposition are content to allow a few favoured individuals to go on, as at present, controlling everything, and to leave the consumer and the producer to pay the penalty. Some months ago there appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph a series of articles dealing with the Beef Trust, in which it was clearly pointed out that, unless the people of Australia were on their .guard, they would have the trust in their midst before they knew where they were. The writer showed that the company, which has commenced operations in Queensland, started exactly as did a company which commenced operations in the Argentine Republic. There a company was started on. a fairly liberal scale, and was said to have no connection with the Beef Trust, but once it had been established it was found to be part and parcel of the trust. Company started in the same way in America. these articles points out that we may have the same experience. Mr Wilson was appointed by the Government of the United States of America to inquire into the reason for the high price of beef and other commodities, and that he found that it was simply due to the operation of monopolies. He stated that the people of the United States of America were entirely in the hands of the Beef Trust, and that some of the States had taken action to cope with the trusts, but found that they were practically powerless. Yet we are told that the States have sufficient power to deal with these matters. Our Constitution is similar to that of the United States of America, and I appeal to honourable members to say whether we should stand idly by and allow a like state of affairs to come into existence in Australia. The writer of the articles in the Sydney Daily Telegraph states that, instead of the American Parliament having complete control of the Beef Trust, the trust has complete control of the American people. We should have power to control all trusts and monopolies that are not in the interests of the people. That is the power for which we ask. We do not desire to take over any monopoly, unless it is absolutely necessary to do so. The Opposition ask how it would be possible for us to regulate and control different industries. My answer is that we legislate to control those who break the law in certain respects; that we pass legislation in relation to various civil matters, and that, in the same way, if we found, upon inquiry, that the people were being fleeced by any combination, we could pass a law, under the amended powers for which we ask, that would enable the National Parliament to control that monopoly. We could so control it as to make sure that whilst those engaged in it obtained a fair return on their capital, it should not plunder and rob the people of Australia. A good deal has been said with regard to the Coal Vend, and the Opposition have sought to make much capital out of the [219] attitude adopted towards it by certain honourable members on this side of the House. It was said last night that Mr J. C. Watson, the late Leader of our party; the honourable member for Newcastle, and one or two others, had declared, in 1906, that the Coal Vend was a good thing from the stand-point of the workers in the Newcastle district, and that, after all, it was obtaining only a fair price for its coal. The point that I wish to emphasize is that at He states that a that time the Shipping Combine was not in touch with the Coal Vend. The Vend was brought about as the result of an effort on the part of the miners to obtain better conditions, and an attempt to break down the cut-throat competition existing in the district. Under the sliding scale which prevailed, the miners were not obtaining a living wage, whilst the colliery proprietors were not securing a fair return on the capital they had invested. The Vend raised the price of coal to us. per ton. That is a fair price for Newcastle coal-whic h will compare with any in the world, with the exception, perhaps, of the best Welshand Newcastle coal is still selling at us. per ton. A year after this, however, an arrangement was entered into under which the Shipping Combine was able to control the whole of the Newcastle output, representing about 90 per cent: of the output of the Newcastle district. I admit that the present price of coal in Victoria and other States is too high, but, at the same time, the selling price of coal at Newcastle is fair. In 1906, the price of coal at Newcastle was raised to us. per ton -a n advance of 3s. per ton-whils t the miners' wages went up to the extent of is. per ton. A year later, when the Shipping Combine appeared on the scene, Pelaw Main coal was selling in Melbourne at 14s. per ton, but it suddenly rose to 17s., 18s., and, eventually, to 24s. per ton. If the hewing rate increased by only is. per ton, and the selling price from bedrock to us. per ton-a n increase of 3s -ho w is it that the price of coal in Melbourne jumped from 14s. to 24s. per ton ? Who is reaping the benefit of the difference? It must be the Shipping Combine. Probably is. per ton would cover the increased wages which the Shipping Combine has to pay, but, allowing the liberal margin of 2s. per ton, there is still a big difference to be accounted for. Is it fair that any combine should be in a position to bleed the people of any State to the extent of an additional ios.",66,Smith Th E Honourable Of The Proposed Amendments As Conveying
271,Mr Archibald,The Meat Packing,68,Smith Th E Honourable Of The Proposed Amendments As Conveying
272,Mr Charlton,"And the writer ofper ton, seeing that the increase in the price at Newcastle is only 3s. per ton? If we allow 2s. per ton in respect of the increase in wages on ship-board, we have still 5s. per ton in excess of the amount previously obtained, and that additional amount must be going into the pockets of the Shipping Combine. An allowance of 2s. per ton in respect of increased .wages paid by it is a very fair margin, having regard to the fact that the average vessel carrying coal from Newcastle to Melbourne is of 3,000 tons capacity. This, then, is the question which needs to be inquired into. It is a matter, not as between the Vend and the miners, but as between the Shipping Combine and the consumers of coal in the various States. Unless we have power to protect the consumer, we may expect the price of coal to be raised still further.' If we are to have no control-if these combines can fix prices as they please-the n the people might as well be without a Parliament. We ask for these additional powers to enable us to inquire into these matters, and-to see whether it is necessary to put a check upon any extravagant supply charges made in the interests of certain individuals as against the general well-being of the people. The Leader of the Opposition said in this House, last week, that he was not prepared to support any of the proposed amendments of the Constitution. On the previous occasion he said that some of these enlarged powers should be granted to the Federal Parliament, but that since the Government proposals were bunched together he could not vote for any. The proposals are now dealt with separately, and yet he says that he cannot support any of them. Speaking in this House on 4th September, 1903, on the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, he said, as reported in Hansard, page 4665My own view was that industrial legislation should be left wholly in the hands of the States until the Federal Parliament assumed this power, as it has a right to assume certain other powers under the Constitution, and that after it had assumed responsibility the industrial legisour industrial legislation is so unsatisfactory lation for the whole Commonwealth should be in the hands of the Federal Legislature. That was the view which I held then and which I still hold. That was at the Federal Convention. Owing to -the influence of State rights, the honourable member could not then get all that he thought was necessary for the Federation. Some years later, speaking in this very Chamber, he said that he still held the Mr Charlton. same views-that he thought the Commonwealth should have power to deal with all industrial matters-wherea s to-day he is unfurling his banner in opposition to this proposal to give the Commonwealth power to deal with industrial matters. He said, further,, on the occasion to which I have just referredI saw at the time that the particular manner in which it was proposed to insert this authority in the Constitution was open to objection, on the ground of its vagueness, and of the difficulties that must arise in endeavouring to apply it, and the present discussion proves that those anticipations were well founded. That shows that he foresaw that some difficulty might be experienced in dealing with this question. In reply to the honourable member for Angas, who saidThe Attorney-General assured the honourable and learned member for North Melbourne during the Adelaide session of the Convention that he did not desire to interfere with local enactments, the honourable member for B a l l a r at saidNo. In i8gr I was not prepared to go so far. I proposed that the States should be absolutely independent in their industrial legislation until the Commonwealth assumed control and became the only industrial arbiter. That is what should have been provided. The present arrangement creates a number of difficult problems. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition admitted that it is impossible to do justice to the industrial conditions which obtain in Australia in the absence of an amendment of the Constitution. Similarly we find that, two years ago, the honourable member for Flinders supported a proposal to amend the Constitution in certain directions. But, although he holds the same opinions to-day, merely because the Labour party are in fffice he is prepared to vote against his convictions. The sooner this Parliament recognises the necessity for permitting the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court to deal with industrial trouble, irrespective of where it may occur, the better will it be for Australia. None of us desire strikes. We have always opposed them. It was the members of the Labour party who advocated the enactment of legislation to prevent them. But to-day that if industrial bodies cannot gain access to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, there is likely to be trouble. Why not throw open the door of that Court to them ? Where is the justification for saying that, in common and criminal law, men may go from a State to the Commonwealth tribunal, but in industrial law, where the question at issue is one of the wages which shall be paid in an indusinterruption of this great transport sertry, resort shall be had only to a State trivice?

279,Mr Charlton,"The United Statesrelegated to private life. There is nothing, therefore, in the argument that, because a Labour Government happen to be in power, these additional powers should not be granted to the Commonwealth. We are amenable to the people in exactly the same way as are honourable members opposite. If it be necessary to educate the people up to a sense of their responsibility, I am prepared to refer these proposals back to them again and again. If we were to appeal to the country without submitting these proposals to the electors, we should be open to the charge of simply coming back to sit on the Treasury bench, and do nothing for Australia. It is admitted by all on this side, and by a number of honourable members opposite, that additional powers are required, and, that being so, it is only fair and right that the shortcomings of the Constitution should be pointed out to the people, and the necessary amendments made. Whether a Liberal Government or a Labour Government Be in power, we should take care that this country is so governed that the people as a whole, and not individuals, shall reap the benefits. Unless something is clone, a few years will see Australia in much the same position as the United States, with millionaires by the thousand. not take long to bring that state of affairs about. I do not know personally whether there is a meat ring. Every grazier who dies leaves a large estate behind him. Of course, I do not begrudge any man his wealth, because each does the best he can for himself. the honourable member known go bankrupt ? cannot get the additional powers, and thus be enabled 'to pass much needed legislation, it will matter very little to me personally on .which side of the HouseI sit; but I fancy that, on this occasion, the people will be found very much more enlightened, having regard to the education they have had since the last appeal was made. They have seen the dire results of the working of the Constitution in its present limited form, and I believe they will grant the fullest power necessary to enable us to give effect to our platform. If the question be dealt with as a party question, I venture to assert that, should the amendments be adopted, the Fusion Government will never have another opportunity to occupy the Treasurybench. As this may be fairly regarded as a people's question, it would be advisable, I think, to endeavour to look at it from the people's point of view. If the electors read the speech of the Attorney General, I should strongly advise them to immediately afterwards read the speeches of the honourable members for Angas, Bendigo, and Darling Downs, so that they may see how the inaccuracies of the Attorney-General are corrected. The effect of the referenda if accepted will, in my opinion, be Unification. It has been said by honourable members opposite that such is not their aim, but we have to consider, not what they intend, but what will be the real result of the amendments. There is no doubt that if these large inroads are made oh the Constitution, we must have Unification sooner or later; and, personally, I would sooner see Unification advocated straight out rather than have it introduced in a way that must inflict a most harassing time on botii States and Commonwealth. We have been told that these amendments will place the Commonwealth much in the same position as that occupied by the Dominion of Canada; but, as a matter of fact, the two Constitutions are based on quite different principles. In Canada, the Dominion Governmenb are given all powers of legislation not specially reserved to the Provinces, whereas in Australia the State Governments have all the powers not specially reserved to the Commonwealth Government. Under the proposed amendments, the Commonwealth Parliament could pass almost any of the laws now within the jurisdiction of the States, and this would in time give rise to conflict, when, of course, the State laws would have to give way. There is no doubt that if the extended trade and commerce power be given it will give rise to the greatest crop of law cases we have yet seen, and there will be a veritable harvest for the lawyers at the cost of the general community. Some amendment is desirable in regard to trade and commerce; but no suggestion has yet been made which shows clearly what the exact results of any amendment would be, and until we have information on that point, I am not prepared to throw down the barriers.

The promise of the Minister of Home Affairs to the Tasmanian electors is all moonshine. There has been no demand for an amendment of the Constitution in regard to the trade and commerce power, and nothing has been shown to warrant the change proposed. Honourable members opposite have confined themselves almost entirely to the depredations of trusts in America; but I cannot see how the trade and commerce power will help them in this connection, seeing that a special power is asked for in regard to trusts and combines. 4p to the Bill to deal with corporations, I should like the public to read speeches by members of the Opposition, from which they will see that the power under the Constitution now could be used more effectively than in the past if the Gobeen suggested that another Judge should vernment were so minded. I am, however, quite in favour of a reasonable alteration in the Constitution to deal with corporations. I should be prepared to go as far as the proposal made by the Liberal Government two years ago, when the honourable member for Angas moved to simply omit the words "" regulation and control,"" from the proposal of the Government, which would then leave to the Commonwealth the creation and dissolution of corporations. That is as much as is required. The words "" regulation and control "" have a bad, rather than good, effect in practice; and I cannot understand honourable members opposite advocating their retention when they have been so trenchantly condemned by Mr Justice Higgins, who, I thought, was regarded as an authority by the Labour party. In the Huddart Parker case, the learned Judge showed clearly that the retention of the words created an anomalous position, inasmuch as the Commonwealth Parliament would be able to deal with a certain business carried on by a corporation on one side of the street, while it would be powerless to interfere in a precisely similar business carried on by an individual on the other side. Supposing, for instance, that the Commonwealth passed a licensing law, it would have effect only on hotels conducted by corporations, and would not in any way touch similar places of business conducted by individuals. I cannot understand my friends puerile extent. As to trusts and combines and industrial matters the public, who will have to finally settle this question, may see on one side of this House a party who are advocating an amendment so as to give further powers to that won-' derful institution, the Arbitration Court. What is offered to the public by the Opposition? At the last election the party to which I belong advocated the leaving of industrial matters as much as possible to the States. We think that industrial disputes can best be settled by Wages Boards, with an Inter-State Commission to harmonize'' conflicting awards, to prevent un-"" fair competition between the States. That is a much simpler arrangement than the proposal of the Labour party to refer all industrial disputes to the Commonwealth. Arbitration Court. This Court, although it deals now only with disputes extending beyond any one State, is congested with business, and it has be appointed to assist Mr Justice Higgins. Wages Boards have settled far more cases than the Arbitration Court has settled, have done their work more quickly, and have given more satisfaction. Of course, both parties in this House desire the payment of fair wages; no honourable member wishes to reduce wages. But we on this side think that the Wages Board system is more likely to secure industrial peace than are the proposals of the Labour party. As to trusts and combines, we are quite prepared to suppress any that may be injurious to ""the public, although the members of the Labour party would make it appear otherwise. When a trust is beneficent it should not be interfered with. But there are trusts which may be fairly accused of increasing the cost of the necessaries ""of life, charging unfair prices for their productions.

Attorney-General quoted with approval an article by Mr Andrew Carnegie, published in the North American Reviewf o r November, 1911. Mr Carnegie ought to know a -great deal about trusts. Attorney-General, remembering the adage, '"" Set a thief to catch a thief, "" is of opinion that what Mr Carnegie says is a good way to deal with trusts, must be a good way. Mr Carnegie thinks that the remedy is to have industrial courts, charged with the enforcement of fair prices and the prevention of extortion. He says that the producer should not fix prices. I am -not aware that the producer has much to do with the fixing of prices. governed by the law of supply and demand, and by many other factors. If the producer could fix prices, the price of wheat would not fluctuate from year to year. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Honorabl e members opposite state that the law of supply -and demand is dead. Carnegie says that every member of any industry, large or small, should be placed -on the same footing, and subjected to the same laws. He says that if that is not -done, and you deal with any particular concern, its members will simply transfer their shares to some other concern, and thus -evade the law. A virtue claimed for this proposal is that it would enforce publicity and render governmental control possible over such bodies. would secure might have some good effect, but that, after all, is only a small portion -of the problem. Here is another sentence from Mr Carnegie's statement which, I think, is very enlightening. He says"" The root of the problem lies in fixing maximum prices."" At the same time, Mr of ""making the job last."" Carnegie believes that the workers should become shareholders in all the big concerns in which they are engaged, so that, while he holds these views, he also believes, apparently, that profit-sharing is a. remedy for the trouble. He states that "" Capital and labour should be rowing in the same boat together."" the difficulty by means of fixing prices. A moment's consideration shows that it would be very hard to do anything of the kind. Appathis House last week, quoted from an That article by Mr J. A. Hobson, which appeared in the October number of the Contemporary Review,but his quotation scarcely showed the proper trend of the The other night the article. Those who read it will find that Mr Hobson dates back the coming into operation of high prices to about 1895, and states that the movement is practically world-wide. He shows that there are a I suppose the great many reasons for it . Listening to the Attorney-General one would have thought that the rise in prices was due chiefly to the operation of trusts. Mr Hobson, however, gives that as only one of many causes. He gives as contributory causes, not only the great increase in the output of gold that has taken place during the period in question, but the fact that there has been a tremendous increase in the demand for credit, and the tremendous developments in That is both North and South America. Other reasons for the high prices are, according to him, the great increase in metal and other manufacturing industries in the United States of America, the fact that Japan has entered upon an industrial career requiring the introduction of a lot of capital from Europe and elsewhere, the fact that the rate of the supply of goods has been re-that there has been a lot of waste as the result of the war in South Africa and the Far East. Other reasons given by him are the enormous expenditure on armaments of war and the rapid rise in. cartels, trusts, and pools, which, he says, operate by controlling the output. I am inclined to think that there are other bodies which also largely control the output of various industries. I think -1 heard the other day The publicity that it of a man employed in a factory in Adelaide who was turned out of his union because he did too much work. I have heard it said that unions have a habit of controlling the output of various factories in that way, and that they do so, not so much with a view of keeping up prices as with the idea They, like trusts, have this bad habit of controlling the output. In addition to the reasons I have given, various others are cited by Mr Hobson as contributing to the rise in prices. I commend his article to the consideration of honourable members, and I would draw attention to the following paragraph which I see no hope of solving appears at page 492When the development of the large, rich tracts of agriculture and of mineral resources in the new countries has advanced further, we may The Attorney-General, speaking in expect so large an increase in the output of the",73,Smith Th E Honourable Of The Proposed Amendments As Conveying
291,Mr Atkinson,"They say so. Mr tarded during the period in question, andworld-supply of foods and raw materials as to more than offset the increased manufacture of money. A f a l l of prices will then ensue. But at present it appears as if the world were passing through a period in which an unusually large proportion of its productive energy was being applied to the developmental processes, and a correspondingly smaller proportion to the processes turning u t final commodities for con0 sumption. This consideration, closely related as it is to that rapid expansion of international finance, which, far more than the enlarged output of gold, is the dominant factor in the new economic situation, will serve to harmonize the two tendencies whose co-operation explains the rise in prices, viz., the acceleration in the supply the difficulty with regard to the fixing of of money and the retardation in the supply of goods. Mr Hobson has dealt impartially with the question, and those who read his article will find that the part played by trusts in controlling and keeping up prices is not so great as the Labour party would have us believe. I wish it to be distinctly understood that I hold no brief for trusts, and tliat I am prepared to do as much as is any honourable member of tht Labour party to take effective action against them. If the Government would accept the. amendment which the honourable member for Angas moved when a similar measure was before us two years ago-a n amendment which would take us nearly as far as the amendment of the Constitution proposed by them. I should be prepared to vote for it. It is on more common-sense lines. put a mustard plaster on a wooden leg as apply the honourable member's remedy to this evil. shows what the Honorary Minister knows about the matter. If the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Angas were made, it would give results as good as any that could possibly be secured from the Government proposal, save that it would not enable the Federal Parliament to nationalize combines, as the Labour party would like to do, unless it could be shown that they were acting in restraint of trade. I think that many members of the Opposition would support such an amendment as that proposed by the honourable member for Angas. Returning to the question of the fixiug of prices, I think that, when dealing with such a matter, it is well for us to look for examples of what has happened in other countries. A few days ago I read a hew book by an American professor-Professo r Abbott-entitle d The Common People of Ancient Rome, in which it is shown that at -the time dealt with by the writer the position of the Roman Empire was not altogetherunlike that existing here to-day. Trusts were operating more or less in the way that modern trusts are operating today. Prices were very high, and were rapidly increasing, and, altogether, the State of Rome was very much troubled about the cost of living. That was in year A.D. 301. At that time there was in power an Emperor whom Gibbon has described as a great administrator. I refer to Diocletian, who attempted to cope with prices. He issued an edict covering 800 items, and divided into tables, dealing with the necessaries of life as well as with the wages that were to be paid in every industry, and with manufactured articles as well as with raw products. The penalty for disobedience of this edict was death. An important point which I would recommend for the consideration of Mr Andrew Carnegie is that Diocletian fixed maximum prices. Let us see how far he succeeded in his attempt to cope with the difficulty. His edict has a very remarkable introduction, in which complaint was made of the raging avarice, increasing hour by hour, and of the mad desire, without control, to pay no heed to the needs of the many. Later on, as shown at page 155 of Professor Abbott's work, Diocletian went on to sayIt seems good to us, as we look into the future, to us who are the fathers of the people, that justice intervene to settle matters impartially, in order that that which, long hoped for, humanity itself could not bring about may be secured for the common government of all by the remedies which our care affords. . . . Who is of so hardened a heart and so untouched by a feeling for humanity that he can be unaware, nay, that he has not noticed, that in the sale of wares which are exchanged in the market, or dealt with in the daily business of the cities, an exorbitant tendency in prices has spread to such an extent that the unbridled desire of plundering is held in check neither by abundance nor by seasons of plenty. Professor Abbott makes the rather neat commentI f we did not know that this was found on tablets sixteen centuries old we might think that we were reading a newspaper diatribe against the cool storage plant or the beef trust. Diocletian continuesI t is our pleasure, therefore, that those prices which the subjoined written summary specifies, be held in observance throughout all our domain, that all may know that license to go above the same has been cut off. . . . It is our pleasure (also) that if any man shall have boldly come into conflict with this formal statute, he shall put his life in peril.",74,Smith Th E Honourable Of The Proposed Amendments As Conveying

Nor shall he be esteemed innocent of the same crime who, having articles necessary for daily life and use, shall have decided hereafter that they can be held back, since the punishment ought to be even heavier for him who causes need than for him who violates the law. I should not have made this quotation but because the framers of it were selected that we have in this work a clear indicaby the people, who were careful to choose tion of the result of Diocletian's attempt men who were most fitted to undertake to fix prices.

This Parliament sliould ; It offers the best opportunities Honourable members When tlie United States of America federated there were thirteen States in the Union. To-day there are forty-eight States in the American Federation, and yet the people are not anxious to surrender State rights to any appreciable extent. All the Theodore Roosevelts who have endeavoured to persuade them to do so have failed. As America has progressed, and the resources of each State have been developed, the local bodies have been strengthened. If we adopt a proper policy of immigration in Australia the result will be the same here. Even in Queensland, have not the people in its outlying portions endeavoured to separate themselves from Brisbane many times? Has there not been talk of dividing that State into two States? Do not residents in its remote portions say that they cannot make their voice heard in Brisbane? member for Capricornia advocated the splitting up of Queensland into three States? If we allow the Commonwealth to progress along natural channels we shall obtain a strong form of Federal Government. The longer that form of government continues the more will the 'people adhere to it in preference to a unitary form of government. If the proposals of the Ministry be carried we must sooner or later have a unitary form of government, because the Commonwealth would then have power to nullify almost every State law. I do not say that it would do that, but it would have the power to do it, and there would always exist a temptation to exercise that power. In the Old Country evidence is forthcoming every day that the House of Commons cannot attend to the big things with which it should deal. Consequently a system of devolution is proposed, under which it is suggested that a sort of council should be given to Wales and another to Scotland, in order that the British Parliament may have time to devote to national questions. If the powers sought by the Government are vested in this Parliament it will be overloaded with matters with which it is not fitted to deal. How can an honourable member make himself conversant with all the local requirements of the far-distant portions of Queensland or Western Australia? to do so is an utter absurdity. I have shown that in two cases, at least, if a little common sense be shown by honourable members opposite, they can have the support of the majority of honourable memMr Atkinson. bers on this side. I hope, above all things,, We have only six States. that the public of Australia, who are so vitally concerned, will acquaint themselveswith all the facts of the case; and if they do so, I amsatisfied they will vote even a more emphatic "" No"" than on the previous occasion. When the question of Federation was first brought prominently before the people of Australia, the larger States were reluctant to join because of the equal representation in the Senate; and it was right that they should object to such an undemocratic principle. against equal representation, whilst the honourable member's party supported it. now is one that should be above party. Has not the honourable The larger States, however, consented to join the Union on the clear understanding that the Commonwealth would deal with national matters, while the States should have sovereign and supreme control in local or State matters. Doubtless the large States felt that it would be better that in? national and international matters Australia should speak with one voice instead, of six or seven, perhaps, discordant voices. We now find that the Labour Government desire that the Commonwealth shall havegreater powers, notwithstanding the blot on representation in the Senate. In this connexion, it may be interesting to quotefrom a speech delivered by the Attorney General in 1898 on proportional representation, of which he was then a strongadvocateIt bas been said that equal representation wasunavoidable under Federation, but, as a matter of fact, one of the greatest Federations in the world was based on the principle of proportional representation. (Cheers.) He referred to Germany and to Canada, which latter was on all-fours with our own case. The Labour party believed in proportional representation, and on .that rock they had fallen out with the Federalists. If the Anti-Convention B i ll people could get proportional representation, they would* swallow everything else. (Cheers.) Although still capable of being out-voted, we would still have what -we were entitled to, namely, a voteequal to our strength. We have not got this, and he ventured to say that, until we did get it, we should not accept Federation. The Attorney-General now waves all those To expect him conditions aside.

We now know, on Mr Hughes' authority, that it is nothing of the kind. It is a machine so simple that a babe may understand it and a child control it . Bad men possessed of wickedly selfish hearts have hitherto ruled and manipulated it for their own enrichment and the cruel oppression of the masses, but we only need to hand the machine over to Mr Hughes and give him f u l l power, and, hey presto ! Australia and Utopia will be convertible terms. That is a very nice doctrine if we could price, but they have recently been as high' only give effect to itThere is no mystery in his processes.

That is to cut down to a minimum the honourable member talked of the high price price at which the industrial employer shall sell of apricots, so I suppose there is an aprithe commodities produced by the very high wages and the very little work. Thereupon everybody cot combine that requires dealing with. I will be blissfully happv and prosperous. Rents should like to quote some expressions of will f a l l down with such a run that the average opinion by leading Labour members of the labourer will be able to inhabit the "" bijou v ill a "" of his dreams for about 5s. a week, and New South Wales Parliament in regard to so cheap will be the cost of living that we shall the proposed alterations in the Constitution all be able to set apart about three-fourths of over a year ago. These quotations, I think, -our incomes for pleasuring and luxuries; and are applicable now, because I fail to see every man who wants one will own a motor' car in less than no time. Who could f a i l to be captivated by a prospect so delightfully alluring? And nothing is required to realize this exquisite vision except to empower Mr Hughes to fix wages and prices. That is all he asks for. With characteristic modesty he abjures the temptation to demand larger powers, and he distinctly tells us he will be quite content with constitutional authority to compel the employing classes to pay the maximum and accept the minimum. There is much more that is interesting in this article, but I shall make only one more The notion is really too comical for words. Just-pictjre for a moment the.idea of a bife manufacturer under the Hughes system. Let us suppose he owns a large hat factory, and employs, say, 1,000 men. Mr Hughes strolls one morning into his office and orders him to pay his men a week apiece. The manufacturer replies, "" V e ry well, sir; you are on -' top, -and I have no option, but I ' l l have to raise the price of hats to do it . "" . ->.... "" Oh, no, vou don't,"" says Mr Hughes. ."" I've examined your books, and I find you can both pay the'hi'gh Wages and reduce the price of.your hats by 6d. apiece. This reduction i i i price will have to be made at once."" "" But,"" exclaims the manufacturer, "" in that event I ' l l not have income enough to keep my house going: I ' l l be a poor man."" "" Can't heln that,"" says Mr Hughes, "" your day is over. You've had your good' time. My advice is, close up your mansion and live in one of Mr King O'Malley's cottages."" All this talk of fixing prices is the greatest rubbish, because such .a thing.is. absolutely impossible. We are told there, is a Meat Ring, but let the Government, try .to fix the price of meat. I have sent, s'he^p of, sayj 65 lbs. to Flemington, and received only.5s. 3d. per head ; while, on another occasion; sheep not two-thirds as heavy have realized 16s. per head. Further, I have; sent bul-. locks to the Sydney market .and received £ 3 ios. per head, and for ..others not'nearly so good ^ i o . Where, then, is the controlling influence of the great Meat. Ring?

I do not mean to be debarred from making quotations simply because the passages have been quoted before. I wish first to quote mier of New South Wales, at the Political Labour League Conference of 1911. He said, then, respecting the proposals which were submitted at the last referendaWhat is demanded is too sweeping. The powers asked for by the Federal Labour party are outside .of the Labour platform, and for that reason any individual has a perfect right to adopt the negative attitude. Mr Holman, the Attorney-General of New South Wales, speaking at the same Conference, saidI am an unswerving adherent to the doctrine of what is sometimes described as State rights.' friend of yours? friends, although I'have called him hard names. He did me a good turn in defeating me for the State electorate of Cootamundra, because it enabled me to secure the Federal electorate of North Sydney. I , like him, am an unswerving adherent of the States right doctrine. To continue the quotationI still believe that the State House of New South Wales, so far as the people of New South Wales are concerned, is the instrument by which the liberties, the rights, and the happiness of this State are to be secured. FurtherNo man can consider the conditions under which the battle of social reform is to be fought out without realizing that the State Parliaments are infinitely more valuable and effective weapons than is the Federal Parliament. AgainAl l the powers asked for in the referenda exceed the Labour platform, and I claim the right, without any violation of the spirit of solidarity, to holci' the views I do. I am sorry that Mr Holman has since been brought to heel hy the Trades Hall, and is now prepared to swallow those words. We shall find him now on the side ,of the Unificationists. views. who never changes his opinions. But, although pressure has been brought to bear on others besides Mr Holman, they have not changed their views on this matter, but have dared to give expression to what they honestly think. The Secretary for Lands in New South Wales, Mr Beeby, has donethis, and because he has refused to be brought to heel by the Labour'leagues and the Trades Hall, which have endeavoured to make him act against his principles, they are trying to kick him out of the movement. goes so far as that. The only man in the Parliament of New South Wales who professes to believe in Unification is Mr Griffith. Mr Nielsen might be regarded as a man of weight in the State Labour party, because the Labour Government of New South Wales is at present paying him four guineas a day, in addition to his parliamentary remuneration of .£500 a year, to do practically nothing. To get him out of the way, they made him a sort of dummy agent in America. It was awkward to have him in the New South WalesParliament, because of the views he held on the land question, and therefore he got this billet. He said., speaking on the subject now under discussionI do not believe in depriving the State of its-functions one by one and thus aggrandizing the Federal Parliament. Whilst the State Parliaments retain f u l l control of ihe matters l e f t within the State ambit under the Federal Constitution, I shall strenuously oppose any encroachment on State rights by ' the Federal authorities. The powers asked for are too great... The States can better control the industrial laws,, except those definitely dealing with corporations. The late Mr Dacey was always looker! upon as one of the most conscientious men in the New South Wales Parliament, andhis opinions as a leading member of the State Labour party are worth having. He saidThere is a movement on foot now for what is called Unification, that is, the six State Housesshall be shut up and the whole of the legislation centred in the Federal Parliament. Sof a r as my vote can go, I will protest against that: to the end of the chapter.

307,Mr Speaker,"The honourable memWatson said regarding FederationI f it meant that in order to obtain Federation we were to place our necks under the heels of people resident in smaller Colonies, he was not prepared to pay the price. He was referring to the representation given to the States in the Senate. On 8th February, 1897, Messrs. McGowen, Holman, Hughes, and others addressed a meeting on behalf of the Labour party, and the Attorney-General then saidThe Labour party, believes in the establishment j f a Federal Court of Appeal, and that Court should be the final Court of Australia. As in America, it should have the right to determine questions affecting Federal as opposed to State rights. Great consideration should be given to words like those. We are asked to extend the powers of the Federation, but does the experience of the past twelve vears warrant this being done ? The Commonwealth Parliament has had full control of defence since 1901, but has that control been satisfactory ? I am not now referring to our compulsory system of military training, which I do not wish to criticise, but I say without fear of contradiction that our Defence Forces to-day, permanent and militia, are not as efficient as they were before Federation. The Federation has failed to deal satisfactorily with defence. How has it dealt with the Post Office? Can any one say that the administration of the Postmaster-General's Department has been satisfactory under Federation? Today, it is in a state of chaos, and the employees are on the verge of mutiny. favoured the Federation of the States because I thought that it would lead to the improvement of the national defence, but in that I have been sadly disappointed. I believe that our defence is not as efficient now as it was prior to Federation. that fact to the world? our minds on these questions. The honourable member may take it for granted that the world at large knows as much about our defence as we do. These things cannot be hidden. much about our defences generallv as we do, and probably more about the defence of our coast line. The greater shame to us ! member confine himself to the question before the Chair? to order in this debate. Other honourable members, including the Attorney-General, have been allowed a wide range of discussion. lowed honourable members ample opportunity to deal with the constitutional points at issue, but the honourable member is not in order in confining his attention to the Defence Forces. that since that service had not been satisfactorily dealt with by the Fedeial Parliament-sinc e the parliament had tailed to> deal satisfactorily with the services already intrusted to it-ther e was no warrant for giving it an increase of power. Another reason which actuated me in advocating Federation was that I believed that some attempt would be made by the Federal Parliament to bring about a uniform railway gauge for Australia. The Parliament, however, has utterly failed to deal with .that important problem. That, again, is a reason why the people should not grant an extension, of its present power. The Post master-General's Department affords another illustration of the absolute failure of this Parliament to deal satisfactorily with the services intrusted to it. It takes two monthsI know of one case in which it took three months-to be connected with the telephone system after an application for a telephone has been granted. That being so, how long would it take a trader to obtain supplies from a nationalized industry? That is a question for honourable members opposite to answer. From the way in which I the Defence Department and the Postmaster-General's Department have been dealt with, it is plain that they are incompetent to satisfactorily carry on those services, and, therefore, there is no warrant for granting these increased powers. I come now to the nationalization of monopolies. A very pertinent question is. ""What is a monopoly?"" As has been clearly demonstrated during this debate, no one on the Government side of the House can define the word, yet the people are to be asked to give this Parliament power to deal with monopolies. Under the The Japanese know as Government proposal, if both Houses of the Parliament, by resolution, declared that any industry was a monopoly, then it would be within the power of the Parliament to nationalize it. That is a very dangerous power to place in the hands of any Parliament, more especially when we consider how both Houses are constituted. What does it mean ?

314,Mr Ryrie,"I merely desired to showin the hands of the Attorney-General of the day-I am not referring particularly to the present Attorney-General-the power to bring down a motion declaring that any 1 industry is ;i monopoly. It would open the door to a state of affairs worse than that prevailing in America. We talk about bribery and corruption, ""graft,"" and that sort of thing in the United States of America, and I certainly say that the placing of this power in the hands of practically one man would open the door to all sorts of malpractices here. Let us assume for the sake of argument that we had power to nationalize any industry declared by resolution passed by both Houses to be a monopoly. If that were the position, then the Attorney-General of the day would be able to say to a man who was conducting a profitable business, "" I think you are making very large profits, and I intend to submit a resolution to Parliament asking that your business shall be declared a monopoly."" To what would that open the door? If the Attorney-General of the day -no matter what Government was in power -brought down such a resolution, it would be carried. The Parliament as at present constituted, at all events, would pass it. There would not be one dissentient voice raised on the Government ' side of the House, and, as the Labour party are also in the majority in the Senate, such a resolution would also be passed in that Chamber. I ask honourable members to say where any monopolies are in operation in Australia? Can honourable members point to any monopoly, trust, or combine here? I ask the smiling Honorary Minister how many businesses or industries he can point to as being controlled by a trust, combine, or monopoly? The Coal Vend has been trotted out before us again and again. We know all about it. Mr Ed den, Minister of Mines in New South Wales, has declared that it is absolutely the best friend the miners ever had, because it has kept up the price of coal, and has enabled the colliery proprietors"" to pay good wages to their employees. Turning from the Coal Vend, which has been flogged to death, we come to the sugar monopoly, and I venture to assert that, notwithstanding that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has a monopoly of the business, the price of sugar in Australia to-day is, having regard to our import duty, as low as it is in any other country. If we were to do away with that big company, and substitute for it ten small refining companies, I venture to assert that Mr Ryrie. we should not obtain any reduction in price. The price of sugar would probably be increased. as good an article. over, and make it a national monopoly. would undoubtedly go up. We should have, in connection with the industry, the day-labour system and "" the Government stroke."" The position would be the same as it is in connection with Mr Griffith's State brickworks, lime quarries, and other Socialistic concern's in New South Wales. big dividends to pay. to pay big dividends, it is probably because of its clever management. of its employees. paid. Australia is not exorbitant, and I believe that, allowing for the import duty, it is as low as it is in any other country. our own sugar, what has the import duty to do with the matter ? price. We have also been told that there is a Meat Ring in Australia. As one who knows something about the sale of stock, I do not hesitate to say that that is an absolute myth. An honourable member of the Labour party accused me of being the President of the Meat Combine, but I repeat that there is no Meat Ring and no Meat Combine to keep up the price of meat. It has been said that the Sydney Meat Preserving Company is subsidized by pastoralists to keep up the price of meat. From its inception, however, it has never paid a dividend. I am not a shareholder, but I know that it operates on the Sydney market, irrespective of whether prices are high or low. If it be subsidized by graziers to keep up prices, how is it that there are times when those who are raising stock have to accept for their cattle in the Flemington yards a price that does not pay them? If this company exists simply in the interests of the men on the land, and for the purpose of keeping up the price of meat, why does it not keep up the price ?

If any body can show me that this Trust exercises a baneful influence on the community, that it raises the price of tobacco, or that it provides an article of inferior quality, I say that it should be dealt with. I have recently endeavoured to gain information in regard to the Coal Vend, the alleged Sugar Combine, the mythical Meat Ring, and the 1 Tobacco Combine. The only Trust about which I have been able to secure reliable information is the Tobacco Trust. I learn that this combination was formed on the ist February, 1904, and that, for the eleven months of the year, it employed in its various factories 1,614 hands, including men, women, youths, and girls. Their total wages amounted to .£98,728, or an avera S of £ 6 6 14s. 7d. per annum. The e average wage earned for the twelve months ended 30th June last was not less than £100. This shows a difference in favour of the year 1912, as compared with the year 1904, of £$S 5 5dper employ^, and, allowing s for the same, number of hands, of £S2»699 m wages. we can find fault with the Trust, therefore, on the score of the wages that it pays. It has also been pointed out to me that the wages paid are quite apart from the benefits which the employees receive in the way of subsidies towards friendly societies, life assurance, sick and accident allowances, building schemes, luncheon provision, & c , the total cost of which runs into many thousands of pounds annually. In addition to the increased cost of manufacture involved, there has been a heavy increase in the cost of the raw material during the past two years, but notwithstanding this increase, there have been no increases in the price of the main products, other than those which have been brought about by changes in the Tariff. Consequently we cannot find fault with the Trust on account of the price of tobacco. I fail to see, therefore, that it exercises a baneful influence on the community. has it paid ? ask for that information? the Tobacco Trust. I have not received a dividend from it, because I am not a shareholder in it. It is well that the public should know the way in which the business of this Trust is conducted. Unless it is conducted in such a way as to impose hardship on the employees, or to increase the price of tobacco, or to supply us with an inferior article, we have no warrant for interfering with it. It was stated the other night, by way of interjection, that these trusts treated their employees well only because they were forced to do so. I find, however, that the Tobacco Trust gives its employees a number of privileges which it is not obliged to give them. For instance, it has inaugurated a savings bank scheme, under which employees may bank their savings with a Government savings bank. Arrangements have been made with the Commissioners for the company to act as agents for the employees. I learn thatDeposits from is. upwards will be accepted on the day that wages are paid, starting 14th September, 1911, and interest will be allowed on sums from £ i to ^250, which will be calculated by calendar months, namely, from the first day of the month following that in. which a deposit is made. The number of the Trust's employees is now nearly 2,000. This scheme is intended to convenience them. I further gather, from a circular which has been forwarded to me, I do not think thatA l l accounts will be kept with the Victoriastreet branch of the Savings Bank. On the Tuesday of each <»eek the employees will fill in the slip with the amount they wish to ""deposit, and hand same to the foremen, or place it in the box provided for the purpose. This sum will be deducted from their pay, and they will receive the balance and the bank pass-book showing a receipt for the sum deposited. The circular also saysInterest which will be allowed on all sums up to ^250 will be added on the 30th day of June each year, and will be subsidized by the company by such an amount as will bring the rate up to 4 per cent, per annum. That is a very considerable concession. It proves that a good deal is said about trusts and combines in this country that might very well be left unsaid. I do not think that they exercise the baneful influence which honourable members opposite would make us believe. They are not to be compared in any way with the trusts in America of which we have heard so much. I certainly should not approve of the existence in this country of such trusts and monopolies as we read of as existing in America. If we had them here, it would be time for us to put oui foot down and deal drastically with them.

There should be some information afforded as to the means by which it is proposed to keep the water at the requisite height in the summer season, because, if it is allowed to recede, there must be pestilence. Whether it is proposed to cut a channel from the sea, or pump the water from the Murrumbidgee, I do not know. But I do know it is impossible for, at any rate, eleven months in the year to keep the necessary level in that portion of the Molonglo course. It may be regarded as an impertinence on my part, as a layman to speak as I am doing; but, at any rate, I know that it is impossible to get so large a quantity of water there unless it is brought there, and we ought to know where it is to be brought from. The names of the officials on the plan are those of men who occupy high positions in their profession, and how they can have placed their signature to anything so misleading, I cannot understand. Australia has been imposed upon enough by the placing of the Federal Capital where it is, and it is not fair to mislead the country anv further. I should like to ask the Postmaster General whether it would he possible to lay on the table to-morrow the Tasmanian mail contract ?
