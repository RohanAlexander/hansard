21,Mr Page,"Not according to last night'swas found at last night's meeting that the clothes of which ihe honourable member for Maranoa spoke yesterday would not fit, and the men concerned have been given six months in which to try to stretch them a little. The sentiments of loyalty to which expression has been given by several honourable members opposite remind me very much of the sentiments which they uttered in connection with their proposal to borrow ^3.000,000 with which to provide for the purchase of a Dreadnought as a gift to the Mother Countrya proposal which was very politely, but firmly, turned down by the British Government. Indeed, I am inclined to think that British statesmen do not appreciate all the grovelling that goes on, ancl in this connection I propose for a minute to remind honourable members of what has happened in the Old Country. Some people, by the way, speak of England as the "" Home Country,"" but I recognise no land, save Australia, as the "" Home Country."" from the Old Country a chance. we must not forget that we are an Australian Parliament, and should put Australia first. place that gave us birth. ° no such suggestion. I claim to be as loyal as any one else. The only difference between my attitude and that of some honourable members opposite is that, unlike them, I do not care to be always parading my loyalty. Let us consider for a moment what has been said by some of our greatest English statesmen. Disraeli, for instance, said that "" these wretched colonies "" were a ""millstone round the neck of the Old Country."" I mention this statement merely to show that British statesmen in the past, as well as those of the present day, have not appreciated the spirit of pandering to them, and what I might term "" the kowtowing "" to Royalty that goes on. These references lead me to the paragraph in His Excellency's Speech regarding the question of Australian defence. The Government, in my opinion, have taken a practical step, and one that will be appreciated by the people of Australia, in making the defence of the Commonwealth the first consideration. An attempt has been made by a section of the' press to belittle the prospect:o the Commonwealth note issue they never tive work of the session. part, I should be well satisfied-indee d I think that any Government ought to beif only one of the measures mentioned in the Speech were passed. I refer to the Bill to provide for a Commonwealth Bank, the passing of which would be enough to justify the existence of this or any other party. Such a measure will be more keenly appreciated by the people of Australia than any other Act passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. posal ? orable member will know when the Bill is introduced. I look forward with great interest to the establishment of this National Bank, because I realize that it will afford greater security to the people of the country than , can be, or ever has been, afforded them by our private banking institutions. The Commonwealth Bank, having at its back the resources of Australia and behind it the security of the nation, will never place its depositors in the position so many occupied in the nineties, when private banking companies failed and brought destitution and ruin to thousands. Another advantage which the National Bank will afford is that it will provide farmers and struggling settlers with cheap money at lower rates of interest than those which have been extorted from them by private institutions. There are many other noteworthy features associated with the proposal, and one which I suppose^ the honourable member for Richmond will appreciate, is that those employed in the Commonwealth Bank will get a little more than have the men who have been sweated in the past by banking institutions, whose huge profits have been going into the pockets of a few private individuals. Of course, it will be prophesied by the Opposition that dire destitution and financial ruin will follow the establishment of this bank. We had the same prophesy in conntxion with the introduction of the Bill to provide for a Commonwealth note issue. We were told then that the passing of that measure would result in financial chaos. take our notes. fact is that we have at present in circulation notes representing nearly ^9,200,000.

42,Mr Parker Moloney,"Even thatwhich they put to no real use. I come now to another matter referred to by several members of the Opposition, and that is the question of the referenda. The Leader of the Opposition was more eloquent when rejoicing-over the result of the last referenda than he was in dealing with any other matter. how he could claim it as a victory for his party, since in opening the campaign at Ballarat, on behalf of the Opposition, he saidLadies and Gentlemen -You all realize that the issue before us to-night is something which should be considered quite independently of the Ministry or the Opposition, or quite apart from party politics and party feeling. orable member for Richmond says "" Hear, hear,"" but I ask him how the Leader of the Opposition, in view of this statement, can reasonably claim the result of the referenda as a victory for the Opposition. He saidNo Ministry is pleading for a continuance of power. No Opposition is seeking to eject them. This question stands on its own merits, apart from all other considerations, and, as far as I am concerned, there will be no introduction of any other matter not immediately pertinent to the issue. The honourable member, therefore, laid it down from the very outset that the question was apart from party politics and from party feeling, and yet from his place in the House he now claims that he had a majority of a quarter of a million of the people of the country at his back. knows perfectly well that the majority of members on this side of the House-and so far as' I know, it is so-sai d the question was not a party one-personall y I said so-and that it should be fought on non-party lines. How, then, can honourable members opposite claim the result as a victory and a triumph for them ? party hunting Holman? hunting him ? If what the honourable member suggests is correct, it is all the less reason why the Opposition should claim the result as a victory for their side, because they were assisted by so many members of the Labour party. They would not have had the quarter of a million majority of supporters that they boast about but for gentlemen like Mr Holman. I was going to pall Mr Holman something else, but I will not. I have no appreciation for a man, whether he is on this side of the House or the other, if he is always to be found sitting on a rail and is prepared to turn a somersault to every political wind that blows. Perhaps it was a want of confidence in their own side that made honourable members opposite say that the issue I fail to understand, however, was to be fought on non-party lines. Perhaps it was that they did not want their party to be associated too closely with the side of the question tliat they were advocating. But the most surprising utterance that came from the Leader of the Opposition was that there were more trusts at the back of the Labour party in connection with the referenda than there were at the back of his party. Such a statement is scarcely worth discussing. We can just imagine the support given to the Labour party by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which, since the referenda, has put the price of sugar up by £ 3 a ton to recoup itself for the money which it spent in that campaign. How it must smile at such utterances by the Leader of the Opposition ! Honourable members opposite say they did not see any of the money that was going about in the referenda campaign. If they had come to my electorate they would have seen over a dozen organizers, some of them receiving over £ 7 a week and expenses, to distribute literature and organize against the referenda. Where do they think all that money came from? Then the tales that were told ! As to monopolies, those who were against the referenda had the hugest monopoly I ever sawa monopoly He of misrepresentation. In my electorate I had to fight single-handed against from seventeen to twenty organizers, who in some places conducted a house-to-house canvass; and actually told the people that I was against the referenda. One could write a book about the things that were done -' majority against the Government's proposals. able members opposite are quite entitled to the credit of any victory whicli they get under such discreditable circumstances. They are welcome to all the honour and glory they can extract from it. But the next time the questions are submitted they will have to fight under very different conditions. There will not be any next time. '",16,Brennan

Perhaps the State righters have already learned the error of their .ways, and will be prepared to hand these powers over to the Commonwealth. In several towns the organizers on the other side told the shopkeepers, especially the ladies, whom they considered to be the most innocent, that if the referenda were carried they would lose their little lolly shops, and that all the goods that were worth anything would be taken away from them and nationalized, while they would be left with only the refuse that nobody would look at. Unfortunately, there are in country districts any number of people who are ready to listen to such fantastic tales. At one meeting in my electorate, and a report of it appeared in the press, one lady showed the small estimate she had of the intelligence of her audience by telling them that if the referenda were carried the Labour party would be able to compel every woman in the Commonwealth to wear harem skirts. If that had been uttered as a mere joke I should not take any notice of it, but it was told in all seriousness, and all the protection I can get for the manufacthere were numbers ready to believe it. Even that was not much more ridiculous than the arguments put forward by several honourable members opposite, to the effect that if the Labour party's proposals were -carried, the inclusion of the clause dealing with railway servants would have the effect of causing the State railways to be handed over entirely to Federal control. I have never heard any member of the Opposition seriously attempt to justify any such statement. Can any of them show in what way the power would be given to the Federation to take over the State railways? railway servants the right and privilege due to them of having their grievances tried before an Arbitration Court. could be distorted by honourable members opposite to mean that the State railways would be handed over to the Commonwealth, I have not yet heard explained. If honourable members opposite can read anything like that into the BillI shall be pleased to hear of it. give the Government power tofixrates on bother about your new Protection, but the railways? referred to the right of the railway serin his industry. vants to appeal to the Arbitration Court. What have honourable members opposite to say now in support of their frequent assertions that there were no monopolies in Australia? They used to tell the people, "" We are free from these things in Australia. It is true they exist in America, but in Australia we need not worry our heads about them."" I hope the people who' spread that doctrine are enjoying the payment of the extra £ 3 a ton that they are charged on sugar to-day. The housewives of Australia must now thank honourable members opposite for the information that there are no trusts or combines in Australia. When the next referendum is taken the people will have learnt to their cost that there are monopolies here. The time they realize the fact is when it touches their pockets. I am glad to see that the Government are keeping the question of the Tariff in front of them. It cannot be denied that the Protection enjoyed to-day in Australia has done much for this country. We have only to look at the difference between Sydney to-day and Sydney in the days of Free Trade to find an object lesson in the efficacy of Protection. Personally, I want turers of the country, but as a new Protectionist, and, therefore, a true Protectionist, I want to see more of the profits shared with workers than has been the case in the past. During the referenda campaign we were told that we did not want the new Protection, as the Wages Boards were doing everything necessary. If there was any one feature more striking than another, it was the number of converts made in that campaign to the Wages Board system. I have known State members who consistently voted against the application of the Wages Board system on the floor of the House, yet That clause merely gave the prepared,when opposing the referendum, to hold up both hands in favour of Wages Boards. One gentleman in particular, the How that President at that time of the Chamber of Manufactures, said that his advice to the workers of Australia was to "" stick to their glorious Wages Boards."" was Mr Hogg. He said, "" My advice to the workers of Australia is this : do not stick to your glorious Wages Boards.""",17,Brennan

I want to see full and ample protection given to the manufacturers of the Commonwealth, but while I recognise that great things have been done under our present Tariff, we must not forget that we should never have the Tariff that we have to-day if it had not been for the Labour members in this House. what it is, and therefore they are responsible for the building up of the industries so far as that has been done, but they did so on the promise that the workers were to get a fair and square deal when the protection was given. We cannot ask for much more proof that the present duties are effective than the cry about the scarcity of labour, a subject upon which the honourable member for Echuca waxed eloquent. I do not know whether honourable members opposite are sincere in their utterances about Protection; but if it be true that there is not enough Protection, we would naturally expect to find idle workmen. On the contrary, the honourable member for Echuca spoke about the scarcity of labour; and I should like to remind honourable members of a little incident during last session. On the motion for adjournment the honourable member read a letter which he had received from some one in his electorate in reference to the repatriated Australians, those chaps who went out to risk their lives in defence of the Empire of which we have heard so much in the last few days, and who, when they came back, could not find work, and were practically ignored by the authorities. uttered by the honourable member on that occasion are very dissimilar from those he uttered last night. The honourable member, when he brought that letter under our notice, showed that there were men in his He has thereelectorate who could not get work. The letter, which was written by a clergyman, is as follows : It is now a long time since the Government dumped down some twenty-seven returned Ausformed by some one in the office of the Closer Settlement Board that work would be waiting for them on their arrival in Rushworth.

I do not care where the capital may be; but while the proposed site is better than I had thought -that does not commit me to very muchthere are a great many others in Australia infinitely better.

There is what I might almost call a barbarous plan of demanding from a handful of, perhaps, the poorest people, who desire a telephone, a substantial guarantee, and, in many instances, an undertaking that they will form a "" workingbee "" to provide and erect the necessary poles. It is cruel to ask these poor people to do what residents in the more populous and wealthier districts are not called upon to perform. As I have said, this plan is not peculiar to the present Government, because for years the poorest portions of the community have been penalized in this regard. There is another system which cannot be defended on the score of common sense, fair play, or national policy. Penny postage has lieen established over Australia and the world generally, and a uniform system, to a certain extent, has been adopted in regard to the telegraph, but with the telestances in which a telephone bureau is phones under the zone system the further a person lives from the capital or the centre, the more costly this convenience becomes. Some of the examples in this connection are positively absurd. stance, if a person telephones from the furthest point A to B, and then disconnects, and has the message repeated on to C, there is a distinct saving on the cost of telephoning direct, although additional work and expense is entailed on the Department. That is an absurdity of the zone system which I am surprised that the Department should have permitted to grow up. rangement has been altered. ence a few weeks ago. Another complaint against the Postal Department is this: While the remuneration of postal officials in all branches of the service is being increased, those in charge of allowance oflices are being sweated. There are persons who have to give the whole of their time to keeping a post-office, a telephone office, making old-age pension payments, and looking after a savings bank for £ 3 0 or £ 4 0 a year. tions of an office the proper basis for the determination of the remuneration of those employed in it?

Honourable members have a grievance against the Government because of the manner in which the sugar question was treated last session. The honourable member for Capricornia moved for an inquiry, but, as the session advanced, the Prime Minister asked private members to give up to the Government the time usually allotted to their business, on the understanding that there would be a full opportunity to deal with it at the end of the session, even if that took two days. opportunity to take a vote on it. When we tried to carry out the arrangement, what happened ? Prime Minister been in South Africa, I believe he would have kept his word; but the arrangement was not kept.

VVe have no more information available now than there was a year ago, when it was known that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was taking full advantage of the duty; and the honourable member for Maranoa stated that the wages paid on the cane-fields were the 'lowest in Queensland, while the workers, -with few exceptions, were no better housed than the Kanakas had been, and in some places were in the same buildings. The Prime Minister,however, would neither allow a Committee of the House to be appointed. Did he think it necessary to wait until there had been a strike ? Had an inquiry been entered upon, either by a Commission such as was proposed by the Deakin Government or by a Committee, there would have been no strike, because the men would have been willing to await its report and give Parliament an opportunity to deal with the whole subject. There is not one member of the House with a full and complete knowledge of the industry from the planting of the -cane right up to the refining of the sugar. The Attorney-General went to Hobart to invite the people to vote for tlie referendum proposals, on the ground that they would -enable the Government to deal with the sugar monopoly, and my reply to him was that his Prime Minister had prevented a full ancl complete inquiry into the conditions of the industry.

The honourable member for Maranoa and others then spoke of the wages that are being paid, and the late lamented member for North Sydney, who from his business relations was a complete master of the sugat trade, put before the House the industrial side of the case, but the Government declined to appoint the Commission which the Deakin Government had promised, and prevented honourable members from appointing a Committee, by jockeying them out of a division on the proposal. -making a statement which he knows to be incorrect.

The honourable member for Indi has quoted a statement by the Leader of the Opposition that the recent referenda did not involve a party question. I said on every platform from which I spoke that I took the same view. The Labour party themselves, however, made the issue a party one.

How did the Opposition get him in? the railway servants was responsible for the attitude of the honourable member for Flinders. I wish now to press upon the Government the advisableness of proceeding as speedily as possible with the development of the Northern Territory. We have made a very wretched bargain. We have given £3,500,000 for the Territory, and have taken over the responsibility of conducting certain existing railways It is therefore the bounden duty Parliament itself, to devise some scheme by which the Northern Territory can be settled. A white population is the best and the only defence we can ever secure for the Territory. It will never be developed by large leaseholds such as have prevailed there for the last forty or fifty years. favour freeholds? ritory could be settled more satisfactorily by the adoption of the system of community settlement, which was followed ir* the early days by the United States of America, and more recently by Canada. We cannot hope to induce a few people to scatter themselves over the country, cutting themselves off from their friends, the means of education for their children, and all the comforts of our modern civilization. It would pay the Government well, I believe, to establish, on an approved site in the Territory, a community of 800 or 3,000 families. We should give them a good start; let them bring with them the comforts of civilization, and then the settlement of the Northern Territory will not be the bugbear that it is to-day. In that way only can it be satisfactorily settled. We describe as settled many parts of WesternAustralia, Northern Queensland, and theTerritory, over which a sheep or some other beast, perhaps, travels once a fortnight every year. We need something more thanthat. I come now to the purchase of large areas for military purposes in the different States. Such an expenditure is an absolute waste of money. There is no. necessity for the Commonwealth to acquire50,000 or 60,000 acres to be used for a fortnight a year for defence purposes. No difficulty has ever been experienced in Tasmania in obtaining sites for military camps, and military men assert that it is really adisadvantage to hold camps year after year in the same place. The Government haveundertaken the purchase of some 50,000 acres in the Midlands of Tasmania for military purposes practice on a small area. slightest difficulty in obtaining in Tasmania, free of charge, as many large areas as are wanted for this purpose. with guns having a range of nine miles? crowning folly of the Government relates-",22,Brennan

Again, at Lithgow, cadets declined to be drilled by non-unionists. The whole system we are building up is that of a pop-gun navy, and an army of school boys, involving a cost of nearly £3,000,000 a year. At present our navy consists of three vessels, not one of which would dare to show its nose outside the Headsi f , in time of trouble, a eruiser appeared in our waters. British Admiralty suggested the very class of vessels we have obtained. Australia are not receiving, and will not receive, anything like a return for the money we are spending on defence. Under the present system we shall have the most costly army, and also the most costly navy, in proportion to its fighting possibilities, that the world has ever seen. We are spending, practically, £3,000,000 a year, and yet we have little, if anything, to put in the way of an invading force. The Military Department is discouraging, or, at all events, failing to encourage what would be a really good fighting force in Australia to-day if the necessity arose. I refer to the rifle clubs. we were spending this year £23,000 more than we spent last vear in that direction. spent in a verybad way, because rifle clubs all over Australia are being driven out of existence.

Another important industry which was being built up was the shipment of meat from Queensland to Canada. That would have become a very valuable trade. Canada from its position can never be a great stock-raising country, and there is a big opening there for frozen meat, which Australia produces in abundance. That frozen meat trade, which has been built up by the energy of the Australian people, chiefly in Queensland, will be lost to us. I am informed on the most reliable authority that if the steamers had The terminal port in future is to be had three or four times the space available it could have been filled up every voyage; but now the supplies of frozen meat for Canada will be drawn entirely from New Zealand. Another trade that might have been fostered if the line had been kept going is the enormous tourist traffic from the United States. Citizens of the American nation go to all parts of the world. They are an intelligent community, and they like to travel and spend their money lavishly. I was assured by many of them that if they had known there was a good steamer service to Australia they would have come down in considerable numbers, spent a I should like to great deal of money here; and exchanged ideas with us.

He has diverted to New Zealand a stream of trade and passenger traffic which ought to have been secured for Australia. I think there is plenty of room for two lines-on e with its terminus in New Zealand and another with its terminus in Sydney, and touching at Brisbane. Canada is growing by leaps and bounds.

Even an expenditure of £80,000,000 will not save us if the British Navy goes down, for in that event we must go down, too.

It is impossible just now to float an Australian venture on the London market. When in EnglandI was disappointed to see, day after day, an immense volume of capital going from Great Britain to Canada and the Argentine-countries which are our great competitors in the production of wheat, meat, and butter-in stead of to Australia. That capital will stimulate enterprise there in all directions, ancl so encourage our competitors. As a matter of fact, more British capital is now invested in the Argentine than there is in Australia. If that money had come here instead of going to the South American Republic, we should scarcely have heard of the Argentine in the matter of the production of meat and butter. . As it is, our great competitors in these markets are being stimulated by capital which should have come here. good thing for business? without it. success if they are securing it by means df cheap labour. cannot be described as cheap. there is better paid than it is in Australia, but the cost of living is considerably higher. in Australia, you will find that the shareThe financing of the loans of the States should receive the most serious consideration. It is not at all welcome news to learn that about 90 per cent, of the last State loan was left on the hands of the underwriters. I should like to see intelligent regood a chance of existence and profitable presentations made, through the High Commissioner, on the other side, so that we shall not be left in a hole, and a very considerable toll of interest exacted from us, at the last moment. All these are matters that ought to engage the earnest attention of the Government if Australia is to continue to be, as we hope it always will, the finest place in the world. Sitting suspended from 12.55 to 2.15 p.m. -With reference to the proposed establishment of a Commonwealth bank, there is no reason why, if it is carried out upon proper lines, it should not pay, whether it is instituted by the Government or by private ment. At present the people of Australia are not badly off as regards banking institutions. In almost every town, however small, there may be found the branch of some bank; in fact, in many places we are over-banked. In some towns with only a hundred inhabitants, one will find three or four branch banks. That is a heavy expense, and as regards Victoria, it would be much better if four or five of our local banks were to amalgamate and form one large institution. The larger the capital, the cheaper and better is the management, and I believe if some of the banks amalgamated they would pay better, the public would get their money at lower rates of interest, ancl their clerks would be much better paid than they are at present; for if there is auy class in this community which is badly paid as compared with other scctions^ I believe it is the bank clerks. ployers being capitalists. not competition a member will remember that when the crash took place some twenty years ago, a great percentage of the banks had to reconstruct and go into liquidation. In a majority of cases, they lost the whole of their capital, and a large part of the funds of the depositors was converted into preferential shares or debentures. People think that banking Labour has been a great paying concern; but if you take the history of the Colonial banks holders have had a very small return on their capital, and, in many cases, they have lost the whole of their investment. If , however, the Commonwealth bank is carried on upon sound banking lines, it has just as employment of its money as has any other bank. Buti f it is carried on upon the lines suggested by the honourable member for New England, I am afraid the Commonwealth, or any other bank, will be in the same position as our banks were twenty years ago. The honourable member proposed to lend money on long terms to people to build houses, so as to get rid of the landlord system.

250,Mr Agar Wynne,"It is very dif'people of this country by doing what they believe to be best for them in connection with this project; but it is absolutely necessary for them to profit by the lessons of the past. No country went through a greater crisis than Australia did, and that has taught banks to be careful. One cannot get the banks now to tie up their money as they did in former days; they know the danger. The banks in England are more conservative than they are here. They insist upon having short loans. It is most difficult in London to get from a bank an advance fixed for six months; four months' bills are about the longest they will discount. But we have not enough commercial business in this country to enable the banks here to be so conservative as that. A bank will lend money to a farmer, who has only one return in tbe year; that is when his crops are cut. If he has the misfortune to have a bad crop, the bank has to wait two years for its money. down on the farmer and take his farm when he does not pay. it is of no advantage to a bank, or moneylender, unless he wants to get a property, to swoop down on anybody. If a man wants to carry on business as a moneylender, he needs the good-will of borrowers ; he does not want to get the name of being sharp and seizing men's properties. He wants his money returned with interest; ancl the majority of the banks will let a man go on as long as they possibly can, provided that he is honest and they see any -chance of his pulling through. They have not in their minds the idea of jumping down on people, or lending a man £ 1 0 0 or £^500 simply for the sake of getting his property. It is not banking business to -seize people's property. The banks do not want to foreclose or sell. Any one who is connected with banking institutions will know that day after day securities are rejected, because there is the fear that they may fall into the banks' hands, and the banks do not want them. They are not land purchasers, and do not want to hold land. They have the money of other people as well as of their shareholders, and want to pay their deposits when they become due. That is why they endeavour to make their loans as short-dated as possible; ancl that is why, in England especially, very little else than bill discountlines on which thebank must be carried ing is carried on by the banking institutions. on. I have endeavoured to criticise every member think the Commonwealth Government should have a bank of their own in which to conduct their business with the various States, and with London? they cannot carry on their own banking business if they think it will pay. We know that the State Governments by drafts on London frequently save exchange. Banking on proper lines is a profitable business, so long as losses are not made; but the danger, as in all other business, is bad debts. bank not have facilities for carrying on ordinary banking? facilities for carrying on the business, but the question is whether it will not cost too much. If the idea is to lend at lower rates, a difficulty will arise, because the same rates of interest would have to be paid to depositors as are paid by other banks, or otherwise people will not lend the bank money. There must also be a margin of profit sufficient to pay working expenses and provide a reserve fund, in view of bad debts; becauseI do not care whether it is a private or a Commonwealth bank-ther e must be a certain percentage of such debts. The Savings Bank of Victoria is conducted on very sound lines, and for the last fifteen years a reserve fund has been built up, so that if there should come three or four years of drought the depreciation and loss will be easily covered. Every bank at first has to be more conservative, for the reason that there is no reserve fund.

Simply because I sit on this side, I am not prepared to say that every measure introduced by the Government is bad, or contains no reason or common sense. It is the duty of every member of Parliament, no matter on which side he sits, to point out weak spots, in order that they may be removed, if the majority think the suggestions are sound. It is true I have not seen the B ill , and it is, therefore, dimcult to judge of its merits; and, as I say, I am only suggesting what I believe to be the most sound lines, if we are to have a Commonwealth bank. that the Government, having a majority, may, if they insist, carry any measure they choose; but it is the duty of honourable members on both sides to make suggestions for improvement.

If a man were of honourable character, and had always endeavoured to pay his way, money would be advanced to him on the guarantee of one or two people in the district. There was always some guarantee; and as every one in the district was interested in the business, there were very few cases of fraud. is lent in that way by these banks. ago, when the Creclit Foncier system was proposed for Victoria, that I read the little book in which these people's banks were described, and the Credit Foncier here is on the same lines, though on a larger scale. There is no reason why similar small banks should not be adopted in every district throughout Australia; but it will be very difficult, if there is to be a large Commonwealth bank, to combine the two systems., We must either do an. ordinary general banking business, or start people's banks for the purpose of lending money; and, if we do the latter, we must issue debentures and borrow money at long dates. We cannot have call money, and tie it up for years; and any bank which tries to do that is bound to come to disaster. member thinks that there must be separate institutions ? have the two systems, I would rather see There is no doubt them as two separate institutions, because that is safer, in the interests of the public and of investors. One or two references have been made to wireless telegraphy. We hear of it being installed on ships in three or four days, and of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company establishing a station at the Cocos Islands in three days; and it is extraordinary, considering that the question has been before this Parliament, and before three Governments, for years, that there is not yet a station in any part of Australia. A large percentage of the ships that come here have the system installed ; and the Prime Minister, when he wished to send a message to his colleagues from a mail-boat, had to communicate with another mail-boat, a trading steamer, or a British man-of-war in Sydney. It seems most strange that private people can carry out this work so expeditiously, and that Government enterprise should be so lackwere established throughout this country, it would be the means of saving hundreds of lives; and yet, although we all approve of the idea, nothing is being done. There is similar mismanagement, or want of foresight, in connection with the small-arms factory at Lithgow.

If we are going to spend millions on defending our shores, there is no reason why we should not do the necessary work in Australia. Vessels of fair size are being built at Sydney; and if it be possible to build vessels of 1,000 or 2,000 tons, why cannot we build our own men-ofwar, torpedo-boats, and destroyers, some of which are not half as big as many of the vessels now being constructed at Sydney.

A majority of the settlers on the irrigation areas of Victoria were paying their way before they had been there three months. Immigrants give employment to other labour, in the shoeing of horses, the building of houses, and other work. Australia's safeguard must be population. I would fear no enemy had we a population of 10,000,000; but in Northern Australia there is only one inhabitant to every 16 square miles, while in the most thickly settled State there are only sixteen inhabitants to the square mile.

The difficulty is to get the workers to realize that immigration will not injure them, but that, on the contrary, it will help them. Honourable members opposite should preach that doctrine. When in New York, I stayed at an hotel next door to which some work was going on, and I said to one of the men employed on it, "" It is reported in the newspapers that yesterday 16,000 immigrants arrived in New York; how will that affect you ?

The Governor General's Speech is more interesting than documents of that kind usually are. The programme set before us contains some very important and necessary proposals. The Imperial Conference justly receives first consideration. Its influence will be felt throughout the Empire, and will affect Australia, for many years to come. The holding of the Conference marked a very decisive historical stage. Remembering the need for peace, and for the advancement of the human race along right lines, we must be glad of the coalition of influences tending to bring them about. I do not hold that the British Empire possesses all the virtues or suffers from all the vices, though Britishers are given to an arrogant assumption of superiority. There is a feeling-justifi able, perhaps, to some extent-that we are the people, and that wisdom will die with us. The Empire is a very loose confederation of nations, but the looser the connection the stronger will it be. Some one said lately that even if King George III . had not been foolish, the United States to-day, with a population of 95,000,000, would not now be an integral part of the British Empire. One cannot think that if Canada had a population of between 50,000,000 and 60,000,000, she would be content to form part of a Federation such as now exists. The Empire can hold together only if the connection is loose and free, and in no way burdensome to either the Dominions or the Mother Country. I hope that the Dominions will more and more recognise their responsibility for their own problems. For years past the Mother Country has borne too much of the burden of Empire. The Imperial Conference will develop in a very marked way that spirit of unity which The Northern Territory is sq needed for the Empire's growth, and will assist in securing the peace of J:he world. We are told in the Speech tliat the system of universal training has been successfully inaugurated, with a gratifying response by the youth of Australia to the call to prepare themselves for its defence. Tliat is a matter for congratulation.

The problem of which we hear so much in regard to population and immigration would find in that way, at all events, a partial solution. It is an accepted fact that the enormous number of infants who die in Australia is altogether disproportionate. domestic economy. only one phase of a very important question. The Australian youth has a natural adaptability. He can make himself a useful and effective soldier, and I think that the girls of Australia have also a natural adaptability fitting them to act, not only as nurses in time of war, but to be ready at any time to be of service in the treatment of disease. Before leaving the question of defence, I wish to refer to the conduct of training camps. This, to my mind, is one of the most important matters in connection with a defence scheme. Many parents view with considerable trepidation the sending of their bovs into training camps, and especially the annual camps, where they remain from three to four days. Even in the ordinary military camps where the adults remain foi a week there is an equal difficulty with regard to the moral influences of those camps upon the men. If it is bad in the case of men it is worse in the case of toys. The Government have taken care that one thing, at all events, sliall be provided for the men in camp. The canteen, unfortunately, is never absent. It is to the credit of this Parliament that the canteen has been abolished from the cadet camps, but it still exists in our military camps for adults, and, unfortunately, it is the only opportunity for refreshment or recreation that is provided by the Government. partment are altogether ignoring a very important item in the matter of training camps. I suggest that something should be done, if not to inaugurate, at least, to support, any effort that is made to provide reasonable opportunities for recreation and reasonable conveniences for the men so that they may put their spare time to good use. I have here an extract from the Argus in reference to the camp that was held at Seymour while Lord Kitchener was here. Referring to the Young Men's Christian Association marquee, it saysLooked upon with some suspicion at first, ns being new to camp l if e, the marquee soon became popular with the men, and in a day or two it was the most frequented spot on the encampment. Its popularity arose from the fact that it struck a note of home life in military surroundings. After the dusty march the soldier found other shelter than the crowded tent or the canteen. Military organization provides -him plenty of work, but it does not concern itself with his idle hours. AgainAfter a long day's march the men gathered to write their letters or postcards, to read, or meet their friends, or group about the piano and sing with the lightness of heart conferred by a good day's work well done. Every night some entertainment was arranged, and the surrounding bush rang with the laughter of delighted soldiers: Sunday afternoons and evenings were devoted to religious services. The daily attendance of officers and men was 650There were, I think, about 4,000 men under canvasand the greatest crush was always in the evening. "" More room "" was often the cry. . . . Altogether 4,852 letters and postcards were written and despatched from the marquee; 3,000 postcards were distributed in camp; 6,500 sheets of letter-paper were used and 5.700envelopes were supplied. This year the camp at Kilmore was attended by over 5,000 men, and concerning the provision made for their comfort by the field service of the Young Men's Christian Association of Melbourne, I propose to quote a few appreciations selected at random from a number expressed by the officers and men. According to the article before me, a corporal described it as "" the best place in camp."" Another soldier described it as "" a boon and a blessing to soldiers,"" while other comments were "" a heed supplied and appreciated""; ""an excellent institution much appreciated "" ; "" a boon to soldiers in camp""; "" a great acquisition to the camp "" ; "" what we have always wanted""; "" will do a great deal of good,"" and "" essential to every camp."" The Defence DeThese are but a few of a large number of comments made by the officers and men who visited the Young Men's Christian Association tent. Colonel Stanley saidI am wishful of expressing once again my high sense of appreciation of the excellent work carried out by your association for the promotion of the well-being of the troops. By making provision for the comfort of officers and men for recreation purposes, and for writing letters",37,Wynne Firs T They Ing In Virility I F Wireless Telegraphy

296,Mr Finlayson,"I am referring to4o their friends at home, your association has -conveyed a distinct benefit to the Military Forces, but my experience during the last few and it is difficult to place a value, from the -soldier's point of view, upon the advantages accruing to the service, from the men being thus induced to remain in camp and away from less -desirable counter attractions. Lt -Colonel Courtney saysOf the regiment under my command, 477 of all rank were in camp, and it is most gratifying to me to be able to say' that the conduct -of all was exemplary, not a single offence or complaint being brought under my notice during the eight days. For this record I feel indebted in no small measure to the influence of your organization, and the attractions it so liberally provided. Colonel Field, of the Australian Infantry Regiment, writesIn my opinion, the splendid facilities provided by the Young Men's Christian Association at Kilmore to enable our soldiers to send away and to receive letters from home should be a permanent feature of every camp, and the work should be subsidised by the Commonwealth Defence Department. The concession was largely availed o l , and was splendid in every respect. Lord Haldane, the Secretary of State for War in Great Britain, made the following statementThe War Office has long been appreciative of the services rendered by the Y.M.C.A. to the men of the Auxiliary Forces. . . . The interest taken in their moral and material welfare cannot but react favourably on their efficiency as soldiers. Some reasonable official recognition should be given to such institutions as this. Under Lord Roberts, Young Men's Christian Association officers attached to the main column are officially recognised as members of the head-quarters staff. The Women's Christian Temperance Union in Queensland attend 10 this work, and do it very effectively. It seems very reasonable that while the men are away from their homes, the Government should assist in furnishing opportunities for them to write their letters and have some home comforts. To simply let 4,000 or 5,000 men loose in a camp after the day's work is over, with the canteen as the only place of resort, and the only means of recreation, is altogether destructive qf the best influences of camp life. during the clay, it is much more necessary that they should be morally trained during the evening. I commend that suggestion to the officers of the Defence Department. There is in the Governor General's Speech an item which has occasioned me considerable pleasure. The matter can be dealt with at greater length when the Bill to amend the Conciliation and 3/r. Finlayson. Arbitration Act comes before the House; months of the absolute failure of the existing Act to be of any practical benefit to the men for whom it was placed on the statute-book, has convinced me that some amendment is urgently wanted. The Act was passed with the particular object of making it easily possible for industrial disputes to be settled, by allowing the men and their employers to meet together under reasonable circumstances, discuss their troubles in an impartial atmosphere, and come to a reasonable conclusion without any necessity for disputing or striking. Yet the Act has so signally failed in every direction as to be practically useless. has brought that result about by its decisions. the amendment of the Act to be introduced will be of such a character as, if necessary, to get past the decisions of the High Court, which have made the Act at present on the statute-book absolutely useless. If there is one thing necessary in order to develop Australia, it is an effective measure of this kind. There is no doubt an urgent need for population, and nobody can object to the cry for immigration. It is all moonshine for honourable members opposite to say that the Labour party are afraid of or opposed to immigration. We are nothing of the kind, but we want to make the conditions of life here such as to obviate any necessity for attracting immigration, they themselves being the best advertisement to induce people to come here. We cannot make the conditions here anything like they ought to be until we make it easily possible for disputes in any industry to be adjusted without any disturbance of trade or any of the upheavals so common in other parts of the world. A good deal has been said about strikes. Some honourable members referred to civil war and suggested that a state of social 'war has practically prevailed in Australia during the sugar strike. I always listen to the Leader of the Opposition with If the men are physically trained considerable pleasure. He is always worth hearing, even when one most disagrees with him, and possibly he is then at his best. But on Wednesday he reminded me of nothing so much as a dancing master on account of the graceful way in which he side-stepped and pirouetted and circled round the various items to which he referred. His dexterity excited my admiration. It was very clever. I could not help",38,Wynne Firs T They Ing In Virility I F Wireless Telegraphy

298,Mr Finlayson,"I am hopeful thatreflecting how graceful his movements were, how choice his language, and how agile his movements; but somehow he always missed the point. He never got exactly to what he seemed to be driving at. When he referred to strikes in Australia as having practically created a state of civil war, and 'being almost revolutionary in their methods, I wondered whether some echo of what has taken place in England, or what is taking place in France, had got into his mind. One wonders what would be said by him and others in Australia if we had anything like a repetition of the riots at Liverpool or in France. Strikes here are child's play compared with strikes there.

The reasons lor that strike seem so patent and necessary that one wonders if we are really living in the twentieth century. Fancy it being necessary in this workmen's paradise, this country of great advantages, for men to strike in order to secure an eight-hour <lay and £ 2 a week ! It is remarkable that employers should be able to refuse to give white men living in the paradise of Australia £ 2 a week. -not worth £ 2 a week, are they ? has his remedy, because he need not eraploy any man who is not worth his money. When I arrived at Cairns on my return from PapuaI found the reasons for the strike were that the men were demanding an eight-hour day and pay equal at the outside to £ 2 a week, because 30s. a week and found is equal to 35s. or 38s. at the very most. member contend that it costs a man only Ss. a week to keep himself? struck me the men were not making an unreasonable demand in view of the miserable conditions and payment they had to put up with. On the contrary, I thought they were altogether too modest in their demands. member told them so. was simply astounded. The employers estimate that it costs them about 12s. 3d. per week to supply a man with food, but it is a peculiar thing that in some cases the men take ios. per week, pay their own cook, and make money on the transaction. The onemen in any sugar district in Queensland are prepared to take 8s. a week and find their own food. They have a very good reason for that, because one of their great complaints, which was well-grounded, was as to the quality of the food supplied to them. Jt was stated in the Queensland House of Assembly, and the statement has not been challenged or contradicted, that all the men had to wash their plates and tin mugs in after their meals was a little dish of water, which was boiling when put there, but soon became tepid. The first men who used it did not fare badly, but when up to 100 men had to use it the scum ancl filth on the water became simply repulsive. The serving of the food was altogether disgraceful ; and a few photographs here, taken at the Bundaberg strike camp, will give some idea of how these men were managed and fed. Fortunately, that strike is settled now; but I hope honourable members will not overlook the fact that it is only a temporary settlement. An industry that has to be forced tn pay such a reasonable, or rather unreasonable, wage as £ 2 a week, considering the cost of living, and refuses eight hours a day, is one that demands inquiry. Even now the eight-hour day is only applicare able to the mill hands, the men in the fields having still to work ten and twelve hours. contract. are the worse off amongst the lot. It is all very well for honourable members to laugh, and to talk about the high wages made by these men; but we never hear a hint as tp the hours these men have to work in order to earn £ 3 or £ 4 a week. They work from daylight to dark, and the wage I have mentioned is about the top. The men are glad to take work under contract",39,Wynne Firs T They Ing In Virility I F Wireless Telegraphy

Let me turn now to the remarks made in regard to ""civil war""-to the conduct of the strike. I think that honourable members must have been thinking of France or some other country rather than of Australia, because the conduct of the sugar strike is one of the great object-lessons of the world. In only one other country 1 know of has a strike of such magnitude been conducted with less disorder and less need of interference by the Government. Some little time ago, theie was a great strike in Sweden, but anything in the shape of disorder in connection therewith was much minimized by the workmen, of their own volition, supported by the Government, asking that the hotel bars and liquor shops should be closed during the progress of the strike. Never in the history of the world has there been a more successful strike than that, both in regard to its conof the strike and the agreement now arduct and results. As to the sugar strike, the reports in the press in regard to disorder, interference with people at their work, or the damaging of bridges, railways, and so forth are all open to a good deal of doubt, if not to flat denial. One Monday morning during the strike I read in the Brisbane Courier that there had been a great riot in Bundaberg. We were told that there had been great disorder by the strikers, and that the police had been compelled to chase them down the pavementin short, that there had been quite a tumult enough for their labour, we desire to asin the town on the Saturday night. Unfortunately for the report, the last sentence informed us that, while this was going on, the strikers were holding their usual open-air meeting at the top of the street, and that, after their meeting, they formed up in fours and marched back to camp. Several of the most reputable business people of the town told me, not more than a month ago, that the whole of the disorder in Bundaberg on that occasion was due to needless interference by the police with the tradesmen and townspeople, who were going about their ordinary business on the Saturday night. If there was disorder, interference with, and interruption of, ordinary business, it was due entirely to and Vancouver, and it had grown by leaps the scum-to the lowest-down class of -workers in Australia gathered by the employers in Melbourne and Sydney. It is to the eternal discredit of the QueenslandGovernment that they allowed their Em-r are their own ployment Bureau in Sydney to be used as an office for the engagement of free labourers or scabs to take the place of honest workmen, who were ready and willing to work, but who were not allowed to do so except with unreasonable wages and conditions. The conduct of that strike reflects the greatest credit on the men We must remember that they are only temporarily employed, scattering subsequently to all parts of the country when the cutting is over, and that they are subject and susceptible to certain temptations which do not assail men who are settled with regular, steady work. One wonders that 5,000 men could keep themselves so well under con-trol, and carry on a strike for eight weeks, without one of the regular hands having to be brought to book. They realized that there was more than their own name at stake-that each in his own way was responsible for the good name of the workers generally-and they justified the strike handsomely. I only hope that the results rived at will obviate any necessity for a recurrence next year. I repeat that honourable members must not forget that the present settlement is only temporary. I rejoiced to hear the Prime Minister say yesterday that the Government are favourably considering the appointment of a Royal Commission. Whatever differences of opinion we may have as to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company being a monopoly, and as to whether the growers get enough for their cane, or the workers certain the facts, the whole facts, and. nothing but the facts; and, if that can. be done by means of a Royal Commission, let us have one as soon as possible. ber favour a non-political Commission? graph 22 of His Excellency's Speech isMy Advisers have under consideration 'the establishment of reciprocal trade with New Zealand and Canada. I am particularly interested in this because of my anxiety in regard to the Vancouver mail service.

Paramail service; and I was delighted this morning to have the assurance from the Prime Minister that consideration is being given to this matter, and negotiations are proceeding. It is important that these should be brought to an issue as soon as possible; because, in the meantime, our trade is passing into other hands, and we know that it is much easier to lose customers and markets than to gain them. We desire the most friendly relationship with Canada, because Canadian people have much to give iis, as we have much to give them. We have just the commodities in the shape of meat, butter, and dairy produce generally, that-they require; and a trade could be established of mutual advantage. haps, seem a small thing in itself is just one of those influences that make for community of. interest and give rise to the best relationships and unity throughout the Empire. the honourable member's own constituents that the mail agreement was not continued ? of the Brisbane people was that a service conducted at the expense of the people of Australia should not subsidize New Zealand exporters. The Brisbane people took a broad view, seeing that they insisted that if an Australian service was inaugurated it should include Melbourne and Sydney as well as Brisbane. people not intend to cut out New Zealand? tinctly, and I repeat it here, that any service why the men should not be kept on as long which includes New Zealand is an unfair handicap on Australian exporters owing to the reciprocal treaty between New Zealand and Canada. For Australia to subsidize a line of steam-ships to land Australian and New Zealand goods in Canada under the same conditions, and then permit New Zealand the absolute advantage of the reciprocal arrangement, will seriously prejudice our shippers. similar reciprocal arrangements? fer with commendation to the paragraph in His Excellency's Speech and the reply of the Prime Minister this morning. It is necessary, if we are to establish closer relationships, as well as develop our commercial business, that there should be the best possible understanding with Canada as well as with New Zealand. Paragraph 28 refers to the Public Service Act; and if there is an Act that requires our attention, it is that. This Act was supposed to protect public servants against political influence, but, from my short acquaintance with its operation, 1 think there has been substituted the much more subtle and dangerous social influence. Some amendment of the measure is urgently necessary in order to insure to public servants, as far as possible, fair and reasonable conditions. mention an instance in which social influence has been used ? remarks on the subject until the Bill is on Trade, although it may, perthe table. I would, however, draw attention to the injustice of the present position of temporary employees. Contrary to common sense and sound business arrangements, temporary employees are turned off, after, by a six months' engagement, they have gained a special aptitude for their work. extended to nine months? that makes the position more absurd. was adopted to prevent the flooding of the service with temporary employee's. In Victoria, there was a telegraph messenger who had been a temporary employee"" for years, who was drawing only £ 7 0 a year, although he had whiskers, and a wife and five children. as they are wanted. No doubt in the Postal Department there are times when extra hands are needed, but means should be found whereby men who have proved their ability and worth should be retained, instead of being automatically dismissed at the end of six months. I shall discuss that matter mote fully when we have the Bill before us. Another complaint I have is that our young men who go abroad to study are not recognised as Australians, if they want to come back and get a Government appointment. A young man who left Queensland several years since to go to the Old Country to perfect his education as an electrical engineer subsequently accepted a position there. But he now wishes to return to Australia, and to apply for a position as electrical engineer in the Commonwealth Public Service, but our regulations treat him as a foreigner.",41,Wynne Firs T They Ing In Virility I F Wireless Telegraphy

My last reference will be to the referenda. 1 wish honourable members opposite all joy of their victory, if they can find satisfaction in it. There are victories which are, in their essence, defeats, and the knowledge of the campaign of misrepresentation which preceded the referenda must rob the victors of most of their satisfaction. Tf there is any truth in that great hook, The Great Illusion, in which the author shows that even the victors in a war gain nothing, our friends opposite rue not the gainers, and are mistaken if they think that they have struck a blow at the Labour party.

The point about this illustration is that it was absolutely untrue. Our young men should be enLeader of the Opposition was that Victoria would be ruled from Yass-Canberra.

When I inquired at the Customs House as to the truth of Mr Denham's statement. I was told by the Collector that no such application had ever reached the Excise officers. I therefore gave a denial to Mr Denham's statement and there the matter ended. Just prior to the referenda poll we had a most unfortunate shipping disaster on the Queensland coast. I am sure we all regretted, and all sorrowed, over the unfortunate Yongala disaster. Mr Denham was in Northern Queensland at the time, and at Ayr he saidHe did not wish to make capital out of a misfortune like that of the Yongala, but the Federal Government was not to be entirely exonerated.

When speaking at the Eight Hour dinner, at the Exhibition Building, Brisbane, he denied the statement, and denied that such a statement had been reported. He was at once challenged, and a copy of the newspaper containing the report was sent to him. He has never yet denied the accuracy of that report. does the honourable member want him to deny it? it as often as the honourable member for Parramatta denied the statement credited to him in regard to the River torpedo boats. thing more than another in regard to the unfortunate Yongala disaster it is that the absence of lighthouses along our coast was not responsible for it. The disaster, according to the finding of the Marine Board, was due to weather conditions. a mystery. How can the honourable member say to what it was due? to be an expert; I simply quote the finding of the Marine Board. It is very patent that as soon as possible attention should be given to the lighthouses and beacons along the coast. No doubt Mr ercise, whereas, in the older country, the Baines, the Treasurer of Queensland, will be glad to hear of the statement made yesterday by the Minister of Trade and Customs that the Lighthouses B ill was to be proceeded with, inasmuch as last week he said thatThe Government could not possibly spend a huge amount on the lighting of the coast when it was absolutely unknown whether the Federal Government would or would not take over the matter. I contend that Mr Barnes knew that we desired to take over the control of lighthouses and beacons at the earliest opportunity, and I believe that the recent inspection of the coast of Australia by the lighthouse expert will provide the Federal Government with sufficient information to induce them to give us the lighting of the Australian coast, and particularly of the Queensland coast, that is so urgently needed. The lighthouses along the coast are altogether out of date, and there is much in connection with them that demands attention. One of the most successful [,:.,] lies told during the referenda campaign was that the proposals put forward by the Mr Denham has Government were designed to take away Home Rule. true. rate and unfair attempt to capture the Irish vote. With the aspirations of the Irish people for Home RuleI have the utmost sympathy. No Australian who values the democratic institutions, and the freedom of government that we enjoy, H o w many times would deny reasonably equal opportunities ancl advantages to other people. But to try to draw a comparison between the granting of Home Rule to Ireland, and the preservation of Home Rule to the Australian States was to attempt an analogy that could not be fairly drawn. HomeI f there is lone Rule, as we understand it, in the Old Country, is the handing over from the higher to the lower authority of certain powers, advantages, and opportunities, whereas Home Rule in Australia, as we understand it in connection with the referenda proposals, meant a grant, not from the higher to the lower, but from the lower to the higher authority. tweedledum and tweedledee!
