For Defence) [2.32]","{B y leave.)I wish to inform the House of the death of Lieutenant-General Sir Edward Hutton by which the Empire has suffered a great, loss. On the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia-, Sir Edward's. services were requested from the British Government to mould the various StateDefence Forces into ' one AustraUan Defence Force. great organizing ability during his period of command in New South Wales, from 1893 to 1896, and had successfully commanded, amongst otlier mounted troops, Australian troops during the South African War. It is to him that Australia is indebted for the organization and the system of training which enabled her to put the Australian Imperial Force into the field at the beginning of the late war. He was one of the fathers of the mounted infantry movement in. the Bri-r tish Empire,, and during his ' period ef command iu Australia devoted himself particularly to the development of the Australian Light Horse, whioh he considered was the ideal combination for modern warfare of the cavalryman and the mounted rifleman. Until the day of his death he was honorary colonel of two of OUT Light Horse Regiments, and showed great interest up to the last in this arm, and indeed in all the Australian Forces. ister for Works and Railways whether, in view of the fact that a serious strike is imminent at Canberra, whioh may have the effect of throwing 700 men out of work, and the desire of the unions that the industrial tribunal should immediately meet to settle the difficulty, he will expedite the calling together of tiie tribunal ? r He had already shown IirousraiAj.

NAVY COOK RATINGS . upon noticeIn view of statements that Army cooks are being trained at private schools, and of the fact that an efficient school of cookery exists at Flinders Naval Depot for the training of cook ratings for the Navy, and also that a special victualling department forms part of the Navy Office-Would it not tend towards economy and service efficiency if more use were made of the Naval victualling departments by the Army in giving instruction to military trainees instead of going to private schools for such knowledge? honourable member's question are as follow : The cooks who are referred to as being trained at private schools are presumably those members of the Citizen Forces who are receiving their initial training in cookery at various schools of Domestic Economy and similar establishments pending the training of Army instructors. The School of Cookery at the Flinders Naval Depot is already being used to its fullest capacity in the training of Army cooks; a party of instructors has been undergoing training there for the past three weeks. The course lasts ten weeks.. When this party finishes, ansible stigma on, and also to protect the honour other party will take its place. Preliminary arrangements for the training of Army cooks at the Naval School of Cookery were made in October, 1922, and only the lack of funds prevented an earlier commencement of the system now inaugurated.

It is not practicable to send Citizen Force trainees through a continuous course of cookery, which lasts in all some twelve weeks. OF EVIDENCE . SUPPLY TO TASMANIA.

E . Davies. September, 1920, 1,000 tons of sugar at £7.2 12s. 6d. per ton'; 1st October, 1920, 5,000 tons at £ 6 3 10s. per to n ; 8th October, 1920, 10,000 tons at £ 5 4 per ton. In the course of the discussion suggestions of improper conduct in connection with the transactions were made, but no definite charges warranting action by the Government were forthcoming. Subsequently the transactions were considered by the Public Accounts Committee, which made the following report:Owing to the limitations imposed upon the Committee by the Statute under which its work is carried on, the Committee has been unable to completely investigate certain phases of this inatter. So far as the Commonwealth acounts are concerned, the Committee has discovered no overcharges or irregularities in connection with these transactions. Although a considerable amount of suspicion was caused -by these transactions, neither in tbe House nor in the evidence before the Accounts Committee were definite charges made which would have warranted action being taken. But yesterday further information regarding those three transactions was brought under my notice, and it has since been considered by the Government. It is of such a character as to demand the fullest investigation, and the Government has accordingly deCourt a Royal Commissioner to investigate the circumstances of these purchases. The Commission will be issued immediately, and, the matter being now sub judice, it would be improper for me to say anything further regarding it , and equally improper for the House to discuss it at this stage.

I do not know whether they intend to I make a claim on the Government. Honourable members in this House should have the facts brought before them.

54,(By Mr Stewakt) Proposed,"Budget, I suppose some of its funds were used in legal expenses, and possibly other amounts have been wasted in consequence of this legal action. I ask the Treasurer to see whether something cannot be done to avoid such happenings as these. I have a word to say also on behalf of our old-age pensioners, who, because of the penury or unjust economy of the Government, have been ocmpelled to suffer on account of having been resident in some of our benevolent institutions. When the pension was 15s., the old men and women were allowed 2s. each as pocket money, 10s. 6d. was charged by the State for maintenance, and 2s. 6d. remained in the Federal Treasury. I understand, however, that there is to be an amendment of the Act so that the position of the pensioners may be improved. My only fear is that the authorities of ' the State institutions in which these old folks find a home, may raise the charge for maintenance, and thus .deprive them of the f u l l advantage of the concession. I have here a specimen of the red-tape foolishness that is displayed by some of the Departments. It is a copy of a notice that was put up in one of these institutions, and, apparently, it was regarded as of great value, because, as I am in formed, it was placed under glass. It is as follows: I shall be glad if you will ""kindly make it . known to pensioners who apply for leave in order to ask tbe restoration of their pensions, that pensons will not .he restored in any case to a pensioner whilst on leave. He should apply by letter to this office setting out the ground on which he claims restoration, when his case vvill receive consideration, and he should not leave until the result of his application has been received by him. We all know that great delay often occurs in the answering of such letters, especially when they are written by the cramped fingers of old age. I can see no reason why an old-age pensioner should not continue to receive his pension during his absence from Australia, if , for instance, some kind friend were to give him a t r ip to the Old Country. There are many parasites who shake the dust of Australia off their feet, and spend the rest of their lives and their money overseas. The right honourable E . C. Childers was given an Australian pension after having been in this country for some three years and a half, and subsequently he was mean and contemptible enough, when, in London, I asked him to assist [7 AUGUST, 1923.] 1923-24. 2217 in defraying the expenses of two old Australians who desired to return to their home, to say, "" I have severed, all connection with Australia."" That was a thundering untruth , as I found when I called for a parliamentary return showing what this gentleman had received. He was given this pension, and drew it for many years, on the ground that he had been deprived of a great chance of promotion when responsible government was established in Victoria. That ground, again, was false, as is shown by the fact that Mr Childers rose to be Lord Chancellor of England. It is possible that Australia, wii-.out the direct permission of' the people, will be called upon to contribute largely to the cost of thc naval base at Singapore. According to two of the most advanced thinkers in the Navy, one dead and one alive, that base w ill be useless for capital ships; but if it has to be established. I think the Government ought to act upon a suggestion made by ex-Senator Chataway that Australia should make a contribution, not in money, but in the form of Australian-manufactured iron to be used in the construction of the base. B y that means the money would be spent in Australia, and the iron industry further developed. I have been greatly perturbed by in formation as to the scandalous conditions under which the produce of Australian orehardists is sold. In the Budget there c are these two items, "" Losses on F r u it Pools, £312,000,""' and "" F r u it Pool advances, £551,000."" In the Australasian of the 4th August, there appeared the f o l lowing :Some firms in San Francisco interested in Australian fruits conceived the idea some time ago of, importing specimen varieties, and placed an order in the Commonwealth for '500 cases of Almeria grapes. Tbe shippers packed them with the greatest of.care, and on arrival at San Francisco the f r u it turned out in excellent condition. Officials of the California Department of Agriculture pronounced the fruit to be splendid, but they prohibited the importers from placing the graces on sale within the boundaries of thut State oil nci'nunt of the danger of introducing the Mediterranean f r u it fly. Quarantine' officers stated that some of tlie f r u it was grown in a district known to be infested with the viticultural pest, which, according to the State law, banned their sale. The grapes were then sent to New York, and transportation proved a success. While the experiment showed that shipments of fresh grapes could be carried out successfully, past happenings in the United States of America iiv< respect to imported f r u it suggest that development of the trade would be attended w it h risk. All kinds of trickery, it is said, 'have ibeen resorted to in San Francisco by handlers of domestic products to damage the reputation of Australian fruits.

The n in the Brisbane Courier of t h e 24th J u l y t h is was p u b l is h e dSIR, Having had a very large experience in selling Australian canned fruit s all over the world, I venture to say that bhe people most concerned, viz., the fruit-growers, must be staggered to know that the disposal of their f r u it s has been placed in the hands of an American,, who acted for the Californian packers in California in 1910 and 1920. I venture to say that .there is not one canner An Australia who would dream of makiing .such an appointment. people in authority must know that the Californian canners, taking f r i g h t at the great amount of Australian jams sold by Australia in Aimericai n 1919 and 1921, tried to jjot the Tariff Boardi n New York to embargo Australian canned goods America, notwithstanding Australia had to pay a duty of about 30 per cent., and having failed, the traders of California were told that unless they p u t Australian goods out of tlieir shops, they would not be supplied. The result is to-day, where Australian goods were in every store in California not a sign of our goods is to be seen. The most marvellous part of the appointment of Mr Ennis to London at £100 a month and his .passage paid, .is the fact that iic arrived here in Australia, and actually got the appointment over the head of Freeman and^Company, of Melbourne and London, who are the buyers for tlie largest food .providers in the world, witli headquarters in London.

The wily answer is, "" See reply to number 3."" I shall read the whole of the questions and the answers. The questions were1. When the Fruit Pool for 1921-1022 was established, did the former Prime Minister( Mr W. M. Hughes) notify to the other members of the Pool^and, if so, on what dates, the policy of the Government as to the appointment of a sole selling agency in London7 2. What were the reasons for the Government adopting this policy} 3. Has such policy been changed by the present Government, and, if so, when was any notification given to the members of the Pool prior to the abandonment of the former policy of the Hughes Government? 4. Have the States which are members of the Pool been informed of any change of policy, and bave tbey approved of such change? 5. Who is responsible for the recommendation to change such policy? 6. What was such recommendation, and by whom and when was it made? To those questions the following replies were given:1. Yes. In the scheme approved by tbe late Government on 28th November, 1921, the following provision was included:-""Al l sales in the United Kingdom shall be made through an official representative to be appointed by tlie Governments of the Commonwealth and the 'States which are concerned in the Pools. In 'the event of a failure to arrive at a satisfactory 'agreement, the appointment shall be made by the Government of the Commonwealth."" In the Melbourne press of 29th November, 1921, the former Prime Minister is«.' reported to have stated, when announcing the decision of Cabinet, that ""He could not agree to give assistance if there was to be competition among the selling organizations on the London market resulting in one man undercutting the other, which he (the former Prime Minister) alleged had taken place the previous year."" 2.

See reply to No. 3. The former agency was supplanted three, if not four agencies. The statement of the Minister that they sold more in one month than the previous agency sold in twelve months is inaccurate. true position is that the first asked for the limit of 12s. 6d. to be reDr. 'Moloney. duced, so as to enable it to effect a large sale at 12s., but the request was delayed. W ill the Minister say at what figure the new agents sold the f r u it ? Wasi t 7s. 6d. or 8s. 6d. ? I believe it was sold This is another question I at a huge loss to the fruit-growers and canners of Australia. The new agents were allowed a reduction of shillings, although the other agency was not allowed a reduction of pence. Are not Weddeli and Company interested more in the sale of meat rather than of f r u it ? The Minister has furnished no reply to that question. The Overseas Farmers' Company is dominated by Mr Meares, who has had no great experience Who are Peabody and Company? They, for years, have been connected with American dried and canned fruits. Is Australia so poor that we have to upset suitable arrangements in order to place the business in the hands of several men, one whose nationality is hidden, and another well known because of his Californian experience? The officer who supplied the answer to the Minister knew well that the States had not been informed of the change of policy. The answer is, "" See reply to number 3,"" and that has nothing to do with the subject. Five people, instead of one, are now engaged in the disposal in London of Australian f r u it . They are Weddell and Company, Peabody and Company, the Overseas Farmers' Company, Mr Meares, and Mr Ennis. I do not object to the trade in peaches going to a neighbouring State. If Sydney can compete w it h our Victorian canners, good luck to it . I understand that the goods from the Goulburn Valley are landed in Sydneyf or £2 per ton. That seems to me very low freight for such a long railway journey. I receiveda letter from the Amalgamated Food Preserving Employees Union of Australia showing that the closing of the F r u it Pool would injur e the splendid canning industry of New South Wales. No honourable member wants to do that. If the New South Wales industry can compete against Victoria, good luck to it . I do not know whether Victorian fruit-growers and canners belong to the F r u it Combine which i by is dominated by Sir Henry Jones. That may be the reason why this State has been hampered in its f r u it trade. A stereotyped reply is given to many of my quesThe tions. I asked this question of the Minisagency t e r "" I s it a fact that Messrs. Peabody and Company are largely interested in the sale of Californian canned fruit?"" I want that to sink into honourable members' minds. I am told that a previous firmFreeman and Company-were refused their request for sixpence under the selling cost per dozen tins. If the reply to that request was not immediately given then the Minister was neglecting his duty . to the fruit-growers of Australia. this way, a sale involving hundreds of thousands of tins was held over. We cannot expect any one who is connected with the American dried or canned fruits trade to push Australian goods when interested in Californian. The question continues2. Isi t a fact that Messrs. Weddell and Company are largely interested in the sale of meat, and apparently are not well known in connection with the sale of canned fruits? 3. Isi t a fact .that the Overseas Farmers' Company, of which Mr Meares was the director, is not well known in connection with the sale of canned or other f r u it s in London? 4. Did Mr Meares recommend or advise, directly or indirectly, that his company-(the Overseas Farmers' Company-shoul d be appointed to sell Australian canned goods? 5. During the agency of former agents for the 1021-22 Fruit Pool, were the recommendations of the former agents to reduce the reserves, owing to the markets, from time to time ignored? 6. If so, why wore their recommendations ignored ? 7. WJcre the recommendations of the present f r u it agents immediately given effect to? 8. Will the Government circulate, for the information of honourable members, the recommendations of the High Commissioner, and report as to thc reasons for the appointment of Messrs. Weddell and Company, the Oveiseas Farmers' Company, Messrs. Peabody and Company, and Mr Ennis? S). Is not the effect of the appointment nominally of three separate firms, namely, Messrs. Weddell and Company, Messrs. Peabody and Company, and the Overseas Farmers' Company, to change the policy of the Hughes Government to have only one firm? . 10. Do the three firms concerned divide the whole of the commission, irrespective of whuther the sales are effected by one firm; or does each firm receive commission on each sale effected by each firm? 11. Who keeps the books of thc separate companies? 12. Docs each firm keep a separate record of each sale effected? 13. Is there any contract or written agreement appointing each firm; w ill the Minister produce the contract or agreement lor the information of honourable members? The reply of the Minister was that the information was being obtained. Unless the information I have received. In the honourable members are informed that the firm of Freeman and Company did not properly carry out their duty, they should appoint a Committee of inquiry. That firm had the fullest confidence of the largest restaurant-keepers of Great Britain, or, perhaps, of the world, and that advantage has been sacrificed. When Freeman and Company were reIn fused a reduction of 6d. per dozen, and the answer from the Department was so long delayed, the sale was lost. Any person who hopes to beat the Americans in business enterprise must rise up early in the morning and keep his eyes open. I cannot say whether the Minister or the officer was to blame for the delay, but the sale was lost. The new company, however, was able to get an immediate answer, and, I believe, sold for about 8s per case. That of course meant a loss to the Australian fruit-growers. I think these transactions call for action by members of the Country party. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Austin Chapman) said that the new combine had sold more fruit in one month than the others had sold in a year; but an answer with which he furnished me shows that the total sales to that date were 80,873 cases, of which Freeman and Company had sold 49,302 since the 6th April, 1922, and the new selling organization had sold 31,000 cases since the 28th May. Those figures clearly disprove the Minister's statement. In any case, the combine sold at a reduced price, for included in their sales was much fruit that could have been sold on a 6d. reduction basis. it would take ten years to sell the whole of the fruit. the frui t of California, owing to excessive irrigation, is so soft that it does not make as good jam as does the f r u it grown in Australia, especially in the Goulburn Valley. Perhaps the honourable member for Martin( Mr Pratten) can give me expert information on that point. is less flavour in frui t grown by irrigation than in fruit grown under natural conditions.",22,Budget 1923 24

I asked the Prime Minister to-day tke following questions:1. Isi t a fact that representations have been made by the Federal Council of the Institute of Architects concerning the revival of the world-wide competition for the Federal Houses of Parliament at Canberra? 2. Is the Government about to abandon thc said competition; if so, w ill it consider thc question of compensating each of the 210 registered competitors in order to modify the possible stigma on, and also to protect the honour of, Australia? The reply to the first was "" Yes,"" and the reply to the second was that the matter would be considered. I maintain that if we do not keep faith with these gentlemen, or pay them compensation, the honour of Australia will be besmirched and we shall be disgraced. When we decided to hold a competition the conditions were blazoned throughout the length and breadth of Christendom. The exigencies of war compelled a postponement of our programme. Later on the competition was made public again, and another interruption occurred. Now, I believe that some of the schemers who tried to destroy our splendid plan for a Pederal Capital are willing to have Australia's name disgraced. But just as some 200 of the chief architects of Australia lodged a petition of protest with Sir Joseph Cook, then Prime Minister of Australia, and stopped the abomination that was known as the departmental plan, so we should to-day protest against what is being done. Honourable members know that Colonel Owen, Mr Murdoch, and others prepared the departmental plan. They took the plans of one man and i extracted certain ideas from them; then they took the plans of another, and another, and another, and extracted ideas from each of them. Prom these ideas they made the composite thing which they called the departmental plan. nothing but a fraud. . It was just as if a second-class artist had? painted over a picture by Rubens or Raphael. It was a hotch-potch. Sir Joseph Cook stopped that infamy at once. Do we propose to remain silent now that the chief architects of Australia are discussing what is being done in respect to Canberra? shall quote the remarks of some of these gentlemen, as reported in 'the publication Building, printed in Sydney. The article is headed "" Canberra."" It readsAbout twenty-four members attended the special general meeting of the New South Wales Institute of Architects held at 5 p.m. on Friday, 5th July. Xhe vice-president, Colonel Spain, who presided in the absence of Sir Charles Rosenthal, explained that the meeting had been called as an outcome of the action taken by the president of the Federal Council and to endorse or otherwise the action of the president of the Federal Council in connection w it l i Canberra. Mr Waterhouse said it had been felt that the Federal Government should keep faith w i th the competitors, both in Australia and other parts of the Empire, in connection with the competition for Parliament House that had ibeen announced on several occasions and finally been abandoned. The Council had .been endeavouring to have the matter revived, and he thought the simplest way to put the matter would be to read portion of the report of the president of the Federal Council:"" I have had an opportunity of inspecting the advantages of the proposed Parliament House at Canberra, and I am inclined to think that the Houses of Parliament would be better situated on Kurrajong H ill . Prior to the war an interesting national competition for Parliament House was initiated; it was twice postponed, and ultimately the Federal Government abandoned the competition, notwithstanding that plans had been drawn up and architects had incurred expense in the preparation of competitive schemes. When the members of the Federal Council of thc Institute of Architects waited upon the then Minister for Works and Bailways( Mr Foster), fifteen months ago, he said that a permanent building could not be erected in the time. Had the Government taken steps then, the competition could have been completed; the ideas of architects could have been obtained, and the body of the future structure could have been erected, with temporary additions, to meet immediate needs; as extensions became necessary year by year, they could have been added, and b it by bit the whole scheme completed; . £200,000 would not be thrown away, and tihe Government would avoid the stigma of breaking its pledges to the architects of the Empire. Some of the best brains in the architectural profession of Australia were represented in the deputation that waited upon the Minister for Works and Bailways, and showed that the It was body of a building could be erected as easily as the provisional building now proposed, and not a penny thrown away. The deputation was ridiculed, its proposals turned down, and it was told that the officers of the Department knew as well as the deputation did what they required. If the original scheme had been followed the Government would be far advanced to-day towards the erection of the permanent I structure."" That competition was announced all over the world. I believe it is an impertinence and an insult to some of the 'greatest architects in the world that their proposals should have been ridiculed by the departmental .officers. The report of the president, as printed in that article, continues :"" The Institute of Architects had no direct representation on the Advisory Committee. Mr hardly be said, however, that the credit John Sulman is a member of the Royal Institute Of British Arshitects and a member of the Institute of Architects of New South Wales, but he has ceased to practise, and he devotes his time, to consultation and doing other good_ things; bnt he does not represent the architectural proI f he had not presented the Budget when fession, and was not nominated by the Institute, which offered to provide representation free of cost to the Government, but the proposal was rejected. If the competition for Parliament House had been proceeded with, work upon the permanent building could be started now. If the Government had obtained 100 designs from architects all over the world, it would have had the product of the brains of able firms and individuals all looking at the scheme from different angles, and that knowledge would have been of material assistance in this great undertaking. The present scheme did not appeal as the foundation of a great Pederal Capital City; it was a paltry idea. The Federal president was told that the provisional building was to be removed after about thirty years, but he had never known a public building that was temporary. Surely at a cost of £200,000 the Commonwealth Government could provide at Canberra the nucleus of one great building; the ornamentation need not matter for the time being; the building could be constructed from tbe interior and developed outward. The accommodation essential could be built for £300,000 provided some of the quarters were treated inexpensively."" Such an infamy as the present attitude towards the architects should not be permitted to continue. Australian architects should be permitted to send in competitive designs for any building which is to cost over £3,000. The Commonwealth Bank business was the greatest piece of nepotism that I have ever experienced in my long political life. MrW . M."" HUGHES ( No r t h Sydney) [4.14.]I should not have spoken on this Budget were it not for the fact that by my silenoe I might be held to have approved it , and to have accepted its statements as being a fair presentation of the position. There is another reason why I feel it incumbent upon me to speak. Those who are specially interested in this criticism of the previous Government's financial policy-for that is the effect of this Budget-ar e either out of this Parliament or are colleagues of the honourable gentleman who has presented the Budget, and so their mouths are closed. They are unable to speak for themselves, so I must speak for them. The honourable gentleman ha? claimed as a special and noteworthy feature of this Budget that it has been introduced earlier than any previous Budget. That is quite true. It can is due to that honourable'gentleman, for he himself has created the very circumstance which has made impossible a later presentation of the Budget to this House. he did he could not have done it at a l l . It had to be done now or not done at all. Of course, if it be held that the fates have determined our courses, and that we are merely like corks on the ocean of circumstance, neither blame nor credit belongs to any man. But, in this case, surely the honourable member has himself created the very conditions that he affects to deplore. It is he who proposes to close the Parliament. And so he can hardly ""take credit for introducing the Budget earlier than usual. If he had not introduced it now he could not have in troduced it at all this year. The Treasurer says that this Budget marks a new era. It does, but the .honourable gentleman is wrong in supposing that it is the kind of era that he would have us believe. That we may be in a position to consider the Budgetf a i r l y , it is necessary to emphasize the purpose for which a Budget is presented. The Budget has always been an object of special i m portance in B ritish assemblies the world over, because it is the outward and visible sign of the control of expenditure by the people. That is the very foundation of our parliamentary government. , The Commons have always most jealously guarded their rights on the Budget. And thp rights of this House are not less clear nor more zealously guarded than those of the Commons itself. In every Parliament throughout the B ritish Empire the more numerous House has insisted on its right to control expenditure. In order to control expenditure, it is essential that the facts should be clearly and accurately set out. The Budget should be a clear statement of the public accounts so that members of Parliament may judge whether the proposed expenditure is necessary and proper. A Budget which is not clear, f u l l , and accurate, does not enable Parliament to exercise its function. The first essential to proper and effective criticism is knowledge. The .Budget should be prepared and presented in such a way that the man in the street may understand it. stands condemned on the very face of it. Tbe Budget, then, must be a clear, accurate, and f u l l statement of the Nation's financial position. In the light of this statement of the position, I want honourable members to look carefully at this Budget. It is perfectly true that the statements of accounts of some private companies are made public in such a way that nobody can understand them. suppose it was the outstanding merit of the Budgets presented by Treasurers in oilier days, when people did not have a vote, that nobody could understand them. But other times other manners. people have taken to themselves more and .more power, and it is now essential that the statements of accounts should be made so clear that every one who has the right to exercise a vote may understand the figures. If it is not thus clear then a Budget is useless, or worse, and Parliament is wasting its time in considering it. Let us take the Budget as it is, and judge it by this standard.' But there are other standards, and the honourable gentleman, however much he may take exception to tlie standards set up by others, cannot take exception to those he himself set for other Governments that preceded this. Let us see what the Budget looks like when these successive tests are applied to it. gentleman's speeches, so that he and honourable members may judge this Budget out of his own mouth. Unfortunately, many of the honourable gentleman's statements escaped me at the time they were made. His criticisms were severe, and couched in language calculated, no doubt, to disturb my serenity. Happily for me, and for mankind, too, they did not. I did not hear them, and so they passed unheeded; but the disciples of Caxton have perpetuated his words of wisdom, and I have refreshed my memory-or , rather, informed myself of what he said. I shall apply that which he said of others to himself. Now, let us take this Budget. The honourable gentleman claims to be doing two tilings: First, he says he is effecting a big saving on last year's expenditure; and, second, that he is living within his estimated income. As a matter of fact, he is doing neither I Otherwise, a Budget should be the last to condemn a man who was not doing either of these things, if he but stated his position plainly. I do not condemn him because he is spending more than his income, but for pretending to be that which he is not. When we meet a spendthrift, who greets the world with a smile, and marks his indifference to wealth, and that smug respectability which suits wealth so well, by displaying I his pockets turned out and his hands full of race tickets, we know what he is. He does not try to hide his position. I shall show that the honourable gentleman makes good neither of these claims. I should The not, perhaps, have referred to this matter but for the fact that by keeping silence I might be held to accept what the honourable gentleman says as a true presentation of the facts. But his Budget is the very reverse of this. The Prime Minister, who was the previous Treasurer, cannot very well do this duty because of his position, and for that reason I must do it myself. The Treasurer claims that he is spending less than his income and effecting a saving on last year, and the Budget is presented to convey that impression. It is an impression that any man would get on reading the Budget speech, and I undertake to say that thc bulk of the people of the country now would say,,"" Yes, this fellow has got a I shall quote from the honourable surplus."" People might be very much astonished, but somehow or other they would take it that the surplus was there. Yet nothing can be further from the truth. If honourable members will turn to the Budget statement they will see three items, to which reference has already been made. I emphasize these points, because they need emphasis from one who must take the greater share of responsibility for the finances of this country during the last seven or eight years. Those three items are: Boads Development, £500,000; purchase of wire netting, £250,000; and taxation officers' compensation, £200,000a total of £950,000. I think honourable members will be-a t any rate, 1 am-in hearty accord with theobjects on which the money proposed is to be spent; but, with the exception of thc. taxation officers' compensation, I think it can be fairly said that the previous Government gave the lead. It was the previous Government that first made available a large sum for main roads, and placed wire -netting on the free list. But it is not a question of the expenditure of the money, it is a question of the presentation of accounts. The Acts under which these amounts are authorized to be spent are set out in the Budget in blanks; that is to say, they are Acts in future us to consider a Budget in which he has set down these items, although these items are not on these Estimates. they on last year's Estimates. honourable members to realize quite clearly what this implies. It is the prerogative of Parliament to control expenditure, and, in order to control it, Parliament must be able to say "" Yes"" or "" No"" to any particular item. The Treasurer tells us that the Government will spend this money, and got tbe credit for spending it, while others will be debited with the expenditure. There is no authority for this ' expenditure, and if the House were to say "" No"" the Treasurer could not spend one penny of it. But there is no way in which the House can express approval or disapproval, so far as I can see. They have been taken out of the control of Parliament ! Will any man tell me that this i-3 the kind of restoration of Parliamentary control of public finance which the honourable gentleman declared to ,be essential, and that we are entitled to expect? The Treasurer estimated expenditure out of revenue for 1923-24 was £61,896,098, while the -estimated revenue ' for 1923-24 is £61,943,250, which leaves, according to his statement, a surplus of £47,152. Por the moment I leave out all reference to the Fruit Pool. Now, the Treasurer gets his surplus by charging to last year £950,000, which he proposes to spend this year, but which has not been voted, and of which there is no authority to spend one penny. bound to say that this does mark a new ^ra, and, certainly, it accounts for the surplus. which the honourable gentleman is entitled to take any credit. It belongs to his predecessor. By every canon of public and private finance, he ought to charge his expenditure for this year to the year in Mr W. M. Hughes. which it is to be spent. I have referred to those three items, but there are others. I cannot say how many more there are, but it may be fairly said that of the cost of the conversion of loans, fully £100,000 is charged improperly to last year. . Thus we have the position that somewhere about£1,050,000, which ought to be charged to -this year, is charged improperly to last year, and of tliose items the The honourable gentleman asks greater portion, at any rate of the £950,000, has not yet been authorized by Parliament. Further, unless a motion is Nor were carried referring the Budget back to the I wish Government, there is no way in which the Parliament can control these items. Another position arises out of this one. Does the Treasurer propose to continue this policy of main roads development? Does he propose next year to grant £500,000 for that purpose? Does he propose next year to make a grant of £250,000 for wire netting? If he does, to which year does he propose to charge the expenditure; to this or next year ? If he is going to charge it to this year his surplus, by his own act, is gone-doubl y gone. If to next year, how does he explain his action in charging these items to last year in this Budget? If they are going to be charged to next year, then the action disclosed by this Budget is condemned. If the Grovernment do not propose to continue such a vote, this is a mere flash in tells us that the the pan, it is a method of diverting the country-it is merely -a rocket sent up in order to illuminate the Cimmerian darkness and induce people to believe that things are being done. If this is going to be a settled policy these items of expenditure will never come before the House because they will always be charged to the previous financial year, and will not appear on the current year's Estimates. The Treasurer has not had the experience of his colleague the present Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), and he may I am have thought it was a perfectly natural and even a proper thing to charge his predecessors with the expenditure of But it is not a surplus for money that he proposes to spend himself. This may be excusable in a neophyte, but it will surely not commend itself to this Committee. Now, let us see how the Treasurer gets his surplus. If honourable members will look at page 10 of the Budget they w ill find in the Estimates of revenue an expenditure of £250,000 payment of advance to the F r u it Pool. of the Budget they w ill find in the estimates of expenditure the items, "" F r u it Pool losses,' £312,000,"" and ""Advances to 1922-23 F r u it Pool, £551,000."" Now what has the Treasurer done? It would be very amusing if it were not so serious. has done has been to debit the last Government with the losses and the advances, and credit himself with the refunds, some of which have not yet come to hand. By debiting the last Government with the whole of the advances and with all the losses and not crediting them as a set-off w i th the amount that has been repaid, he is able to credit himself with the difference between the amount of repayments £250,000 and the advances of £551,000, or, roughly, £300,000. I ask the honourable gentleman whether he calls that straightforward finance? Ought he not to have set off the refunds against the advances and cancelled the advances to that extent? If I advance £1,000 to a man, and he refunds £300 to some other person, is the latter entitled to put the £300 into his own pocket and then say that I have lost £1,000 and he has made a profit of £300 ? By charging the three items to which I have referred to last year the Treasurer is able to make it appear that he is £1,050,000 better off than he really is! By debiting his predecessors with the F r u it Pool losses and advances and crediting himself with the refund of £250,000 he swells his revenue with another quarter of a million. He does quite right to say that this Budget marks a new era! Let us t r y to get at the facts. Eliminating from the debited to this year the figures for the F r u it Pool, and debiting to last year £1,050,000 improperly taken into this year, the expenditure for last year is £61,780,485 as against a revenue of £64,720,635 . While this year's position is-revenue , £61,693,000; expenditure, £62,946,000. In other words, the excess of this year's expenditure over last year is £1,176,000, and the excess expenditure for 1923-24 over the estimated revenue for that year is £1,250,000, which is to say that the Treasurer has gone to the bad to thei extent of £1,250,000. The honourable gentleman w ill , no doubt, give us his version of his new system of bookkeeping, On page 11 which, on the face of it , has many advantages. It is, of course, perfectly well known that Machiavelli was an Italian, and the excellence of the Italian system of bookkeeping is known to everybody ; but it has been reserved for the present Treasurer to link these two What the honourable gentleman isolated facts together so that we now can really understand what Italian bookkeeping means. Perhaps the honourable gentleman will say that in doing what he did he followed the example of his predecessors. Let us look at the facts. In 1920-21 the honourable gentleman submitted an amendment for the reduction of the Defence Estimates by £2,800,000. A t that timo Senator Pearce, one of the honourable gentleman's present colleagues, was on his way to Washington. Naturally, it was contemplated that the defence policy of the country would be affected by the Washington Conference. As honourable members know, it was very greatly affected by it . The Government of the day was unable to accept the honourable member's amendment. I think it can be shown that he is unable to accept what it proposed himself, now that he has opportunity to give effect to it . The Government at that time agreed to reduce the Defence Estimates by £500,000. It said that if the House would vote the sum of money that then appeared on the Estimates it would reduce the defence expenditure as and to the extent that the decisions of the Washington Conference justified. The position was thoroughly well known, and Parliament voted the sum of money asked for-that is to say, the Defence Estimates as presented, less £500,000, the amount which the Government agreed to take off. The Washington expenditure Conference was most successful, and the Government made many and considerable reductions, entailing wide-spread retrenchments in the Defence Department. A little while after the present Prime Minister accepted a portfolio in the late Government, a re-allotment of portfolios was made, and the previous Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) took oflice as Minister for Defence. The Government brought down the policy of retrenchment , which it had outlined the previous year. It had previously given notice to very many employees of the Defence Department that their services would be dispensed.with. mates were before the House most of those who were to be retrenched Defence Department their connection with it. sum of money which the Government had saved Out of the amount the had voted, and within a few thousand pounds that was sumcient necessary compensation to retiring officers of the Defence Department. was charged to the previous year. I ask honourable members to note the facts, lest the Treasurer should attempt to draw an analogy which does not lie. In the case referred to, the Parliament had voted the money; the Ministry policy, subject to the Washington ference decisions being satisfactory. this case Parliament penny. anything. and received ment. cers of the Income Tax Department their proper. but I hope that the amount of compensation will not be determined Parliament sidering the proposals of the If all this is to be done while is closed, I admit that this part of my argument that is not the intention. to be done has so far not been disclosed. I ask honourable members if they gather from the Budget what are the proposals of the Government in this matter 2 They are apparently intended to be set out on page 11 of the Budget, but it is a very difficult matter to breathe these dry bones a spirit of life and say what they really mean. plain enough, and it is that some, of the States-two, sent year for us. I am not commenting this in any way, or criticising policy of thc Government in that or any other direction just now. All that I am saying is that this Budget does not tell us where we are, and is not an accurate presentation of Commonwealth The Treasurer is not living within his income.

This One thing is is the only opportunity to discuss these items, and the Committee must underI think-will for the 'prestand that they cannot be. dealt with collect our income tax on the Estimates.

Tbe honourable gentleman in f u l 1921 said a great deal on the necessity for a clear financial statement, for diture from one Department to the other in economy, for reductions of the public order to defy the pursuit of what has actually debt, and for most radical financial reforms.

In his speech from the corner last year,, the Treasurer indicated "" many places where gross extravagance and unexplained tration have taken place, and a possibility of large reductions."" This, he said, had been possible without any knowledge of departmental working. "" It is not my duty, but the duty of the Executive Government,"" he said, "" to saywhere the most ready economy can be effected, and which services should bear the brunt of that economy. That is a matter where inside departmental knowledge would alone avail."". He has that inside knowledge now, but where has he effected economy ? He has cut down the Defence vote by £72,000, notwithstanding that the Council of Defence gave a solemn and unequivocal warning that the defence expenditure could not be further reduced without imperilling the safety of the country. We. are told that when the Prime Minister has heard the suggestions of the Imperial Conference the Government w ill evolve a defence policy. What the Government w ill do I do not know, but the Treasurer has, in the preparation of his Budget, gained credit for a reduction of expenditure, at the expense of defence. He has shown a saving of £175,681 in departmental expenditure. The whole amount is covered by reductions in two Departments, namely, Defence £72,964, and Home and Territories £112,927, making a total of £185,891 . The reduction in the Home Territories Department is easily explained. Last year a general election was held at a cost of £95,000. It was a f r i g h t f u l mistake to spend so much money in doing so l it t l e ! However, that was not the honourable gentleman's f a u l t ; but, as he does not intend that there shall be another election this year, he takes credit for saving £ 9 5 , 0 0 0! Customs of non-recurring and special expenditure, so that it is clear that in the aggregate the Treasurer has not reduced the departmental expenditure, but has actually increased it . Where reductions are shown, they are in respect of Defence, Sinking Fund, and Repatriation. As to Defence, the reduction is absolutely in defensible. I do not say here that he should not have reduced his expenditure under these heads. I am merely showing that any reduction he has made is at the expense of Defence: the reduction of the public debt and repatriation. He proposes to save £350,OOO in the Treasury, 1 increases in adminisbut the saving is still '.' in the air."" So far not one officer has been discharged, and I think we may take it for granted that the honourable gentleman will hardly muster sufficient courage to dismiss a sufficient number of men to enable a saving of £350,000 to be effected in one year. He had told the Committee what he intends to do, but he has not done it yet. Therefore, the only savings to date are in respect of Defence, Sinking Fund, and Repatriation, and those are not the items' upon which,, in the opinion, of the vase majority of people, expenditure should be reduced. There should have been a greater contribution to the Sinking Fund, For the honourable gentleman was never tired of telling us. that it was absolutely necessary to reduce the public debt. But he has not reduced the debt; he has increased it . Repatriation expenditure has been curtailed, but that, I admit, must be a gradually diminishing liability. In the aggregate he has not reduced departmental expenditure. The Treasurer's Budget speech is just the sort of pronouncement that one hears before an election. I have never heard a Budget speech"" like it before. It omitted nothing that I can think of. The honourable gentleman took credit for every good thing done by others at any time. Preand ceding Governments had done nothing; he had done everything. For instance, he said that taxation, had been reduced by £4,930,000, and people who know no better may give the honourable gentleman credit for doing this. But what are the facts-2 Of that amount of taxation remitted, £4,930,000, the Treasurer is entitled to credit for only Last year the £1,080,000. The greater part, £3,850,000, Department had £43,000 was remitted by the previous Government. The Sinking Fund was not originated by the Treasurer, and he was not responsible for the reduction of taxation. The contributions to the Sinking Fund by his. predecessors were greater than those which he made. He has paid less into the Sinking Fund than did his immediate predecessor, and much less than the previous Treasurer, Sir Joseph Cook. He has not reduced departmental expenditure except in respect of Defence, Repatriation, and Sinking Fund.. The honourable gentleman spoke also of the Postal Department and the wonderful things which the present Government are doing for the man on the land. When the member for Eorrest( Mr Prowse) was speaking yesterday, I said that in my opinion the people in the thinly settled districts should be charged less per head for the benefits of civilization than the people in the more populous areas. I said that this was the only way we could level up the lot of the men in remote places to that of the men in settled areas. policy that w ill help the man on the land. The Treasurer, dilating upon the extension of postal and telephonic facilities, spoke as though he was responsible for what has been done. But what are the facts. The extension of telephonic, telegraphic, and postal facilities in the country was the policy of the previous Administration. new regime; they made the necessary financial arrangements, they provided the £9,000,000 which is to. be set apart for this most necessary work. money is available this year to enable extended thts country should the credit of his predecessor. But let m e ' draw attention to the' way in which the Treasurer is assisting the man on the land. The honourable gentleman has great influence with this Government. Any man who could be permitted to bring down a Budget like this must have great influence. which the men on the land are being helped in New South Wales and Victoria. In the other States their position is even worse. The total amount to be spent out of loan moneys next year in those two Statesf o r new postal works is £507,179. Of that sum £233,275 is to be spent in the metropolitan area in New South Wales, and £69,616 in the country districts. In Victoria £140,104 is to be spent in the city, and £64,184 in the country. In some of the other States the proportion is worse. It is hard to believe that a Government which professes to represent the country could evolve a policy of this kind. It is certainly greasing tive Government, to say where the mo3t ready the f a t pig. It gives the cities an overwhelming preponderance of the good things to be distributed. I could say a great deal more, but I bave done what I set out to do. I have Mr W. Jf. Hughe*. shown that this Budget does not do what we were entitled to expect. This Budget is not what we should have, if we propose tc maintain parliamentary control of public finance. The Budget does not set out the financial position clearly and ac"" curately. A f t e r perusing it nobody is better equipped to discuss those weighty matters which the honourable gentleman himself told us were of the utmost i m portance, and at the foundation of civil government. The honprable gentleman I am entirely in accord with a said of the previous BudgetThere has been a skilful juggling of expenditure from one Department to another in order to defy the pursuit of what actually occurred. Are the evidences of dummying I have given mere slips or are they deliberately intended to mislead the public ? Wby is the revenue of the Post Office taken from that Department and allotted to other governmental activities, and in its place loan moneys voted to They inaugurated the the Post Office for carrying out its work? Why is the £162,000 for assisted passages to immigrants paid out of loans instead of revenue. That more The Treasurer has himself followed the practice. He askedfacilities to be given to How can taxation ever be reduced if our be placed to indebtedness and interest bill is increased in every Budget? In all these things the honourable gentleman stands condemned out of his own mouth. He has been guilty of doing those things he condemned in others. In view of the honourable gentleman's previous criticisms, we had a right to expect Let us look at the way in that he would do all that was necessary to give us an honest presentation of accounts. Instead of that, he has charged expenditure to this year which could not properly be charged to this year. He has had ample opportunity to improve matters since he made the charges to which I have referred. H is most severe critic is himself. He said, last year, that he hadIndicated many places where gross extravagance and unexplained increases in administration have taken place, and a possibility of large reductions. This has been possible without any knowledge 'of departmental workings. It is not my duty, but the duty of the execueconomy could be effected, and which services could bear the brunt of that economy. That is a matter where inside departmental knowledge would alone avail. In effect he said, "" If I could only get inside I would see that we got something like the ideal conditions we are now seeking 'but cannot find."" The honourable gentleman in his Budget speech this year saidAs to the increases in thc Departments of Customs and Postmaster-General, it should he pointed out that there has been a great expansion of revenue, entailing increase of expenditure for administration and collection. In 1018-19, the Navigation Act, administered by the Customs Department, had not been brought into operation. The increase in the Defence Department is due wholly to the fact that in' 1918-19 the Fleet was ou war commission and military personnel was largely engaged abroad with the Australian Imperial Porce. the cost of these war services being charged to war loan. . Now, of course, the cost is charged to revenue. Invalid and old-age pensions have increased because the fortnightly rate is greater and the number of pensioners is growing larger year by year. Interest and sinking fund require more money now, because it has been the policy of the Commonwealth to provide for capital expenditure out of loan moneys. he had been taken out of the Bosphorus. The taxation office up to the present has been an expanding service, hence the greater cost. Increases in prices since 1918-19, with the consequent living allowances to public servants, have caused large additions to the expenditure of all Departments. The reasons for the other increases are obvious. The Treasurer posed as a champion of economy, and told us that he would clean out this Augean stable. Now he says, "" I have not done anything; I am unable to do it . "" Previously he said, "" We must have an amendment of the Federal Constitution; we must have, a Federal Convention.""Now the one thing that concerns h i m is that Parliament shall go into recess. He says, "" Recess is more precious than reform."" -He said, "" W h a t wo want is a reduction of our national debt."" He has increased it . He said, f ' What we want is a thorough overhauling of departmental expenditure."" Now that he is in office he says, "" I see that this cannot be done."" Last year he said, "" W h a t we want is a plain, honest statement of accounts."" Now he says, "" I see very clearly that if I were to give such a statement. I should show a deficit, and, as I must not show a deficit, candour and honesty must be thrown to one side so that I can give you the Budget that is on the table."" That is the way the honourable gentleman sees his duty to-day. As to the policy of the Government, I shall say nothing. Probably we shall have an opportunity to discuss questions of policy as they arise later. What the Government financial and taxation proposals really are I do not know. "" Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."" My condemnation of this Budget is not on what it does do, or what it does not do; but. on the way in which it hides what it proposes to do, and creates an impression that it does what it does not do, and that it does not do what it does do. quite bad enough for Opposition members to assail tbe Government, but it gives us intense pain that the National party should be stabbed in the back by one of its own members in the manner in which the right honourable member for North Sydney has just stabbed it . I am reminded of the remark of Byron, after He was asked, "" H a v e you no friends?"" "" Yes,"" he said, "" but, thank God, I have lost them."" I think that is the, position of the G'overnment at this juncture. It has lost one of its friends, and I think it should be thankful. It was reasonable to expect that the right honourable member for North Sydney would endeavour to get back some of his own. He gibes at tbe honourable the Treasurer for his inconsistency. He says that the 'Treasurer was an advocate of the New States movement, and then he condemns him because he has taken the steps that he has taken. What steps has the Treasurer taken ? He has taken ten steps. He has stepped from the cross-benches to the Treasury bench ! Why should he adhere to a merely academic thing like the New States movement when the safety of the country demands that he shall occupy the position of Treasurer? Why should the right honourable member for North Sydney criticise the Treasurer for inconsistency? He has never been Treasurer. He criticises the Treasurer because of the way in which he has produced his surplus. It is easy to calculate in such a way that a surplus may be shown. He assails the Treasurer because he has charged to last year's accounts certain amounts which should have been charged to this year's accounts. The quintessence of ability is shown in a Treasurer when he brings out a surplus and not a deficit. It matters not how he achieves it , so long as he upholds his honour for the hour.

A private company put this steamer into commission, and the Government pay it a subsidy of £5,000 a year. condition of the agreement was that the vessel should do something like 17,000 miles of travelling a year. By doing only 8 miles an hour for twelve weeks she would fulfil the conditions of the contract, and she could lie' idle in the. -Northern remaining This This is financing. It is the kind of thing that this Government right honourable member for North ney says that the Treasurer's are inconsistent with what he has said. But circumstanceshave changed. He was there: he is here. His opinions then were necessary for his situation as. the Leader Mr Anstey. of the Country party. Now, of course, it is necessary for hi m to adapt himself to his present position. It is quite true that he was not the Treasurer when he criticised the gentleman who is now Prime Minister.

Theis how economy is achieved. honourable gentleman said that the presen t Prime Minister, as Treasurer, had been does. The a disappointment. Of course, the Prime SydMinister is not a disappointment now, but actions, a brilliant success, because he took the present Treasurer into his Ministry 'What was condemned in the Prime Minister as Treasurer, now becomes, a virtue. Last year the present Treasurer said that. the then Treasurer, instead of stemming the stream of extravagance had been content to go with it . Last year in connection with the Post Office the honourable gentleman declared it to be a scandal to use a public institution of the kind strument of direct taxation. The Post Office, he said, should be conducted as a business concern, in a business-like way, under a directorate. But now, no directorate! The Treasurer holds opinions this year that he did not hold last year, and the reason is that the Prime Minister does not agree with him. If two opposites meet the effect must be negative, or one must give way. In this case we have one giving way on one point, and the other on another, so that they may hang together. The Treasurer has had to give way to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister went to a public meeting in his own district, I think, and said that the idea of the Post Office being treated as a private enterprise under a directorate could not be tolerated for a single moment. The Post Office, he said, was not only a publicly-owned instrumentality, bnt a public utility, and not only the revenue but borrowed money must be used for the extension of such utilities. was one idea that the . present Treasurer put forward last year which he is not prepared to believe in at the present time Sir Joseph Cook was in power on It was, I think, one of the fourteen points 4th August, 1914, and opened negotiaof the ^Country party's programme. According to h i m, .the Commonwealth Bank should be placed under a Board, and there should also be an investigation into -the Persian oil deals. Not now!

It w ill be remembered gentleman sat in the 'corner, he regarded the conduct of War Service Homes as criminal. Now he sees nothing criminal about it . Then the repatriation scandals, were to be a subject of investigation ; today they are not touched. These are not the only matters that call for comment. I draw the attention banks commenced an inflation of their of the Treasurer ( D r . Earle Page) to the action. taken in connection with the note, issue, and would also like him. to show what is transpiring in connection with loan moneys. It is quite true that our expenditure is not met merely out of revenue, but also out of the enormous millions that we as an in raise year after year. Before the war the Commonwealth and States raised on an average £4,000,000 a year by loans. A t present, throughout Australia, and ever since the war, the Commonwealth has been raising £50,000,000 a year. That is going on at the present moment, and the borrowing is increasing in both Pederal and State spheres. We are not livin g within our income. In spite of what the Treasurer may say, the indebtedness of the country is steadily increasing, with an enormous and expanding interest bill. There has been some talk of economy, and last year the Government economized in a peculiar way. B y a reduction of the sinking f u n d rate by something like \ per cent., the Government were enabled to p u t £500,000 less into the f u n d , and this they regarded as a saving. Everybody remembers that when the note-issue was first instituted, the arrangement was that if the banks wanted notes, That they would have to deposit gold in the public Treasury. 'That went on u n t i l the outbreak of the war. tions with the banks and stock exchange brokers, which resulted in the formation of what is known as the Advisory Committee. That Committee of stock jobbers and brokers has been in existence ever since. In 1921, Sir Joseph Cook desired to perpetuate the Committee by an amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act, but he was not allowed to do so, and he said that he would do it by regulation. This Committee has been in control , and it .stands behind the Government to-day. One of the conditions laid 1 down at the beginning of . the war was how, when that honourable that if the banks fel l short of cash they should get three £l-notes for £ 1 in gold. The States were to get £20,000,000, on the basis of £4 in notes to £1 in gold. The States have no gold, but had to get it from the banks, and the result was that £20,000,000 of notes printed in this city were handed direct to the banks. On the basis of ,£20,000;000. legal currency,' the cheque currency to nearly In this way they were enabled to help private individuals to contribute to Commonwealth and State loans. The banks, on what they obtained at a small charged an immensely larger to the public. 1916, even the supplies of the national currency were not sumcient for the financing of wheat, meat, and other ' and the banks made an arrangement the Government to get £1,000,000 of notes on loan. The loan was to be for twelve months, with renewal at the option of the banks. and deposits were renewable at the option of the depositor, and in this case the Government was the depositor. nary policy was reversed, and the loan was renewable at the option of the banks, who were the borrowers. £1,000,000 of notes at 5 per cent., the banks floated another cheque currency, various masters £60,000,000 of bonds. vernment printing press was kept going night and day.

January this was increased by another £1,000,000, another, until the amount became, by the end of March, £59,500,000. this, as . I say, not a penny piece of security has been furnished by the banks. A few months afterwards Cook stated in this Chamber that the Government Afr. Anstey £100,000,000. rency. The honourable member for North Sydney referred to some omissions from the statement of accounts, but there are others. I am taking only a cursory view percentage, of the matter to-day.

65,On 14th De,"Mr ANSTEY -The Government getsism which can be levelled against the present Government and their methods of finance. That is what happens when there is no war as an excuse to justify what is done. What is being done today is that the national printing press is being used, not in order to print notes which might be used for national purposes or issued by the Commonwealth Bank for the building of soldiers' homes at a low rate to avoid-the imposition of a heavy interest rate, but practically as a medium to assist private institutions in carrying on operations from which they gain profits. Every one knows that when the Labour Government introduced the measure to establish the Common( wealth note issue the representatives of the bankers then sitting on this, side, and speaking for them, contended that it would be absolutely dangerous, if the Treasurer did not keep a reserve in gold of at least one-thud of the value of the notes issued. It was advanced day after day by public men, and by the press, that we could not, with safety, permit the gold reserve to go below 33 per cent, of the value of the notes in circulation. Thcr banks and tlieir newspapers pointed out that every advance which they made was backed up by a gold reserve of at least 33 per that, their advances to the public were over £120,000,000, and their reserves in notes and gold were about £40,000,000, or about 33 per cent, of their total advances. They have been returning notes to the Treasury to be burnt after they are done with them. At the present moment the currency they have in gold or notes in their vaults amounts to about £52,000,000, or to about £11,000,000 more than in 1914. That is their basis of credit, and upon that £11,000,000 of additional legal currency they have issued loans to the Commonwealth, the States, and the general public up to £150,000,000, and the basis of 33 per cent, reserve which they had in 1914 has dropped to about 20 per cent. The amount of the reserves of the private banks of this country is about one-fifth of the total advances made to the Commonwealth, States, and general public. If we were for any public purpose, such as the building of soldiers' homes, the Northern Territory railway, or any public work, to issue notes upon a [85] basis of five to £1 we had in gold in the Treasury, every banking institution and every banking newspaper in Australia would regard it as criminally reckless, yet the private banking institutions are Joday operating a fictitious currency of that . kind. These things should be made public. We should ask by whose will or direction, under what impulse, law, or' regulation, the Treasurer and the Note Issue Board are permitted to issue millions in notes to the private banks without Parliament or the public knowing anything about it, and without a single pennyworth of security. That is information which should be given to the public, and there I leave the matter for the present. It is not my intention to traverse the many speeches which have been made during this debate. I wish to make some observations upon a matter which I have been intensely disappointed to find does not occupy a place in the Budget. I refer to Australia's relation to and interest in the New Hebrides. . I am sorry to say that this important matter has been neglected not only by the present but by previous Commonwealth Governments. I raised the question as far back as 1906, cent. They pointed out and pointed out in this Chamber that the administration of the New Hebrides group of islands was a matter of vital concern to Australia from a defence as well as a commercial point of view. I directed attention to the strategic value of the islands as naval bases, and the menace they would prove to Australia should they pass under the control of any nation other than Great Britain, and I referred to the commercial advantages which might be gained by trade with the New Hebrides. On the 19th July, 1906, I moved the following motion:That with a view to promote and encourage settlement by people of o>?r own race in the Southern Pacific Islands-particularl y in the J< ew Hebrides group-it is desirable to allow a rebate of duty on all produce grown by British and Australian settlers in those islands $ coming into the Commonwealth. In order to indicate the purpose I had in view in submitting that motion, I may inform honourable members that these islands are situated some 1,400 miles from the eastern seaboard of Australia. They cover an area of about-400 square miles, or something like 2,500,000 acres. Speaking from memory, I think that in",39,Budget 1923 24
66,Sir Elliot Johnson (Lang) [5.57]. *,"1914 they carried a population of 65,000 people. It may'be within the recollection of honourable members that a little before Federation there had been a considerable administration islands, and representations from Australia ment as to the importance of the islands to Australia and the advisability of steps being taken to secure their control by Great Britaiu. sult of laxity in the matter, things were allowed to drift, aud before 1888 the French, seizing an opportunity which they considered favorable, to the New Hebrides and landed a military force with the intention, it is presumed, of annexing this group of islands. Fortunately alive to the danger of the situation, and as a result of their protests Great represented the situation to France, and the French troops were withdrawn. I may mention that tlie islands were first settled about 1S70, and the settlement very slowly up to 1907. In 1888 a convention was entered into between Great Britain islands were placed under a Joint Commission of British officers. The Commission had no administrative power, and its duty appeared to be really to watch over the interests of British and French settlers and protect their lives, and property, and also checkmate moves by either nation in the direction of annexation. agreement was entered into and signed in London, proclaiming torate by Great Britain and France. This Condominium, as it was called, was agreed to in ""London in February, 1906, ratified in October of the same year, and came into operation on the 2nd December, 1907. Affairs in the New Hebrides have not been any better as a result of the Condominium. from the British point of view, at least, steadily There French ascendancy, owing to the. nursing of her settlers by France, whilst settlers have been discouraged in every possible way. although I directed special attention to this in 1906, nothing effective has. been done to improve the position so far as we Sir Elliot Johnson. are concerned. Perhapsi t will conserve time if I quote the following from the remarks I made on 'the motion I submitted in 1906controversy concerning the It is unfortunate, however, that while these and control of these (mail and shipping) facilities have been were made placed at the disposal of the settlers -whils t we have given them an .imto the British Governproved means of communication by increasing the niail subsidy-w e have, on the other hand,, raised a Tariff wall which prevents the introduction of their products into Australia. Increased mail services can avail them nothing Unfortunately, as the reso long as their products are shut out of our markets. In consequence of our action, a number of the settlers in the islands have been reduced, in some instances to absolute penury, and in nearly all cases to a condition sent two warships .bordering more or less on destitution. They have made several appeals to the Commonwealth Government to assist them, not by monetary grants, but by treating them as fellow Australians-as citizens of the Comthe Australian people were monwealth endeavouring to help in the work of building up the Empire in these seas. There is no doubt that even under the most Britain favorable circumstances, courage and hope, ns well as skill, are needed by those who leave these shores to live under the conditions obtaining in the islands, and to do the work of pioneering there. But when, after encouragprogressed ing our people to settle in the group, we deliberately set up obstacles in the way of their progress, and . close the only profitable market open to them, we are guilty of something and France under which the worse than folly. The effect of this action on our part is likely to be very serious. We may and French naval not feel it immediately, but there is'not the slightest doubt that unless we take steps to remedy the evils we have created, by our failure to afford reasonable encouragement to those settlers, we shall realize later on, in a very unpleasant way, .perhaps, the blunder we have committed. In the meantime nothing very much has In 1906 a formal been done. An arrangement was entered into by the Deakin Government a Joint Protecwith Burns, Philp and Company to take up areas of land in the group with a view to encouraging Australian settlement in the New Hebrides, with the ultimate object' of making it a part of the British Empire. I have no complaint against Burns, Philp and Company. They reduced the fares, and made On the contrary, they have, special concessions to intending settlers, and a number of Australians were in gone from bad to worse. duced to go there to raise copra. As the has grown up a certain coconut trees, from which copra is obtained, take from seven to ten years to British mature, it was necessary that the settlers should engage in some other occupation I am sorry to' say that, to sustain themselves during that time, and to prevent the loss of their capital. They did this only to find that they had no market for their products. They grew other products, chiefly coffee, maize, and arrowroot. Australia was their natural market, but, unfortunately, it was closed ' to them by the high Tariff which had been imposed on their products. They found themselves treated, not as Australian citizens, but as foreigners and aliens. As a result many of the settlers failed, and were reduced to absolute destitution. A considerable number -left the islands. Comparing their treatment with that of the French settlers, it was decidedly to their and our disadvantage. Whilei t is true that the French authorities taxed products, they returned the tax to their settlers by way of local administrative purposes in improving roads, wharfage, &c. assisted handicapped, the Australian residents were seriously up against, things. A t this juncture the French Government offered to the Australian settlers similar concessions to those enjoyed by the Frenchi f they would accept the .nationality of France. To the credit^ of their loyalty, the Australian settlers refused these overtures, but many of them returned to Australia sadder and wiser men. , From a commercial stand-point the present policy of the Australian Government concerning the New Hebrides is a disastrous one. The only way to establish a legitimate claim for sole control by the British Empire would be by effective occupation, and by a preponderance of British settlers and British trading interests. Unfortunately, our settlers are dwindling, and the French settlers are increasing. A t present the French population is more than double that of the British. This raises a formidable barrier to any arrangement between Great Britain and Australia for the intervention bf the Imperial Government, and for the substitution of British control for the Condominium. This Government cannot be saddled with the blame. They have been too short a time in office, but they have a heavy and urgent responsibility to face concerning the position. The present state of neglect is the faul t of each succeeding Government since the first Australian settled in the New Hebrides. value of these islands to the Commonwealth and Great Britain is immense, because any future trade from tbe Panama Canal to Australia must pass in the vicinity of them. Regard must also be paid to the strategic position of the islands for defence purposes. They possess three or four fine harbors, V i l a and Havana Harborsi n E f a t or Sandwich Island, Segond Channel on the south-eastern side of Santo, and Port Sandwichi n Malekula. Havana Harbor is large, and capable of sheltering at one time the whole of the British Fleet. It has a safe entrance, an approach in all weathers, and is practically land-locked. As a naval base it would have no rival, atany rate, in the Pacifio Ocean between Australia and the western coast of America. Unfortunately, these advantages are likely to be lost to Great Britain and to the Commonwealth. These islands are very much desired by another Power with which we In every way ' they are at present on friendly terms, the French settlers. Thus but which must be regarded as a possible enemy in the future. I mention this as a possibility, and not as a probability, haying in mind the instability of national alliances and friendships; we have to consider these contingencies. As a naval base in the hands of a foreign power, with which we might be subsequently embroiled, it would gravely imperil outposition. Although these islands are 1,400 miles from the eastern seaboard of Australia, the trading steamer taking some eight or ten days to do the journey, a fast war vessel could do it in a third of that time, or even less. From a strategic point of view, this is a matter of extreme gravity to Australia. TheB ritish settlers in the New Hebrides, who are principally Australians, suffer a grave disability, because, while they are made to obey the laws, and rightly so, breaches of the law by the French settlers are treated by their Government with a degree of tolerance and laxity which places our people at a great disadvantage. The judicial system in the Islands is as unique as it is complex. To explain this position it will be necessary to show the number and arrangement of the officials. The French Administrative officers are the Resident Commissioner, the Assistant Resident Commissioner, the Second Assistant Resident Commissioner, and two clerks. The British Administration consists of . the The commercial Resident Commissioner, the Assistant Resident Commissioner, two LabourI n spectors, one of whom acts as Registrar of the British National Court. In addition, there are the judiciary and staff of the Courts. The British Court administers the law from the British standpoint, and the French Oourt administers it from a French stand-point.

Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. In Committee of Supply: settlers thus suffer considerably in consequence of the laxity in the administration of the French laws in the Condominium. Certain settlers, knowing that they can punity, take advantage of their knowledge to do many things which should not be allowed. One of tiie laws of the Condominium prohibits trading in intoxicants and rifles. The natives, well knowing that the British authorities compel rigid observance of this law, go to the French traders, can deal with impunity. This trade is diverted channels. This seriously affects the progress of British settlement in the New Hebrides. It should be given close attention by the Commonwealth Government. This Government alone cannot deal with the situation, but the position is serious enough to merit attention from the Imperial Government. subject in 1906, and pointed out the dangers that were ahead of us. predictions I then made have been more than verified by results. gone from bad to worse. terian missionaries in the New Hebrides have frequently called attention to the flagrant abuses which occur in the islands, and they have urged the Commonwealth Government to take all possible, steps to correct them. As a result of investigations while acting as a Royal Commission, in addition to our published report on the mail services, the h o n orable member for Herbert and I made a confidential report to the Government of the day. I am, not at liberty to disclose the contents of that document, but I will say that the position outlined therein is sufficiently serious to justify the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) bringing it before the Imperial Conferf7 AUGUST, 1923.'] 1923-24. 2241 ence. If that is done the British Government may determine to consult with the French Government to see what remedies may be applied. I do not conceal from myself the fact that the question is"" a* very delicate and difficult one and requires very judicious and tactful handling, but that is no reason why the matter should be shirked. The representatives of the Presbyterian Church have established mission stations in the New Hebrides and are doing valuable service there. In a statement in the Argus of 6th August, the Rev. R. J. H . McGowan, of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church, says. It is reported tliat grog is being used in redisregard the law with imcruiting, perhaps more than ever before. Yet, even with the grog, and with decoy women, and, sometimes, straight-out force, recruits are becoming more and more difficult to obtain Therefore, the temptation to commit irregularities to get them is enormous. It is Said that as labour is becoming so scarce and difficult to obtain, a French firm is bringing in, during the next few months, 800 Tonquinese. There will be 300 in ihe first batch, and 500 later This with whom they is said to entail an initial outlay of about £15,000. These Tonquinese are to be recruited for five years. However, their coming will not . from British to French solve the labour* problem, for the French will still .be eager to employ all labour available, and irregularities will continue. It is supposed that the Tonquin labourers are French citizens; so this phase of the problem may work 'for France and be against Britain. So long as the lax administration of theFrench authorities, complained of by I discussed the British settlers and the Presbyterian missionaries, continues, it is unreaThe sonable to hope for successful British colonization in the New Hebrides. Things have Such an idea must be set aside. In view The Presbyof the strategic importance of these islands, to say nothing of their commercial value, something should be done by the Commonwealth Government to effectively and steadily promote British settlement there. One thing we can do is to give a rebate of all duties on the products of British settlers in the islands. This would place the Britishers in a less v unfavorable position as planters, and would assist in the development of trade. As long as the Condominium control continues, however, it will be impossible to secure a thoroughly satisfactory state of affairs. I trust, therefore, that the Prime Minister will take steps while he. is in England to see that the true condition of things is brought under the notice of",43,Committees A S Temporary Chair

79,Mr Mcneill (Wannon) [8.13],"The motion of immigration. My own opinionco uiitry on the face of the earth where land monopoly has such ahold. Victoria, which I know well, the State Government cannot provide a block of 320 acres of agricultural Crown land otiher than, perhaps, in the uncleared Mallee country. It is true that there is plenty of Crown land in eastern Gippsland, but it is not the sort on which we could expect immigrants,"" or even Australians, to settle or succeed. There are thousands of experienced men in this State, but none of them could make a living on 320 acres of the Crown land offered in Gippsland. When we are told that there are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of acres awaiting the human hand to t ill , we are told what is not true in fact. It is true that some of the closer settlement blocks purchased under the repatriation scheme are successfully occupied, not, and never w ill be. is that in quite a number of cases the mistake subdividing tlfe land into blocks that--, are too small. when a department or a Government apply a cheeseparing policy in such a way as to provide blocks too small to permit of a decent living being made on them. It is true that in a few instances the closer settlement scheme has been carried out very well. For iustance, the Mielville Estate in the Western District, purchased, I believe, from the Falkiner family for soldier settlement, is adequately managed. In that case, however, the land was cheap, and there is thorough organization in the administration. homestead, with their own cook and their own mess, and . there is an experienced manager to look after the property, and teach them the science of sheep-breeding and wool-raising generally. clearing of their own land, and, to some extent, in cultivation. There is no doubt that in such circumstances these men will make a success; and what I have said of the Melville Estate applies to other places in the lower Western District. These are instances in which'the Government or the Department has shown some common sense. In many cases the settlers are inexperienced, knowing nothing of cultivation or the raising of stock, and yet they are left to their own resources. If they escape financial disaster Ini t will be by a miracle. The day is not far distant when this whole scheme will have to be reviewed. In many cases there will have to be a revaluation of properties, but it would be a thousand times better for the Government to admit its mistake, and have a revaluation made, than to court failure. The Government ought to admit'that the conditions are too harsh, in view of the price of land and the rate of interest, and should promise their revision. If these settlers are driven away, they will be thrown on the labour market, and others will 'be put in their places w i th a like fate in fron t of them. These are all matters which must be taken into consideration by both the. Commonwealth and State Governments. When we induce young men to come from the Old World, telling .them at Australia House, and by placards throughout the.British Isles, that but others are there are thousands and millions of acres The reason here awaiting them, we are misleading them in the most unfair way. During has been made of recent months I have met young settlers who are absolutely disappointed; and we It is altogether wrong may rest assured that when they return to the Old Land, as they w ill , they will not have a good word for this country and the treatment they received in it at the hands of the Government. Land settlement is quite above party politics, because it has an interest for every man, woman, and child of the community. There are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of young men in Australia to-day, who do not own a speck of land, and who cannot get land to cultivate, or even, in many cases, to build a house on. We must as quickly as possible throw open The settlers live at the the lands of this country to the young men of this country, and also to immigrants. The other day a Lands Ordinance for the Northern Territory was laid before the House, and I suppose it w ill be discussed before this session closes. Every day they assist in the From that Ordinance I gather that in the Northern Territory companies hold .as much as 11,000 and 12,000 square miles of country. The Commonwealth is committed to the construction of a railway through the Territory at a cost of millions; and for what purpose? For closer settlement? No ; to suit the convenience of a few gentlemen who compose the big land companies, and hundreds of thousands, or millions, of acres of the finest country in the world may be locked up for a lifetime. The people of Australia are committed u . build that railway and maintain it for the convenience of a few people, and it will -not -assist in the settlement. of that at present sparsely-populated portion of the Commonwealth. schemes are to succeed, the promises we make to the men and women of other nations to induce them 'to come to Australia must be faithfully carried out. If they are not, we shall be doing a grievous injustice to the people whom we induce to come here, and also to our Australian-born men who are seeking land to-day. We are told that all we require in Australia is increased population, and that if we bring millions of people to this country they will enable us to reduce our national debt. That may appear at first sight to be true, but in reality we cannot expect such a result, because, to-day, we have the sorry spectacle of thousands of men and women seeking employment and unable to secure it. That is a state of affairs which should not be permitted to continue in Australia. No country can afford to have its young manhood, representing the greatest wealth of the nation, in idleness. I venture to say that 99 per cent of the men who are idle to-day are not idle through their own choice, but because the Government of the day will not provide employment for them. Is there any reason why employment cannot be found for them ? There are many great undertakings which might be proceeded with in this country that would absorb all the unemployed we have. The Commonwealth Government should set an example to the State Governments in this' matter by undertaking a comprehensive policy of developmental works. I suppose it is proper that the Prime Minister should attend the Imperial Conference, but I do not think it is fair that he should ask that Parliament should be closed until he returns from the Old Country. party who, surely, could carry on the government of the country. sitting at the table. Treasurer, to whom the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) refers, is as honest as any other man in his party, and would be prepared to carry on the work of Parliament. Prime Minister will have important work to perform in the Old Country. I was' pleased, to hear him say, the other night, that when he goes across the water he will take advantage of every opportunity offered to advocate.disarmament, and the peace-of the world. 1 hope he-will fulfil If our immigration the promise he has made to this House in that particular matter. A t this time it is necessary that some one in the Old World should sound the Australian note and give expression to the Australian sentiment.. When the Prime Minister speaks on this matter I hope he will not forget to tell the big men of other nations that Australia is in favour of disarmament/, and is in favour, of peace. I feel sure that Australia is capable of giving a lead in this way. The honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham), speaking the other night, referred in laudatory terms to the League of Nations. He said rightly that we cannot exjject very much from the League of Nations, constituted as it is at present. If it is to be of any value to the world in the promotion of universal peace it can only be when every nation in the world is permitted to join it . We? cannot have a League bf Nations to abolish war and bring about international disarmament unless every nation in the world is invited to take its share of the work to be performed by the League. I hope the Prime Minister will emphasize this point at the Imperial Conference. Heshould say that he brings the message from the people of Australia that they ' believe that the peace of the world can be brought about through the League of Nations, but that first of all every nation, including Germany and Russia, must be invited to join the League. It is remarkable that no institution of its kind should have been proposed throughout the long, dark centuries that have passed, during which, God knows, the world suffered severely from wars brought about by rotten diplomacy. Sir Robert Peel once said that secret He has reliable men in his diplomacy was a costly engine for bringing about peace. Voltaire declared it to be a "".field of lies."" I think he was right. So far as we have been able to trace the doings of the diplomats of the various nations, they have never been honest either with their own people or with the Governments with which they were negotiating. The history of their operations goes to show that their No doubt the treachery to their own people plunged the world into war time and again.

When the people of the different nations become fully alive to the fact that they .haye.»it .in. their power to prevent war, I am certain that universal peace will be brought about. It can only be secured through the people of every nation becoming united in the League of Nations and determining, once and for all, that secret diplomacy shall be abolished, and that whenever a dispute arises between nations, the rest of the world shall be informed how it came about, and be given an opportunity to say whether it shall continue. France is undoubtedly the greatest military power in the world to-day. The French people, among whom I do not include -the military, are a lovable people. The military forces of France are to-day pursuing a war of domination in the Ruhr to the detriment of the French people, the rest of Europe, and of Great Britain. Kepresentatives of the Labour party of Great Britain visited the Ruhr to find out for themselves the actual conditions obtaining there, and this is, briefly, what they reportWe found a state of war in the Buhr. A& invading army is occupying this region, whose commander issues orders to the civil population aud punishes disobedience of them. Motor cars, locomotives, hotels, and public buildings are requisitioned, leading citizens are seized as hostages, and individuals, considered undesirable by the invaders, are expelled, together with their families. If this is not war, it is difficult to say what it is. Such proceedings would be illegal in time of peace. There is the statement of a body of honest men who visited the Ruhr to ascertain for themselves the facts of the French occupation of that district. The French military people are pursuing a very dangerous course. They have loaned 400,000,000 francs to Poland for the manufacture of war material, and 300,000,000 francs to Servia. The whole of that money is to be used in the manufacture of arms and ammunition by French manufacturers. Neither Poland nor Servia will receive one shilling in cash. All they will get will be war material manufactured in France. Servia' and Poland are really being asked to back France up in all her invasions. taken over Krupp's works in Germany. ber reminds us that France has now taken ist candidates at the last elections the over.Krupp's works. I say that France is not pursuing a wise or< an honourable course. France has not paid her debt to England, although requested to do so. She is loaning hundreds of thousands of francs to European States who are prepared to assist her in time of war. If Great Britain is involved in a war in the near future, it will be not with France but with Japan. We have nothing to fear from Japan. France is deserting her Allies-Great Britain, Italy, Australia, and other .nations-^-wh o helped .to defend her fair lands from the invading Army. She has invaded Germany, not for reparation, but to acquire the rich coal valley of the Ruhr. The Prime Minister has many problems to face at the Imperial Conference. He will be asked to express an opinion on the invasion of the Ruhr and other vital questions, and I shall be very disappointed if he does not voice the sentiment and ideals of Australia. The time is not far distant when peace will reign supreme. Man was not created to quarrel and fight. It is true that the immortal Burns, in one of his lonely moments, wrote, "" Man was made to mourn "" ; but I do not agree with him. I believe that man was made to be happy, and that he mourns only 'because of "" man's inhumanity to man."" If God-given rights were supreme there would be no squalid slums and the misery which exists in every, large city. For the sake of peace and prosperity we should strive to bring about better conditions for the human race. Let us waft the cry of peace over the ocean north, south, east, and west. We who live under the Southern Cross believe that the world's peace can be attained by negotiation with other nations. We can determine that war and its attendant crimes shall for all time cease. Before my election to this Parliament, L was led to believe that a surplus shown on the balance-sheet of this country's operations for any one year was based on sound figures, but I understand from some honourable members that the figures shown in Budgets are of a very ephemeral character, and do not always represent the true position.

84,Mr Gardner (Robertson) [8.48],"impression that up to last year, because of war commitments, there had really been no opportunity to seriously curtail expenditure. This has been borne out by the Budget of the Treasurer. He is meeting with the same criticism as was experienced by his predecessors, and I sympathize w it h h i m. Criticism is one thing, but the assumption of responsibility is another. As the Treasurer has been in office only six months, and this is his first Budget, I am sure the Committee will give h i m credit for honest intentions and judge him by results. The Government have seen fit to alter the method of tax collection. The taxpayers for some considerable time have considered that there should be one taxing authority. Duplication entails unnecessary expense, and this should be eliminated in the compilation of electoral rolls. A t present the proposals for one tax-collecting authority are somewhat indefinite. The Commonwealth and two of the States have agreed that the State authority shall collect the tax. will remain in force, but one set of officers w ill ' be responsible to State and Federal Commissioners. . Having had some experience as an accountant, and in the Taxation Department, I know that the Government cannot expect very much benefit from taxation reform during this year. First of a l l , the Commonwealth Act is difficult to administer. I understand that a conference of taxation experts w ill be held in September next to t r y to bring about the uniformity of taxation laws. pect ofi a satisfactory settlement of that matter. it . Until it. is proved to the contrary I shall not change my view that uniformity will be better brought about under the FederalA c t than under the different State measures. We should r i d this country of laws involving unnecessary duplication. Two taxation returns have now to be supplied, and the perpetual queries issued by each Taxation Department harass the taxpayers. According to the Budget, the amount extracted from them during the years 1914-1922 was about £141,000,000. It is a heavy tax, but we must remember that a great deal of it was levied for war commitments, which was the monetary price paid for Australia's freedom. The taxpayers of the Commonwealth are looking for relief not only from duplication of taxation; they are awaiting the f u l f i l ment of the promise of the Government for some remission of taxes. The reduction of the postage rate is a general relief to the country. In the taxation schedule I find, under War-time Profits Tax, a total revenue of £8,382,162 , and a debit balance outstanding of £125,000 . This tax was most inequitable and difficult in its incidence. The officials of the Taxation Department found it almost impossible to work under that Act, and it was a mistake to bring the primary producers under it . Although the primary producers obtained good prices during the war, it is a well-known fact that one year they obtain high prices, which vanish in the next I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Charlton), that debts must be paid. I am not concerned because the war-time profits tax h it hard a section of the community, whose stocks in hand in The Commonwealth taxation laws creased in value to an enormous extent, and who during the war made enormous the profits. Whilst the primary producers were mulct in this taxation, another section of the community that could have been included w i th more justice was overlooked. Many professional men rendered war service. I am quite sure that the Treasurer ( D r . Earle Page), and other members of the medical profession, made a considerable financial sacrifice through their service at the Front. Barristers and members of other professions must have done the same, and I cannot believe that others in those professions who did not go to the war did not derive a certain amount of , benefit from the absence of their comI am glad to hear petitors. The war-time profits tax could bave been applied to them w it h more jusfice than to the primary producers. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) suggested that because of the precarious nature of their industry and their uneven incomes the primary producers should be given the benefit of a differential rate of income taxation. But one does not . pay income taxation unless he has a certain minimum income. Therefore, I am not in favour of a differential rate for any one section of the community, but I would like this Parliament to extend the averaging system on lines that would",48,Committees A S Temporary Chair
85,Dr. Eable Page,There is every pros,49,Committees A S Temporary Chair
86,Mr Gardner,"be more fair to the primary producers. Another desirable reform is in regard to the taxation upon natural increase. The ordinary definition of income is money received in cash or negotiable security. Until the farmer or grazier has realized his natural increase he has not received income from that source. Therefore, when taxation is collected from h i m in respect of natural increase which he has not sold he is being taxed on a fictitious income. There seems to me to be an anomaly in the proposed amendments of the law relating to the taxation of companies. Undoubtedly, the Commonwealth officers have found it difficult to collect taxation on distributed dividends. The State Government found, long ago, that it was impossible to trace dividends paid by a limited company into the hands of the shareholders, adopted the system of taxing at the source. The Treasurer said, in his Budget speech* With.a view to bringing about more uniformity in the taxation systems; and to make thc administration less expensive, the Commonwealtli Government has decided to submit an amendment to Parliament providing for the imposition of a tax on companies at the flat rate of Is. in the £1, instead of the present tax seems to me that the exemption allowed on undistributed profits. Where, however, the normal income tax rate imposed upon an individual is in excess of Is., he will be charged income tax upon those dividends as at present, subject to a rebate of Is. in the £1. It does not appear to me that the Government are adopting the system of taxing at the source. They are really i m posing a -flat rate of Is. in the f 1 on the whole of the profits of the company, irrespective of the dividends, and they are still endeavouring to follow the dividends into the hands of the shareholders. W h y not make a complete change by adopting the system now, operated by the States of taxing companies' profits only at the source? My attention was drawn to this anomaly in the Treasurer's proposal by an article in the Sydney Bulletin. That journal pointed out what w ill happen to a taxpayer who is paying a rate of 8d. in the £ 1 . The effect of the Government's proposal will be that the poorer shareholder will be disadvantaged, so far as his income from companies is concerned, in comparison with other shareholders. If the rate he pays is 8d. in £ 1 sucn a shareholder will be penalized to the extent of 50 per cent, for his contribution towards and assistance to Australian industries. D r . EABLE PAGE -Anothe r means of equalizing the tax will be provided. may be a difference of opinion amongst honourable members as to the extent to which the Commonwealth can increase invalid and old-age pensions, we are all in sympathy with those old pioneers who have borne the heat .and burden of the day, have directly or indirectly contributed to the taxation of the country for many years, and have reared families of young Australians, .than whom, as has been truly Said, there are no better immigrants. Whilst one's sympathies may suggest an increase in the pension by 5s. or even 10s., tliis matter, like all others, must be dealt with according to the financial capacity of the country. As and, consequently, they the proposed increase and alterations, .of the conditions governing the pension will increase the burden of the Commonwealth by £1,065,984 , it cannot be denied that in setting aside this sum for the aged people the Government have done something substantial. I am very pleased also that many of the anomalies in the Act and regulations are to be removed. It in respect of the amount of property held by the pensioner is not sufficient. A pensioner who has been t h r if t y and has managed to acquire a house in addition to the home in which he lives should hot -therefore be penalized. The conditions in that regard should be liberalized. The Government might have been more generous in regard to the amount which a pensioner may earn without detriment to his pension. However, the proposal to , appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into pensions and national insurance has met w i th the approval of honourable members on both sides of the House. This investigation w ill let U3 know exactly what the Commonwealth can most effectively do to provide for old age and invalidity. Speaking on the Address-in-Reply, I said that I had no objection to a reduction in postage rates, but I regarded the efficiency of the service as the paramount consideration. I said then, and I still think, that a reasonable amount should be paid ""for such efficiency. The people of Australia are asking for economy, and the Treasurer is very keen upon bringing",49,Committees A S Temporary Chair
87,Mr Gardner,"Although thereabout a reduction of '.expenditure, but thero can be false economy'. What we require is efficiency, and I believe that the Australian people are prepared to pay for it . I do not believe in pitting country interests against city interests, but as a country representative with country interests, I hold that the outback people are entitled to the best conveniences that this Parliament can give them. Such facilities are not only essential to the conduct of theiz.industad.es, but are necessary from a social 'stand-point. Telephones which bring the settlers into cloger relations with their neighbours, and make possible some of the amenities of social intercourse, mean a great deal in the outback country. Sometimes they are -the means of saving life. I know that the sympathies of the Postmaster General( Mr Gibson), are with the country people, but has he made an accurate estimate of what his Department -can do, and have the Government gone fully into this matter? making a mistake it will be their funeral, uot mine. I can judge them only on the outcome of their policy. Will the policy of extending facilities in the country, which was initiated by the Nationalist Government, be continued with greater concessions, or will the reduced postal charges mean the starving of country services ? My attitude towards the Government in this matter will be affected by the results of their policy. I understand that owing to the efforts of one very capable man, assisted by other officers; considerable re-organization has taken place in the Postal Department end, therefore, I hope that the Postmaster General's expectations will be realized..; It is very gratifying to find that the Government have, by providing £500,000 for the purchase of wire netting, recognised that the rabbit pest is a national concern. money is allocated to the Northern Territory, but States in which the rabbit has become a great menace will participate. Tn the district I represent the provision of wire netting is a matter of vital concern to the producer. It is recognised by most practical men that very often two-thirds of the dire effects that are attributed to drought are really due to the rabbit pest. The Government deserve the thanks of . the primary producers for having recognised the obligation of the National Government in this regard, and Jfr. Gardner. I hope that the finances in the next year will permit of their proceeding further in the same direction. I was not able to take part in the debate on the Imperial Conferences, and I take this opportunity of referring to the amount of £250,000 which has been placed to a reserve account in the Defence Department. Foreign relations and trade relations are probably the most important issues that this Parliament can discuss. It behoves .every member of this -..Committee to have the courage of his convictions, and to say where he stands. I had the courage of my convictions in my electorate of Robertson, and I have similar courage in this House. I listened with attention to most of the speeches made on this subject, although I missed some of the good addresses. Without making an acute analysis of those speeches, I think it may be said that, after all, there is not very much difference between our opinions about Imperial relationships and foreign If thjey are policy. The Prime Minister, on behalf of this side of the Chamber, and the Leader of the Opposition for -the Labour party, showed clearly that there was no intention to support what was known a few years ago as the policy of "" cut the painter."" It is generally recognised that Australia's safety lies in her remaining an integral part of the British Empire. That is precisely my view. I believe that the crimson tide of kinship, as it was once described by that grand old statesman, Sir Henry Parkes, still flows through the veins of Britishers, and that we are proud to belong to the British Empire. With my limited political experience, I cannot attempt to throw light on Imperial and international questions, but I am certain that our safety lies in remaining a part of the British Empire. If trouble arose, in Australia it would affect every part of the Empire. A portion of the If ' trouble arose in the Homelandi t would also affect all other parts of the Empire. I hope that the Prime Minister, when he is in England, will make it . very clear that the people of Australia realize that their safety and future prosperity depend upon their continued connection with the British Empire. I hope he will make it clear that Aus' tralia is prepared to do her fair share in the defence of this country. What is the best thing to do is a matter for experts to decide. If one of the best means to be adopted to safeguard Australia is to establish a Naval Base at Singapore, at a cost of something like £10,500,000, the majority of. the members of this Committee would be prepared to do their part towards it . The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) made a strong point when he asked what was the use of us having an army and an aerial fleet for our defence if the high seas were not open to our trade. have been if our primary products could not have been sent abroad during the war? That they were sent abroad with safety was due in a considerable degree to the work of our ex-Prime Minister( Mr W. M. Hughes). Where would we have been had it been impossible for us to send food to the soldiers who were abroad fighting for our freedom? believe the right honourable the Prime Minister is possessed of Australian ideals and of a love for this country, and that he desires to do his best in the high position that he occupies. that he has given us an assurance that he will not commit Australia to anything without the consent of this Parliament. Nothing could be more democratic than that. I am sure we all wish him Godspeed and a successful mission. The representatives of this country, who are elected to this Parliament on a franchise than which there is nothing more democratic in the world, not even excepting America, will be prepared to,give proper deliberation and consideration to whatever proposals he may bring back with him from the Conference The first item that strikes one on perusber of the Commonwealth Service for ing the Budget is the enormous increase several years.

I do not often agree with the right honourable member for North Sydney, but I must agree with him that certain items given in the Treasurer's list of increased expenditure were not spent during the last year. It is very questionable whether the Fruit Pool advances of £551,000 properly come into that period. I have yet to hear from the Treasurer an Where would this country explanation on that item that will satisfy me. Certainly the amount of £250,000 for wire netting which is included in last year's expenditure has not yet been spent. The Treasurer's own statement proves that. He says, in respect of that matterIn order to assist small holders in combating vermin, the Government has decided to I moke available a total of £250,000, to be advanced for the purchase of wire netting on long terms. Of that amount, a sum of £50,000 hns been set apart for the Northern Territory, and £200,000 will be made available for tbe other parts of tbe Commonwealth. I am glad I submit that clearly proves that the amount has not been spent, and that it has been irregularly placed on the expenditure side of last year's balance-sheet. The inclusion of items such as that in the Budget makes the document of no use to the Committee in determining the exact financial position of the Commonwealth. , I specially desire an explanation in regard, to defence expenditure. We are told that the ordinary expenditure on defence this year is to be £662,000. Other heavy expenditure is to be provided for out of loan moneys. This country should take all possible steps to insure that we get full value for money spent Tby the Defence Department.

That was the position last year.

I compliment the Treasurer on his brevity in dealing with this subject in his Budget. He uses nice, crisp sentences, but he departs from his usual method when he states in what almost amounts to a panegyric on the Post OfficeTliis .Department assists in providing comfort, convenience, and profit to all sections of tlic community.

Modern invention gives a hope I maintain that the Treathat, by tliese. services, the disadvantages of tbe country, as regards isolation, education, and recreation, may be minimized, and that the present drift to the cities may be turned back towards natural life and settlement. TreaA l l this is to be done by reducing the rate of postage from 2d. to l ^ d . I know there is a difference of opinion here with regard to this proposed reduction, and I say frankly'that T am against the reduction. My opposition to it is not from party purposes, because I know I can find a numI think that ber of gentlemen opposite who agree with was me. The reduction proposed is one of over 50 per cent. If the rate were kept at 2d. and an ounce letter carried for What would have happened if that sum, there would have been a reduction of 50 per cent. MrA .

I know it will mean a gain of hundreds of pounds-bi g business-to the big newspaper proprietors and the banking institutions.. We are told thab the reduction will mean a loss of £930,000 for the first year. Roughly speaking, there would not be more than 2,000,000 people in the Commonwealth who,write a letter once a week; indeed, I think I am overstating the position. The reduction means that these people will each' save £d. per week, or a saving to them collectively of £216,000 a year, at'the outside. We all know how seldom one receives letters from the bush, and altogether the reduction means a gain of £700,000 a year to the big business men of Australia. I was once employed in the Post Office under the State Government of Western Australia, and I know that in the lean years there was no rise of salary for the employees.

We have been told that it is impossible to make use of the aerial mail service over the tropical country between Derby and Wyndham Siniilar cases may be found in aJl the hinterland of Australia, and instead of cutting down postage rates, we should allow them to stand, and extend postal services for the benefit of the people in the back country. My own view is that the man who desires a reduction below 2d. on the postage on a letter is a born sweater. In this matter, to compare conditions in Australia with those in Great Britain or America is quite unreasonable.

When they get on cattle, these flies bore a hole through the hide and into the flesh. They exist' in millions, and when a beast becomes infested it is not long before it is in poor condition and unfit for market. raisers in the Kimberley district are naturally alarmed at the spread of the pest. Although data has been in the hands of the Institute of Science and Industry for several years, no funds have 'been provided to enable the Institute to take steps to discover a method of coping with the pest. We have, a Government with an overflowing Treasury distributing largesse, but it starves the services essentensile strength. Such a material should find tial for building up this country.. To illustrate the methods of the Government towards secondary industries, I want to read one or two opinions of gentlemen who are interested in the asbestos industry in Western Australia 'Directly to the north of Geraidton there are immense deposits, extending rightup to ' the Kimberleys, of various kinds of minerals. It has been stated -repeatedly, not only by members for the district, -but also by reliable prospectors who have gone out there, that that portion of the country is the richest they have seen in different kinds of ores, the mining of which would be payable if transportation were provided. That is the testimony of men who have been mining i h different parts of the world. Deposits of asbestos have a very wide range in that part of the country. Gentlemen who were in terested in about 100 square miles .of country at Moora, on the Midland railway, had tests made to discover the value of the asbestos there. members ought to have reserved that commodity for their own use in the next world. . MrA . GEEEN party w ill assert itself in this matter. They, and not a Labour man, should be -stirring up the Government tb a realiza; tion of the needs of our primary industries. As far as that party is concerned, I have never interested myself sufficiently and the Nationalists. Between them. I can find no essential difference. My attitude towards the Country party is like that of a man who had a good-looking wife and a good-looking sister-in-law,. but the latter was . the younger. In appearance they were alike. A friend said to him, "" Your sister-inlaw is very much like your wife. How do you discriminate between the t w o / ' and the man replied, "" I do not t r y . "" Cattle And so I do not t r y to discriminate' fe'etween the Country' and Nationalist parties. Reverting to the subject of Moora asbestos, Edward S. Simpson, Doctor of Science, Government Mineralogist and Chemist of Western Australia, has made the following report:Tfae Moora asbestos is in soft flexible fibres, easily separated from one another, from J inch to 2 inches in length, and possessed of high a ready market, and would be particularly . useful for making fibre cement, wall sheets, &c. This statement shows that the asbestos is not of. inferior-quality. Honourable members know that . for manufacture it is necessary to have-' a product of good quality. The Minister, for Railwaysi n Western Australia gave this asbestos a trial, and stated-< We have now six locomotive boilers which have been put to stationary wprk covered vith your asbestos.. It is a very good boiler coverrng, 'easy to mix and put on, and hangs well to boiler. It is .quite equal to Bell's or the K2 boiler compound.'"" . -. A tribute from Mcllwraith , McEacharn Proprietary l i m it e d reads as follows: We have pleasure in stating that the two boilers, and also the cylinders of our local riversteamer Westralian, were covered in .November last with asbestos, supplied and applied by your company, .and our experience ""in the case of this vessel goes to show that your composition is' quite .as good as, if not 'superior to, the imported article. I have a further testimonial from the Western Ice Company Limited, Perth, reading.Owing to the fibrous nature of the material we did not use 'any woven wire for reinforcing, and it has now been under the severest tests I hope the Country for over twelve months.

105,Mr Chablton,"The Government dohave been made on the Murchison River, and it is said that the richness of the Surprise Mine is not equalled by any other lead mine in the world. This property is owned by a company, but the state of the metal market is such that it is impossible to get additional capital w i th which to develop the mine. It was, however, operating very actively during the war, but the muddle made by the then Prime Minister( MrW . M . Hughes) of the handling of all base metals extended to the lead-mining industry in the Northampton district. Prior to the establishment of the Australian Metal Exchange under the a»gis of the right honourable member, the mines were paying very well, but thereafter the owners were refused the right to send their concentrates abroad, as they had been doing hitherto, and were compelled to ship them to the metal exchange. They had to pay that body a certain amount for handling the ore which they did not wish it to handle, and they had also to meet the cost of shipment to and treatment at Cockle Creek. The result was that whereas previously they had been making profits, they now began to lose money. U p to date the mines of the whole Geraidton district have produced 209,958 tons of crude ore, from which 24,266 tons of metallic lead has been extracted, for a return of £595,000. The freight on the transport of the ore on the Midland railway from Geraidton' to Fremantle, a distance of about 300 miles, was £245,000, leaving the producers only £350,000 with which to pay the cost of mining, treatment, and . marketing. Naturally, those engaged in the leadmining industry were anxious to establish treatment works at Geraidton, and the then honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) asked .these questions in the House on 16th October, 19191. Whether, in view of its geographical position, base metal ores produced in Western Australia may be exported for treatment and sale to Great Britain without special application being necessary in each case, until such time as efficient and suitable treatment plants are available within the State? 2. Whether definite action will be taken -by the Government to give effective consideration to the interests of the producers lete works at Fremantle, and by shipping of metalliferous ores throughout Australia? The replies of ""the then Prime Minister( MrW . M . Hughes) were1. The policy, of the Government is to encourage the treatment of all ores within the Commonwealth. It has pursued this policy during the war, and, as a result, practically all the lead and copper, and a great proportion of tin, and other metals produced are now smelted and treated in Australia. The Government, however, recognise that the position of Western Australia, its geographical remoteness from the treatment plants of the East, impose 'handicaps upon the producer. While the war was raging this was inevitable; but now peace has come, means have to be found to deal fairly with the Western Australian producers. 2. The Government will, therefore, make every effort to arrange for the erection of treatment works in Western Australia, and in the meantime will allow the export of ore to Britain, under proper safeguards, <that cannot be treated here, so as to give the producer the London parity. Export to countries outside -Great Britain cannot be permitted. That district subsequently became part of the constituency of Kalgoorlie, and I , realizing that the present Government, like its predecessor, is a Nationalist Government, and that its Leader is in agreement with the former Prime Minister upon everything except ""the Prime Ministership, naturally expected that the promise made by Mr Hughesi n 1919 would be honoured by the Ministry of tp-day. Accordingly, I asked this question of the Prime Minister on 1st March of this yearAre lead ore concentrates from the Northampton and Surprise mines, in Western Australia, being sold in Holland at an increase of £3 per ton on the price paid by the obsolete Fremantle treatment works; if so, will he honour ti promise made by a previous National Government to establish up-to-date treatment works in Geraidton? I submit that in reply to the question submitted in 1919 by the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) a distinct promise was made by the Government to assist the Western Australian lead producers to establish treatment works. > In fact, the opinion prevailed that the Government would undertake the work. The answer to my question readI have seen the newspaper statement that the proprietors of the Surprise Mine have made a contract with a Belgian firm, but I have no information as to price. ' The price I quoted was correct. The lead producers in Western Australia cannot have their product treated at the obsoi t abroad they make £ 3 per ton more than if it were treated at the Fremantle plant. It is the duty of the Government to honour the promise made by a previous' Government and to establish lead-smelting works in Western Australia. The Prime Minister said that no such promise was madeI did not have this information then-and I acknowledge that at the time he was under the impression that no promise had been made. Some years ago the erection of co-operative smelters in Western Australia was suggested by the Commonwealth Government, but the project fell through owing to lack of Government support. It is my intention to again approach the Prime Minister on behalf of the lead-miners, who are working in small parties, and are doing a good deal to open up the country, in an endeavour to have an up-to-date smelter established. ber any idea of the probable cost? would receive the support of the honorton) regardless of the cost, because he favours the establishment of secondary industries. like to refer to the-question of light dues. with a good deal of what has been said able member does not intend to deal with ( Mr A.

That means that instead of having 32,950 persons on the land we actually have 98,850. The time has arrived when a thorough inquiry should be made into the settlement of soldiers throughout Australia. While the soldier settlement situation is as it is, we have very poor prospects of successfully settling immigrants. The Commonwealth Government has played the game fairly by the soldiers. It has contributed £2,980,000 free of interest to the soldiers. The position to-day, however, is such that we should thoroughly investigate it . know that some men are leaving their blocks, and in a week another man may be sent to take up the work. There are quite a number of very successful settlers, but others have not been so fortunate, and if they were compelled to meet their liabilities, independently of interest, within twelve months or even two years, they would be "" down and out."" We must get into touch with the State Governments with a view to instituting an inquiry: No one has time for wasters, but those who are triers, and are prepared to ""play the game,"" should be given a revaluation of their land, or concession in regard to interest, or something which will give them the heart to continue. There are hundreds who are in debt to such an extend that they have not any immediate chance of redeeming their liabilities. They lose heart, and at the first opportunity leave their selections. If the Government surrendered £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 in an endeavour to make soldier settlement a success, would it not be infinitely better than spending millions of pounds in directions that are not remunerative? I ask leave to continue my remarks at another time. Progress reported. Message recommending appropriation reported. That the House do now adjourn. A few days ago I had the pleasure of conferring with the Prime Minister( Mr Prime Minister will not enter into such Bruce) regarding an offer to purchase the "" Austral"" ships. I now hand to the Prime Minister an offer by the Australian Shipping Company, one of the largest 1 shipping companies in Australia, for the purchase of eleven ""Austral"" ships. It is a very large offer. This company desires to cable to London directly the Government has considered the matter. I ask that the Government give the matter urgent consideration. rather unusual step has been taken affecting Commonwealth property to the value I of hundreds of thousands of pounds. If it is the intention of the Government to dispose of these ships the House should be given an opportunity of considering the matter, and of expressing its disapproval, should it so desire. It is astounding to me that a private member, no matter how eminent, how respectable, how honourable he may be, should bring to this Chamber an offer for the purchase of portion of a Commonwealth utility. Is this the manner in which the Commonwealth ships are to be disposed of? I view, with sorrow, the outlook for public life in Australia if the' affairs of the country are to be conducted in this way. There is a principle underlying this matter. I do not insinuateI would be the last to do so-that there is anything wrong with the bona fides of the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks), but I do say that this is a most dangerous precedent to establish, and I cannot allow the matter to pass without entering my protest against what is being done. If the ships are to be disposed of, the straight and honest course is for the Government to call tenders in an open way. in this Chamber in order that the whole thing might be open and straightforward. for the Government to take if it intends to dispose of these vessels is to advertise that they are for sale, to call for tenders, and to allow the tenders to be considered upon their merits. To follow this other practice would mean that a particularly proposedfavoured individual would be able to purchase, the. ships, while other persons in the community would not be given the opportunity of doing so.
