Since then the Prime Minister and other Ministers have notified honourable members who sit in this corner of any intention of the Government to alter the order of business as set down. I should like to know why that procedure was departed from on this occasion. I do not know, of course, whether honourable members who sit opposite were informed that the Government intended to alter the order of business. It is the usual custom-and it should be followed for reasons of courtesy, if for no other reasons-to notify the different parties in the House of any intention to make a change in the order of business.

It is not fair that the order of business should be changed at the mere whim of the Government and without any notification to honourable members generally. If that course is persisted in, and no adequate reasons are given to show that there is a clear necessity for the alteration, I shall continue to call for the division of the House on the question whenever the occasion arises. ter) [3.23] -The decision to postpone the consideration of Order of the Day No. 1 was only made this morning. The Government expected to have returned to it certain agreements signed by representatives of the State Governments, which would have made possible the completion of this item of business. A few technicalities have arisen in connection with the schedule to the bill, which has rendered it impracticable to proceed at once with the measure. Honourable members will realize that it is difficult for the Government to keep to a programme when it has to consult other Governments in different parts of the Commonwealth. It was only known this morning after the mail was delivered that certain signed copies of the necessary agreement had not come to hand. The only notification that the Government intended to alter the. order of business was given to the Leader Oi the Opposition. ( Mr Lyons). It was due to him that he should know, for the postponement made it necessary for him to be ready to proceed at once with the discussion of Order of the Day No. 2.

Had the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) asked for one to be posted to his Sydney address it should have been delivered to him yesterday. The Government has no desire to be discourteous, but it cannot be expected that it shall notify every honourable member of comparatively minor changes in the business paper. Question resolved in the affirmative. Debate resumed from the 26th of June, (vide page 3138), on motion by Mr Tliat the bill be now read a second time. orable members of the Opposition are in agreement with the general principles of this bill. Eor some time past I have advocated the taking of the course laid down in the bill. The main difference between the members of the Premiers Conference and the Federal Opposition leaders who attended the conference was on the question whether the proposed conversion should be compulsory or voluntary. The main object of the Opposition leaders in attending the conference was to induce it to accept the voluntary principle, and as this was accepted there is no reason why the members of the Opposition should not give general support to this measure. I have contended for a long time past that if Australia was to get out of her financial difficulties, sacrifices would have to be made by all sections of the community. At no time have I even suggested that any section should be freed gested that those who receive interest",14,Order Of Business

Consequently I appeal to the bondholders of Australia to make their contribution to the general sacrifiqe. Many months ago, when I asked the representatives of the Commonwealth Public Service to accept a reduction in their rates of pay, I made my appeal solely on the ground of the necessity of the case. I pointed out that extremely critical financial conditions were inevitable in the Commonwealth unless prompt steps were taken to avoid them. Those conditions are still inevitable, unless this, the period of rising prices which Ausand the other measures involved in the agreement reached at the Premiers Conference, are speedily passed. It was only on the ground of the urgent necessity of the case that the then Acting-Prime Minister( Mr Fenton) and I appealed to the Public Service to agree to a sacrifice. It is on the same ground that our pensioners are to be asked to accept the sacrifice which they will be called upon to make. It is objectionable to all of us to have to take steps to reduce pensions; but we realize that the alternative is a complete failure to pay any pensions at all. It is only by calling upon all sections of the community to make sacrifices that we can get back to sound conditions. It is in order that we may get back to sound conditions that we are appealing to the bondholders throughout Australia voluntarily to convert their holdings, and so accept a share of the financial burden which is to-day resting so heavily upon Australia. I am prepared to ask them to make this sacrifice because I believe that if a substantial contribution is not made by all sections of the community now, very much greater sacrifices will be demanded of them at a later stage. This Mr Lyons. has been proved by experience. If the proposals agreed upon at the conference in Melbourne in August of last year had been given effect, the burden laid upon the individual to right the finances of the Commonwealth would have been infinitely lighter than the sacrifice which will now be required of every person in the Commonwealth. While I am supporting the appeal to bondholders to bear their fair share of the burden now, I regret very much that in certain quarters a most unfair attack is being made upon them. I remind the House that, on every occasion when we approached the loan market, the Government laid down the conditions upon which the money should be made available by the people. The success of previous loan operations benefited Commonwealth financiers directly, and also was of temporary benefit to wage-earners as. the result of the employment created by the carrying out of public works. I also remind those who criticize adversely the bondholders that, during tralia enjoyed for several years, no representations were made that bondholders should participate in the prosperity of the country by being paid a higher interest return upon their investment. It follows, therefore, that since their interest return was fixed, while other sections of the community enjoyed the benefits due to a succession of prosperous years, they were making a definite sacrifice. To-day, when the position is reversed, and when the general price level for all commodities is declining, the first demand made in some quarters is that bondholders should be called upon to make another contribution. 40 years. they will be expected to accept a lower rate of interest for a period of upwards of 30 years. And, after all, who are the bondholders ? is right.

29,Mr Lyons,"The honourable memberthe bondholders represent the people of this country, and a3 I have shown, they have already made a substantial sacrifice which was not demanded of other sections of the community in recent years. The bondholders are either business men, primary producers, or salary or wage earners. As citizens of the Commonwealth they have already suffered, in common with other sections of the community, because of the existing depression. Now they are to be asked to make a further sacrifice. While I am prepared to appeal to them to do this, it is as well that thoy should know how far they are to be asked to go. In the first place they will be required to accept a lower rate of interest on their investments, and in lieu of existing securities, some of which mature at relatively early dates, will be asked to accept new securities for substantially longer periods. arrangement indicates that the bondholders will certainly be bearing their fair share of the burden which Australia has to carry. our internal debt, securities amounting to £170,000,000 are held by the banks. sent their depositors. The same may be said of insurance companies, which have invested a large portion of their funds in Commonwealth securities. While the figures quoted by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) show how existing securities are held, they do not indicate the f u l l extent of the spread of investments in Commonwealth loans. have invested £35,000,000. suggest, are much more widespread than is indicated in the statement made by tbe honourable member for Maribyrnong. A very substantial proportion of the Commonwealth debt securities is held by small investors. In view of these facts the Australian bondholders, as such, should not be the subject of condemnation by certain honourable members of this House. We should also bear in mind that, after this conversion operation has been carried out, we shall be obliged to make further appeals to investors, to finance the Commonwealth. If we pass legislation which is unpalatable to those who, ordinarily, subscribe to Commonwealth loans, and if , further, there is adverse criticism of investors as a class, future appeals for financial aid to carry on Commonwealth activities may not be entirely satisfactory. We should keep these matters in mind. In contrast to the sacrifices required of public servants and pensioners in the carrying out of this plan to rehabilitate the Commonwealth, bondholders will be making a real and a permanent sacrifice. I hope that we are all looking forward to the time-if we adopt the right course now we may, I believe, expect our realizations to materialize-whe n the finances of the Commonwealth will be substantially improved. There will then be a demand for relief from taxation and the other sacrifices that have been made, but there will be no relief whatever for bondholders This whose interest return on investments will be definitely reduced for the currency of the new loan. Take, for example, the 5J per cent, stocks maturing in 1934. The investor in those stocks looked forward to a permanent return of £5 53. for each £100 invested, but under this scheme his return will be £4 Is. 4d. per cent., and that reduced rate will be payable'for a period of 30 years. that it will be a permanent reduction ? guarantee, because it fixes the rate for a period of 30 years. tain rate of interest for a period of years. loan in a moment. There is no escaping the fact that the reduced rate will be definitely fixed. ' I hope that, as near as may be practicable, it will be made impossible for any further reduction to be made; that the sacrifice having been made, no additional contribution shall be asked of the investor. It is my desire that the measure as it passes Parliament shall be acceptable to the investor, so that we may approach a? near as possible to a 100 per cent, voluntary conversion. The attempt should, therefore, be made to popularize it.

I am hopeful, however, that we shall be able in the near future to restore to the worker a proportion of what he is now being asked to forgo; while under this proposal we may lay it down definitely that nothing shall be returned to the bondallowed to bondholders to notify dissent. holder. I am merely advancing what I regard as a reasonable proposition;' that is, that some slight restitution be made to the bondholder to lessen the severity of the sacrifice that he will have to make not for only one or two years, but for 10, 20, 30 or 40 years. If something of thatkind were done, I am sure that it would help to make the conversion a success. I want to see it a success, and I feel sure in their country, and are prepared to that the Treasurer is like-minded. I am also anxious that we shall not do anything that may have a tendency to destroy the possibility of our obtaining new capital in future years. The provisions of the bill are largely technical, and it is not necessary for me to discuss the details that have been so exhaustively explained by the Treasurer. But I suggest-and again my object is to make the conversion a success-that ithe period in which a bondholder may declare that he proposes to dissent from converting be extended from a fortnight to at least one month. that will fall due in the meantime; does the honourable gentleman propose that that shall be paid at the old rates. that make ? The existing rates of interest are to be paid until the bill becomes law. time. date on which the conversion will take effect. Surely sufficient time should be allowed within which investors may make up their minds to convert voluntarily! I wish to make it certain that, when the operation is completed, we shall be able to point to voluntary action on the part of the people. I do not wish it to their be assumed that a very large proportion of bondholders have assented because they have not dissented. I prefer to give to bondholders the fullest opportunity to make their assent known to the Commonwealth. The Treasurer has pointed out that in a majority of cases, when conversions have been undertakezi in England, a fortnight, and occasionally less,, has been allowed. I remind the House that that has not always been the case. The honourable gentleman himself mentioned the conversion of £154,000,000 in 1830, on which occasion one month was If that period could be allowed in England, I see no reason for its disallowance here. Whatever argument there might be in favour of shortening the period in Great Britain, there is no argument in favour of shortening, it in Australia at the present time. We want the bondholders, by converting voluntarily, to show that they have confidence accept their share of the load that has to be borne. It is advisable to make that demonstration, for the benefit of our creditors overseas. By inducing voluntary conversion we shall improve our credit both in Australia and overseas. I hope, therefore, that the Treasurer will accept my suggestion, and that we shall make a special combined effort to induce investors to acknowledge the slight concession thus made to them by converting voluntarily in the largest possible number. There are one or two sections affected by the bill who will receive special consideration. First of all there are the savings banks, in regard to which either the dates of maturity will remain unaltered or be fixed by agreement with the Treasurer. I endorse that proposal, but point out that it applies only to State and Commonwealth, savings banks. In Tasmania there are two savings banks outside those of the State and the Commonwealth. They are truly savings banks. Their operations are carried on",17,Theodobe

45,Mr Lyons,"There is a particularin exactly the same way as are those of the State and the Commonwealth savings hanks; their management is similar; and no fees are paid to their directors. As an ex-Treasurer of Tasmania, I know the assistance that these banks have given to the Government of that State in past years. I believe that to-day they have something like £900,000 invested in Commonwealth stock, which will come under the provisions of this loan conversion. If they are not to receive similar treatment to that granted to other savings banks their operations will be considerably hampered. I hope that the Government will be able to extend those concessions to them. Certain overseas trading funds were invested in the 1930 conversion loan specifically because it was a short-term one. man surely does not ask that special consideration should be extended to those who were really escaping current obligations by taking that course? vided for in the bill, and I take no exception to consideration being given to them.

It is such a short time since we gave those people guarantees as to rates of interest and the redemption of the loan, that some special provision should be made in this bill with regard to them. I raised the subject at the Premiers Conference, but the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) thought that it would introduce too many difficulties. I now £3 10s. per £100 on the other two secsubmit it to the Government. Concessions are being granted to those who invested overseas trading funds in the £28,000,000 conversion, because it is they are trustee banks, a short-term loan.

If people were forced into the loan, that is all the more reason why their case should receive special consideration. I know instances in which workers who had saved a few hundred pounds took that money from the savings banks and invested it in the £28,000,000 loan purely out of patriotism. Many of those persons are now out of employment, and when this conversion is effected they will not receive their money as they anticipated, next year. employees to contribute to the loan, taking the amount off their weekly wages. country's call hundreds of thousands of persons with small means invested in the loan. It is different in the case of the ten, fifteen and twenty year loans, into which investors went with their eyes open, knowing that their capital would be locked up for those periods. I think that we could safely exclude from applies to all the provisions of this bill the whole of the £28,000,000 loan. Those who could afford to do so would reinvest in the new conversion, while cases of hardship would be met automatically. Actuarial calculations indicate that special consideration is not being given to the holders of stock in that loan. Actually the premium on a 6 per cent. £100 bond amounts to 18s.

The conditions of the conversion loan should be made as fair as possible, so that conversion will be made if the bondwe may confidently appeal to their patriotism, and remove any grounds for suspicion of coercion. Honourable members in the ministerial corner may smile when I speak of the patriotism of bondholders. I remind them that the bondholders who will be asked to convert their stockare ordinary Australian citizens, who in the past have proved their patriotism. put their patriotism to the test. Why, therefore, exempt them from any sacrifice? member listened attentively to my remarks, he would know that I have not suggested that the bondholders should be exempted from any sacrifice. I am one with the Government in asking them to make a sacrifice; but I ask, in addition, that the conditions of the loan shall be such that we may be able to appeal to their patriotism. If we do that, I am confident that the appeal will not be in vain. I agree with the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) that the success of this conversion loan would have a wonderfuleffect upon Australia's credit, both at home and abroad, and that is what we need. The Treasurer said that while he hoped that the action proposed to be taken would ensure a lower rate of interest for Government stocks prevailing for some definite period, and that in consequence interest rates generally would fall, he could give no guarantee that that would be the case. Obviously the Treasurer cannot give us such a guarantee. bondholders can Only by restoring confidence can we offer any prospect of interest rates being permanently lowered. When an investor has confidence in that in which he invests, he is prepared to take a lower rate of interest than when he is investing in something which carries a risk with it.

78,Mr Hughes,"Some Commonwealth bondholder complain if he is put in theof the plan again into the melting pot. That would be disastrous because time is the essence of the matter; delay would inevitably mean default. I am concerned, as I am sure are the Treasurer and all others, with what the effect of this plan may be upon the future -thi s plan which, in spite of its imperfections, its audacity, is the only remedy available for the acute stage of the evils from which we suffer. But its reactions will almost certainly bo far-reaching. It seems to me that the adoption of the plan will close the door for internal loans for many years. Whether interest rates will rise or fall as the years go on no man can say. Professor Giblin holds that there is a tendency towards lower rates of interest, and that, consequently, these converted bonds will gradually rise to par, or even be qxioted at a premium. It may be that this is a possibility which the future holds for the bondholders, though it seems a somewhat remote one. The immediate effect of this conversion must be the very opposite. During the last conversion loan the Government made an appeal to the patriotism of the bondholders and the public, who were told that patriotism, in the circumstances, meant lending their money to the State. For many years the impression will remain that such patriotism has been but ill-roquitcd. In the dim and distant future another generation may arise from whose minds the bitter memory of what is being done now will have faded, but for a long time to come people will be most reluctant to lend money to the State. Therefore, as I have said, the door against internal borrowing is closed. Nor does the overseas market seem precisely inviting. Though much is expected of this plan, even more must come of it if it is to eifect the rehabilitation of Ausof government of the State in which they tralia. Otherwise our position will be hard, indeed, seeing that there is a possibility of both internal and external borrowing being cut off. thing for us. Governments will then have to attend to their own affairs. is in favour of a non-borrowing policy when it applies to other people, but if the honourable member wanted money himself, he would see great merits in a loan. I can see no possibility of Australia being completely rehabilitated without the aid of a substantial loan. How such a loan is to be obtained I do not know, but there is very little prospect of obtaining an internal loan. I read with much interest, but with little satisfaction, the lengthy debate at the Premiers Conference on the subject of the conversion of tax-free securities. I gathered that those who were demanding differential treatment for tax-free bondholders were moved by the fact that it would be a breach of contract, unless immunity from taxation was preserved. This seems to be a very lopsided sort of logic. The whole plan rests on a breach of contract. There is a refusal to pay the rates of interest agreed upon, and to repay the principal on the due dates. These things go to the very root of the agreement; they are of the essence of the contract. There is a third term to some of the contracts; that the interest shall be free from taxation. It is'contended that this immunity shall be preserved. But why ? The Commonwealth loans are free from State taxation, and if we are to be told that one term is so sacred that it may uot be varied, while others-thos e fixing the rate of interest and determining the date of repayment of the principal-ar e not sacred, we have a new theory of contract, a revised version of sanctity of contract to which hitherto we have been strangers. In my opinion, both classes of bondholders should be treated in exactly the same way. I protest against the preferential treatment of persons who, apparently, bought the securities in order to avoid paying any taxation whatever. They have been contributing nothing whatever to the cost live. What greater wrong could a citizen of any State commit than accept all the benefits of government, and contribute nothing to its cost? be a good granted immunity from taxation, and will enjoy it only until the date on which the bonds would have matured. course, the wrong would have gone on for ever.

The bondholders who lent money to the States and to the Commonwealth did so on the condition that on the date of maturity of the loan the principal would be paid back. ""WhatI wish to know from the Treasurer is what is meant exactly by the term "" free from income tax "" ? What is income tax? Is it a tax so-called, or is it, in effect, a tax upon income? It is evident that if the bondholder, with his reduced interest, is to be exposed to the taxation assaults of those who seem to put no limit on their demands, then, indeed, his lot will be a hard one. Are we to assume that any tax upon incomes, whether it be so designated or not, is to be regarded as income tax, and so will not apply to the earnings of the converted bonds ? nated or not, such taxes will not apply to the converted bonds within the limits of this plan. pletely sure on that point, in order that when we come to discuss the bill in committee, we may know where we standso that he who runs may read. vision has been put in because it was thought impossible that any more income tax could be imposed. say that. The honourable member perhaps under-estimates the powers of the Government in this respect. There is one other point. The bondholder has been promised that on the due date his capital will be returned to him in full. The bondholders whose loans are maturing this year and next yearincluding bondholders in the £28,000,000 loan-wil l have to pay much heavier taxation than they did when they lent their money. The value of 'the bond will be reduced. A bond with a face value of £100 will be saleable on the market at £70 or £80. Justice, and due regard for the interests of the bondholder, as well as of the State, demand that for purposes of taxation the bond shall be taken at its face value. That surely is not too much to ask. If the bonds are not taken at their face value, what becomes of this contract ? gentleman referring to the payment of ordinary taxes? Bonds are accepted now by the Government for probate purposes. should be accepted at their face value for income tax purposes. great inconvenience to the Commonwealth Treasury. about the unfortunate bondholders?

100,Mr Hughes,"There is much logicclear that when the bondholder, who is entitled under his contract to be paid £100 on the 15th day of December of this year, offers it on that date as payment lor taxes he will be credited only with what that bond will fetch in the open market-abou t £70 or £80. That will be very inconvenient to the bondholders. As I have said, I accept this scheme because, so we have been told, it is the only alternative to default. I accept the whole plan with great reluctance, and in respect of some aspects of its incidence I accept it with reservations which I shall indicate at the proper time. I shall support this measure because it is vital to the success Of the plan; but I ask the Treasurer to make it abundantly clear to the bondholders of Australia that there is no alternative, that they must convert their bonds, because there is not at the command of the Government enough money for their redemption, nor for the payment of interest at present rates. I do not agree with the proposal of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) that the new bonds should be used for the payment of income taxation. If that proposal were adopted, and bonds were legal tender for income tax purposes, it Would be logical that bonds should be accepted for payment of customs duties and every other form of government taxation. It would mean that we could tender in payment of government debts, bonds bearing interest instead of, as hitherto, the ordinary Australian notes, and make them currency bearing interest. This legislation when passed will entail a great sacrifice on the part of some people, but no sacrifice at all on the part of others. There is not the slightest question that it will bring about innumerable anomalies.. I have with me a statement supplied by Mr E. Dyason, the president of the Economic Council of Australia, which shows that the return to the bondholder after his bonds have been converted will be, in many cases, over 8 per cent. This statement assumes that the conversion is to be effected as at the 15th June, 1931. Any per3f per cent, stock, why should it not son who on that day buys converted bonds will obtain a return of at least 7 per cent; who buy to-day at £77 10s., and get a net and in some instances over 8 per cent. For example, bonds converted for seven years and bought on the 15th Juno, 1931, will show a return of £7 7s. 5d. The return diminishes as the period of the conversion increases, and on loans converted for 30 years the return will be £5 4s. l d . A person who, on the 15th June, 1931, buys a £100 5£ per cent, bond converted for seven years, at £S2 5s. will receive a return of £7 7s. 5d. A 5\ per cent, bond purchased on 15th June, 1931, at the current rate of £80 will show a return of £8 6s. l i d . , and a 5f per cent, bond purchased on the 15th June, 1931, at the current rate of £80 12s. 6d., will show a return of £8 6s. 9d.; while if 1931 bonds are bought now at their current price of £77 10s. they will return for seven yeai'3 a still larger amount of interest. The position of those who buy bonds at the present time is totally different from that of those who, last December, invested in the £28,000,000 loan. The small bondholders in that loan were forced to pay £100 for a £100 bond and w'ill receive a return of slightly over 4 per cent. I would point out that the current price of a £100 bond in the 5% per cent, loan maturing in 1931 is £77 10s., which represents a further fall of £5 For every £1 decrease in the price of the bond there is an additional interest return of 4s. 5d. or a total of £1 2s. Id., on the fall in value of £5. Therefore, the net return to the purchaser of such a bond will be increased from £7 7s. 5d. to £8 9s. 6d. That does serious injustice to the man who bought last December. I regard as an anomaly clause 13 which provides that^Where the holder of existing securities bearing interest at the rate of 3f per cent, per annum or less satisfies the Treasurer that he acquired the securities before the fourth day of August, 1914, the rate of interest on conversion of such securities into new securities Shall not be reduced below the rate of 3 per cent, per annum. Those who bought 3f per cent, stock below par after the 4th August, 1914, will not get the advantage of this provision. Their stock will be reduced on an actuarial calculation to £2 6s. 6d. per cent If the market price is to be taken into consideration in the case of 3 per cent or also be considered in the case of those result of £8 9s. 6d. on their bond? [Quorum formed.]",24,Theodobe
101,Mr Crouch (Corangamite) [4.36],"I call attention also to' clause 17, under whicli bills discounted by banks are to bear a discount at 4 per cent, only, whereas private holders are to suffer a reduction of 22^ per cent. I do not like the discrimination. The ordinary borrower is doing as much as the banks to help the country at this time, and where there is a general sacrifice to be made, I think, the banks should also bear the 22^ per cent, reduction. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Lyons) referred to clause 16. Undoubtedly the conversion loan raised by the honourable member when ho was Acting Treasurer was in the nature of a forced loan. People were forced by their banks and their employers to subscribe. So were a number of loaus raised by the Hughes-Cook Government, Sir Joseph Cook, as Treasurer, having intimated that unless people subscribed to the war loans they would be forced to pay double the amount of income tax. The result was that many uirwilling investors took up bonds. Clause 16 providesWhere tlie holder of existing securities satisfies the Treasurer that, owing to exchange difficulties, the securities were purchased by him with overseas trade money as a short term investment, new securities in exchange for that will give a return of not more than the existing securities may be issued to him redeemable on such date or dates as the Treasurer approves, but otherwise conforming with the provisions of this act. I do not like this special provision to enable holders of securities to have their bonds redeemed at 6 per cent, for two years, on such dates as the Treasurer approves. These holders put their money into the last conversion loan, not because of their patriotism, but because they wished to avoid paying 30 per cent, exchange. That is specifically admitted in the clause. They were hopeful that before the two years expired the exchange rate might decrease. member has indicated, the persons interested are mostly American oil and film corporations. sideration be extended to them? it should be. The greater part of the £28,000,000 loan was subscribed at 6 per cent, with a view to withdrawing it in 1932. These bondholders will not come under the dissent clause and run the-risk of taxation up to 22% per cent. I cannot see why the Treasurer should try to help these overseas interests who gambled on the exchange rate coming down before 1932 when their 6 per cent, bonds would be redeemable. It is natural that they will not be anxious between now and 1932 to pay taxation up to 22-^ per cent, on their interest earnings, but I see no reason why under clause 13 special consideration should be extended to them compared with other members of the community who invested, or were forced to invest, in the £2S,000,000 loan. Clause 24 providesNew securities bearing interest at the rate of 4 per cent, or 3f per cent, per annum, and having fixed dates of maturity, shall be accepted by the Commonwealth at par in payment of Commonwealth estate duty. I do not know why this concession should be confined to 4 per cent, and 3$ per cent, stock. Why should not 3 per cent, tax free securities also be accepted in payment of estate duty? They were purchased on the understanding that there would be no taxation upon them, and the holders of the 3 per cent, stocks are now to be forced to convert them into bonds £2 6s. 6d. per centum. Yet' the stock will not be accepted in payment of probate duties. I trust that in committee tlie Treasurer will have this anomaly putright. Except for the general principle of compulsion with which I agree-and I am sorry that the bondholder is given power to dissent-the measure is one entirely for consideration in committee. I am of opinion that we are making a great mistake in converting at 4 per cent., because this re-adjustment of the internal debt and all the economies that are proposed, are only the first steps of a series that will be necessary. Having studied the financial obligations very closely during the last fortnight, I do not think that we can afford to pay 4 per cent., if we are to meet our interest obligations overseas, as, indeed, we must. The overseas debt is not on the same basis as the domestic debt. The whole of the money we borrowed has been expended for the benefit of the Australian people, including the internal bondholders; loans from overseas aided our development and augmented our",25,Theodobe

I say, deliberately, that even this reduction of interest, and all the economies and cuts that are proposed, w ill not be sufficient to get us out of our difficulties. Perhaps, however, it is wise to reduce the interest to .only 4 per cent, for the time being. We shall then be able to observe the effect of this plan of prosperity.

That expenditure includes the appalling sum of £S5,000,000 for interest, sinking fund, exchange and economies unon our general unemployment. It w ill be seen, therefore, that it is necessary, even in the interests of the bondholders, to reduce the Government interest b ill ; unless that be done and other economies be effected, there w ill be no alternative to default. What default would mean is well summed up in the following paragraph from the report of the under-treasurers to the Loan Councili n February last:face the The evils which would follow such default would be immeasurably greater than any hardwhich the nation would be asked to face in order to restore Australia to a sound Insolvency would be the order of the day. would be general. Recovery The holders of fixed money claims have the f l (7i per cent.) and may have suffered reduction of such income as they derive from other sources. But their incomes from fixed money claims have not been reduced to the same degree as other income elements.

106,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [4.55]. Ships,"That is a succinct statement of what : would' be the result to' Australia if it went ing to get down to a 4 per cent, basis over the"" precipice of default. experts recommended a reduction of 15' per ceut. in' the net return on fixed money claims. I assume that the Melbourne conference considers that it has not exceeded that recommendation inasmuch as it intended a 15 per cent, rednction from the net returns after the 7\ percent, special tax recently imposed by this Parliament had been deducted. As the Government intends to relieve the bondholders of that 7£ per cent, tax the gross reduction of 22^ per cent, conforms to the recommendation of the experts. whole of the proposed economies, including the reduction of interest, will meet only one-third of the estimated deficit for the next year. That should impress upon the minds of all of us the very difficult position of Australia and the absolute necessity for the steps which are being taken to promote its financial recovery. The success of the huge conversion loan, whether on a w'aVe of patriotism' or because of a popular sense of the urgent necessity for a rednction of interest to a 4 per cent, basis, would be very much less harmful to future conversions than penal taxation which discriminated against bondholders. Such taxation would have a very bad effect indeed, and would make future conversions possible only at rates of interest sufficiently high to cover the extra taxation and the risk of more. The bondholder would practically have to insure against the possibility of additional penal taxation, and would determine not to invest his money in government stock unless he received a rate of interest that would warrant the risk. If this conversion succeeds, as I believe it will, we sliall have until 1938 before the shortest term bonds included in the consolidated stock will mature. We all hope that by then we shall be able to look back on the depression as an unpleasant memory; but even if we have completely regained prosperity by 1938 and confidence has been restored, that will not necessarily mean that the consolidated stock will be back to a par basis. The Treasurer recognized that, and stated it very frankly towards the end of his speech on Eriday last. We Mr Paterson. cannot overtook the fact that in attemptThe we are aiming at haM per cent, below the' present world's rate for countries who'se credit is high. The credit of Canada, for instance, stands very high; yet its recent: conversion loan was effected on a basis of 4£ per cent. In endeavouring to get the interest below the rate ruling in countries whose credit is high, there is' always a danger of the stock being at a discount, but I recognize our desperate position and our incapacity to pay more than an average of 4 per cent, to our own bondholders, especially at the present The time. Therefore, I certainly shall not criticize the extent of the reduction that is proposed. If the new consolidated stock is spread over the ten different maturing dates proposed in the bill, one-tenth of the £556,000,000 will mature on dates ranging from the first in 1938 to the last in 1961, and bondholders a portion of whose bonds mature on the first date of maturity may have considerable holdings maturing later.. That would mean that a bondholder whose holdings were spread over the whole period would have only one-tenth of his holding in the short term securities maturing in 1938, and nine-tenths maturing later. It would be to the interest of the bondholders holding stocks at different dates of maturity to support a conversion loan in 1938, because if the conversion were not a success the value of the nine-tenths of his securities would depreciate. Having holdings spread over the ten different dates will, I contend, be a factor in supporting the market when any one of these currencies mature. When nine-tenths of a bondholder's bonds are spread over the remaining currencies, it will be to his interest to help in making each conversion a success, and no danger of anything in the nature of a slump .should occur. appeal? suggest that it would be possible in this or any other country for bonds to maintain a par level with a rate of interest lower than that prevailing in other countries ; but the circumstances I have mentioned would, I think, be a factor in success at periodical conversions.",27,National Income And Government Expenditure
107,Mr Gabb,There may be a recurring,28,National Income And Government Expenditure
108,Mr Paterson,"Yes. I do notI t seems that a reduction in taxation upon governmental bonds at some future time, when conditions were sufficiently prosperous to enable that to be done, would also assist in strengthening the market, and be some recognition of the fine spirit which we expect to be shown by the bondholders in the proposed conversion. ""While every section of the community hopes that prosperity will soon return, wages revert to their old level, and pensions be restored, bondholders are being asked to make sacrifices over a period ranging up to 30 years. Clause 20 of the bill provides thatThe interest on new securities exchanged for existing securities (other than new securities which in accordance with tlie provisions of section fourteen of this Act are free from Commonwealth and State Income Tax) shall be free(o) from the Commonwealth further tax of seven and one-half per centum imposed by the Income Tax Act (No. 2) 1030; (6) from any income tax, under the law of the Commonwealth, further or in a higher degree than the taxes (other than the further tax specified in the last preceding paragraph) levied on existing securities respect to the proposal that the assent of at the commencement of this Act ; and (c) from all income tax under the law of a State. I understand that that clause does not refer merely to immunity from special taxation of interest on government stocks such as the proposed tax of 3s. 6d. in the f l , provided in the bill introduced recently, but that during the currency of the present consolidated stock, no additional income tax of any kind is to be imposed. I should like to be clear as to whether the unemployment taxation, such as that now being levied in some States on the basis of income, and which for that reason can be regarded as a form of income taxation, is included in this promise of immunity from State income tax. As this Parliament, like all other Parliaments, has no power to bind its successors, it seems necessary to add a clause to the existing financial agreement to insure bondholders from suffering any disability which may arise as the result of the action of future Parliaments in this respect. Such an amendment would require the unanimous consent of the whole of the parties to the agreement before additional taxation could be imposed upon the bondholders. As this Parliament cannot bind future ParliaT ments, it is essential that some such provision should be made in the financial agreement to which the Commonwealth Government and State Governments are parties. If that were done the danger would be overcome, as it would then be necessary to secure the unanimous consent of all governments concerned before additional taxation could be imposed. an amendment of the Constitution? ment would be necessary. It would simply mean utilizing the new provision of the Constitution adopted at the last referendum in. November, 192S. A clause safeguarding the bondholder from additional taxation, if added to the existing financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, could not be amended unless the seven governments concerned concur. I now wish to say a word or two with those bondholders who do not dissent shall be taken for granted. I say, quite frankly, that in the circumstnnces, I regard that as a iustifiable form of pressure, and that without such a provision the success of tlie proposed conversion would be impossible I should like to see the proposed loan regarded in other countries as a successful voluntary effort on the part of Australian bondholders to do their duty in saving their country from insolvency. The success of the conversion is bound up in the proposal for assuming the assent of those who do not actually dissent. I believe that if a bondholder were required to take active steps on his own initiative to reduce his interest returns a voluntary conversion would be successful only in Utopia. But in this instance inaction is to be regarded as equivalent to passive acquiescence. Inertia on the part of a bondholder will be a means of achieving complete success. If the bondholder does nothing, the loan should be an unqtialified success in a very short time. for the exercise of any discretion on the part of the bondholder?",28,National Income And Government Expenditure

The Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) quoted British precedence for the adoption of the principle that silence means consent. He also quoted one in stance in which that practice was departed fro m and failure resulted. I can imagine the effect upon British investors of a successful voluntary conversion loan in this country. British bondholders, reading a cablegram reporting that the Australian Conversion Loan had heen an overwhelming success, that 95 per cent, of the bondholders had agreed to voluntarily sacrifice 22$ per cent, of their interest in order to ensure their country's solvency, would ascribe the result to a great patriotic impulse throughout the Commonwealth. country that could carry out such a huge conversion, and was anxious and determined to overcome its financial difficulty, was one in which they could invest their money other hand had the Government decided to introduce a bill based upon a drastic compulsory reduction of interest the effect upon our overseas bondholders would be entirely different. If the Commonwealth was breaking its contract by arbitrarily reducing interest, it would soon be thought that the Government might treat its overseas bondholders in the same wa'y. I believe that Parliament is adopting the right method in this connection. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) alluded to the desirability of taxpayers being permitted to use bonds for the payment of taxation. I can realize the reluctance of the Treasurer to adopt such a proposal, because, as the right honourable member pointed out, the Commonwealth bonds are now worth only from £78 to £80. One can easily visualize a taxpayer liable for a considerable amount in taxation spending £78 or £80 to purchase a £100 bond with which to liquidate a taxation liability of that amount. One indirect effect of such a scheme might be to increase the demand for bonds for that purpose, with the result that values would rise. While. I understand the reluctance of W h a t can he do that any Treasurer making provision for even exceptional cases in a bill of this nature, there are certain classes of bondholders whose position deserves special consideration by Parliament. Of coursj, every law pinches somewhere; but if there is one class of people more than another which we should try to protect from injustice, it is those old oeople who have denied themselves little comforts and pleasures during their working lives in order to provide for their old use without relying upon the public purse to help them out. stuff. I shall quote some hard figures. I have a tremendous admiration for old people of the class to which I refer. Theirs is a spirit of rugged independence which, I fear, is dying out. The TreasThey would say that a urer said on Friday that the Government would make special provision to meet the case of small bondholders who had £1,000 or less invested, so that the maturity dates would not be spread over the whole with confidence. On the period. But there are many old couples with more than £1,000 invested, whose income is less than that of old-age pensioners, who merit every consideration.. I have received a letter from one such person, from which I intend to quote. This personI shall not mention his name, but he represents a distinct class of investors-hold s at present £400 worth of 6 per cent, bonds maturing in 1932, £300 worth of 5 i per cent, bonds maturing in 1939, and £600 of 5J per cent, maturing in 1933. In addition, he has £700 in the State Savings Bank, which is yielding him 4 per cent. The. interest from all these sources amounts to £98 per annum, and is his and his wife's sole source of income. He writes as follows:Under present conditions this income is insufficient to meet my needs, and I have to live partially upon my capital which, of course, is steadily shrinking. My intention when taking up the bonds was that they would mature in time to meet my needs. But with tbe new conversionI am now 75 years old, and not likely to live long enough to see them mature if converted-the interest would not be sufficient to keep me and my wife.

These people require their money. It is not fair to put them in the position of having to dissent, although it would, apparently, he of advantage to be a dissentient. We should, if we can, avoid forcing people into that position. It should be possible for them to say to the Treasurer: ""We are willing to convert provided that the Government will, in our special circumstances, enable us to redeem our bonds in 1932."" I wish to say a few words about the tables in the appendices to the bill. They are most useful for showing the extent of the premium or discount which various bondholders may hope, or fear, to get. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr early days of the war, a circular, issued Yates) said, with truth, the other day, that the majority of the people who invested in the 1930 loan took up 6 per cent, stock for two years in preference to 5f per cent, stock for ten years, or 5-J per cent, stock for twenty years. Buti t will be seen by reference to the tables to this bill that those who invested in the 6 per cent, stock will get a premium in the new stock of something less than 1 per cent., whereas those who invested their money for ten or twenty years will get a premium of £3 10s. The advantage is, therefore, not necessarily with those who invested their money for 1 the shorter period. In conclusion, I wish to refer briefly to the additional relief which we may expect in our interest payments if the negotiations at present proceeding in regard to oversea war debts are successful. We should be very grateful to the United States of America and to the Mother Country, from which we all sprang, for the additional help that may be given to us. I sincerely hope that it will be possible to give effect to President Hoover's plan. The little country from which we, or our ancestors, came has stood up to her war obligations in a way which entitles her to the admiration of the world. Hitherto she has met her war obligations and paid her way despite default, or partial default, by some of her own debtors. Now she is prepared to shoulder on the Government's proposals, the House an additional loss of £11,000,000 and to has been treated to a great deal of sobMr Paterson. take her place in the very forefront of those who are showing a willingness to help the world to economic stability. It makes us proud of our connection with the Mother Country. I hope that by means of this bill we shall be able to carry out the conversion operation successfully, thus extricating Australia from her difficulties and restoring the credit of this country in the eyes of the world. [Quorum formed.] The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), when speaking this afternoon, gave one the impression that he had not a very high regard for the patriotism of the money lenders. The statement was characteristic of the right honourable gentleman. I recall, in the under his authority as Prime Minister, to all adult male citizens of the Commonwealth, asking them to state their age, whether they had offered for active service, and, if not, to furnish the reasons. The executive of the New South Wales Labour Party suggested to the right honourable gentleman that he should issue another questionnaire asking people how much money they had offered voluntarily to the nation for the prosecution of the war, and if they had not already furnished funds in this way, were they prepared to do so. The Prime Minister took the first train from Melbourne to Sydney to consult with the executive. In a discussion that ensued upon its proposal, he pointed out that it was impossible to ask people to give money voluntarily for war purposes but, by a process of reasoning entirely his own, he indicated that it was not impossible to ask them to give their lives. "" These men,"" he said, referring to money lenders, generally, "" w ill not give their money, they would rather give their lives than their money. I would rather give my own life than my money."" And that has been the position all through the piece. We are in our present desperate situation as a nation because people with money to invest have never beeu willing to place it at the service of the country.

If bondholders return of 2 per cent. They know only too well that if they invested in business enterprises, they would be exposed to the risk of losing, not only their interest, but also their capital. In the circumstances it is undeniable that under this scheme investors in government loans are to be presented with gilt-edged securities guaranteeing to them a fixed interest return year after year and, through the operation of the economic law, which will become inevitable in the working of this plan, tbe purchasing power of the interest return on their investment will be increased from year to year. This then, is tbe sacrifice which the bondholders are to be called upon to make! They will be given an absolute guarantee that their principal will remain intact for a period of 40 years, during which time they will draw, at least, a reasonable return from the investment. If this avenue were closed to them they would be forced either to invest in commercial ventures or place the money on current account with one of the banks, because there is no investment in this or any other countryassuming that they could transfer their capital abroad-whic h would give them a better return with equal security. ""We must expect Commonwealth revenue to shrink, because the plan, in operation, will accentuate the depression and, with a steadily decreasing revenue a return of 4 per cent, on government securities-the interest rate ought to be 2 per cent, if sacrifices by bondholders are to be comparable with sacrifices by wage-earnerswill be quite satisfactory. As a matter of fact, twelve months hence, it will be more difficult to find 4 per cent, than it is to pay 5 per cent, or 6 per cent. now. I predict that, in the course of a few months, there will be a further conference and another agreement, to overcome the difficulties then confronting the Commonwealth. The debate on these government proposals, supported as they are by honourable members opposite, suggests that this House has become a mutual admiration society. The Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) did not always hold the view which he enunciated in support of this, the' Government's latest scheme, to restore the finances of the Commonwealth. This is what the honourable gentleman said in Mr Lazzarini. July, 1929, when speaking to miners in the Newcastle districtStatistics showed tliat a very small per centage of these loans was subscribed out of tlie savings of the ordinary people, and the actual implication was they were being subscribed by the coal barons, ship-owners, and big business men from the profits of industry. Then, stealing a phrase much used by Mr King O'Malley, the Treasurer, who was then Deputy Leader of the Labour party, dealt scathingly with the "" gilded roosters "" who were securing such a good return from their investments in these loans. He went on to single out one big business man who, some years ago, he said, made a great demonstration of investing £1,000,000 in Commonwealth loans, and was now drawing a steady income of £55,000 a year without any of the risks attached to a similar investment in business enterprises. That was the view of the Treasurer when in Opposition, and hoping one day to become Treasurer of the Commonwealth. It is in striking contrast with opinions expressed by the honourable gentleman now that he is, as he believes, firmly entrenched on the treasury bench. His latest utterance appears in to-day's Sydney Morning Herald. The honourable gentleman seems determined to outbid even the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) in the extravagance of his promises, and I should add that his public statements, like those of his colleague, usually have no foundation. This is what the Treasurer is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald to have saidIf the conversion loan succeeded quickly, and the Premiers' plan was generally adopted, Australia would see the making of a new country in three months' time. I pledge my political life and reputation in the prophecy that the operation of the plan will not have that effect. I challenge the Treasurer to do likewise. gang in Sydney, led by Mr Lang, who are endeavouring to prevent the success of the plan. another member of the Mutual Admiration Society!

123,Mr Lazzarini,"Now speaksLand. All that has happened in this House during the last week or two proves conclusively the truth of our criticism, that the finance and economic measures now being sponsored by this Government, are the proposals of the Nationalist, Country party, and other oppositionists in this chamber. This is an attempt, by a Government that is well acquainted with the fundamental principles of the Labour movement in regard to finance, to engraft the system of capitalist finance on the nation for the next 40 years. Should a genuine Labour government obtain possession of the treasury bench in the future, and endeavour to give effect to Labour's policy, honourable members opposite will be enabled to accuse it of tearing up a scrap of paper and of violating sacred obligations covered by an enactment of Parliament. After its experience of the last twelve months, the Labour movement will endorse only those who will make some pretence, at any rate, at carrying out its policy. The right honourable member for North Sydney has said, "" ""We have to tell the bondholders that we have not the money with which to pay them "". We have never had that money. When this £400,000,000 was floated, Australia did not possess £65,000,000 of legal money. It borrowed, not money, but bank credits. If every person in the community were stripped of all that he possessed in legal money, it would be found that there was not £60,000,000 of real money in Australia. There is no money except that which is created by a government, in the economic structure of cither this or any other country. There is not £20,000,000 sterling in Australia to-day. What we call money is the banknote which is brought into existence by governments, and even that does not aggregate £65,000,000. The issue of notes has never exceeded £70,000,000 even when there was a large addition to the number printed. La3t year the banks owed their depositors £308,000,000, and the amount in the Government Savings banks was £270,000,000. What are we trying to persuade ourselves that we can do? cussed, honourable members talk about inflation. know that the currency consists of bank credits, which can be manipulated without any check.

I repeat that this debt was piled up in Australia not by borrowing money, but simplyby obtaining bank credita currency forged by the banks. I defy contradiction of the statement that if there were any inflation it occurred when these loans were floated for war purposes.

It proposed that the Commonwealth Bank should function in such a way as to provide for the requirements of the nation in a loan and revenue sense for a period of twelve months. The loans as they were floated were .to be taken up by the Commonwealth Bank, and bank credits made available. The inflow and outflow of revenues were to be operated by the bank under an ordinary overdraft arrangement, the revenues being paid in and cheques drawn against them. Bank were made secure against a raid by the associated banks, every penny of this £550,000,000 could be given back to the bondholders in the form of bank credits, which was the form in which it was borrowed. It would be necessary to make a simple amendment to the Commonwealth Bank Act, so as to bring that institution into line with the Bank of England, and enable it to operate for the benefit of the nation as the Bank of England -has operated by law for the benefit of private bankers for a period of 50 or 60 years-a law passed in England at the request of bankers, for the purpose of stabilizing the banking system of Great Britain. We should so amend our act as to make it impossible for any banking or other financial institution to operate on the reserve of the Oommonwealth Bank. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) smiles. I am prepared to debate this matter with him in his electorate at any time that he chooses, and thus afford him an opportunity to prove that I am the economic as which he endeavours to make this House believe tliat I am. He has not the courage to accept my challenge, because he knows that his arguments cannot prevail against mine in the minds of the people. Honor able members say that the issuing of bank credits is inflation. I repeat that the inflation took place when these loans were floated. These bonds are negotiable to-day on the Stock Exchange. They are being used in many cases for the purpose of making deposits on homes, and for the purchase of big city properties as well as in other business transactions. Some time before I entered this Parliament I sold Mr Lazzarini. , a small business, and the man who purchased it from me asked whether I would accept a £500 bond as part payment. That is being done every day in the week. Not one penny of these credits would have any effect on price levels unless the owners of the credits released them by purchasing commodities. If a person has a bond for £100 or £1,000, and that is converted by this plan into another form of bond,' is it likely that the owner will go about squandering it until nothing is left? The position will be as it was before. If this chamber were stacked with banknotes from floor to ceiling it If the Commonwealth would not affect the economic condition of the nation one iota unless the money were distributed among the people and used as a purchasing agent. It does not matter what economic authorities honourable members opposite quote, it is an indisputable fact there can be no inflation until the symbols of credit are utilized as purchasing agents. Honourable members ask what security will be behind the new bonds. What is behind the thousand million pounds that Australia owes? Nothing but the good name of the nation, and the taxable capacitj of its people. Our credit is susr tained by the simple faith of our people and of overseas borrowers who invest, their money here. Whether these securities are in the form of pieces of paper called bonds, or of a book entry in a ledger, the position is the same. The Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) has asked for an alternative policy to that propounded by him. I refer him to the economic policy of the Labour party, which, I admit, is sometimes departed from, but is, nevertheless, available to the Government. In conclusion I emphasize the different points that I have enunciated. First, that inflation took place when our war loans were floated, and the purchasing power of the bonds was thrown into our economic arrangements by buying equipment for our soldiers, and so forth. Secondly, that the form in which inflation exists to-day is that of interest-bearing bonds, for which future generations wifi be taxed for all time to pay the interest. Thirdly, the transferring of those credit symbols from interest-bearing bonds into figures in a ledger, with no interest-bearing capacity, can by no stretch of imagination be claimed to be additional inflation. able member think of this bill? merely perpetuates the capitalistic system of finance against which Labour has already stood. I have suggested a sound alternative. If it is not accepted this year or next year, the country may struggle on for a while longer, but eventually, and probably within our lifetime, the existing economic system will crash about our ears, and be replaced by the only sane alternative, that which I have enunciated. Sitting suspended from 6.11 to 8 p.m. and there always will be, a risk in conbill before us is one of a number designed to rehabilitate our national finances. As such I cordially support it, differentiation in the price of loans otheralthough naturally I deplore the circumwise. stances which compel us as a nation to ask the bondholders for a variation of often that I find myself in agreement their contract in favour of the Governwith the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore). ment.

As I see it, the position is that governmental debt. We did not owe that bondholders who have invested in Ausmoney to the British Government as tralian internal loans have now discovered such; we owed it to the people of Britain. that their investment is not so completely Had we secured relief from that indebsound as they previously believed it to tedness, it would have been a case of be.

Recently, when Britain agreed bonds have not been tested as they to postpone certain interest payments due were tested during the Great War, and its by Australia, and thereby' penalized her aftermath. I make no apology for saying ewn people, we applauded her action. that the interest paid on Australian bonds clearly indicated that a certain element of risk was associated with them. That risk was cheerfully and selectively faced when investors chose our bonds in preferenceto others.

There is no .more cause for shame in this proposal than there was in the other. but an intimation. honourable member for Fawkner( Mr. Maxwell) reiterates that these proposals are in reality a compulsory reduction. His attitude and that of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) w ill not benefit this country or the Empire to which we belong. On the face of it , the bill provides for a voluntary conversion. If the honourable member for Fawkner desires to go behind the bill he may do so; but I shall not. am sorry that he says that its provisions amount to compulsion; that bondholders have no alternative to coming under the scheme, that, in fact, the gun is loaded against them. If the bondholders accept the proposals-as I believe they w ill and agree to a voluntary reduction of interest, Australia will have greater reason 'to be proud of her citizens for their action than for anything they have done, apart from the war. If we appeal to the patriotism of our people, and urge them to convert tlieir holdings for the good of the nation, I believe that the appeal w ill not be in vain. As I have said, the proposal before us is not so unprecedented or so extraordinary as its critics would have us believe. ""What is the Hoover proposnl that we have so applauded, but an admission by the greatest creditor nation in the world, that it is not in the interest of civilization that the debtor nations should be called upon to pay the whole of their debts when they f a i l due ? If we acquiesce in the Hoover plan, we acquiesce in principles which are precisely the same as those underlying the proposals now before us. They are an admission that Australia, a debtor nation, cannot pay f u l l interest upon her internal debts; and that for the benefit of all concerned it ought not be called upon to pay it . Happily, the greatest creditor nation in the world, admits civilization, debtor nations should be granted some relief. AlthoughI regard this bill with a certain sense of shame, I believe that it is absolutely necessary for the salvation of our finances and the welfare of the people of Australia, aud indeed, of the Empire as a whole. It is unfortunate that Australia should be the first unit in the Empire to be compelled to follow this thorny path.

""When referring to our desperate financial plight I have always expressed the opinion that Ave should hang on as long as possible, in the belief that sooner or later there would be a general easing of the position as between nation and nation and creditor and debtor. In my opinion, the term ""gilt-edged security "" is true only in a relative sense. There is no such thing as a 100 per cent, security in the case of any government.

One can buy more of almost anything I can think of with the bond at its present market rate than when it was at par. I suggest that the bondholder may well accept this conversion scheme without groat sense of hardship. The important thing to do now in the interests of the bondholder is to keep his capital intact, and that is what is intended, not only under the present measure, but under all the rehabilitation proposals of the Government. The purpose of the bill is to save our credit, to keep our name high, and to ensure a tolerable money market in the years to come -At its present that. price, say, £S5, an Australian bond will buy more of anything I know of in this country than £100 would purchase three years ago -a-l l the reductions are subject to endorseabout those in the seventies? the seventies. stock exchange quotations, from pasheld by persons of relatively small means, toral propositions to real estate, but there is a difference between any and 30 per cent, cannot be shown.

There is to be no exception, and I claim that all of these reductions are to be on a voluntary basis, including those of bondholders, because none of them will endure unless endorsed at the next general election. If there should be a mass adverse vote by all who are affected directly, and closely indirectly, by these cuts, there will be a restoration to the old level, though not to the old payments. Therefore, in a sense, these reductions are all to be submitted to the people, and endorsed by them, if they are to stand. applies as much to the public servants and the pensioners as to the bondholders we cannot make the necessary reduction of expenditure wholly out of poor man's and win out with it at the polls.

The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the State Premiers deliberately removed the element of compulsion from the. scheme. happen if nobody converts? trust our people in this matter. Speaking on the Debt Conversion Agreement Bill last week, I said that Australia had always treated its people with remarkable generosity. That is true, but I think that it is equally true that successive generations of Australians have served this country well, from the days of the earliest navigators and explorers and the pastoral pioneers down to the time of the late war. I believe completely tliat, in the present crisis, the spirit of service will prove to be high in the bondholders, and if honourable members on all sides unite wholeheartedly in an appeal to the public, we shall obtain very nearly a 100 per cent, assent to the voluntary conversion scheme. Summing up my views, I first of all express my profound regret and disappointment, as an Australian, that a proposal of this kind should come before this National Assembly. I take second place to no honourable member in my regret that it is necessary to consider such a measure; but, having said that, I submit that the bondholder does not find himself to-day in possession of a really discredited stock. The stock that he subscribed for has proved relatively gilt edged, and quite the best investment in this country for the past two or three years. In other words, the Australian bond has survived the shock of the economic storm extraordinarily well. If we unite to bring about the success of this voluntary conversion, it is my firm belief that we shall maintain the confidence of the money market in the Australian bond, and in the Australian nation. That should be our great objective. Three or four alternative proposals have been mentioned. There was straightposal to defer payment of part of the Under the plan which the present voluntary scheme superseded, it was suggested that we should advocate conversion on a voluntary basis, but with the express determination that, if the bond were not voluntarily converted, punitive taxation should be imposed. I dislike punitive or compulsory measures, because I am not one of those heroes in this House who declare that it would be a good thing if we never borrowed again in our time. I do not believe that it is possible for this young country to carry on development, and maintain public services, without a certain amount of loan money in the very near future, and even in years to come; but I would not like to return to borrowing on the old, disastrously high scale. If we compulsorily reduce interest on our loans, if we flagrantly and openly break our contract with the bondholder, we shall not be able to borrow a penny in this country during the next generation or two. That accounts for my dislike to anything in the nature of compulsion, apart altogether from the moral aspect of the matter. Buti f we are able to convince the bondholders that Australia has not really failed them badly, that the sacrifice which we are asking of them is relatively not nearly as heavy as we are demanding of other classes of the community, we may bring about this voluntary conversion, derive great benefit from the exercise of the national spirit behind it, and still carry our credit high. Therefore, I shall support this measure with much satisfaction through all its stages. If the forms of the House permitted, I should have much pleasure in moving that the apology of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) be accepted. No doubt it is rather embarrassing for him, and others on his side of the House, to have to accept this measure, which, beyond doubt, is a repudiation of the contract with bondholders, when only a few months ago any suggestion for a reduction of interest or alteration of the contract would have been scorned as something unworthy of discussion, either in this Parliament, or among decent members of the community.",39,Parkhill Wha T Ment By A Popular Vote I N A Democracy

Tha't was the Government's own case iu favour of the 3s. 6d. in the £1 suner tax. We, therefore, nave -.the Government's own statement in support of my contention .that, even under this conversion proposal, -the bondholders w ill not make any real sacrifice. It has yet to be seen whether the Government's plan will be accepted, but it would apoear that,-with the help of the .Opposition, the Government wiU get its proposals through Parliament. If -that plan is adopted, the sacrifice, so-called, to-be made by the 'bondholders, w ill not at all compare with that, for instance, demanded .of incapacitatqd -soldiers, and old-age and ; invalid (pensioners. According to the plan, 2s. >6d. a week is to be deducted from the payjments to old-age pensioners, but that does not .re,p«esent the f u l l ex-.tent of -their loss. It -is obvious from w i a t the Treasurer has said that the conditions governing the granting -of penAs' I ihave sions .will be altered .to such an extent that at least 25 per cent, or 30 per cent, of those now in receipt of pensions will cease to receive them. A heavy sacrifice will also he demanded of the returned soldiers. As the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) pointed out, the greater the incapacity of a returned soldier the greater the sacrifice which will organizations, and it is particularly be demanded of him, because not only will he suffer a pension cut, but certain allowances are to be taken from him. There is not the slightest doubt that the pensioners will be compelled to make sacrifices under the plan, but the bondholders, I maintain, will not make any sacrifice at all. Part of the Government economy plan deals with the reduction of salaries and wages throughout the Public Service. I listened attentively to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons), which consisted mainly of a wail of sympathy with the unfortunate bondholders, but contained references to the losses which are to be suffered by the workers, although he still endeavours to maintain his sympathy for them. No one can deny that the workers as a body have, during the last few years, made big sacrifices all along the line. The Arbitration Court has. figuratively speaking, cut them to pieces, besides which large numbers of them have had to submit to rationing, while many more have lost their employment altogether. They have suffered in this way untold hardship, while all the time the bondholders have demanded, and received, their full pound of flesh. Up to now bondholders have drawn their full rate of iiiterest, and it ill becomes honourable members opposite to raise a wail of pity on their behalf. I am not here to defend the interests of the bondholders, because tbey are obtaining all the assistance they require from both sides of the House, but nobody seems to care much about the workers. for the Government, and those who support it, to cut arbitrarily the wages of the workers and alter their conditions, it is good enough to apply the same treatment to the bondholders. Not only is the Government cutting wages, but it is also taking Steps to alter the conditions of employment, a matter Mr Beasley. which comes under the heading of adjustable expenditure. Wage rates are governed, to a large extent, by the Statistician's figures as revealed in the cost of living index, but conditions of employment have been won largely by the efforts of the workers through their reprehensible that those conditions should be tampered with by a Labour Government. Indeed, I have been informed that this interference has already been carried some distance by the Government. It has to be admitted that, under present economic conditions the strength of the workers' organizations is not so great as it would be in normal times. They cannot be expected to fight as strenuously for their rights as at ordinary times, and this so-called Labour Government is taking advantage of the fact to reduce their wages, and arbitrarily very few vary the conditions of their employment. Surely the workers have as much right to consideration as has any other class of the community. Is there any honorable member in this chamber who will argue that invalided soldiers are not entitled to as much consideration as the bondholders? After all, they took the risk of losing their lives, and very many of them have actually lost their health. What risk did the bondholders take who put their money into war loans and gilt-edged securities? They did not even take the same risk as did those who invested their money in ordinary industrial undertakings. So long as constitutional government obtains, their money is as safe as if they held it in gold, silver or notes. They took virtually no risk whatever, but the man or woman who invests money in private undertakings takes all the risk associated with the carrying on of industry. That is why I protest strongly against the action of the Government If it is good enough which, accepting the decisions of the Premiers Conference, proposes to differentiate between the bondholders and other sections of the community. As I have said, if it is good enough to deal arbitrarily with wage-earners and pensioners, it is equally good enough to deal in the same fashion with the bondholders. That is my attitude. Another peculiar aspect of this proposal is that bondholders are to be exempt from future taxation. Is not the interest of the country as much their concern as that of anybody else? Why should they be exempt from future taxation? The bondholders should not be a privileged class, receiving further special and preferential treatment. to the existing heavy property rates. under this bill that bondholders shall not be called upon to pay any future taxation. called upon to pay any increased taxation. taxation must be future taxation, and I strongly object to such concessions. Quite a lot has been said about appealing to tbe patriotic sense of the bondholders, but we must admit that very little patriotism was displayed by them in respect of the loan conversion of £28,000,000. That loan had to be made very attractive to them, by a process well known to honourable members, and it placed about £200,000 of additional burden upon the taxpayers of this country by increasing the interest rate from 4 per cent, to 6 per cent. This is the first opportunity I have had of referring to an undesirable feature of that loan conversion. When it was under way a number of large manufacturers in the various States adopted measures which actually forced their employees to take up bonds. Eor instance, the BritishAustralasian Tobacco Company, of Sydney, applied what might be termed a process of economic pressure to its employees, becatise if they refused to carry out the instructions of the directors of the company to ' take up bonds they were likely to jeopardize their employment. it possible for its employees to subscribe to the loan, arranged for weekly or fortnightly wage deductions over periods of from eighteen months to two years at a time when these workers could ill afford to have any deductions made from their wages. There was no need for tbe big manufacturers to go to those lengths to secure the success of the conversion loan, but their action was designed to spread as many bonds as possible over the workers so that it would assist them in the propaganda regarding the large number of small subscribers, and was in keeping with that of honourable members opposite, who, as the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) has said, used "" sob-stuff"" to try to gather in a number of small subscribers to the loan. They, of course, realize that a £10 bond represents to the small bondholder as much as a £1,000 bond does to a large bondholder. I know that that practice was resorted to by the big manufacturers, because at the time, the organization concerned brought the matter under my notice and asked my advice. It was pointed out to me that the employers had increased made it plain that if their employees did not take up bonds there was every likelihood of their next pay envelope containing a note to the effect that their services were no longer required. When the Labour party decided to postpone for twelve months the proposals that were submitted by the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons), that honourable member, calling the proposal repudiation, rushed out of caucus to receive the support of the Baillieu press. We are all agreed that the boost that he then received placed him in the position which he occupies to-day over the heads of many members of the Nationalist party who had hitherto borne the heat and burden of the day. They have had to take a back seat, but I think only for a short time. With respect to appeals for voluntary subscriptions, let me quote the experience of New South Wales recently when the combined churches endeavoured to raise funds to assist the sick and the needy. There was a great flourish of trumpets. The people were asked to subscribe voluntarily to assist the hospitals. That company, to make A lot of money was spent in advertising and the appeal was given a big kick off. We know what happened. The Associated Press through advertisement receipts, secured most of the benefit of that appeal. They obtained a very decent swag out of the funds. I hope later to be able to give the actual amount. No more humane appeal could be made to the people than one to assist the hospitals, and yet the wealthy people saw",40,Parkhill Wha T Ment By A Popular Vote I N A Democracy

I am indeed pleased to hear that the appeal was a success. I wish now to refer to what has been described as a wonderful gesture by the President of the United States of America. We have had the same old stuff about generosity, &c, trotted out; we have been told how this offer should be received with open arms .and of the great good it will do. We have been told of the generosity which the United States of America, as a creditor nation, has extended to.the debtor nations. Is it not remarkable that when a foreign country finds itself unable to meet its debts, its creditors have no difficulty in providing the means to enable it to tide over its difficulties? In such cases we hear nothing about the need to restore confidence in these countries as we are hearing from the Government and the Nationalists of the great need to restore confidence in Australia before assistance can be given. There is no effort on the part of the creditor nations to ascertain what the debtor nation is doing to balance its budget. Honourable members must have noticed, within the last few days, press reports to the effect that there has been an amalgamated effort on the part of the Bank of England, the Bank of France, and the Central Bank of New York, to make available £20,000,000 to the Reichsbank of Berlin to enable Germany to pay its police and military forces. Only a week ago the Bank of England also made £4,000,000 available to Austria, an ex-enemy country, to tide that country over its difficulties. I do not know whether an expert inquiry was made into the financial position of Austria, or whether they were considering the -workers there, or if any steps were .taken beforehand to restore confidence in that country.' Nevertheless, whatever the circumstances may be, Great Britain does not hesitate to assist foreign nations whenever the call is made. The facts cannot be hidden any longer. The average person in this community is awake ,to the manipulation of international finance that takes place to-day, and to the fact that talk of the restoration of confidence and the need to balance the budget, is mere claptrap. When the investments of British capitalists in foreign countries are menaced, and there is the danger, as there is in Germany today, of the Government being overthrown, assistance is soon forthcoming. Honourable members opposite have referred to Sovietism, and my answer to them is that no doctrine that can be regarded as detrimental to the interests of the community will live ih any country the Government of which is honouring its obligations to the people. When the people are living in reasonable comfort and under decent standards of living, there is no need or urge to agitate for a change. In Germany the government of the day has failed to honour its obligations to the people, and it has no longer the right to exist, but it is vitally necessary to outside capitalists to protect their interests there, and hence they rush to give financial aid. Thousands of our unfortunate citizens are to-day unemployed,'and on the verge of starvation; but the Bank of England, which is closely associated with the Commonwealth Bank, refuses to make a shilling available to assist them. It is recognized in foreign lands that an imemp'loyment percentage of between 20 per cent, and '25 per cent, marks the danger line, and once that stage is reached by any nation, its creditors rush to its assistance. Great Britain is now assisting a country against which it will be remembered, particularly by the returned soldiers, the doctrine of hatred was preached throughout the British Empire. I ask those who took part m the Great War, to throw their minds back to the time when they were associated ivith that struggle, and to eompare the position then with the position of to-day. The Bank of England, together with the Bank of France and the Central Bank of New York, is making available £20,000,000 to Germany, but not ono single shilling to Australia to help it in its time of stress.

168,Mr Beasley,"I think that thatreturned soldiers are to suffer reductions in tlieir pensions, and the greater the degree of incapacitation on their part, the greater is to be the sacrifice. This is the so-called democracy to which the honourable member for Henty( Mr ciples of Labour. The Government 's Gullett) referred. He said that we were living in a democracy; that we make our decisions per medium of the ballot box; and that every three years or less, according to the circumstances, honourable members were elected to this Parliament to give effect to the policy as enunciated by them on the hustings. What has this Government done to give effect to its policy as indicated per medium of the ballot box? The members of the Government must admit that they have not governed since they gained office, but that Sir Robert Gibson, along with the directors of the private banks, have been the real dictators as to what should be done in this time of crisis. They told the Government that unless it did certain things, it would obtain no accommodation from them. Is this a democracy? It certainly is not what is regarded as a democracy. One thing which appeals to me more than anything at the present time is that the further we enter into the existing process of social evolution, the more we expose the sham and farce of our system of government. The other day, when speaking on the subject of the shipment of £5,000,000 of gold abroad, I said that I welcomed the opportunity to express the views of the party which I represent, and at the same time to expose our opponents who have prattled so much about the necessity for having a 25 per cent, backing to our note issue. orable member resign from the Government? the New South Wales election of October last as the psychological moment for me to make a declaration of my position, and. to show who was really governing in Australia. My efforts were fairly successful. Just, as it is open to any honourable member to choose the time which best suits him to remain in this House, or to determine the course which best suits his owu interests or those of the people he represents, it was open to me to take the course which I took in regard to the affairs of the present Government. I refuse to be associated with a so-called Labour Government which has declared for a course so flagrantly at variance with the prinnow taking steps which, as the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) has said on many occasions, are merely a temporary expedient to tide them over this financial crisis, instead of sticking to the policy of the Labour party. Possibly, within three months, or even a shorter period, we shall have another revision of policy, and be asked to sanction further cuts in wages and pensions. In conclusion, I say to those whose wages and pensions are to be attacked in an arbitrary fashion, and with an utter disregard for their circumstances, that they should rise and organize, and with all the force at their command, and in the four corners of this country, show the present Government up in its true light to the people. ringah) [9.1] I view this matter in very much the same light as other honourable members who have preceded me. I am prepared to admit that in the proposals before us to-day there is technical repudiation. tion. There is some actual breaking of contracts, and my only reason for giving my support to the Government's proposals is that the alternative proposals are calculated to inflict even greater hardship and privation, and to fall more heavily on the people than those which are before the country to-day. These are certainly bad enough, and I vote for them and speak in favour of them with the utmost reluctance, but if any one can put forward any scheme under which any section of the community can, in fairness, be absolved from any share in the sacrifice which it is proposed it should make, I am prepared to support it.

173,Mr Archdale Parkhill,"I have already protested against the gibes that have been uttered from time to time in this chamber, and elsewhere, against the bondholders, those who have loaned money to the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States, as if they had done something for which they should be blamed. One would think to listen to some people that the bondholder was an opprobrious kind of person, indulging in some unfair operation at the expense of the public and his fellow citizens. The position is the very opposite. The Governments have asked the people of Australiafor their money, and have said that they will pay certain interest for the use of it. They have taken the mouey and used it on social services, public works, and so forth, possibly wasting a great deal of it, and, in some cases, they have refused to pay the interest which they have contracted to pay. The bondholder is not the wealthy man several honourable members have said that he is. According to the honourable member for ""Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini), the bondholders to-day are the banks, the stockjobbers, and the wealthy people of this country. able member is right. the main, he does not know what he is talking about, nor does the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates), because about £26,000,000 represents all that the banks have in our internal indebtedness of £556,000,000. member know that? was mentioned at the Premiers Conference in Melbourne. hold stock valued at £20,000,000. the honourable member for Adelaide still persists in his absurd suggestion that the banks of this country are its bondholders; he persists in stating what is obviously not a fact. In the Senate recently, in answer to a question, it was pointed out that the total number of individual subscriptions of persons or bodies in respect of loans floated up to the present, is 1,441,448. Another question asked was the number of subscriptions by individuals whose amounts were £500 or less, and the total amount of such subscriptions. The reply given was that information was not available regarding conversion applications in respect of loans from February, 1918, to July, 1923, but that in respect of all other loans, 1,215,149 citizens of the Commonwealth had taken up bonds of £500 or less, amounting in the aggregate to £13S,9S2,151. Yet some honourable members say that the bondholders, who have been asked to make a sacrifice of 22$ per cent, of their capita], are the wealthy persons of this country. that the public holds £329,000,000 of Australia's internal debt. am pointing out that of the people who are asked to make this reduction in their capital, there are at least 1,215,149 whose individual interest in the loan ranges from £10 up to £500, and that an attack upon the bondholder is really an attack upon the decent, thrifty, saving people of this country. I protest against it as strongly as I possibly can. After all, the bondholder of this country has put his money into a form of national saving, and has been asked to take his money out of the savings bank, and put it into Government bonds, because an investment in Government bonds is a form of national saving. The best class of people in this country, and those who are playing the best part in building it up, are the thrifty, saving section who are represented in the bondholders of Australia, and particularly in that class I have referred to in the figures I have quoted. Yet men in this House say that they are not entitled to the interest which the Government has contracted to pay them, and belittle the sacrifice they are being asked to make. As a matter of fact, the sacrifice that many of those small bondholders are being asked to make is very considerable. I have received letters from people who have scraped up enough money to invest it in Government bonds with a view to getting a return of a couple of hundred pounds a year, not much more than could be got by an old-age pensioner.

They have written to me asking what they are going to do with the diminution in their income that these proposals entail. I am perfectly sure that the hardship that they are being called upon to face is as great as that which is being faced by any other section of the community. hardship like that. There is no doubt there will be. But they will require to be faced in the interests of the country, simply because Parliament and the Government cannot put forward any other proposals seemingly fairer than those which we are now considering. own interests as well. was coming to that point. The one thing that reconciles me to these proposals, so far as these bondholders are concerned, is that they at least can keep their capital intact. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) said that the bondholder is to suffer no hardship, because the amount he will receive from a 4 per cent, loan will buy as much as he could buy with what he received formerly. If the honourable member argues that the bondholder is making no sacrifice because of the decreased cost of liviug, and because money will buy to-day as much as the higher amount would have bought some time ago, he can also argue that no sacrifice is being made by any section of the people with whom we are dealing at the present moment-includin g old-age pensioners and soldiers. Such argument is absurd. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) also spoke similarly of the diminished income buying as much as the higher amounts. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) said that for years bondholders have been obtaining a higher income by investing, not in industrial stocks, but in what he described as gilt-edged securities backed by the Government, and by the resources of the nation, which in effect, he said, could not fail. I said to him by way of interjection to which he refused to listen that the same promises were made in regard to the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. No greater promises could have been made by any government than were made to the workers and the people who put their savings into that bank. The workers were assured that their deposits were secure for all time, and in -all circumstances, and they put their money into that institution under those conditions. Yet the honourable member chose to ignore my interjection and argued that people secured a better investment by purchasing Government bonds than by putting their money into industrial stock which returned a higher rate of interest. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), on the other hand, advanced the extraordinary view that, with government loans in every country I an element of risk is associated. I have never previously heard that, when a government issues a loan prospectus, the people who invest their money in the loan are taking a risk. To-day people are paying an adverse exchange of 30 per cent, in order to transfer their money to Great Britain, because they believe, as I believe, that British consols and other securities issued by the Government are gilt-edged and free of risk. Australian stocks should be equally sound. The view is generally accepted that public men, instead of investing their money in risky business ventures which might prove embarrassing to them in their oflicial relationships, should invest in government stock at a lower rate of interest; they would thus have security, together with immunity from possible embarrassment. There are others who, rather than take the risk of commercial investments, prefer to forgo the chance of high returns in order to enjoy that security which is supposed to attend investment in government stocks. I have always believed that, when a government undertook to pay a certain rate of interest, it would do so even if the Government had to resort to additional taxation for the purpose. The statement that there is an element of risk in these business relations between governments and citizens is a view which never previously, to my knowledge, had been uttered.

The honourable member has no right to belittle the United Kingdom by making statements which be cannot substantiate. [Quorum formed.] The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has supported Mr should like some relief to be given to Lang in his refusal to pay interest on money lent by the people of the United Kingdom to the Government of New South Wales; yet the honourable member has the audacity and effrontery to whine about the action of the Mother Country in advancing money to Germany, Austria and other countries which are honorably meeting their interest bills. Apparently he thinks that, although New South Wales has repudiated its contracts, Great Britain should still pour money into that State. effect, he did. He complained that the United Kingdom had lent £4,000,000 to Austria, and in co-operation with the Central Bank of New York and the Bank of Erance was maintaining the solvency of Germany in the present financial and economic crisis. How can. he expect Great Britain to lend money to New South Wales when the Premier of that State refuses to pay interest on borrowed money already expended, and the benefits of which the citizens of the State are to-day enjoying? If a person to whom the honourable member had lent £10 refused to pay interest on the debt or repay the principal, would the honourable member volunteer another loan to him ? Certainly he would not; yet he expects such magnanimity nf Great Britain. dom giveu a respite of three years with respect to its war debt to the United States of America? time that that canard was exploded. If the honourable member will take the trouble to acquaint himself with the facts he will find that, although the payment of interest was deferred for a period, that interest was added to the principal. The original debt was £800,000,000 odd, and to-day, Great Britain is paying interest on about £1,000,000,000. Great Britain is now, as always, following the honourable course. It has never repudiated a contract. I have little fault to find with the provisions, of the bill, although with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons), 1 small bondholders-person s holding not more than £1,000 worth of Government stock. If possible, such holders should be repaid their principal if they cannot afford to lend it to the Government at the reduced rate of interest. I appeal to the Treasurer to consider what can be done for persons of that class. Mi\ CUKTIN -Wher e would the Treasurer get the money with which to redeem the bonds? honourable member for Eremantle has so often talked of extensions of credit that I thought he might help the Treasurer to obtain such an extension for the benefit of the small bondholders. I do not suggest, however, a resort to anything in the nature of inflation, because even a hint of inflation would at this stage have a most injurious effect; the bondholder faced with a loss of 22$ per cent, in respect of the interest payable to him, and fearing a further scaling down of his capital by inflation, would refuse to convert. As to the voluntary nature of this proposal, the honourable member for Henty has appealed to us to be frank and honest. If we are, we must recognize that at one stage of the Melbourne conference there was a definite pronouncement in favour of compulsion. Now, however, the conversion is to be projected on a voluntary basis, and I shall say nothing more on that phase, beyond asking myself what will happen to the holder who does not respond to the Government's invitation?

I have already done that on various platforms since this scheme was mooted, and I am prepared to continue to urge the people to make the loan a success. The bill proposes that the bondholder shall have the right to intimate his unwillingness to convert, and that failing an intimadented in its magnitude. In looking up tion of dissent, his assent shall be assumed. That is a wise provision which has been included in other large conversions bills. There are many people who if asked to go to the bank and sign a form authorizing the conversion of their stock, or if asked even to communicate with the Government, will neglect to do so; they prefer their minds to be made up for them, and are content to know that if they do not signify dissent theiT securities will be automatically converted. That is a prudent and common sense provision. I do not intend to discuss the proposed reductions of old-age, invalid and war pensions. Repeatedly I have said that if any scheme can be evolved for the rehabilitation of the national finances without imposing the proposed sacrifices on all sections of the community, I shall be glad to support it. In the absence of the alternative, I shall vote for this scheme because, severe as it is, I fear that worse will befall us if we Gladstone was not a success, did not say, do not accept it. I believe it will be a means of re-establishing the credit of the country and rendering further sacrifice unnecessary. If bondholders, pensioners, public servants, business men and others will unite in a patriotic resolve to re-establish Australia on a sound economic and financial basis, and co-operate wholeaccount. heartedly and enthusiastically to that end, the country will be again facing the sun within a very short space of time, and entering upon a new era of prosperity. not feel disposed to express myself upon this measure other than to say that I disapprove of it, because it is nothing but repudiation naked and unashamed. It is our duty to honour our obligations, and had we adopted the proper means we should have been able to do so. It is my intention to move to the motion before the House an amendment which has been prompted by the precedents quoted by the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) in moving the second reading of the bill. On that occasion he gave precedents which, in his opinion, justified the Government in submitting this proposal. He also stated that the proposed Commonwealth conversion loan is probably unprecethe particulars of the large conversions to which the Treasurer referred, I find that in 1822, Mr Vansittart, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer of Great Britain, converted a 5 per cent, loan, amounting to £152,000,000. That was followed in 1824 by the raising of a loan by Mr Robinson. I presume that the Treasurer is au fait with the statements made by Mr Goschen in which he referred to the precedents that led up to the British Government taking the action it did on that occasion. The loan raised by Robinson, was followed by another raised by Goulburn in 1830, and following that a similar loan was raised in 1834 by Lord Althorp. Then followed the loan with which the late Right Honourable W. E. Gladstone was associated, and which, the Treasurer said, was not a success because it was not provided that failure to notify dissent would be taken as giving assent. The Treasurer, in giving reasons why the conversion loan put on the market by as the records disclose, that its failure was due to international complication which arose. Because the terms of the conversion loan at that time did not contain a provision similar >to that contained in this bill the inf erence drawn was that it was unsuccessful on that Goschen paid tribute to the efforts of Gladstone and condoled with him in the circumstances in which he was confronted in carrying out a big conversion at that time. of the 1888 conversion, congratulated Goschen on his proposal. of the proceedings in the British Parliamentary Debates of the 9th March, 1888, on page 731, of which reference is made to Gladstone's attempt to convert a large loan in that yeaT.

193,Mr Yates,"I have read the report[ desire to make is that no attempt was made by Goschen to hide the fact that the conversion was under compulsion. Mr Goschen, when addressing the honourable member for Edinburgh ( Mr Childers), said, as reported on page 718My right honourable friend did not say that compulsion should never be tried, but he said that he desired to make the first attempt one of agreement rather than of compulsion. Most of his comments were to the effect that if the Government should f a i l to come to a decision Parliament should have the right to decide at what time dissentients should be paid. Vansittart's proposal the Government had the right to convert £152,000,000 worth of bonds, which was a very large order, but only £3,000,000 worth had to be paid off. The compulsory part of the measure was that dissentients were at the tender mercy of the Government, which could decide whether they should be paid off immediately, within six or twelve months, or at the w ill of the Government. This clearly conveys, to my mind, that GreatB r it a in was in difficulties during the time Gladstone floated the big conversion loan, because, if the position were favorable, the Government, which had the savings banks behind it , would have been able to meet the claims of dissentients. Goschen saidConsider for a moment the immense resources at the disposal of the Government. In 1844 there were under £30,000,000 in the hands Of the Savings Banks Commissioners; but I ask the committee to remember that that fund, which is at the disposal of the Government for assisting them in transactions of this kind, at the present time, instead of being £30,000,000 is £60,000,000 immediately available to be utilized, if Parliament thinks fit, and safely utilized, in paying off dissentients. At that time the British authorities were not able with that of Australia. According . to the opening remarks of Mr Goschen, British consols at that time had fallen f a r below those of the railway stock. They were beginning to decline, and the Government was not getting any advantage. The is that the records clearly show that the British Government did not hesitate to ask bondholders to do their duty to the nation. a definite undertaking, Ifr. Yates. must be honoured u n t i l circumstances arise when it is impossible to do so. I do not admit that Australia has reached that position. H ad it not been for the mess made by preceding governments we should be able to meet our obligations, and would not be in the discreditable position of reducing invalid and old-age and warpensions, and whittling down the conditions of our people. It is because I am opposed to such a policy that I propose to move an amendment, to which effect should be given. As a member of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations, AusUnder Mr tralia is entitled to ask British bondholders to accept conditions similar tothose which we are imposing upon our own bondholders. I move That ail the words after "" B ill "" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, ""be withdrawn, with a view to incorporating provisions so that the act shall apply to overseas bondholders domiciled in Great Britain."" authority to act in that direction? under which we can refuse to pay British bondholders a higher rate of interest than we are paying bondholders in this country. If we can reduce the rate of interest paid to bondholders in Australia, we can with equal justification reduce the rate paid to overseas bondholders.

I am most anxious to assist the Government in putting into effect the general plan adopted by the conference of Premiers. My only regret is that during the past twelve months in The the Government has not adopted unimpeachable security. The whole of the methods which would have made unnecesnational resources of Australia are pledged to sary the drastic action that is now being the prompt and regular payment of interest taken. Many crocodile tears have been There shed by honourable members because of in an investment in a government loan. interference with the solemn contracts made by the various governments with our bondholders. I was surprised to find such complete agreement between the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) and the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) on this subject, and still more surprised to hear such extraordinary arguments adduced by the honourable member for Henty in support of this bill.

200,"Latham, J. G. Mr Mackay","I am. surprised thatThose remarks are characteristic of appeals that have been, made by various Australian governments from time to time. The people of Australia had formed the habit of believing that Commonwealth bonds were an unimpeachable security. I do not think we should try to disguise facts or to deceive ourselves in approaching a subject like this. The Commonwealth is undoubtedly in a bad way financially, and the Government is being called upon to face many serious problems. I am certain that every member of the House sympathizes with all sections of the people who are being called upon to make sacrifices at this time. I am satisfied that sacrifices are necessary, but I shall be disappointed if this Parliament is not prepared to do justice, so far as that is humanly possible, to every class in the community. It is true that our annual interest bill of £55,000,000 is a staggering load to a population of 6,000,000; but I do not agree that our interest rates are unduly high. When money is scarce it is dear. If a risk is at all suspicious, a high rate of interest is always demanded. There has been competition for money for many years in Australia. The various governments have been almost entirely to blame for this. The savings banks have raised their rates of interest in order to compete with the private banks; and the private banks have thereupon offered still higher rates in order to attract business. I agree that at a time like the present our bondholders should be asked to contribute something to enable us to meet our obligations. The question is what is the best way to ask them to contribute so that they will not feel that they have been deceived by the various governments. I consider that it is absolutely unfair to ask the bondholders to convert their present holdings into long-term securities at a very much lower rate of interest than they are at present receiving. The proposed reduction of 22$ per cent, in interest rates is reasonable in the circumstances, but the method by which it is to be applied is not reasonable. I strongly object to forcing bondholders whose contracts expire this year, next year, or a few years hence, to convert their holdings into securities maturing over a period of from 7 to 30 years. Mr Mackay. The great majority of them will, of course, be lucky if they are able to get their money in less than thirty years from now. This will be a great injustice and a great inconvenience to tens of thousands of the best people in the community. By"" the best people "" I mean the people who have been thrifty, and who have saved money to make provision for the future. It has become a practice in Australia to cultivate extravagant habits. Most of our men and women have dressed well, and lived well, and have denied themselves nothing in the way of pleasure. Another section, instead of spending every penny they earn, put by a few pounds for their future requirements. By their thrift these people are responsible for the successful flotation of government loans from time to time, and they are deserving of every possible consideration that can be extended to them. It would be most unjust to compel thpin to convert into long-dated Commonwealth bond securities which are repayable within the next year or two. If it is at all practicable, an amount equivalent to a reduction of 22$ per cent, in interest should be taken from them in the form of special taxation rather than by this gigantic conversion scheme. I have discussed this proposal with members of my own party, aud I have to admit that my views have not received sympathetic consideration, nor have I seen, in the leading columns of the press, comments in support of it. On the other hand, I have not heard any argument to convince me that it is inadvisable. Australia will not always be suffering from this depression. I have no doubt that, within a few years, we shall enjoy a return to prosperity. As a public man I know how easy it is to develop an agitation for the restoration of wages and pension payments, and I contend that bondholders should be put in exactly the same position as other sections of the community that are called upon to make sacrifices at this time. To many people these sacrifices will be merely temporary. They will be called upon to make their contribution by way of taxation, so that when prosperity returns this, or some future Government, could gradually ease the burden. I submit that the thrifty people among us who have supplied money to our governments faithfully by the Commonwealth and for purposes of development should State Governments in the interests of receive the same treatment. I do not wish to say too much about the voluntary aspect of this conversion scheme, but I do not think we can go on deceiving any one outside when we speak of it as a voluntary scheme. It is perfectly obvious, from the discussion which took place at the conference of Premiers, and from remarks made during the course of this debate, that bondholders who refuse to convert voluntarily will be penalized, in the first place, by having their interest withheld until they communicate with the Treasury and, later, by some method of compulsion, probably in the way of special taxation. The mask which has screened this proposal is gradually being torn away, and we see it in its true light. The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) this afternoon spoke of this scheme as being the first bite into the interest payments received by bondholders, and added that he had not the slightest doubt that in the very near future, further cuts would be necessary. Other honourable members bave spoken in a similar strain. We know perfectly well that, if confidence were restored in the governments of this country, the exchange position would become easier. At the present time the adverse exchange is costing the Commonwealth about £10,000,000 a year. A saving of this sum would represent three times the amount of revenue now asked for from the bondholders. I hope that, when he rises to close the debate, the Treasurer will have something to say in answer to my suggestion, and tell me what is the objection to the special taxation of bondholders, instead of requiring them to accept this conversion scheme, which will tie up their investments for periods ranging from seven years to 30 years. I have already expressed my views with regard to the general plan. I have said that, in the committee stages of the bill, I shall endeavour to ensure that justice is done to all sections of the community, including bondholders. If I fail I feel that I shall have done my duty, and I shall support the conversion scheme in the hope that the plan will be carried out our people. During the discussion at the Premiers Conference we were led to believe that a reduction of interest would apply not only to government loans, but also to all private loans and mortgages. The interest burden presses heavily unon our primary industries. Our wool and wheat-growers, faced with falling incomes, are not able to employ the necessary labour. For the most part t h j primary producer is over capitalized. During a period of prosperity, due to uniformly high price-levels for outexports, farmers acquired land at high values, and now that prices are low, they are unable to carry on. A wool grower, in what might be regarded as a small way, on an area with a carrying capacity of from 6,000 to 7,000 sheep, finds it extremely difficult, with wool at its nresent prices, to make a living. In all. probability, he bought sheep at from 20s. to 25s. a head and has an overdraft with the bank of £10,000. Before he can take anything for himself he has to find £700 a year in payment of interest on his overdraft, and, at ruling prices, it is almost impossible to do that. The interest burden is responsible for much of our present unemployment. We are told that a reduction in bank rates is part of the rehabilitation plan agreed upon at the conference in Melbourne, but I fail to see how it will benefit substantially our primary producers and consumers. All governments borrowed heavily during prosperous years, and made what are regarded as sacred contracts with investors in government loans required for the development of this country. Included in those developmental works are concrete roads which are used by motor vehicles in competition with the railway systems of the different States. This expenditure was not productive. We are now experiencing one of the leanest periods in our history, for although we are producing abundantly of wool, wheat and other primary products, prices are so low that great numbers of our people are in a condition of poverty.",51,Speakeb Hon Noeman Makin The Fact That Certain Non British Coun
201,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [10.6],"A good deal Las been said regarding tlie sacrifices that are to be made by bondholders. I have no grievance against the bondholder. He was induced by specious arguments during the war to invest his money in loans; and only six months ago, he was induced to believe that Commonwealth bonds were as good as gold. But let us consider the case of the soldier who went overseas. capital that he possessed was his l if e, and he staked it all. That was his sacrifice at a time of national crisis. Many of the people who were willin g at that time to conscript for war service those who would not enlist voluntarily, to-day do not believe in the conscription of a portion of their incomes or in the making of a sacrifice which cannot be regarded as in any way comparable with that made by a man who went overseas, leaving a wife or a mother entirely dependent upon him, and who, in many cases left the whole of his capital on the fields of Flanders. age pensioner, who put his capita! into industry for the development of this country. It is not given to everybody to be a bondholder. Many of these men, after struggling for years in industry, find themselves discarded because of invalidity old-age, and they are compelled to live on £1 a week. ""We are not asking them to consent to a reduction of 12-J per cent., but are making that reduction autocratically. Of what benefit w ill these measures be to anybody? ""What work w ill this make possible? ""We are told that the deficits of the Commonwealth and the States will be reduced. Towards the end of last year an emergency session of this Parliament was held. It was then suggested that a loan be floated, covering a period of two years. The majority party the honourable member for Wilmot Lyons), that Australia could not continue to carry the existing interest burden, and that the bondholder should be. asked to accept a lower rate of interest, the Commonwealth Bank being called upon to underwrite the amount held by those who would not convert voluntarily, scheme that would return them 3 per cent. When that proposal was expounded was termed repudiation, and it was preMr Riordan. dieted that the result would be the destruction of the currency and a loss of confidence. Professor Copland, Professor Shann, and the gentleman who is now Acting Commonwealth Statistician, argued that the proposal represented inflation. Yet in a report which they, as experts, furnished to the Melbourne conference, they made the following stateThe ment :So that those not consenting might be repaid the conversion loan would need to be underwritten by the banks, insurance companies, &c. As private debts would not be included in the reductions of the rates of interest, the conversion operations should be accompanied by simultaneous reduction of bank interest rates and mortgage rates. Legislation would be needed to empower trustee companies and others to convert their holdings into the new loan. Under their suggestion there could be a much greater degree of inflation than under any proposal suggested by a Labour member. If the 1,500,000 persons reThen there is the oldferred to by the, honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) as holding bonds of between £5 and £500 do not wish Or are not in a position to convert, what would be wrong with the amount of their investment being underwritten and with their being paid off that to which they or retired because of are entitled? What would they do with the capital sum if it were returned to them? They would have to find some other investment for it . In many cases, it would be put into industry; and that which did not find its way directly into industry would be deposited in a savings bank or placed at fixed deposit in a trading bank, and thereby would be made available for development. as the Government Savings Bank is closed, in some case, it would be placed for safe keeping in the chimney. informed the then Treasurer, Government Savings Bank of New South( Mr Wales is the fault, not of the people who are endeavouring to-day to create employment, but of the politicians who are responsible for the difficulties in which we now find ourselves.

203,Of The Members Of This Mr Riordan,"The closing of thearisen. The hardship caused by the closing of this bank is in the case of many persons much greater than that which will be caused by a reduction of 22$ per cent, in the interest rates. The propaganda that is being carried on against New South Wales will go a long way towards creating a lack of confidence. The criticisms that have been offered of, and the propaganda against, this. Government since its return to power, have done quite a lot to destroy the confidence of the 300,000 and 400,000 out of work, but no people in this country, and have undeceived those who believed that the electors had control of the Government of this country. It is the banks, which have held up this Government at the point of the pistol during the last eighteen months, that govern this country. It is said that a change of government would lead to money being made available; that means that credit is available for a Government willing to do the bank's bidding. It has also been argued that a fiduciary note issue of £18,000,000 would be inflation. The experts who condemned the fiduciary are recommend this plan which will, if agreed to, mean inflation to the extent of £560,000,000. So much for the opinion of the experts. And when the Government gets this money it will merely reduce the deficit and not be used for development. No good will come of the scheme unless it provides for the release of new currency. We are told that this year the country will have to pay an addibe no default next year, witb a resultant tional £3,000,000 for unemployment relief. What a prospect! The experts say that the result of this legislation will be the restoration of bondholders. The overseas prices of confidence. They even claim that additional employment will be provided. Let me examine the position. Queensland has done everything to obey the dictates of its political masters. The Moore Government has reduced the wages of publie servants by over 20 per cent., dismissed between 3,000 and 4,000 railway men, and closed down public works all over the State. Last year Queensland had a deficit of £1,700,000, and it now has a greater unemployment record than has been the case for many years. For over twelve months South Australia has reduced the wages of its public servants. That State has been living on money that was left in the Loan Council by a Queensland Labour administration. It has not opened up new land or works, or made available new jobs. So that all these specious promises really have no basis of fact. They certainly do nothing to relieve our primary producers, who still have to pay their rates to the local authorities and full interest to the banks. Australia has between serious attempt has been made to reduce administrative costs. The same number of heads are operating in every State and Commonwealth department. A reduction bf interest will not bring about the prosperity that is predicted. Legislation that was previously proposed by this Government would have reduced interest to the extent of 3s. 6d. in the £1. That was rejected as "" repudiation"". This plan is just as much repudiation as was anything ever introduced by this Government. The experts who condemned the policy and proposals of this party have made note issue as inflation recommendations which are accepthe very individuals who table to the Nationalist party, because they force this Government to do something that it did not want to do-the dirty work of Nationalism; that is, reduce old-age and invalid pensions; and threaten, the recipients that if they do not accept a reduction of 2s. 6d. a week now the Government will have to default and pay only 12s. 6d. in the f l . What guarantee have we that there will payment of 12s. 6d. in the £1? There is none. The threat that was made to pensioners must also apply to our exports have fallen. We have increased our production, and that, together with our high interest bill, and the great fall in the prices of our exportable commodities, will give the Government considerable concern next year. How can a reduction of interest on bonds to 4 per cent, effect a solution of the problem ? This plan contains nothing except an expression of hope that, as a result of its operating, something will be done to relieve matters. I know hundreds of primary producers in Queensland and New South Wales, men who are in a small way, and who provide a good deal of employment, who will be drastically affected by this proposal on account of the reduced purchasing power of the people. . When a reduction of interest rates takes place the value of their land will fall, and they will be hunted off their holdings by the banks and financial institutions who have them in their grip. A new group of "" mugs "" will then be put in their place, and so the vicious circle will continue. The Government should realize that the unemployment problem can be solved, to a great extent, by making available to our workless the land on which it was proposed to put immigrants. Unless Australia does that, and increases its exports, there is no way out of the difficulty. It is anticipated that the reduction in interest rates will give the Government £6,000,000 per annum which will go towards balancing the budget. What worries me is the case of our aged and infirm. The Government should make provision for a superannuation scheme, and compel everyone to make regular contributions to provide them with pensions in their old age, as is the case with our police force and Public Service. That would obviate the indignity of old folk being subjected to objectionable cross examination as to their family history, and the production of birth certificates &c, when applying for pensions, and the delays, occasionally amounting to ten months, which sometimes occur before applications are granted. I cannot see where the equality of sacribut it applies only to government fice comes in. Compare the cost of living in cities like Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane with centres such as Burketown, Normanton and Croydon and the whole of north and west Queensland. The disadvantages under which our pioneers in those parts are living are immediately obvious. What is £1 a week to an old-age pensioner in those outback places? Yet those are the people who, in the 'eighties, opened up the mining fields of Charters Towers, Croydon, and other centres-prospectors pioneers who really did their bit for the country. To-day they are to be robbed of 2s. 6d. a week, in order that the Government may balance its budget. Had an hlr. Riordan. additional 1 per cent, been taken off interest rates, it would have been possible to save our old-age, invalid, and soldier pensioners the prevailing f u l l rate of pension. This bill offers nothing to the private mortgagor or to the man who has a big private debt, seeing that it applies only to government loans. It will not provide any additional currency, or put new money into circulation. In twelve months' time, we shall be in the same position that we are in to-day because our greatest national asset-the land-is not under the control of the Federal' Parliament, but is in the hands of the States. We are told that we must accept the plan in its entirety, if it is to accomplish what is desired. One State passed, in a couple of days, the legislation necessary to give effect to the Premiers Conference agreement. I do not know what that legislation is, but following a telephone conversation which 1 I had with some friends, I understand that, among other things, it does not provide for a reduction of the interest on private loans. I shall oppose this bill, unless it is amended to deal with uot only government, but also private loans. The loans which are falling due should be underwritten by the banks. It is not in the interests of the banks to allow the existing monetary system to collapse, because they have more at stake than have the workers, the old-age pensioners, the returned soldiers, and others in the community. I was hopeful that the bill would embody provisions to grant relief in respect of private loans, expenditure; and it is that expenditure which has got us into our present economic tangle. adjourned. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [10.34] -In movingand That'the House do now adjourn, I ask honourable members to come prepared to consider to-morrow the Debt Conversion Agreement Bill, which has already passed its second reading.
