21,Mr Howe (Dalley) [10.40],"It is,I , on the other hand, may be compared to a ship's boat. He claims a long association with shipping and an intimate knowledge of it, having been general manager of a large shipping company, while I , for my part, have had that connection with the industry which arises from personal contact with sailors, firemen, engineers, and others of the rank and file of the mercantile marine, here and in the Old World. The honourable member for Parkes, while professing himself desirous of considering the interests of those whom the Navigation Bill specially studies, is fearful that its provisions for the redress of the grievances of the seamen, engineers, and others, will result in coddling, and that that will create an evil greater than it is desired to remove. asking for, so far as the seamen are concerned, is merely better wages, better lighting, better accommodation, and better conditions generally, so that those who go to sea may live a more normal life, and enjoy conditions approaching more closely to those of the workers on land. This, in the mind of the honourable gentleman, is coddling. He told us that in trying to increase the comfort of the seamen, we are playing fast and loose with the laws of political economy, and that that will operate boomerang fashion, by injuring those we wish to help. the laws of political economy have been definitely ascertained, and are immutable ; as if there was no possibility of contradicthave regard to the provisions of the British ing the statements which had been laid down as laws. school of political economists does he abide? Ricardo, and their like? Jevons and Cliff Leslie? the historical school, or by those of the more advanced Socialistic school ? Socialistic school, by which class of that school ? istic schools? The honourable member for Parkes assumes that there is a definite and assured basis of thought upon which to work in dealing with this great problem, and that the moment we get away from it evil must result. .political economy that cannot be questioned, whether it be a law relating to rent, interest, profit, prices, or the Tariff. No one can say what is really the truth, and what great governing principles are the protective basis of society, what rules we,, as a Parliament, or society as a whole, should follow in attempting to redresssocial and economic wrongs. By interjection I asked the honourable member, whoseemed to feel that some reform is necessary, although fearing that we were going, too far and too' fast, what was the point of limitation. His reply was that he would wait until I had expressed myselfon the subject, and would listen with interest to what I had to say upon it. My point of limitation will be reached when the conditions of seamen in regard to wagesand comfort have placed them on a level with the average mechanic or worker in our great cities. From the beginning the condition of the seamen has been a deplorableBut what we are one. I view with much hope this attempt to place them in a better position, and shall vote for every clause that will tend to improve to the utmost the condition of the men of our mercantile marine. The honourable gentleman says that the tendency of this House has been more or less to chance the passing of provisions as to the constitutionality of which there has been some doubt, and to trust to their getting through the High Court. I admit that there is just a possibility that certain provisions in this Bill may be declared by the High Court to be ultra vires. The legal authorities of He spoke as if the House who have addressed themselves to this motion have recognised that in dealing with the question of navigation we must Merchant Shipping Act, and to the limitaBy the laws of which tion of our powers in respect of Intra-state trade. It is only by passing the Bill in By those of Adam Smith, its most complete form, however, that we By those of shall learn precisely what our powers are; By those of and it will be for the High Court to determine to what extent one part of the Bill is severable from another. The honourable member for Parkes.expressed the fear that if certain requirements were insisted upon, a great burden would be thrown upon shipowners. One of the matters to which he specially referred in this connection was the I accept the correction. provision as to the number of boats carried being in proportion to the number of the passengers and crew. He feels that that provision is not desirable, and be strongly opposes it. I have here a quotation from the public press regarding the recommendaBut there is no so-called law of tions made by Lord Mersey, the Commissioner appointed to inquire into the Titanic disaster.

23,Mr Howe,"B y which of the Socialshould have longitudinal and vertical bulkheads; also watertight bulkheads on each side of the ship; watertight decks above the waterline; and that searchlights should be carried. The Commissioner further recommends that lifeboats and rafts should be provided accordingto the number of persons carried, and not according to the tonnage of the vessel; more frequent boat, fire and watertight door drills; a police system on all ships to secure obedience; and that the wireless apparatus should be in use on ships night and day. I have also before me an article by the Secretary of the United States Navy, which appeared in the North American Review for June last, in which we have the following statement:First and foremost, then, laws should be at once enacted prescribing that no passenger steamer shall carry more persons on board, crew and passengers, than can be accommodated in the boats and on the life-rafts provided in the vessel's equipment. The Congress of the United States unquestionably has the power to enact such laws as applying to vessels flying fhe American (lag, and the further power to enact laws refusing clearance from any American port to any foreign vessel not complying with such laws. Federal inspection of all vessels would be necessary to see that the laws are enforced. Every member of the crew and every passenger embarking in an ocean-going vessel should be assigned to a certain boat or raft, and should be informed of his assignment; each passage ticket should designate the boat to which the holder is assigned, and there should be, in each state-room, a diagram of the ship showing the location of the boat, the deck from which loaded, and the route by which it could be reached. On the following page the writer continuesThe watertight subdivisions of the United States naval vessels of recent construction are sucb that no ordinary accident can seriously endanger'them; while at sea all doors and other openings in watertight bulkheads are kept closed except such as must be open for the service of the ship; all these can be closed in a few seconds when the danger signal is given. I put these statements by the Secretary of the United States Navy and the British Commissioner appointed to inquire into the Titanic disaster in juxtaposition to the contention raised by the honourable member for Parkes, who is evidently very much afraid that some of .the requirements of this Bill will operate against the profits of the shipowners. I am not concerned about the question of profits. The honourable member has said that to institute these reforms will merely be to place an additional burden -upon the public. however, is the first essential; and if fair provision is not being made for life and property at sea, then the general community are getting their present service too cheaply, and in their interests we should . see that such requirements are insisted upon as will give greater security. The honourable member for East Sydney by interjection said, "" This Bill may prove unconstitutional."" I have already touched upon that phase of the question. I know that there is a difference of opinion amongst the lawyers in the House we shall not know whether any part of it is unconstitutional or not. take up; and I hope we shall pass it with as little amendment as possible. There is very little in it that will not be beneficial, not only to the seamen, but to the community at large. The honourable member for Kooyong raised a point quite in harmony with the view taken by the honourable member for Parkes. Towards the close of his speech he saidWhile we are all anxious to improve the lot of the seaman generally, we cannot ignore the fact that others have rights and vested interests which must to some extent be protected. The question is, to what extent must they be protected? The honourable member was much more liberal in his treatment of this measure than was the honourable member for Parkes; but this statement shows that even in his mind there has arisen the fear that by granting these concessions to seamen we may affect the vested interests of the shipping trade, and that ship-owners will not receive the profits they have hitherto secured. I am particularly pleased with that part of the Bill which deals with our coasting trade. In seeking to conserve to ourselves, as far as possible, our coastal trade, we are doing that which will help in a most material manner to build up an Australian mercantile marine. There is a great tendency to-day for tramp vessels, manned by seamen at very low rates of pay, and working under the most objectionable conditions, to come along our coast and to take freights from one port to another at cut-throat rates. They menace in the most pronounced way the interests of the Australian mercantile marine. I therefore view with much pleasure the attempt made in this Bill to prevent the continuance The security of life, of that sort of thing-to establish conditions relating to our coastal trade that will be favorable to the men, and to make all vessels desiring to trade on this coast work",17,Navigation Bill Second Reading
24,Mr Tudor,But unless we pass the Bill,18,Navigation Bill Second Reading
25,Mr Howe,"That is the attitude Iunder those conditions, instead of indulging in that cut-throat policy which has been in vogue, not only on the Australian coast, hut wherever these tramp vessels have been free to go. In this respect, we are doing only what most trading countries have already done. Such countries, in most instances, have conserved to themselves their own coastal trade, and in this respect we are doing great good to the whole community. A feature of this Bill which appeals to me is the provision that it .makes for surveys. I have here scraps taken from plates and frames of vessels while undergoing a yearly survey, and I invite honourable members to examine them. Reform in this respect is most desirable. At one time, in New South Wales, bi-annual surveys were made. Under this Bill, it is proposed that an annual survey shall be made of every vessel not more than five years old, and that all other vessels shall be surveyed every six months. I know from experience that a bi-annual survey is most desirable. I have worked in dockyards, and have seen what has been done. Mr Samuel Smith, a member of the New South Wales Parliament, did most beneficial service in connection with the navigation laws of that State by seeing for himself the conditions under which vessels went to sea, and these scraps of metal taken from the frames and plates of vessels undergoing survey, between 1910 and the present time, should illustrate the neceswith surveys. sity for careful surveys being made. Amongst these samples will be found pieces of plate, almost eaten away with rust, that were taken from ships' bottoms. The slightest touch with a hammer would have dislocated the whole plate. Then, again, honourable members will find amongst these samples portions of frames so eaten with rust as not to be a quarter of an inch thick. These should illustrate the fact that a survey only once in twelve months, in the case of vessels over five years old, is not desirable from the stand-point of the public well-being. samples taken from ships in active service? going surveys in Sydney. eighth of an inch thick. . Parliament some years ago that some of the plates on certain vessels were no thicker than a jam tin. tically to that effect before the Commission. It was shown that, more particularly in the case of vessels that have to cross sandy bars, such as those on the New South Wales coast, the wear and tear on a ship's bottom was equal to an eighth of an inch in six months. In most cases the plates on such vessels have to be made as light as possible. Very often they are only three-eights of an inch thick, so that in twelve months a quarter of an inch of plate would be worn away, and a vessel would be travelling with plates three-sixteenths of an inch thick on its bottom. We shall be doing good service to the community by requiring a six months survey, and I hope that no attempt will be made by honourable members to so amend the Bill as to provide for annual instead of biannual surveys. I fully agree, also, with the proposals of the Bill to provide for the employment of three classes of surveyorsa shipwright's surveyor, a hull surveyor, and an engineering surveyor. I have felt for some time that the surveyor appointed under existing circumstances is not always the most competent to carry out survey work. Generally, he is a man who has served as a ship's captain or a first mate, and who, having retired from the sea, has obtained employment as a surveyor, and bas gone, at times, ineffectively to work in connection So far as the examination of a ship's hull is concerned, no one is better fitted than is a boilermaker to do the work. Having had to deal practically with boiler plates, he knows very well whether a plate is safe or not. I have seen huge lumps of cement dumped into a plate, with the object of giving it some solidity, before the shipping surveyor came along. Later on, the surveyor, who had practically no knowledge of tbe sound of a solid iron plate, would tap the defective plate, and believe that he was hitting a solid piece of metal instead of a piece of cement. 1 I have known these things to be done Buti f you have a boiler-maker with a competent knowledge of what a steel or iron plate is, backed up with that further technical knowledge which will be developed by his examination before he gets his certificate, you will have an efficient surveyor for the hull of a vessel. The same thing again certainly applies to machinery. I , therefore, welcome the change embodied in the Bill in connection with the surveying of vessels. So far as",18,Navigation Bill Second Reading

31,Mr Howe,"Evidenc e was given pracconcerns the question of the benefits to the seamen themselves, I fail to see that any member of the House can take legitimate or reasonable exception to what we purpose 'doing. Any man who has been in the forecastle knows the vile and unhealthy conditions under which the men generally exist. There is certainly room for reform there. The stench of a forecastle, as a rule, is appalling. I have been in them time and again, and have always been glad and eager to get out. We are giving the seamen 140 cubic feet of air each; but, after all, what does that amount to? A space 6 feet by 3 feet by 8 feet contains 144 cubic feet, which is a little over what we have allowed; and it cannot be held that that space is too much. Further, there is a great lack of lighting, and there is need for reform in that direction; while there is certainly no accommodation or means whereby the men can keep themselves in fairly healthy condition by washing. simply disgraceful and disgusting; and I think that every man, especially a medical man, who has looked into the question admits that reform is most essential. Still, we have, the outcry that ship-owners have spent large sums of money to bring their vessels reasonably up to date, and we are asked if we mean to compel them to spend more on further improving them. I say, decidedly. If these men must perform these services for the community; if shipping is a necessity, and trade and commerce are essential to the progress of a country -as we know they are-the men who are doing the work should have decent conditions in which to do it, and those they have not to-day. So far as regards crimping, reform is again most desirable, and I hope the Minister will stick to his proposals. I have heard repeatedly from shipping companies and their officers of the desirableness of the companies themselves engaging the men on the vessels, or at their offices. I contend that that would be most undesirable, inasmuch as hitherto the companies have been prepared to take men under any conditions and supplied by any one. If we permit what they suggest to be done, we shall simply have a repetition of the evils of the past, as I have seen them myself in Newcastle; and even in Sydney. worse port in the world for that. events. I hope the Minister will stand by the proposition that the men shall be engaged and sign on only at the shipping office. If the honourable gentleman fails to insist on that, the evil of crimping will not be abolished, but will continue as in the past in a most vile and objectionable way. Trade is very strict on that point. Board of Trade is concerned, I compliment the Administration on the fact that they have turned down a great number of its suggestions. A close examination of them has shown me that in nearly every case where the Board of Trade has offered suggestions it has . been concerned more with its own interests and the interests of British shipping than with the interests of shipping on the Australian coast. I am glad that those who drafted this Bill have had the courage to turn down the majority of those suggestions, and stand by the recommendations of our Royal Commission. In the The conditions in that regard are matter of advance notes again, a desirable reform beneficial to the men is being made. I have seen advance notes issued in Sydney. I have been in company with men who had the notes, and have seen them pass to dealers in Sussex, Kent, and Erskine streets, by whom they were discounted at the rate of about 50 per cent. I know for a positive fact that this discount has been afterwards shared between the dealers and the captains of the vessels. If the Minister eliminates this sort of thing, he will be doing an excellent work, and performing a great service to the men, and, on the top of that, there is the question of the man getting his month's pay. Pay him two-thirds of his money and he will want no advance notes. He will have his money in his pocket, and can spend it as he likes. It is possible that he may spend it in drink; but, at any rate, he will have what is legitimately his own, and there will be no possibility of any one taking advantage of his necessities to sponge upon or rob him. In this regard, therefore, we have another reform which I very much welcome. Another matter on which I shall touch is the Australian trade as relating to fapua. Representations have been made by the inhabitants of the Possession that the application of the Act in its present ferm to Papua will be a great menace to them. They say that if the foreign vessels calling there are not allowed to trade to their ports unless they carry white crews, or pay a black crew white men's wages, which they will not do, the result will be that , the vessels will not call",19,Navigation Bill Second Reading

35,Mr Howe,"S o far as the Britishthere, and that they will be injured, because those vessels bring from the East large quantities of rice, which is the staple food of the employees on the island. I admit that there is something in the contention, but I have reason to believe that the quantity of stuff carried by these companies from the East to Papua is such as .would pay them, even if they carried white crews. Papua is practically on their line of route between Singapore and other Eastern ports, and any of the Australian ports from Brisbane down to Sydney, and I think that, even with a white crew, they could call at Papuan ports and supply the Papuan people with their requirements. there not such a thing as subsidizing a white company to do the work? At present there is one Australian company trading to the East, and calling at the ports of Papua; but it uses coloured crews on its vessels. I believe it would be ready, if subsidized to the extent, say, of the difference between the cost of a coloured and a white crew, to give Papua a service that would meet the situation adequately if the other shipping companies refused to call. I hope that, if it is found by the Government that there is a likelihood of the foreign companies refusing to continue the Papuan trade, they will take into consideration the advisableness of giving a subsidy to the local shipping company. I do not want it to be too much. I do not wish to create a monopoly; but if such a situation arises, a subsidy such as I have mentioned might well be offered with benefit to the purpose we have in view in connection with our navigation laws, and that is to make the whole of our mercantile marine white, so far is it is possible. To attain that end, I think we should make some little sacrifices. Bill goes into Committee, I shall be able from time to time to help to make it, if posan old tub of a ship which may or may not sible, more effective. member finds difficulties in the way, or sees opportunity for additional reform, or, perhaps, finds some provision too stringent, I trust that I shall be able to add my little word and thought here and there to make the Bill as effective as I hope it will be. I look forward to the passage of this measure with a great deal of hope. I believe it is one of the best that has ever come before this Parliament. It has been pending long enough. Let us get it through this session, and I believe it will be a credit, not been boarded off with planks on end intoonly to the Labour party, but to the whole House, and a benefit to the community.. Mr Howe. very satisfactory that we are at last considering such an important measure as is now before the House, after having waited for it so long. I believe that it is something that the country requires very much indeed. It may be said that in some respects it leads the way, and perhaps takes us further than has yet been attempted. I think the Bill as a whole represents a very praiseworthy attempt, not only to bring the shipping legislation of Australia up to datein all respects, but to a certain extent to create precedents that other nations may very well follow. The measure is of conEven if it be not so, is siderable significance in more ways than one. It indicates that Australian shipping has at last reached a position of considerable importance, and that its future is to be watched with a good deal of interest and care by this Legislature, to whom the subject is intrusted. I remember when Australian shipping was by no means in the satisfactory position that it occupies at the present day. Somewhat over twenty years ago I made my first trip across the Bight to Western Australia, and the circumstances of that trip will, I think, never fade from my memory so long as I live. I had then a first inkling of the fact that while the Australian States may have legislated in regard to shipping, the carrying out of the law was by no means equal to what I well believe were the good intentions of the legislators. I saw then for the first time in my life how the law can be practically flouted and ignored, and that experience has created in my mind a certain critical attitude towards matters of navigation and shipping that has caused me to take more interest inI hope and trust that when this this measure than I might possibly otherwise have done. We crossed the Bight in If any honourable have been up to date at some period of itshistory, but certainly was very much below even average conditions at that time. It was fitted up for not more than 100 passengers at any rate, and there were onboard some 500 or 600 men. I paid for that trip more than is paid now for a first class passage to Fremantle, and when I got aboard and was shown my berth, I was somewhat surprised. I and a companionwere taken down to the 'tween deck, the whole length and breadth of which had spaces of about 6 feet by 2 feet. line ?",20,Navigation Bill Second Reading

The boards were roughly nailed together, reminding one of so many hog pens, which may be seen in stock markets in various parts of the world. These were our bunks, and we had to step very gingerly over the ends of the planks to reach a particular pen. When, as not infrequently happened, some of the men had been enjoying themselves at the bar, and were rather late in finding their pens, their steps were liable to disturb :Somewhat roughly the repose of any unfortunate person who happened to have -retired a little earlier. the ship? the name of the ship, because things have improved very much since those days. and perhaps, a matter of necessity than -choice that this particular ship was employed on the voyage. However, we got -safely to the journey's end, though not without one or two somewhat exciting adventures. I remember that we were a good many days in the Bight, battened down most of the time, and it was, indeed, a -treat when we were allowed to emerge into 'the fresh air. Since those days very remarkable strides have been made in con-nexion with Australian shipping. We now see, travelling all round our coasts, vessels around our coasts does not tend to whole-that compare favourably with any to be found in other parts of the world. When we remember that this development has 'been almost entirely carried out by means -of the profits made in this trade, with, in very few cases, the addition of extra outside capital, it must be confessed that the ship-owners have had such a run of prosperity generally as I think is not easy to ""be found elsewhere. The carriage of both goods and passengers has been growing, especially between Western Australia and the -eastern-States, in a most remarkable way; and the prosperity of fhe ship-owners and merchants in the eastern States is to a very large degree due to the development which 'has taken place in the western State during the last twenty years. I am rather proud, -of the fact that such is the case; and I believe that even such development as we !have seen is only a faint indication of the -future that lies before the Australian shipping trade. We are fully justified in bringing such measures as this forward in anti* cipation that the trade will be of such a character as to enable it to hold, in many respects, the fo?emost position in the history of shipping throughout the world. We are undoubtedly going a long way in certain directions in providing for, not only the comfort, but even the luxury of' men employed on ships; and I , for one, have no hesitation whatever in committing myself to the support of legislation of the kind. I have seen, time and again, the almost barbarous conditions under which seamen have had to live; and I heartily welcome this measure as a step in the right direction, which will not only tend to the betterment of the men, but will give us, undoubtedly, a more efficient service, both for the ship-owners and for those who trade with them. There is one feature of Australian maritime trade of which I am very pleased to remind the House. It is the fact that, on the whole, I believe that it was more, our shipping has been carried on with remarkably few calamities. During all the years of the bustling trade between the eastern States and Western Australia there have been only one or two comparatively insignificant accidents, attended with slight loss of life. It is true that, in one or two other quarters,' we have had lamentable disasters; but, on the whole, Australian shipping has been remarkably free from the wholesale trouble that we see occasionally in other parts of the world. It may be that the nature of the seas sale disaster; at any rate, on the greater part of our shores, the waters, though not unfrequently stormy, do not appear to have that hurricane character which, time and again, elsewhere bring' disaster on a dozen or more vessels at a time. I take it, therefore, that we must regard Australian shipping generally, in these times at least, as of a character that gives a fair amount of assurance that the best is being done for the safety of the shipping' and the passengers, and in the interests of the ship-owners themselves. While I readily concede so much, I feel it my duty to emphasize some features in connection with the shipwrecks of late years on the Australian coast. There was the wreck of the Yongala, on or about the 23rd March, 1911, between Mackay and Townsville; and the wreck of the Koom'bana, on the 20th March, 1912, between Point Hedland and",21,Navigation Bill Second Reading

42,Mr Fowler,"I do not think so,Broome, on the Western Australian coast. There is a remarkable similarity between these two disasters. wrecked almost in the same parallel of latitude, namely, the twentieth; they went down under circumstances that have not been ascertained with any degree of precision; and, worse feature of all, every soul on board was lost. This takes me a little farther back to the disaster of the Waratah, which was lost between Durban and Capetown on 28th July, 1909. Although not in the same latitude, still, there are certain circumstances connected with that wreck which identify it with the other two I have mentioned. The Waratah went down in a severe gale, though it has not been precisely ascertained what fate overtook her; and, again, all hands were lost. have been Courts of Inquiry in connection with each of these wrecks; and I have gone through the voluminous report connected with the Waratah, and the much shorter reports connected with the Yongala and the Koombana. I must confess that each and all of these reports is somewhat unsatisfactory ; that in connection with the Waratah being perhaps the least unsatisfactory of the three. As to the Yongala and the Koombana, any one Teading the reports must come to the conclusion that the inquiries were unsatisfactory, not so much on account of the evidence produced, as on account of the evidence that was kept back, or, at least, did not reach the Court. constituted by no means of experts, at least in Australia; and a mass of evidence is brought forward, generally in the interests of the shipping companies, to show that the owners are entirely blameless in regard to a wreck. I do not for one moment insinuate that ship-owners in these days would deliberately take risks that may ultimately lead to the loss of their vessels with crew and passengers; no such position, I think, could be taken up by the severest critic of shipping conditions at the present time. Nevertheless, to any one who goes through the reports I have mentioned, there must appear a suspicion that a good deal of the evidence is of a more or less restrained character. For instance, those employed by the shipping companies are hardly likely to say anything that would be more or less unpleasant to their employers ; and there are officials, not directly Finallyconnected with the shipping companies, but frequently brought into contact with them, Mr Fowler. who may have a more or less human hesitation in saying exactly what they know. The vessels were We know that in connection with English shipping, the Board of Trade is supreme. The ghastly wreck of the Titanic, which has appalled the whole of the civilized world, has brought out some very strong criticism indeed of the shipping authorities of the United Kingdom. In the Review of Reviews for June of the present year there are some statements of an almost sensational character regarding the inefficiency of the Board of Trade in carrying out the duties imposed on it. The article is headed "" The Board of Trade in the Dock -Mend it or End ita Patriotic Duty."" I do not propose to read the whole of the article, but merely one or two short exTheie tracts, in order to show the attitude of the writer-a n attitude which, by the way, has been adopted by several other writers with more or less emphasis since the disaster to the Titanic. This is the first quotationNo wonder Mr Douglas Hall said in the Board of Trade debate, "" We who have hitherto led the legislation and the regulations of the world in all shipping matters are in the humiliating position of having the finger of scorn, pointed at us by every other nation on account of our obsolete rules and regulations. Then, againNor is this idle talk when we see what is thecomposition of the Merchant Shipping Advisory Committee, that mainstay and protection of the President of the Board of Trade. There are eight ship-owners, two underwriters, two shipbuilders, two shipmasters, two engineer officers, In such inquiries, the Court is and two men representing the seamen's and firemen's union. The two additional members co-opted by the Government were a shipbuilder and a representative of ship-owners. The committee thus represents ship-owners' interests, or people who are in the business to make money out of the conveyance of passengers and cargo. There is no representation of passengers or public. Is it a wonder that the House of Commonsis known amongst the officers of our merchant service as "" The Ship-owners' smoke-room"" ? But the most damning thing about this Shipowners' Council of Ten is that its sittings are in secret, and reports of its proceedings are not made public. Such a state of things tends toreassure the travelling public that their safety will never be allowed to interfere with the interests of ship-owners. AgainIs there any ray of hope for the passenger?"" Apparently none, since behind the ship-ownersthere are the insurance brokers, and it must never be forgotten that the day of the unsinkable ship means the end of marine insurance. We do not wonder, after all this, that the inspection of vessels is a mere farce in nine cases out of ten. We should be surprised were it otherwise.

People acquainted with shipping will tell honourable members, as they have told me, that in the seventies and the eighties a type of vessel that has since been entirely discontinued was favoured and largely built. narrow, deep type of vessel. A very large proportion of such ships met with disaster, and as the result of further inquiries the stability and seaworthiness of the type were so seriously questioned that the construction of vessels of this class has. been almost entirely discontinued. During late years we have had another modification, apd a modification which ought to be challenged by experts in a way that does not seem yet to have been done. to the construction of one deck on top of another which, with their array of cabins, undoubtedly give a weight that will lower the metacentre of a ship in some cases almost to the point of gravity, if , indeed, it does not lower it beproper distribution of cargo has much to low that point. I have no desire to use scientific terms in discussing the matter of .stability, but I may say briefly that there is a method of ascertaining a ship's stability which, I think, is adopted in the case of all vessels built in British shipyards. The centre of gravity having been ascertained, what is known as the metacentre is calculated, and when these two points are-known the stability of a ship can be stated to an exact degree. however, is always determined under strictly neutral conditions, and I con-, tend that in the possibilities of wind action on a ' ship with a towering superstructure we have a factor that does not seem to "" be taken into consideration with the question of stability. The Waratah, for instance, carried above her main deck a spar deck, a promenade deck, and a boat deck. three superstructures, and with regard to all of them the position was further endangered by the fact that they did not run clear from one side of the vessel to the other. blocked by structures running along the keel-structure s in the nature of cabins to provide accommodation for passengers and officers. I do not remember exactly the nature of the superstructure in the case of either the Yongala or the Koombana, but in this respect both were of the same type as the Waratah. While seamen have been industriously coached into the belief that , the increasing height of a vessel above the water-line does not endanger her stability, there is nevertheless a factor in this increasing height, which, even the veriest tyro can see, does interfere seriously with it. We have only to consider for a moment the leverage exerted by any weight I refer to the long, placed at some height above the centre of gravity of any object to understand that anything of such a character raised above the centre of gravity, in a ship must, tend to endanger her stability. During; the preliminary inquiry into the wreck of the Koombana, an official before the Court was askedThere is a popular fallacy that a ship havingher top hamperThe reference was to the Koombana's top I refer hamperis unsafe. That was a peculiar way of putting the question-it was put by way of assertion -and the answer was, "" It is a question of the proper distribution of cargo."" The do with the stability of a vessel. But over and above the distribution of cargo, and the quantity of cargo carried underneath the centre of gravity, we must not forget that anything weighty carried over the centre of gravity must necessarily interfere, with that stability. tralize it. effect of the weight beneath the centre of gravity. Hence the reason for the rigid rules and regulations regarding the quantity of deck cargo to be carried on almost any vessel. The quantity is strictly regulated, and in some cases deck cargo is prohibited because it is universally recognised that it seriously interferes with a ship's stability. There is no doubt that, She thus had other things being equal, a ship having a high freeboard is safer than one with a low freeboard. A high freeboard, however, is entirely different from a high superstructure. When we speak of the The passage of wind was freeboard of a ship we have in mind",25,Navigation Bill Second Reading

52,"This, Mr Fowler","It will neutralize thethat portion of the main structure which runs clear out of the water to the main deck. Considering tliis freeboard, there is nothing to catch the wind. As a matter of fact, when such a vessel heels over, the wind will slide along the side, and the further she heels the less force and effect the wind will have on her, always assuming that she has no superstructure. When we come to consider the superstructure added above the main deck, we have the whole crux of the question. anced by depth of hold? is; but in a. ship with a given depth of hold, carrying a given cargo, whatever weight is placed above the centre of gravity will by that amount neutralize the weight carried below, and the point in connection with this matter of stability is always to keep what is known as the metacentre well above the centre of gravity. In the case of the Waratah, one scientific passenger who was on board the vessel on the trip previous to the one on which she went down, seriously questioned her stability, because, from his observation, he concluded that her metacentre practically coincided with her centre of gravity, and that she was neutral, as he called it ; that is, that it would take a mere matter of a ton or two, either of windpressure or of cargo, to carry her over from port to starboard, or vice versa, and give her a permanent list on either side. I am told that whilst the Waratah was coaling at Albany the men had to shift their tram line some ten times, or perhaps more, while she was taking in 150 tons of coal. The ship stood so much on her neutral centre that her trim was affected by the few tons of coal that were alternately put on one side or the other. A ship of that kind, standing as she did so tenderly, must have been in a position to be affected very strongly by wind-pressure, apart altogether from the question as to whether she was carrying any cargo or coal above her centre of gravity. In the case of the Waratah, it was shown that she had taken in a large amount of coal, and that her bunkers ran up into one of her superstructures, and that consequently, if she was full up to the top of those coal shoots, she was carrying a weight, which must seriously have endangered her stability. Apart from that altogether, I contend that there is a feature in connection with the wreck of these ships that has. not yet been considered, and that probably accounts for the loss of one and all of them. That feature is the wind-pressurs on these superstiuctures. It must be remembered that the Yongala and the Koottbana went down in hurricanes or cyclores, in which the wind blows at the rate of 90 miles an hour or even more, and has a pressure of 40 lbs. to the square foot. The pressure of such a wind on the clean hull of a vessel would be very little when she happened to be thrown over by the force of the waves, but when you remembei that,' ' perhaps, she had two or more decks built exactly on the principle of the box-kitein other words, built so as to give the wind its greatest pushing force-yo u begin to realize that if she were caught broadside on by a hurricane blowing 90 miles an hour, the force of the wind on her superstructure must have been something enormous. I put to one of the ablest professional men in connection with Australian shipping, this question"" Do you think that a ship like the Koombana, with her superstructure, if caught broadside on by the cyclone, was likely to stand up under the effect of it, remembering always that the wind-pressure would be 40 lbs. to the square foot ?"" He thought for a little, and then said deliberately, "" Assuming that the vessel was broadside on to a heavy sea, and that the wind was blowing into her superstructure with the force that you indicate, the probability is that she capsized."" I have seen nothing in this measure to indicate that consideration is being given, so far as regards the stability of ships, to the question of wind pressure on a towering superstructure, and I feel satisfied, as the result of my inquiries, that here is precisely the feature that was responsible for the three disasters I have indicated. tanks were empty, the condition would be made still worse. tures that no doubt contributed to the disasters. Whilst provision is being made to secure stability for a ship under neutral conditions in the arrangement of water tanks and so on, no consideration appears to have been given so far to the matter of wind pressure on superstructures, and that is the question which I am anxious to emphasize to the House at the present juncture. It is to be regretted that in this Bill we have practically only two clauses dealing with the stability and seaworthiness of ships. The measure seems to have been devoted",26,Navigation Bill Second Reading

The interests of passengers are dealt with only in a very perfunctory fashion, and even such portions of the Bill as do relate to the safety of the ship and passengers are, to my mind, very ineffective, and do not state definitely what is desired as the minimum of safety. For instance, clause 211 providesA ship shall not be deemed seaworthy under this Act unless(a) she is in a fit state as to condition of hull and equipment, boilers and machinery, stowage of ballast or cargo, number and qualifications of crew, including officers, and in every other respect, to encounter the ordinary perils of the voyage then entered upon; and (4) she is not overloaded. This leaves to any official the important consideration as to whether the ship is in a fit state or not. He has no criterion to guide him as to what he shall do to ascertain whether she is fit. He is undoubtedly given to understand that hull and equipment, boilers and machinery, and stowage of ballast and cargo, must all be regarded ; but the provision requiring the ship to be in a fit state is so indefinite that it is practically of little use. An official intrusted with the supervision of ships may regard a certain vessel as in a fit state, when, as a matter of fact, she is very far from being so. It is our duty, if possible, to lay down some definite lines as to what shall constitute safety and seaworthiness, over and above anything that we have in this Bill. wish to read, in conclusion, a portion of the finding of the Court of Inquiry into the loss of the Waratah, and this passage is undoubtedly of very grave significance to us in relation to the disasters to which I have referredThe Court does not desire to travel outside fects in our marine architecture-defect s the scope of its functions as a tribunal inquirwhich have a tendency to increase, rather ing into a specific casualty, but in view of than to diminish, owing to the growing dethe great prominence which the question of stamands on the accommodation of ships. bility has assumed at this inquiry, feels it not out of place to suggest whether it may not be The information imparted by the honourable possible, with the help of a committee of ex-member \\\\T, I have no doubt, be fully perts appointed for that purpose, to arrive at appreciated by the Minister of Trade and some conclusions concerning the minimum staCustoms, and be noted, with a view to bility requirements of different types of vessel consistent with safety at sea.

While they regretted the absence of much information that they thought should have been available, and put it on record that the inquiry was more or less unsatisfactory in certain respects, they have also stated their conviction that there is great necessity for some further work to insure the stability and safety of vessels at sea. In regard to three wrecks, I bave shown a remarkable chain of coincidence, which goes far to justify me in asserting' that there was something radically wrong. I have indicated enough to justify the Government making inquiries into the effects of wind pressure, particularly of hurricanes, on the broadside of vessels with such superstructures as those which went down. If inquiry be made, and the necessary calculations are instituted as to the necessary wind pressure, it will be found that .a grave element of danger has been neglected. I have no doubt that it was this cause that led to the three wrecks; and, though I do not desire to pose as an alarmist, we have vessels travelling along our coast many of which have to run at certain seasons into the most violent winds that prevail on any part of the globe. The possible effects of the pressure of wind on these towering superstructures should be investigated, and the Government should take such steps as may be necessary to provide a limit of safety in connection with all vessels carrying passengers above the main I deck.

57,Mr W. Elliot Johnson (Lang),"the constitutional lawyers in this Chamber; but there are other features of the Bill, and some that seem to have been overlooked, that require discussion with a view to the improvement of the provisions. For instance, it seems to me that the steamship companies on our coast may with impunity absolutely disregard the rights of passengers. Recently, with a number of other honourable members, I had occasion to travel up the coast on a locally-owned vessel ; and all of us had noted that when this and other vessels first entered on the trade of Australia, the passenger accommodation was made a great feature in the newspaper descriptions at the time. orable member refer to? have to mention the name, I may say that it was the Wyandra, though there are one or two others that I may have to refer to, and my remarks are applicable to quite a considerable number of others. As I was saying, a feature is made in the newspapers of the great attention that is paid to the comfort and convenience of passengers, who are led to believe that there is a certain amount of deck space, and so forth, always at their disposal. When passengers go on board, however, it not infrequently happens that a great deal of the promenade deck space in all classes is largely occupied with cargo. Wyandra, for example, portions of the saloon promenade deck were filled with cases of fruit right up to the awning, and it was impossible to pass from there to the afterpart of the ship without clambering over cargo. motor cars, motor boats, buggies, and all sorts of cargo hampering the intervening space. In the fore part of the ship, the whole of the space, with the exception of a small portion of the hatch, was occupied with huge pieces of machinery, girders, windmills, and so forth; and the passengers had practically no promenade space at all, except half of the forehatch. This state of affairs ought not to be permitted to continue. It seems to me that there is an utter disregard of the comfort and convenience of passengers, to say nothing of the serious danger involved in case of accident. be carried on deck at all. Every ton of cargo so carried affects the stability of a ship not designed to carry deck cargo. Difficult as it must be, even for those accustomed to the sea, to climb over intervening obstacles in a gale of wind, when a ship may be in danger, we can imagine what must be the difficulties of int experienced people, perhaps suffering from mal-de-mer, and the further difficulties in handling boats or life-saving gear under such conditions. I found that, although there were life belts in some cabins, there were none in others; there were no life belts in the cabin I occupied, and I drew the steward's attention to the fact. I do not know what is the system adopted for the official inspection of these passenger vessels; but the duty appears to me to be carried out in a very perfunctory, fashion. One case came under my personal observation, where a ship was supposed to undergo a periodical survey for the renewal of her certificate. I happened to meet the inspecting officer as he was going off to inspect the ship, and in a little more than half-anhour afterwards I met him again, and found that the vessel was supposed to have been inspected in the meantime, although the officer had to go out into the stream. It is true that this was a comparatively new ship, and well found; but it is quite obvious that nothing like even a most cursory examination of all parts could possibly have been accomplished in the time. This is the way, however, I am afraid, a great deal of the inspection work is carried on On the On our trip along the coast we had occasion to travel in the Warrego, a vessel, I believe, subsidized to carry the mails from Brisbane to ports' in the Gulf of Carpentaria as far as Burketown.

I strongly advise you, Mr Speaker, not to travel in the Warrego during the hurricane months. I do not think that the vessel is good enough to risk so valuable a life in. Accommodation that was supposed to be exclusively for passengers was occupied with cargo of all descriptions, and in the well between the break of the saloon deck and the forecastle head were large steel girders, windmill machinery, and the like; also bar iron, angle iron, timber, and cases of kerosene piled high above the ship's rail. As a vessel discharges at intermediate ports she becomes lighter, and her lightness is increased by the coal consumption. Thus the deck hamper tends more and more to affect her stability. Things are all right while the sea is smooth, and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred nothing happens; but. finally disaster comes, and the community is shocked by a catastrophe that could have been averted with ordinary precautions. The loss of the Koombana, the Yongala, and other frightful disasters on our coast call for imperative legislative action to insure a more reasonable regard for safety of life at sea. The Warrego was crowded with passengers, and I got a berth only through the courtesy of the pilot, who allowed me to share his cabin, giving me the upper bunk. The iron sheeting of the deck above me was riddled with holes, stuffed with putty, and painted over. You could push your thumb through some of them.

All coasting vessels travelling long distances and carrying large numbers of passengers should certainly be provided with medical officers, for one never knows when emergencies will arise at sea calling for medical and surgical assistance. That provision, however, should relate perhaps only to vessels carrying passengers, and having a continuous run of upwards of 600 miles, since vessels having a run of less than 600 miles are usually in and out of,port at very short intervals. Whilst we desire to provide for passengers and crews in all respects, we do not wish to impose needless expense 01* ship-owners, and if a medical officer is not necessary-and I do not think he would be in the case of a vessel making a run of less than 600 miles-w e should not insist on him being carried.

The position is not . so bad in the case of steamers, because they are constantly drawing on their coal supply, and thus gradually lightening their load. Sailing vessels are differently situated, however, and I would ask the Minister to consider the desirableness of insisting upon the observance of the winter North Atlantic load-line in the case of vessels loading for voyages around Cape Horn for foreign ports to reach which they have to meet the winter gales of the North Atlantic Ocean. As to the question -where the mark should ordinarily be placed, I think that we ought to adhere to the principle observed in placing the Plimsoll mark. The Plimsoll mark is now calculated on a certain number of tables, which have been most carefully compiled. A desire was shown on the part of a member of another place to provide in the Bill for an alteration of the present load-line. He desired that the place of the Plimsoll mark should be measured from the underneath side of the deck, instead of from the original deck level. uniform system among all the leading marieven in that case, the loading is not always time nations? but there has been an effort to have a designer in Messrs. Harland and Wolf's parture made in this Bill. to guard against anything of the kind. that there was an ever increasing danger,, The tendency of modern ship construction in connection with our modern passenger is towards danger, not from overloading, steam-ship architecture, to further and furbut from insufficient loading, or too much ther reduce the stability that used to mark, top hamper.

In the case of a vessel that is subsequently sheathed with wood, the deckline is apparently altered, but, as a matter of fact, it is not, because the sheathing does not affect her tonnage in the slightest degree. It does not equip her to carry a ton of cargo more dian she carried before. It is only an extra precaution to prolong her life. perts? seriously proposed by an honourable senator that an alteration should be made in this regard. but he is still trying, and I hope that he will not be successful, because, whilst I appreciate the motive underlying his action, I think that he was mistaken, and that if his suggestion were carried out, we should add another to the already sufficiently large number of dangers with which sea-going people have to contend. The tendency now is not towards overloading so much as it is towards underloading. That point has been emphasized by the honourable member for Perth State steamers. Oversea vessels are generally well loaded. on right lines. While in Belfast last year,. I desire yards on this very subject.

The greater the speed required, the greater the length, and the narrower the beam in proportion. Then, again, increased passenger accommodation cannot be obtained below, but must be above, the water line, deck cabins being mostly in demand, and consequently superstructures have to be provided."" The superstructures are all right under normal conditions, and would be all right even under some abnormal conditions, provided certain other conditions were fulfilled, but the neglect of any of those conditions upsets all calculations. Sitting suspended, from i to 2.15 p.m. regard to the load-line, the general tendency now is for steam-ships to move about under-loaded rather than overloaded. The daily coal consumption and water consumption on a steamer has the effect of daily lightening her draught and increasing her freeboard above the water-line. Consequently, we have to guard against danger of topheavinessa danger that is being constantly increased by the tendency to Ibuild higher and higher superstructures above the actual deck-line. All these superstructures are an added source of danger to ships in heavy weather, especially with a beam wind and a beam sea. The deck awnangs and deck houses, being rigidly built, offer a powerful resistance to the wind, the wind pressure acting as a lever to force the ship over to a greater angle than would otherwise be the case; and when the loading is lighter the tendency of the pressure -to turn the ship over becomes correspondingly greater. There is no doubt that this 'has led to the loss of a number of vessels, -not only on the Australian coast, but elsewhere. Another danger is added by means of the system of watertight compartments, which were originally designed as a means of carrying water ballast, and as affording additional security in case the vessel struck a submerged obstacle. The cellular space was thought to be a great advance, and it was believed that if the vessel struck a rock or ran aground only the outer skin would be injured. The space is divided into watertight compartments running in many -cases only transversely across the ship, with no longitudinal sections, and, when the tanks are not quite full, the water will rush from one side to the other as the ship r-rolls, and so affect her stability. think it is desirable to have at least one longitudinal dividing section, and preferably more. I had some expeiience of sea life in my younger days. I qualified for second officer, and served my time at sea, but I was mostly in sailing ships. My first voyage was in a little barque, of only about 350 tons net register, round Cape Horn. We had, I think, scarcely more than 3 feet of freeboaid, and were hove to for a couple of months in the dead of winter off Cape Horn, where, I think, the seas are very much higher tnan in any other part of the world. She happened, however, to be a well-built, flush deck ship, and well loaded. In my time the chief officer was the man who was held responsible for the proper loading of the ship. He knew where every package of cargo was stowed, but, unfortunately, that is not done at the present time in the loading of our steamers. An officer of the ship-and this should be the chief officer -shoul d be responsible for her proper loading. Under our present system of loading by stevedores, no officer has any control over the loading of the cargo; and no officer can tell where or how it is stowed. We ought to provide in the Bill that a responsible officer of the ship shall supervise and direct the loading, and be responsible for the proper performance of the work. It should not he left to shore people, some of whom perhaps have never been to sea in their lives, and whose main concern is simply to get the cargo from the wharf into the ship when and how they can. I have seen some of the lightest cargo stowed in the lower holds, and the heaviest stowed near, and often above, the water-line. This is dangerous stowage. In certain circumstances, the water ballast tanks constitute an added danger to the tendency of a ship to turn turtle. There was a little steamer, called the Pearl, which turned turtle the other day on the coast of New South Wales. The account from Grafton states that Mr George Marks, of the Department of Agriculture of New South Wales, was a passenger on board. His story was to the effect that several times prior to the actual disaster the vessel gave a dangerous list. In consequence of this he at one period felt inclined to leave her. In addition to iron, timber, and cream cans the steamer also carried a galvanized-iron tank on the awning. When Mr Marks finally felt the boat going over he jumped into the river. The vessel floated for some I time keel uppermost, and the propeller kept",32,Navigation Bill Second Reading
94,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"Withturning, causing the hull to forge ahead some distance after the propeller stopped. That was in the case of only a small vessel; but what is true of a small vessel is true in a corresponding degree of vessels of larger size The tendency to put cargo on deck and have empty holds, and sometimes to have empty ballast tanks as well, constitutes a source of very great danger to the lives of crew and passengers alike. Take the case of the Clan Ranald, which was lost somewhere in Spencer's Gulf, South Australia. letter, which appeared in the press at the time, from a seafaring manI venture to say that the decision of the Marine Board of Adelaide is another illustration of the necessity of establishing in all the States a more up-to-date tribunal to deal with shipping matters. I have followed the evidence as published in your daily journal, and was astonished to observe how the most important feature of the case was passed over with only a question from the President as to the water ballast tanks, to which tbe chief officer replied that they were pumped out on arrival at the wharf, and no orders were given by the captain to refill them. Is this a similar case to the steamer that left San"" Francisco many years ago, overloaded with wheat down to the Plimsoll mark, with empty tanks, and in consequence capsized on the bar beyond the Heads? All acquainted with shipping matters know that a steamer loaded with wheat, if her ballast tanks were f u l l , could not carry anything like the weight and be seaworthy, according to the Board of Trade regulations, and therefore the master and owners chance it, trusting the coal w i ll be consumed in a few days, and thus allow one tank to be filled, and so on, as may be necessary. The diver who examined the wreck says there was no damage to the bottom of the ship, or the hull, yet one witness stated he placed no confidence in a diver's evidence, because he knew of a case where his ship had lost rivets. That is a brilliant conclusion. I have no doubt, and many very experienced shipmasters agree, that the ship was overloaded; that is, her tanks were empty, and when she met a lumpy sea she rolled over on her side, and the evidence all point's in that direction. The ship sbould not have been allowed to proceed to sea in the condition she was. In some cases, when a ship has her ballast tanks full and her hold empty, the practice is resorted to, as the cargo is put into her, of pumping the ballast tanks out until she is loaded down to the Plimsoll mark, with the consequence that she has a sort of balloon of air underneath her. ballast tanks become an air space, and in bad weather, if she rolls more than usual, the tendency of this balloon underneath all the time is to come up-on top and to force the superstructure of the ship underneath. Consequently, if she gives more than a usually heavy roll in a beam sea, there is a very strong probability that she will go just beyond the margin of safety, and that the next roll will carry her right over. That is what evidently happened in the case of the Clan Ranald] and may happen to many of the ships travelling round our coast. Something ought to be done to meet the case of ships which leave port apparently perfectly safe, and passed by the port authorities, when they are not really in a fit condition to go to sea. When the Clan Ranald was alongside the wharf she was apparently in I was struck with the following proper sea trim, as far as the Plimsoll mark indicated; but, of course, it was not known that her ballast tanks were empty, so that her apparent draught was not her actual draught, and her centre of gravity had really been raised considerably higher than appeared to be the case. The question of ships flying light must also be considered, but no provision is made to meet such cases. lost through want of ballast than through overloading. the honourable member is quite right. that difliculty. They can fill up their tanks before leaving, and pump them out again directly they get outside. lieve that is done sometimes by the engineers without the knowledge of the captain, and it is a very dangerous practice. I remember a new ship which came out from the Old Country. She was beautifully fitted up with all the latest appliances; but I borrowed a fishing-line from a man on the wharf, went up on her boat deck, and lowered the line with a plumb-bob at tiie end to the water's edge. I found that the height from the boat deck to the water's edge was over 60 feet, but she was drawing only 15 feet of water forward and 17 feet aft. 1 not extraordinary. Only last week-end, when I was over here, a ship left Melbourne in exactly the same way, after bringing out some immigrants. I do not know her actual height above the water, but it was 'tremendous, and she was only drawing 16 feet forward and 18 feet aft. She had Her empty then to go to Sydney, having discharged some 1,000 tons or more of cargo here. She went away from Melbourne with a great portion of her propeller out of water. I have seen vessels go out to sea with only the boss of the propeller submerged. Of course, it is all right so long as the weather is fine; but it is very difficult to keep.",33,Navigation Bill Second Reading

100,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"It issteerage on when there is so much of the propeller above the water, there being a constant tendency for the vessel to drift and to refuse to answer the helm. In the event of a blow arising, there is always danger of drifting on to a lee shore. If possible, we ought to provide that no vessel shall be allowed to leave any port in Australia with her propeller only partly submerged. It does not matter, of course, how much of the vessel's nose is out of the water, because it is the propeller which commands and keeps the way on the ship. There is room for a great deal of improvement in the housing of the boats and in the drilling and handling of men, and boat accommodation generally. A ship master in this port, with whom I have frequently conversed on this subject, has suggested that it would be much better if the boats, instead of all being hung on the top deck along the side, on davits, with manilla amendment. falls, which are very apt to become entangled in the hands of inexperienced men, were arranged transversely on the decks at convenient places. We know that these boats, when there is occasion to-use them, are manned by stewards and stokers, with, perhaps, only one sailorman in charge. not sailors. quite true that on steamers nowadays labourers, and not sailors, are required; and this makes it all the more necessary that the handling of the boats should be of the simplest character. This ship's captain suggests that if the boats were arranged transversely, space could be economized, and thus a larger number of boats carried, with more effective supervision and ease in handling. The idea is that there should be an iron rod with an eye passing through the thwarts at a distance of about 3 feet from the stem and stern posts, and a bridle wire line attached, worked with a single wire fall by a derrick or crane in the same way that cargo is hoisted in or out of a ship now. Each boat in turn could by means of travelling chocks be speedily inturn brought under the derrick and lowered -over the side. There would be only the wire-rope to attach, and by that means the boats could be loaded on the deck, swung clear, and lowered with a much greater degree of safety than under the present conditions. There would 'be the further advantage that the boats -need not be all stowed on the top deck, but could be placed on lower decks nearer the water. I should like to hand to the Minister a newspaper illustration of another device which, to some extent, adopts the same idea. In a large measure of this kind, there are many points worthy of consideration; but I realize that this is practically a Committee Bill. Had there been time, I should have liked to allude to the complaint made by the residents of Papua and Thursday Island about the hardships they are likely to suffer if the provisions of this measure are made to apply to them. I hope I have not unnecessarily taken up time in alluding to some questions worthy of the attention of the Minister. adjourned to a later hour of the day.

If we are to have compulsory training, the determination of the means of comoulsion is a very important matter. tion 125 of the Act provides thatA l l male inhabitants of Australia (excepting those who are exempted by this Act), who have resided therein for six months, and.are British subjects shall be liable to be trained, as prescribed, as follows :(a) From twelve years to fourteen years of age in the junior Cadets; and (i) From fourteen to eighteen years of age in the' Senior Cadets.

I would remind the House of the remark made by the honourable member for Bendigo that the principle of the Act is new to Australia, and that it might be well, perhaps, not to attempt to administer it with the utmost rigour until its provisions become more generally known. I am confident that it will then be more generally acceptable to the people; but at present it is certainly meeting with objections that may be fanned into something of a stronger nature, and as this particular clause might be administered in a harsh way, I ask honourable members to permit it to go. Minister is justified in making the best case he can in the circumstances, but I fear he is laying himself and those associated with him open to more serious difficulties than they have yet foreseen. Take away fhis sanction, make it possible for boys between twelve and fourteen and from fourteen to eighteen years of age to snap their fingers when required to commence their drill, and the Department will be placed in a position of the most extreme difficulty. by making them drill. it. If there is any objection to this particular method of enforcing it, another can be substituted. If this provision goes as now proposed the whole power of enforcement will be lost until some other Act shall have been passed. Meantime, whenever there is resistance, reasonable or unreasonable, to the Act -whethe r it arise from the personal will of the boys or from honest and conscientious parental objections to the system-the Department will be faced with refusals to obey the law. Such refusals would have an injurious effect upon those who were otherwise inclined to obey.

140,Mr Poynton (Grey) [3.10],"I difj Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is very questionable. Minister should advise us accordingly. I understand that the Court will still have power to hand over to the instructional officer any boy who has failed to attend drill, and to require him to make good the time lost. The only thing proposed to be eliminated is the power to collect monetary penalties. Not only will boys still have to do the required drill, but, if they are found to be inefficient at Ihe end of the prescribed period, they may be ordered to serve for another twelve months. Mr W. H . IRVINE I am afraid that that will not be practically enforceable. I have stated, I cannot see the grave danger which the Leader of the Opposition sugests. If we have the power to make the oys do their drill shall have no practical power. to hand them over to the instructional officer? remain; but how can it be exercised in respect of hundreds of boys? might be asked in respect of the imposition of penalties. If we had no power either to make the boys attend drill or tofinethem if they refused to do so, the position would be very serious. the power to make boys attend drill, I do not see that we need worry over the imposition of fines. The fines, after all, are a penalty on the parents, and not on the lads themselves. Eveni f a boy's wages are garnisheed, the penalty hits back at his parents. All that we need do is to see that the Act is effective in providing that the boys shall attend drill. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [3.12]. I regret that the Minister cannot accede to the very reasonable request of the Leader of the Opposition that we should have a few days to consider this matter, more especially as the change made does not seem to have been part of the policy of the Government after a full consideration of the amendments necessary. opposed this in another place. Mr W. H . IRVINE I was not aware of that. The House almost unanimously agreed to the adoption of the system of universal training, and in doing so set an example to the rest of the Empire which has been welcomed by the most thoughtful people in every part of the British Dominions. I do not say, because I do not know, that the imposition of penalties is a good way of enforcing the system. There may be much to be said against it, but it happens to be the primary method adopted to enforce obedience. There must necessarily be considerable opposition to compulsory training by a considerable section who find it inconvenient; but, in order that the system may be carried through, the law must be as perfect as possible, and the Government administering the law must administer it with some degree of firmness. I have not had an opportunity to go into the matter, but I am inclined to think that the imposition of a pecuniary penalty is perhaps not the best way of enforcing the system. The opposition to the whole system of compulsory training, however, is centred round the question of penalties.' That being so, would it not be wise for the Government to refrain for some time from making this change in the Act. If they make it, I am afraid it will lead to an increase in the opposition to the principle. I am thinking more of the moial than of any other effect. The attack on the system has been levelled at the imposition of monetary penalties, and if the Government and the House immediately give way, how are we to be able to carry through a system which requires in any circumstances firm administration to insure its success? The mere fact that the attack has been"" made on these penalties is a very strong reason against our immediately yielding to it, at all events until we find some substitute. The difficulty may be met by a sympathetic administration of the Act. I feel sure the Minister in charge of the Bill and his officers can devise some way whereby, without immediately yielding to this demand, the hardship of imposing these penalties upon boys who are unable to pay them themselves may be avoided. I fail to understand why the Minister cannot give the House, on a subject on which the House is practically unanimous, and on which we are trying to work together, an opportunity of considering, even for a few days, whether it is wise at this stage to give effect to this alteration, which was put in against the wish of the Ministry in another place at the last moment.",38,Honourable Members Hear Hear

149,Mr Deakin,"The Minister of Defencestrongly support the proposal for an adjournment of this matter. I quite understand the reason why the Government, in the first instance, were prepared to accept this amendment, although they opposed it previously, both here and in another place. There was a belief that the Senate was going to adjourn for three or four weeks, and they were anxious to get this measure passed, so that the present prosecutions with heavy penalties should not continue. I can understand them for that reason hastily proposing to accept the amendment, rather than postpone the consideration of the whole Bill; but now. that we are informed that the Senate will sit next week, the reason for urgency has passed. We are also dealing with an amendment which we have not seen in print, and for these reasons the further consideration of the matter should be postponed, at all events until Tuesday. I join in the suggestion of the honourable member for Gippsland, and would remind the Minister in charge of the Bill of the very firm and reasonable attitude he took up last evening in reference to a proposal to abolish altogether the liability to all the outcry such as we have had recently. penalties. He pointed out, in strong terms that could hardly be improved upon, that whilst it might not be desirable to systematischeme unless there was some reserve cally enforce penalties cumulatively with an order for service, because in many cases the order for sendee might be complied with, it was possible that in certain special cases of insubordination and recalcitrancy some of the lads might defy the authorities, however firm they were, and refuse to serve, and that it was only the pressure of some form of penalty, however mild, that would induce eventual compliance with the requirements of the law. If there is no reserve power to enforce the law, these young men will know it, and may refuse to serve. In that case, the Act and the system would be-come absolutely paralyzed, and such a state -of affairs would bring more discredit upon the authors and administrators of the Act than would the liability to the occasional imposition of penalties. The Act belongs 'to the Parliament and to the people. No party has any preferential claim to credit or honour or responsibility for it. We are all responsible for it, and if it breaks down, see the tremendous responsibility that will rest upon us all. There may be a choice of alternatives-whethe r we will allow the occasional liability to the enforcement of the law at the hands of the Bench, or have only one means of enforcing the system, namely, by detention in barracks. It is possible that, if detention were enforced strictly or frequently, it might lead to an outcry that we were imprisoning the boys, and that cry might be just as difficult to combat as is the present outcry about the exercise of the reserve power vested in the Bench. We ought not to allow this magnificent scheme of national defence to collapse for wapt of some means of "" sanction."" There must be a means of enforcing every law. If boys were systematically kept from their homes and parents in custody in order to enforce compliance with the compulsory training law, it might lead to more disastrous results than even the occasional liability to a fine. See what an obligation it might impose upon the military authorities if , in endeavouring to maintain discipline, they had to detain boys for a considerable time. They would have to provide for their maintenance and comfort in custody, and this would impose considerable financial burdens on the Commonwealth. These difficulties would be more troublesome to deal with than an occasional I dread the denouement of failure and disaster which would overtake this power, to be brought into operation, of course, only in extreme cases. Under the law, as the Commonwealth have proposed to amend it,"" the magistrates would be very careful and discreet in using that power. They would advise the boys to return to duty with all the authority of the bench. It would not be a mere sham suggestion. They would know that they had this authority, to be exercised only in emergency, and it would greatly help the administration of the law, and strengthen the hands of the Government. I hope the amendment will not be carried in a moment of panic, but that the Government will take it into consideration before they allow the House to be led away by a cry which may be hereafter regretted. I am not so apprehensive in respect of this matter as are some members both on this and on the other side of the House. When I was a boy the severest penalty that could be imposed on me was to keep me in after school hours to write out a certain number of lines, and I do not think there is much difference between the Australian youth then and now.

152,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [3.23j,"considerable irritation in every one of the States, and the question is whether we can in some way mollify it. I believe the elimination of the fine will go a long way to make the defence scheme better than it has been before. It may be thought a peculiar suggestion, but I think we could give this proposal three months' trial, and note how it operates. If we found that it did not work well, we could tackle the question again before the close of this session. Mr W. H . IRVINE -You might do that practically by administration. I do not think you could do it by change of legislation. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Because, in the meantime,, you give these people the idea that you are giving way to them. these fines has changed the views of many who were strongly in favour of the defence scheme. supporters of the scheme so long as it affects other men's boys. fathers of large families who were strongly in favour of the scheme. If a father has to go to Court because his lad has not attended the requisite number of drills, there is not only the liability to a fine, but he has to lose a day's work, which is . a very serious matter. One man in my constituency was summoned to appear because his lad had not put in the requisite number-of drills, and he informed me by letter, and personally, that he was the father of eleven children, two or three of whom came under the compulsory system. He said, "" I am ardently in favour of it, and realize the benefits that accrue to my lads from the drill, but if I have to lose time to appear at the Court it takes me several weeks to make up the leeway."" That is a very serious matter to a man who is living, in a sense, from hand to mouth, with eleven little mouths to fill. If the father knows that the penalty will fall on the lad. and not on him, it will be a different matter. At any rate, let us give the new proposal a trial, and if we find in two or three months that it is not working very well we can, perhaps, resort to more drastic means. Under this amendment there is still power where a boy does not put in the required number of drills to bring him before the magistrate, who can not only order him to make up the arrears, but can even impose an extra number of drills. If the money penalty is still left in, how are you going to enforce it on a boy who will not put in his drill ? If we endeavour to apply the law with the utmost rigor by imposing fines, as well as compelling the lads to make up the arrears of drill, we shall place ourselves in a more peculiar position than if we excise the monetary penalty from the Act. have come to a very critical position in regard to the whole scheme of defence that this Parliamentproposes to carry into effect. I do not think the House has yet had a fair opportunity of becoming seized of the true significance of the proposed amendment. We have been told that it is an injustice and a hardship that a fine imposed on boys for non-attendance at drill should ultimately fall on the parents. Surely the father of a boy, who is eligible for drill, owes some duty and responsibility to the State, and he ought tb exerare ardent cise proper parental influence. If a parent fails to do this, it is no more than fair that the penalty should recoil on him. I cannot for one moment agree with the argument of the honourable member for Maribyrnong that a parent has no responsibility, and that it would be a hardship to fine him; if parental responsibilities attach in the ordinary affairs of life, they ought to attach in the matter of defence; and, unless a parent can show that a boy is entirely beyond his control, he ought to be responsible. I do not desire the fine to be of the drastic nature indicated; but, at the same time, a lax parent ought not to* grumble if the fine ultimately falls on him. I trust we shall have a. fuller opportunity to consider this very important point. regard the amendment of the Senate asmost serious, seeing that, if we accept it, no penalty can be enforced against boys who do not do their training. It is said' that a boy may be committed to barracksor some other place and compelled to complete the drills; but, while that may be all very well in the metropolitan areas, it is not practicable in country districts, where an offender may be 200 miles away from barracks or any other suitable place. We know that it is specially provided that a boy cannot be committed to gaol; and I am afraid that the whole system of compulsory training will break down if no penalty -an be imposed.

The husband had also persuaded his mother-in-law to fast, and the wife, fearing that she might fall ill, after she had fasted for four days, suggested to her that, as they had received as a present some excellent flounder, she should cook them. The mother cooked the fish, but that ended her fast. If the prison authorities of the Old Country placed a nice bowl of soup before these ladies, after they had fasted for a day or two, I do not think they would be able to withstand the temptation. again.

"" alliance"" part of the statement, but I clearly remember the honourable member's reference to "" a series of independent republics."" His attitude, whilst it may afford amusement to a certain extent, is, in my humble judgment, a dangerous one. In the first place, we have to remember that this young country of ours has one great danger in front of it-no t the danger that we shall ever suffer from a sufficient lack of humour to be able to appreciate the honourable member, or the danger of self-confidence, but a danger to the racial purity of the Australian people. Racial purity can be secured only by racial unity. Of what value then is it that we should be constantly and ineffectively and impotently carping at another section of our own race instead of endeavouring to sympathize with, and to understand, our mutual difficulties. brutality ! the suffragettes, or for the British Government, but I do desire that this National Parliament shall not make itself ridiculous by entering into controversies, such as that now raging in England, without understanding the facts. Only the other day, in Dublin, a couple of these innocent ladies who object to be fed, entered a theatre crowded with their own flesh and blood, and endeavoured to set fire to it, as a protest against the refusal of the Government to give women the franchise. Women who go to that extraordinary length, are not deserving of much sympathy, either from the British Government or from this Parliament. These are by no means working women. They are drawn mostly from the upper classes of the Mother Country, and are mainly seeking for the vote, not for the whole of the women of England, but for one particular section. When we remember these things, I take it that the House will be careful about expressing an opinion on a matter of domestic politics in the Mother Country.",43,Suffragettes In British Prisons
