The Nauru Chief was purchased in Norway and refitted in Great Britain. She was purchased primarily to meet special requirements of the business, such as the laying of deep sea (moorings, far winch no other suitable vessel is available, and is employed mostly in the Islands. 2.

Have any supplies been imported up to the present moment, either by the Commonwealtli or otherwise? answers to the honorable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. Insulin should not be regarded as a cure for diabetes, but as a means of supplying glandular deficiencies associated ' with the disease. Investigations haye been carried on from the first announcement of the present methods of preparation, w it h ultimately satisfactory results. 2. The product is now available in limited quantities to specialists. The amount available is being continuously increased. 3. Yes. Serum Laboratories are issuing an active and sterile product. 4. There is no intention on the part of the Government to prohibit importation of efficient preparations. 5. The information is not available; but certain firms have announced that supplies are on the way from England. The Commonwealth Government w ill not import, as. according to the statements, of the original discoverers, insulin would not remain -active long enough to permit of its arrival in Australia from England in an active condition. LINE OF STEAMERS. USE MrA . GREEN asked the P r i m e M in 1 ister, wpon notice1. Isi t a fact, as has been stated, that the Commonwealth Line of Steamers on tbe eastern Statest o England run-by way of Western Australia and the Cape-bunke r coal mined by black labour at Durban, in preference to coal won by white labour at Collie, Western Australia ? 2. If the fact is as stated, what is the reason for the preference given to African over Australian coal ? orable member's questions are as f o l low:. 1. Vessels are bunkered in Durban because the coal is considerably cheaper than Collie, and is of a superior quality-in other words, the arrangements at present in force were adopted by the management in the interests of economy. 2. Durban coal costs 27s. 6d. per ton, Collie 33s. 8d.. and Durban coal gives about 20 per cent, better results. Mr. ANSTEY asked t h e M in is t e r for T r a d e and Customs, u p o n notice1.

Honourable members know that it is customary, when the House is nearing the end of the session, for Government' business to be given precedence over private It is regretted that members' business. The practice has been followed for a very long time, and I have no doubt that honourable members will agree to its being adopted on the present occasion. Some time ago the Government announced that it proposed to terminate the present session on the 24th August. I know that certain honourable members on the Opposition side of the House do not approve of that decision, but I would remind t h e m , t h a t one of the primary duties of the Government of the day is to make the necessary arrangements for the conduct of the business of Parliament. That is one of the duties which honourable members opposite would insist upon discharging if they occupied the Government benches. During the present session private members have had the usual facilities for introducing subjects of particular interest to them, but the end of the session is riow not very far distant. It is proposed po introduce the Budget tomorrow, and in ' order to give honourable members the fullest possible opportunity of considering the Budget, the Estimates, and consequential legislation. Ministers propose that' Government business shall be given precedence. I feel sure that honourable members will agree to the motion, and thus afford themselves every possible opportunity to discuss measures, particularly those dealing with the finance of the country, which w ill come before them. Owing to the nature of the business which will have to be transacted between now and the end of the session, honourable members w ill have ample opportunity to bring under the notice of the House any matter to which they desire to draw attention.",15,Commonwealth Woollen Mills

27,Mr Brtjce (Flinders,"Prime M i nM i . CHARLTON (Hunter) [2.44] I have no intention of objecting to the motion. I realize that if the House Is to rise on the 24th August, private members' business must give way to Government business. A t the same time, I wish, again, on behalf of this side of the House, to protest against Parliament being closed on the 24th August, after such a short session. , I am under the impression that in addition to sitting on Tuesdays, we shall shortly be .asked to sit on Mondays. The legislation that has to be dealt with in the remaining three or'four weeks of the session is very important, and should receive the attention of every member in this House. much, if it can. have the attention it deister sat for thirteen and a half hours serves in the short space of time remaining before the 24th August. Parliament will not be able td do its best work if honourable members are required to sit every day in the week. Some of us would like to get the business done and go home. In that respect I am in the same category as other honourable members. sit from Monday until Friday inclusive, and until a late hour every night, and do justice to important legislation. The Prime Minister has indicated that when the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) delivers the Budget to-morrow, many matters arising out of it will require consideration, and will necessitate legislation. He said that he wanted to give the House sufficient time to deal with the Budget. I fail to see how we can deal with all this legislation in the limited period of three weeks. The Prime Minister would be wise, even at this late hour, if he would agree to the House sitting until it has had time to deal with necessary legislation in a proper and efficient way. It is-not in the best interests of Parliament or the country that legislation should be rushed through. iu passing legislation the responsibility will be ours. In hurrying to close the session too early we may do things which we may regret afterwards. opposed to the Government appropriating the time usually allowed to private members, but I object to rushing legislation through in order to close the session on the 24th August. The House should be allowed to sit, if necessary, for another two months. difference to the Prime Minister, for the Opposition would grant him a pair, but it would make all the difference to the efficient conduct of the business of Parliament. I object strongly to the constant whittling away of the rights of members of this House by. the Government. Private members have retained very few privileges since the present Government took control of the House. Members have no channel tor ventilating matters of importance to their electorates and the people generally. A few weeks ago about £4,500,000 was voted by this House after only three and a half hours actual I doubt very debate. I admit that the Prime Minmoving, "" That the question be now put."" Like a marionette he kept bobbing up, and like a phonograph he kept repeating, "" I move, ' That the question be now put.'"" Members of the Opposition vainly endeavoured to discuss matters which they considered of vital imWe cannot portance to the people of Australia. The Ministers of the different Departments could give ho information, and the Prime Minister himself was equally without it. The"" Bill was forced through, and members of the Opposition were prevented from speaking upon many matters of importance. That privilege was taken away by the brutal ""gag,"" and now the small privilege remaining is to be removed also. It is absolutely impossible for the programme of legislation proposed by the Government to be passed in the short period between now and the 24th August. I do not know whether the Prime Minister and the Government think that members of this House are so many children, or that the people outside bave no knowledge of what can be done If we make mistakes before 24th August. If the Government had any capacity or ability to carry on the affairs of this country, it would have met the House shortly after it was elected. I am. not We know, however, that certain assassinations had to take place. Certain men had to be removed, and others placated. Certain warring factions in the different groups, which have now been welded together more or less harmoniously, had to be reconciled. It would not make any A t last, after a delay of something like six months, an understanding was brought about which has carried the Ministry through so far. From a Government such",16,Order Of Business
28,Mr Blakeley (Darling) [2.48],"as the present one we could not expect much more.' I shall say no more about the vote of £4,500,000, after three and a half hours? discussion, and thirteen and a half hours' gagging, but there are on the notice-paper most important legislative proposalsof vital interest to the public, the discussion of which should take at least six months. Can the Budget be adequately analyzed and criticised in less than four weeks? Of course, if the Government are ashamed of their Budget, and desire to prevent a full discussion of it, they are proceeding in the right way to achieve tb,eir object. There will not be sufficient time between now and the 24th August to adequately discuss the Budget. The Navigation Bill, which involves a most important principle, should not pass through this House with less than two weeks' discussion. The Seamen's Compensation Bill is a highly controversial measure, which should receive at least three weeks' consideration. TheA ir Defence Bill is another proposal which cannot be disposed of in a few hours. It was discreetly dropped by the last Government, and rumour in the corridors is to the effect that it will suffer a similar fate at the hands of the present Government. Certainly, there is very httle chance of its being passed in this House, even if the Prime Minister again applies the gag continuously for thirteen hours. Other measures listed on the business-paper are the Naval Defence Bill, Sea-carriage of Goods Bill, New Guinea. Bill, the Boy Scouts Association BillGod forbid that we should forget the boys scouts-and the Papua Bill. It has become the fashion for people to ask why so much time is wasted in Parliament, but adequate discussion is the only protection which the people have against an incompetent Government rushing through the House legislation that is unwise and unpalatable to the electors. When I first entered Parliament I formed the opinion that a great deal of time was occupied in useless discussion, but as the years go by-ma y there be many more of themI have come to the conclusion, as the result of bitter experience, that legislightly place that notice upon the paper. lation can be passed too -hurriedly. Work can be perfunctorily done, and its results become a danger to the people. If the Government should even attempt to pass, before the 24th August, all the proposals that have been listed they x will be guilty of madness. The only way in which that programme can be disposed of is by the extension of the session for at least six or eight weeks beyond fche announced date of closing. Even in that time some of the proposals must be scamped. There must be in the Government programme a good many innocents which are doomed to* be slaughtered, and one. is forced to the conclusion that the Government knew when they listed them that many of them had not the slightest chance of being agreed to. It is all very well to dress the Ministerial windows, to say that so much work must be done in a certain time; and to attempt to run the legislative machine to a schedule; but the Government cannot do that, and they are not justified in attempting it. Now we are told that private members are to be further deprived of their privileges. I shall continue to voice my objection to the whittling away of the rights of members, especially when I know that that course could have been avoided had the Government had the courage to submit their legislative proposals to the House six months ago. agree with the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) that honourable members should be very jealous of their privileges. I stress that point for the benefit of those honourable members who are new to the House. Private members have few privileges, indeed. They have not many opportunities of giving publicity to matters which they regard as being of public importance. Their greatest opportunity is private members' day, which the Government are now coolly proposing to abolish. I ask honourable members to realize what the Government's motion means. There is on thei business paper a most important motion in the name of the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into alleged grievances concerning th© administration of the War Service Homes Department in New South Wales. I take it that that honourable member did not He was surely seized of his responsibility as a member; he must have thought that this matter was one of great importance. There have been allegations of grievous wrongs and mal-administration, and he took advantage of his privilege as a private member to give notice of a",17,Order Of Business
29,Mr Mahony (Dalley) [2.52],"Imotion which would enable publicity to be given to the matter. Now the Prime Minister is practically gagging him, and casting a reflection upon him, inasmuch as he says in effect, "" The notice of motion by the honourable member for Richmond is of no consequence; we must close this Parliament so that ""I may go to London."" It matters not that there may have been mal-administration in connection with ""War Service Homes in New South Wales. turned soldiers are unemployed and sleeping in the Sydney Domain. At all costs Parliament must be closed, and the Prime Minister must go to London. I hope that the honourable member for Richmond will not lightly allow his rights to be set aside. There are other honourable members who, with equal sincerity, I believe have given notice of motions. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) has tabled & motion in reference to the construction of a railway line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs as part of tbe through North-South railway. Prime Minister cannot deny the importance of that proposal^ but he is asking the House to set it aside. The honourable member for Bass is a noied explorer. He has travelled from end to end of this vast continent. known as "" the dead heart of Australia."" I have heard the honourable member deliver lectures oh the subject of the Northern Territory, and from these one might be led to believe that tbe exploits of explorers like the late Lord Forrest and others fade into insignificance beside they support a motion which will have the wonderful achievements of the explorer from Bass. vast experience, the honourable member has placed this notice of motion on the business-paper, declaring that the construction of the railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs should be proceeded with at once. This is a question of vital importance to South Australian representatives, and it will be interesting to see whether those gentlemen are prepared to allow the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) to sweep away their opportunity of discussing it. orable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), who has a personal knowledge of the poverty and destitution that prevails in our midst, has a notice of motion in favour of the granting of a destitute allowance. He believes that Mr Mahony. it is the duty of Parliament to give a lead in the alleviation of distress, and is therefore anxious to have the matter discussed here. I could quite understand the Prime Minister dealing in the way proposed with motions standing in the names of members of the Opposition, but what has the honourable member for Eiverina( Mr Killen) to say about the swamping of his motion in favour of the contract system being adopted for all It matters not that reGovernment work? This is a question in which quite a large number of honourable members behind the Government are deeply interested, and the support given by the honourable member for Riverina to the contract system,in opposition to day labour, was one of the grounds on which he was elected to this House. If the honourable member permits himself to be robbedof his rights it is certain that his constituents will call him to account at the next election. There is a proposal in the The name of the honourable member fbr Denison( Mr O'Keefe) to appoint a Select Committee to inquire into the necessity fbr rjrovision being made by the Government for an adequate direct shipping service between Melbourne and He has been at what is Hobart. Session after session during the years I have been a member I have heard representatives from Tasmania complaining of the present inadequate shipping facilities. I ask Tasmanian representatives who sit behind the Government to consider carefully before the effect of depriving the island State As a result of his of a much needed service. Then, Mr Speaker, your illustrious predecessor, the honourable member for Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson) has a motion urging the necessity for the authorization by Parliament of the publication of Hansard. I understand that without the authorization . proposed Hansard is not covered by parliamentary privilege, and actions for libel may be brought on what appears in its columns. The honourable member for Lang desires to The honplace it beyond all doubt that Hansard reports are not subject to the ordinary processes of law. Surely honourable members generally will insist on having an opportunity to affirm that Hansard' is a parliamentary document. There is another important motion on the notice paper in the name of the honourable memnew member, and the Prime Minister should not deprive him of an opportunity to submit his motion. I hope honourable members will not be prepared to "" g a g"" themselves. The opening words of the motion are-' ' That a Select Committee of seven members, representing both sides . of tha House Speaker, how fair the honourable member for Wannon is. He desires both sides of the House to be represented. Thef u l l text of the motion isThat a Select Committee of seven members, representing both sides of the House, be appointed to inquire into and report upon the alleged non-fullilment of the verbal undertaking placed before the House by the Minister for Trade and Customs prior to the passing of item 275 of the Customs Tariff on 9th November, 1921, as recorded on pages 12538 and 12539 of Hansard of the session 1920-21. the honour of this House. affects the honour of a member of the Cabinet. ber may not now discuss a motion standing on the notice-paper. is that, if the Prime Minister's motion is carried, the House will be deprived of its right to discuss the motion of the honourable member for Wannon. It is a matter of very great importance, affecting the honour pf a member of the Cabinet, and it concerns the political sincerity of many members of the late Country party. I am surprised at the Prime Minister attempting to brush aside a motion containing a reflection upon the honour of one of his own Ministers. I feel sure that he has not read the motion. If he realized its importance, he would be anxious to have an opportunity to defend the honour of his colleague. I hope that he will reconsider his decision. There is also a motion standing in the name of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney). for an honourable member to indulge in tedious repetition. By a mere recital of the motions on the notice-paper, and the application of the same criticism to each item, the honourable member cannot avoid the charge of tedious repetition. I warn the honourable member. tude you adopt, Mr Speaker, and I take your' warning to heart; but I think that the motion of the honourable member for Melbourne is the most important of a l l . It should convince the Prime Minister of the iniquity of his proposed action. I think that I ought to be allowed to make a passing reference to the motion. ItThat in view of .the pronounced favouritism of those who possess the gift of distribution of public works(1) This House declares that all architectural plans, designs, specifications, &c, of all works for the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth Bank, the estimated cost of which amounts to £3,000 and upwards, shall be thrown open to the public competition of the architects . of Australia The matter is very important from the stand-point of the architects of Australia.

In the interests of the new members especially, the House should not be deprived of its rights in this respect. It is the clear duty of the Government to keep Parliament in session, and not to close it up hurriedly to enable the Prime Minister to visit Great Britain. W h y could not the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) be l e f t in charge of the House during the Prime Minister's absence? not be discussed on the present motion. upon the Prime Minister's own colleagues to suggest that they cannot be trusted to lead the House during his absence. The motion of the Prime Minister casts a reflection upon every honourable member who has a notice of motion on the business sheet. I hope honourable members w ill in sist on their right to place motions on the notice-paper and to have them considered. ister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.20] -The motion has been debated, at some length, and it has been dealt with",18,Order Of Business

In moving the second reading, I will briefly refer to matters in.connection with the proposed extension which I think will be of interest to honourable members generally. The Bill provides for the extension of the railway system of the Northern Territory from the .. . . 36 terminus at Emungalan as far as Daly ..' . . 21 Waters, a distance of 160 miles. The extension commences at a point 1 mile dis15 tant from the north bank of the Katherine River; it will cross the river by a highlevel bridge, and will terminate some 360 Johnson, Sir Elliot miles south of Darwin. The advisability Killen, W. W. of the construction of the line has been Lister, J. H . under consideration by the Public Works Mackay, G. H . Committee on two occasions. The first Mann, E.

43,Mr Bruce,Nothing unusual is to,21,Northern Territory Railwa Yextensionbill Second Reading
44,Mr Stewart (Wimmera,"Ministe rA Bill to give effect to this resolution was prepared, hut it was not proceeded with. Last night the honourable member for Hindmarsh < Mr Makin) asked for what distance the line now proposed to be constructed .has been surveyed. I replied, and I find I was correct, that the distance surveyed is approximately 77 miles. That leaves approximately S3 miles of the proposed extension to be permanently surveyed. There has been a trial survey of the remainder of the line. If this B i ll is passed the permanent survey for this remaining portion will be put in hand immediately, and completed. The estimated cost of the which provision is made. by the Bill is £1,545,000. Honourable members will notice that this amount is in excess of the estimate submitted by the Public Works Committee in their reports. The Committee reported that the first' section from, the Katherine River to Mataranka would cost £320,000, and the second section from Mataranka to Daly Waters would cost £925,386, or a total of £1,245,386, or £300,000 less than the estimate now submitted. of the Committee that which was submitted by .the departmental engineer? old estimate for the section Emungalan to Mataranka, and. the estimate now submitted is increased by enhanced construction costs and the greater -cost of transport of rails, fastenings, and sleepers, all of which have to be shipped to Darwin, and transported over the existing line. The estimate-submitte d to the Public Works -Committee in IS 15-WA S much lower than the amount for which ithe line can now be constructed. The lower estimate was prepared in 1915, and since that time costs have much increased because of the enhanced cost of materials, rails, fastenings, cement, timber, &c, and the inand culverts. The sleepers will be such as creased freight on rails, &c, to Darwin. what was the difference between the estito be convertible into a 4-ft. <8^-in. line mate and the actual cost of the first secthe increased cost would be approxition of the line? constructed. A Bil l was prepared to give considers that the most economical method effect to the resolution approving of its is to build the railway on sleepers to carry construction, hut was not proceeded with. a 3-ft. 6-in. line. These will have to be the line constructed from Pine Creek to the Katherine River? before 1915. The estimate submitted to the Public Works Committee in 1915 was for a railway commencing on the south, side of the Katherine River. It was anticipated that the terminus of thc railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine River would be on that side of the river. But the terminus is still on the north side, and some 75 chains of railway have yet to be constructed to reach the Katherine River. A bridge is required over the river. This hridge is a very important' part of the work, and it will cost a fairly large sum. The Katherine River drains a large area of country, and carries a line for great volume of water during the wet season. This necessitates the construction of a fairly extensive bridge with several spans. The bridge alone is estimated to cost £95,000. This is an item which was not included in the estimate prepared in 1915. The Bill gives.particulars of the railway, .and the route is shown on the plans now before the House. The book of reference, submitted in accordance with the terms of the Railways Act, gives a list of Ithe names of -owners and lessees of lands along the route. A great deal was said on thiB -matter last night by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), but I found on looking at the map this morning that much of the land traversed by the proposed railway is still unalienated Crown land. The area to be used for the railway is approximately 3'chains-on either side of the centre line of the railway. This will allow for public roads. It is proposed to construct the line on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, but the bridges will be constructed so as to permit of the conversion of the line to the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge'. are necessary for a 3-ft. 6-in. line.

Very few developmental lines pay at the outset. structed through sparsely-populated territory. A large indirect benefit, however, accrues from their construction. If we were to lay down the principleI do not suggest for a moment that honourable members would do so-that we would not construct railways without an assurance that they would pay from the start, how could this country develop ? Where .would this country be to-day if that had been the policy of the past, and where would it be in the future if that policy were adopted to-day ? I think honourable members on all sides of the House will readily recognise the principle underlying that statement. venue and expenditure are based upon the assumption that Vestey Brothers' works at Darwin will be operating. The estimated revenue from the line will be £24,000 a year as against £26,700 working expenses. These figures will show a loss, not including interest, of £2,700 per annum. The interest charge at 5 per cent, will be, approximately, £77,250. That is how the loss upon ""the line will actually occur. The total loss, including interest charges, wal^ be £79,950 per annum. It will take time, of course, for the revenue to reach £24,000; but it is not anticipated that the period will be long, for the resultant development will, within a reasonable time, provide the amount of revenue I have mentioned. With the freezing works operating the estimate of revenue is regarded as conservative. The extension of the railway beyond Daly Waters, which will have to .be considered later, will bring the line nearer to the better pastoral country, and there is every hope that with that extension the revenue from fche railway will exceed the working expenses. The railway is part of the line that will ultimately be carried through from Adelaide to Port Darwin. This section is common to all the proposed routes. The fact was referred to last night, and I think ifc was member for Angas( Mr Gabb), that this extension was recommended by the Public Works Committee, on the assumption that German sleepers were the line would gofcoCamooweal, and that it was upon that assumption that the Commonwealth Government proposed tc construct this section. The fact that the Public Works Committee gave that as a. reason for recommending the construction of the line does nofc justify honourable They are, of necessity, conmembers in assuming that the same reason actuated the Government. If the line is ultimately, extended tlirough the Territory, a spur line to Camooweal to link up with fche Queensland system would not be objected to, even by South Australian members. The railway will assist in the, development of pastoral country, and that is one of the main reasons why honourable members on all sides of the House should support the Bill. Australia cannot be developed without railways, and if Parliament says that it will not build railways ifc will, in effect, say, "" We are not going to develop Australia."" The The estimates of rerailway will assist in the settlement of the Roper River lands. This river empties into the Gulf of Carpentaria, and traverses country from the Gulf to the railway and beyond. The line will bring nearer to railway connection the rich pastoral lands of the Barkly Tablelands. The Government has sent Mr Hobler, Chief Engineer of Commonwealth Railways, to report upon the practicability of providing railway communication with Borroloola and a port at the mouth of the McArthur River. Mr Hobler is already on his way, and the Government hopes to receive his report before the end of the year. The line will also pass within 12 miles of the Marranboy Tin-fields. A t present those tin-fields are 45 miles from the railway. Honourable members Will see that the Bill is short, and to the point. Clause5 provides for deviations of one mile on either side of the line defined in the schedule, but as a permanent survey has been made over a great portion of the route, it is hardly likely that any deviation will be necessary. Clause7 provides for fche appointment of officers. The desire of the Government is that the",22,Northern Territory Railwa Yextensionbill Second Reading

The Public Works Committee, however, has said that the other proposal is only a piecemeal extension, and that profit cannot be expected until the line has been carried to other portions of the Territory. I hope that if the present Minister is in office while this line is in course of construction, he will make himself absolutely sure in Tegard to the officers responsible for the supervision. penditure of £1,500,000 is involved, and in that remote part of the country, if sub-contracting is permitted on the recommendation of the officers, the whole work will require careful watching.

I listened very carefully to the statement of the Minister, who told us the estimated cost of the proposed line from Mataranka to Daly Waters. It is impossible, of course, to have more than an approximate estimate, having regard to the remoteness of the country affected. mitted only as approximate. not a larger attendance of members, because I wish to deal with the financial side of a proposal which, throws the gravest responsibility on the Government, affecting, as it does, in the highest degree, King O'Malley, to his credit, appointed the future of that part of Australia. If we permit the cost of this line to become unduly excessive, the burden of debt will have to be carried for half a century. We have no information as to how the estimate has been arrived at; we do not know what proportion of the expenditure will be on the railway line itself, and what proportion will be devoted to building, permanent and other station requisites and so forth. I deem it my duty on the present occasion to recall the history of the construction of the EastWest railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. In the absence of any statement to the contrary, I understand that the same official administration will have An excharge of the proposed line as had charge of the East-West line. The whole history of that line discloses a tragedy, a repetition of which should not be permitted. Estimates were carefully prepared, and every precaution taken in the preliminary stages. When Parliament approved of the construction, the Government of the day called in the assistance of the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia, the States more immediately concerned, and also of New South Wales, with the result that an engineer from each State was deputed to examine the survey, which had also been made by surveyors selected from each State. But, speaking from memory, the original estimate of cost, if not doubled, was exceeded by 75 per cent. Provision had to be made for workshops, and the officers in We have been control prepared an estimate for cut-stone buildings°at Port Augusta, for which, on the authority of the Cabinet, a preliminary advance was made of £25,000 on account of the total cost of £250,000. I know that part of the country, and I also know something of railways and railway construction in other States of the Commonwealth. I made inquiries, and took as a basis for my calculations railway centres where ten or fifteen times more business was being done than was likely to develop in the case of the EastWest railway for half a century to come. I found that at Geelong, Ballarat, and other centres, instead of cut-stone buildings, iron buildings were provided for workshops; and I begged the then Government to appoint a committee of experts with a view to putting an end to the official proposal.

As a matter of fact, that smaller provision has proved quite adequate, and will meet all demands for the next fifty years. These facts give some idea of the first blunder made. No reliable estimates of the cost of the railway were given by the Chief Engineer in charge until the work had been three-parts or four-fifths completed. During the currency of the contract there were alterations which increased the cost considerably, but not to the extent that honourable members might imagine. The war, and causes arising out of the war, increased the cost,' but the greater part of the' materials, such as sleepers and rails, had been contracted for at pre-war prices. Regarding the small proportion of the material for which war prices had to be paid, and putting the most favorable construction on what occurred at the time, the conduct of the work was a calamity; the line proved a sink into which public money was poured because of the incompetency of the men in charge. There were numerous instances of waste of money along the whole line. tract, for one. sented an infinitesimal part of the work. In the case of another portion of the line, struction of the East-West line from end and his partner was excessive. I told the then Prime Minister that I had the assurance of a contractor that if the work were rc-advertised, he would undertake it at Smith. -Will connection of these matters with the Bill1 cial connection. This is a matter of great, interest and importance to Australia as a whole, because the disaster of the EastWest railway is not yet forgotten. In all my thirty years of political life, I have -never known ab deplorable a business. The engineer who had charge of the const-ruction said he could carry out the work for about half of the amount tendered; and no doubt he could, in view of the assurance given to me by the contractor of whom I have spoken. numerous other mistakes. Quarries were opened up at great cost, expensive machinery was installed, and railways were laid to the quarries. It was subsequently discovered that the material in the quarries was quite useless for ballast. with the present Bill? of the construction of the railway. Scores, and probably hundreds, of columns were written in the press about the blunder, and the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), who was in the House at the time, was a member of the party responsible for it. the honourable member to apply his remarks to the Bill. pose to construct the railway fin the Northern Territory under the same management. Do honourable members realize that the work will eventually cost millions of pounds? Are they prepared to see a repetition of such an outrageous waste of public money, which was due to incompetency on the part of the management? done after the Labour Government went out of office. MT. FOSTER,-A S a member of the House at the time, I followed the conto end, and I was everlastingly bringing the facts before Parliament; but. no redress was granted. Although two separate Prime Ministers promised an investigation, by expert railway men, of the cases brought under the notice of the House, no investigation was made.

There has never been a greater calamity in railway construction in Australia than thei'e was in connection with the East-West line, owing to the adoption of the day-labour system and the provision of an excess of rolling-stock both during and subsequent to construction. ment have placed the principle of Government work by public tender in the forefront of their platform. There is rolling stock on the East-West line to the value of about £970,000, and the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Stewart) discovered fourteen engines at Port Augusta that had never been used. The Blue-Book contains an account of twenty-two such engines. what has the number of the engines on the East-West railway to do with the Bill before the House? ( Mr Watkins) A general reference only to the matter to which the honourable member has referred would be in order. impossible to build a railway without engines. There is a danger of providing too many engines in a similar fashion for the Northern Territory railway instead of leaving a contractor to decide the number of engines and the quantity of rolling-stock required, thus relieving the Government of that responsibility. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) does not like to hear the truth about the East-West line. If I am not permitted to tell the truth in this Chamber, I shall make it known outside. The press well remembers what took place. -An honourable member may not enter into a discussion 6f the merits of the prime to inform him that his term would vate contract system as against government work.

Is the railway in the Northern Territory to be managed from Melbourne T Darwin from Melbourne, and they made a ghastly mess of it . public money into the sea. The construction of the East-West railway was managed from Melbourne. For years the work was directed by telegraph, and The present Governdraftsmen in Melbourne were employed preparing drawings. A mistake was made in the construction of an engine house. It was found, when the building was well advanced, that the engines could not enter it. The foundations were of concrete, and dynamite was used, to blow up the massive concrete, the whole work having to be started afresh. in charge still in his -position ? Port Augusta were erected upon an unsuitable site, and they had to be pulled down and shifted. It is not pleasant for me to say these things, but I feel it to be my duty to do so. I urge honourable members to investigate the present proposal before they commit the country to an expenditure of a million and. a half of money. The total cost will amount to many millions before the North-South line is completed.

Railway work generally has been revolutionized of late years. vernments have realized the importance of obtaining as their Chief Railways Commissioners the most brainy men to be found. When New South Wales selected Mr Johnston as its Chief Commissioner, men in that State such as those responsible for the blunders on the East-West railway made matters too hot for h i m. Not knowing which way to t u r n , he relinquished his post;, but when he was on bis way home, the then Prime Minister sent a wireless telegram asking him to return ' to Australia and take over the construction of the East-West, line for the Government. He might have been prepared! if he had been asked while he was here to undertake the responsibility, but he had made his plans and continued his journey to the Old experiences, followed the New South Wales example. cided to secure up-to-date men with new ideas, and they appointed more than one such man as Chief Railways Commissioner, beginning w it h Mr Tait. what Mr Tait did for the railway system railway revenue in this State was decreasing, and the different lines instead of earning pretty nearly f u l l interest on the cost of construction were going back.

They are expected to do the whole' of the business of their divisions from their particular centres on the spot. Every railway man in South Australia w ill admit that this will result in enormous economy, and in great satisfaction to the people, who will be able to transact even their most important business in their own centres. The new Railway Commissioner in South Australia has withdrawn from Adelaide a big proportion of the staff previously employed there, because it is no longer required. I have noticed in the newspapers ' that Mr Clapp and his fellow Commissioners in Victoria are proposing reforms in the same direction.

It should be a matter of interest tp the taxpayers of the Commonwealth to know why those engines, in accordance with the policy of the Government of the time, have never turned a wheel. A story goes the rounds that the Government of the matter of railway construction, and that the twenty engines I refer to were built to be employed on the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge railway from Oodnadatta to the Northern Territory. the honourable member said nothing about those engines, I suggest that he does not know thc reason why they were bought. them. member has been more lacking in his duty to the Commonwealth than the oflicer whom he has maligned in connection with I stand the construction of the East-West railway. .He was a responsible Minister, and it was his duty to reveal these things, and not to leave it to a successor to discover them. the reports of the Department for years. information from the general public, or the present.

I agree with the honourable member that we have not sufficient information with regard to the financial aspect of this proposal. I do not wish to see the Commonwealth Government fritter away public money. I do not desire that they should spend money as some was spent on the East-West railway when Mr W. Kelly, then member for Wentworth, was Minister for Works and Railways.

If we are not, we should make ourselves competent, and I think we could do so without importing fresh blood. I believe that amongst the engineers of Australia we could find some one competent to do what is required. We have had one or two importations recently, and amongst them Mr Webb, the Eailway Commissioner of South Australia. member for Wakefield that Mr Webb has not yet published his first annual report, and he cannot say what saving he will make in the conduct of the railways. One thing he has done has been to cut out all cleaning of brasswork on rolling stock.

I hope the policy adopted in the Northern Territory will not be that adopted in South Australia. The late Commissioner decided that a railway station should be not only a thing of utility, but a thing of beauty. away with all unsightly hoardings, and had picket fences erected and painted white. Three prizes were offered for the best kept stations in South Australia, nnd stationmasters vied with each other to win the prizes. A new station was erected, and probably such a station will be required in the Northern Territory when this extension is made. We built the new station. I do not know the Wakefield ( Mr Foster), but all the taxpayers of South Australia were proud of it. A feature which was new to them was that the ramp was lined with glazed tiles. Over these glazed tiles there is now a big advertisement for ""Velvet soap."" That is how the Commissioner is making a profit on the railways. man is talking a lot of drivel. actually happening. Is the honourable member for.Wakefield ( Mr Foster) prepared to say that my statement is not correct? I want to get away from the extraneous matter introduced by the honourable member for Wakefield, but I join with him in emphasizing the view that the Minister should display some sagacity and take all possible steps to see that the mistakes made in the construction of the East-West line are not repeated in the extension from Mataranka to Daly Waters, NowI come to the meat in the pie. The extension has been recommended by the Public Works Committee, but I challenge members of the Committee to state their opinions on this much-debated question, and to explain why they made the recommendation, and why they went outside the ambit of their instructions in dealing with a connection to Camooweal which would settle for all time-or , as the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) said, "" for generations""-the question of the extension of the line through the centre of Australia. There is more in the recommendation than appears on the surface; and I believe that what I have suggested will happen if the recommendation is accepted.

140,I Point Out To The Honourable Mr Yates,"I am stating what isAdelaide. Does it not look as if South Australia has the best right to the traffic? Who is more entitled to it? Which State has attempted to develop the centre of Australia from its own territory? State carried a railway to Oodnadatta ? What State built one frean Darwin to Pine Creek? What State erected an overland telegraph for the use of the Commonwealth, and for the benefit of the eastern States, for many years? but the central State of Australia ? When we ask that the promises made should be honoured, and that the Commonwealth shall do the work which, in the interests of Australia, cannot be done too quickly, we are taunted with desiring to "" drag "" everything to South Australia. does a line to Camooweal mean ? Does it not mean that business will be "" dragged "" to Brisbane, Townsville, «r Cairns? Is that in the minds of the Ministers and the Public Works Committee? Combes has evidently got to work on the Committee. the Committee's report he has outlined a proposal which he mad® to the Commission of which he was a member in 1914. The Minister has said that Mr Hobler has gone to Pellew Islands to see if that scheme is practicable. It appears that the intention is to side-step South Australia, not only for twelve years, but, as the honourable member for Lilley said, "" for generations."" There seems to be no limit. Honourable members may say that the proposed line will -develop three-fourths fore, the fact that the Northern Territory of the Territory, but, after having studied tbe figures relating to its possibilities, I say that it will do no more than develop the northern ports and the north of the Northern Territory. issued with the report, if it shows anything, shows that But the larger idea of national development which South Australia conceived and desired to carry through, which would involve a railway right through the Territory, has not been considered. It is stated in evidence that the Oodnadatta line stops 80 miles short of the good country at Charlotte Waters. If the line were carried 80 miles further to Charlotte Waters and Alice Springs, a losing proposition might possibly be changed into a payable one. I say "" possibly,"" because Mr Combes stated that he had never known a pastoral railway that had paid Mr Yates. working expenses and interest. Mr Combes says thatThe extension I have suggested of the Queensland railway system across the Barkly Tableland What would develop the Northern Territory better than any other scheme proposed. It would not'pay directly; but I do not think there is any railway in Australia, serving purely pastoral country, that has ever paid working expenses and interest.

That, as appears from the evidence, was clearly the intention of the 'Government. very short l if e in that country, and it would, therefore, be a mistake to provide at the start for an unnecessarily wide gauge. lized sleepers are lasting very well in the Northern Territory, and that only in one or'two instances has the white ant got into them. It is stated in the evidence before the Public Works Committee that the powellized sleepers have won out. Thei n tention of the Government was that the line should be built to a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. Wle are getting further away from the compact with South Australia. I quote tlie following evidence given before the Committee by Mr Norris Garrett Bell, Commonwealth Commissioner of R a i lways, as set out on page 290 of the Committee's summary of evidence:-If a 3-ft. G-in. line were built on a 4-ft. 8}-in. Toad, it would be only necessary 'to shift one rail in order bo convert the line to tbe broader gauge. tbe Darwin line has been laid on that principle, but the old .portion of the track is only made for a 3-ft -6-'in. gauge. 'The -disadvantage of -extending the present mileage 'of 3-ft. 6-in. railways is that it will be necessary to have unore rolling-stock, \both for the construction and the operation of the line, and when 'the 'line is converted to '4-ft. 8j-in. gauge, that 'Stock will be a drug in the market. Of course, it will be very many years before the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge is converted throughout Australia, but I 'hope it will not 'be long be/fore dtfher gauges 'are 'oonverbed to the standard of 4-ft. i%%-in. If (the -complete North-South line were .tn be built straight away, the first job would be to alter the gauge of the existing sections from Port Augusta to Marree or Oodnadatta, and Darwim to Emungalan (Katherine After). But if the line is -to .be built piecemeal, it would .pay to leave the existing sections as they are. 'There would be some advantage, if the Tailway followed 'tbe eastern route, in having -a gauge uiwiform wish .tihnrt -of the Queensland -railways., in order to enable quick transit of trains and common use of rolling-stock, but cattle will never be carried satisfaetorily for such long 'distances on 'a -narrow-gauge line. In Queensland the longest distanoe -cattle are travelled without detraining, watering, and ieeding. is 580 miles. The detraining knocks the cattle about, and a this is always objected 'to by the owners. The cattle are kept in tbe trucks up to 32 land 34 'hours, and then are detrained, fed, and watered. But on the Bast-West line we can carry stock 1,050 miles, and keep them in the trucks for 48 [601 hours. . .On a narrow-gauge line cattle trucks are so wide, comparatively, that it -is not safe to attain the maximum speed. I -quote that evidence to show that the Government is doing something which, in its own judgment, it should not do. The object may be to fill up the gap created by the scrapping of the A i r ForceB ill . J t is for the members of the Public Works Committee to j u s t if y tlie position into I have read that powelwhich ithey have led the Government. They -have to let South Australia know where it stands, and whether it w ill ever obtain a railway from south to north. No one supports 'decentralization more than I . I do not believe in dragging everything to Adelaide. My idea of the best ""way to develop Australia is to put a railwa y right across the continent, w it h natural connexions east and west. It should be made a national railway. I support the North-South railway, bocause it is a national project, and will be of national benefit if tackled in a national manner. If , however, it is to be built piecemeal, the people of Australia, instead of having a railway line right through the centre of the continent, will have a line from Daly Waters to An thony's Lagoon, thence to the mouth of The newest .portion of the McArthur -River, and that will be the end of the -development of the vast Northern Territory which South Australia was good enough -to -give to the Commonwealth. port the B ill , although I think that the -Government are commencing railway extension 'at the wrong end. 'Had the ex-Prime Minister{ MrW . M .

The Government are a little unwise in giving effect to only one portion of the Public Works Committee's report. mended the further extension of the existing northern section, and also the extension of the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, and I think that even now the Government will be well advised to construct fche latter project simultaneously with the former. It may be news to honourable members that on the whole 1.60 miles of country which the proposed line will traverse, there is not one occupied holding except that established by the Government at Mataranka. tainly, there is a little mining at Marranboy, which is capable of great development, bufc I do not think that a distance of 45 miles from the railway would seriously handicap the production of t in .

Alice Springs? two when the Sectional Committee of the Public Works Committee visited the place, but unless the Commonwealth is prepared to spend £1,000,000 to £2,000,000 in Port Darwin further south to Newcastle Waters or Powell's Creek, the line will be a heavy drain upon the finances of the country for many years. The extension from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs would have a better opportunity of paying its way than will the extension of the northern section. Experts say that the influence of a railway upon pastoral pursuits is felt for a distance of 100 miles on either side. A line constructed from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, a distance of Stuart, the actual centre of Australia, and a comparatively large number of occupied holdings I do not wish to mislead the Housei n regard to the quality of the land in different portions of the Territory. It is quite safe to say that the richest portion is the Victoria River district, for not only is that land equal in quality to that of the Barkly Tablelands, but it has an abundance of natural waters which the Tablelands do not enjoy. On the Tablelands illimitable supplies may be tapped by boring to a depth of about 200 feet, and there are wonderful natural grasses. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) said that the Public Works Committee would The Committee recomhave great difficulty in justifying its recommendation that the northern section should be extended southwards to Newcastle Waters-I personally think it should be carried further south before swinging to the east-bu t the country which the line will traverse is infinitely superior to that strip between Newcastle Waters and the Macdonnell Ranges. Evidence taken by the Public Works Committee supports that contention. Dr. Gilruth informed the CommitteeCerA railway to the Macdonnell Ranges will make the position much safer for the pastoralists, who havo had difficulty frequently in getting stock even from the Macdonnell Ranges to Oodnadatta. Tliat is a long, dry stretch, Oodnadatta being within the 5 to G-in. rainfall belt. Even Eergott Springs is within the 6-in. rainfall belt. No r t h of the Barkly Tablelands and in the Victoria River district there is a very good rainfall, varying from 15 inches \to 20 inches per annum.. Those districts thus enjoy a wonderful advantage over the country further south. I remind the honourable member for Adelaide that the Public Works Committee was instructed to report upon two definite sections df the constructing the railway from proposed North-South railway, and was not empowered to take evidence whether or hot the Commonwealth was keeping its contract with South Australia. A pronouncement upon t h a t point was not the function of the Works Committee. Such a question must be determined by the High Court. In Queensland evidence was advanced that no compact exists. compact does not exist. MrM .

Queensland members of the Committee exercised their right to ask various witnesses their opinion regarding the arrangement which the State of South Australia was supposed to have made with the Commonwealth. said that that question was not referred to the Committee. Evidently the Committee exceeded its authority. to tbe Committee, but I will not say that the Committee should have discarded evidence, that was presented to it . ber think that questions regarding the compact were justified? of the Public Works Committee two or three weeks before the transcontinental trip by fche sectional Committee was undertaken. The sectional Committee was composed of Senator Newland (Chairman), Senator Foil, and myself, and in matters of procedure I was guided by the two members of longer experience, and the Secretary. when those questions were asked? Such questions were asked not only by Queensland members of the Committee, bufc also by the Chairman of the sectional Committee. If honourable members' will read the evidence, they w ill discover that the same issue was raised in South Australia, and, I believe, at least one pressed grave doubts whether any compact for the construction of the railway north and south exists. However, that issue does not concern the House at the present moment. The enforcement of the compact, if any exists, is a matter for the attention of South Australian members. I think I can safely say that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) and I wore the only unbiased members of the Committee.. ( Mr Gregory), because, on account of ill ness, he attended very few of the meetings at which this reference was dealt with. The other members of the Committee comprised three Queenslanders, one South Australian, and one representative from New South Wales. Each of those three States hopes to derive some benefit from the construction of the North-South railway. The Queensland members of the Committee wished to swing the railway to the east, in order to link up with the Queensland railways and ports, and the New 'SouthW l a e s representative helped them, because he thought that such a line would be extended south vid Boulia, Windorah, Eromanga, and Thargomindah to Bourke, thus forming direct communication between Darwin and Sydney. Of course, Senator Newland was battling for the interests of South Australia. MrM . CAMERON -Fo r the honouring of the compact? Mir. JACKSON -No. He thought, as I think, that the first section of the railway to be built should be that from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, because the country is worth it . Such a railway would make a lot of land productive, and would have more chance of paying working expenses and contributing something towards interest and sinking f u n d than will the 160 miles of line from Mataranka to Daly Waters, where, as I have said, along the route of which there is not one occupied holding, except the Government station at Mataranka, which has been run . at a considerable loss for many years. D r . Gilruth's evidence, continuedI consider that a railway extension in the north, and another in the south, from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, would be sufficient to open up the Northern Territory, without running a railway through 600 or 700 miles of poor country. A railway extension from the Katherine to Daly Waters would not traverse very good pastoral country. From the .Katherine practically to Mataranka is all, poor South Australian witness excountry. Tliere are patches of better country heTe and there, but tbe meTe fact that nobody has taken it up, although it is practically near to civilization, indicates the character of it without necessarily seeing it . I think it is time the Government made some announcement as to when they will continue the line southwards from Daly Waters, and whether it is their intention to extend it eastwards across the Barkly Tableland into Queensland. Personally I favour the eastern extension, but it is no use attempting, with two little railI exclude the Chairman ways, or even with a through railway, to develop a country four and a half times the size of the British Isles. There must be many thousand miles of railway before that country can be properly developed.'

162,Mr Jackson,"Senato r Newland.if the line were to be built from the south instead of from the north he would not be condemning the railway management. In fairness to the honourable member for Wakefield, I may say that when he and I discussed that phase of the question definite as to what he proposed to say in the House to-day. I am confident that if the line had been taken from the south instead of the north the honourable member's words would have been the same. Mr Hobler, the Commonwealth engineer, when giving evidence before the Committee, suggested that, instead of a line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, there ought to be a line to Marree, north to, Birdsville, and thence to Camooweal, across the Tablelands to Darwin. A more insane proposition could not be put before the Parliament of any country. look at a rainfall map of Australia we find that the belt with a rainfall of under 10 inches is in the west pa'rt of Queensland, and that for something like 700 or 800 miles the railway favoured by Mr Hobler would go in a southerly direction, and eventually in a south-westerly direction, through country with a rainfall of from less than 8 inches to 3|inches. I shall read an extract from the evidence of a man who lives on the very route of that suggested railway, and honourable members should ask themselves whether any one man who thought that a railway was likely to go through his property-of course, to his considerable benefit-woul d give such evidence if he did not honestly believe it to be true. The witness was Mr William John Crombie, whose, station is situated where the rainfall is $ \ inches, and where frequently no rain falls in twelve or fifteen months. He saidVery little of the country is subject to floods. Honourable members may smile, but permit me to explain what that means. rain comes to places in Queensland, as at Winton, the gently sloping country allows the water to, flow over a largearea, and to. flood thousands of square miles, but of a very shallow depth. I had a letter some time ago from Birdsville stating that there had been no rain there for eight months,, but that the country all round was asgreen as .possible.. The explanation that the water had flowed, dawn some 200 OF 300miles., so that while there was no Mr Jackson. rain there was plenty of feed. That is what the witness meant. To proceedVery little of this country is subject to floods; the average rainfall is under 4 inches per annum. The bore water runs for about 2 miles through my country, and the stock have to be brought from any portion of the last week he was very run to that water for a drink. I have put down fourteen wells, and in every instance have struck salt water-so sadt, in some instances, that the hydrometer will not measure it. The deepest well was 98 feet, and the shallowest 54 feet. The cost of my putting down a bore would be altogether too great;, this bore here cost £11,000, and I do not think the country is worth it. Open bores are just a harbour for vermin-dingoe s and rabbits-and run to waste. It would be of more use if the water were confined in some way. Here is the point to which I desire to call particular attentionIn my opinion, this country is not good If we enough to warrant tlie construction of a railway from Marree to Birdsville. Yet an engineer for Commonwealth Railways says that the country is better in 1 the . north of South. Australia than in Central Australia. If honourable members read that gentleman's evidence they will see that he got badly "" tangled up "" in his description of the country at the Kimberleys, Alice Springs and Central Australia, and the north-east of South Australia. Prom honourable members who have read Professor Gregory's Dead Heart of Australia, dealing with what is known as. the Lalie Eyre Basin, I shall be disap-' pointed if I hear any suggestion that the North-South line should be built in such a "" dog-leg ''' fashion as through the Barkly Tablelands, the western portions of Queensland, and into the State of South Australia. I understand that in 1912 the Queensland Government proposed to construct a line linking up its three main lines that run out from the coast; but nothing has been done in that direction. I shall not be a party to expenditure on taking a line through any When portionof a State so poorly watered as is the west of Queensland. not because the country is bad that no action has been taken.

I am not concerned with the Gulf country, where the rainfall and the land are good, but with that portion where the Queensland Government hopes that the Commonwealth GovernmetS will build a railway which the State Government is afraid to build. that the Government has not seen its way to accept the advice of the Public Works Committee, and proceed with the work of construction in the south. I was interested to hear from the honourable member for Wakefield that the Minister( Mr Stewart) intends to visit Alice Springs, and to report to the Government on the position there. sincerely trust that by car, or camel, or horse, he will have a look at the country the line will traverse, and then tell the plain truth in regard to both sections. I can quite understand that the Government cannot see its way to carry the line to Newcastle Waters, because that project would have to be referred to the Public Works Committee for consideration and report. But before we pass the second reading I think the M in ister ought to assure us that the work now to be carried out' is only part of the scheme, and that it is the intention of the Government to ask the Public Works Committee to report on the further extensions in the south, through to Newcastle Waters or Powells Creek, and also the extension across the Barkly Tablelands. If these works are carried out, I feel sure that for a number of years the railway requirements of the Territory will have been met. Then will be the time to decide whether the line shall link up between Alice. Springs and Newcastle Waters or Powells Creek, wherever the terminus may be Alice Springs? years prior to 1920, there was an average rainfall of 10.73 inches. [5.30] -It is not my intention'to labour the question. WhatI am concerned about is the passing of the measure as t : stands, and that, I take it , is assured. There are, however, a few comments that I should like to make in connection with the statement of the Minister( Mr. Stewart). We are told that steel sleepers are to be used in the construction of this line. It is true that the Territory is somewhat infested with white ants, and that ordinary timbers are of little or no use in railway construction. The statement has been advanced that powellised sleepers are quite all right, but that I deny. Practical experience has shown I am disappointed that powellised sleepers are useless in the Northern Territory, where I have seen them penetrated at all angles by white^ ants. Where this treated timber is ex-' posed to the atmosphere, as in the stanchions of bridges, it becomes simply a mass of dry rot which can be kicked away. However, there is in the Territory a timber which resists all attacks, and it I is available in quantities more than sufficient to meet the requirements of this railway. I refer to iron-wood, quantities of which were used in the construction of the original railway in the Northern Territory and are sound to-day. That is what could not be said even of steel sleepers. In view of the fact that the use of iron-wood would open up a new avenue of employment, the Minister would be well advised to discard both steel and powellised timber in favour of sleepers which will last not only for a decade but for a century. Iron-wood used in the Territory in the times of the Dutch settlement is quite sound to-day. used on the existing section of the line from Darwin? constructed by the Commonwealth, from the Katherine to Pine Creek, powellised and steel sleepers were used, the former on the curves, and the latter on the straight.

If , however, the land is locked up, the line will merely serve a few large squatters. I am not deceived as to the intention of some of the advocates of a deviation from Newcastle Waters across to Camooweal. An extension to Camooweal Would not to any great extent assist the development of the Territory. The possibility of a line from Borroloola to Newcastle Waters has been mentioned, and that would be far more likely to lead to development than a deviation to Camooweal The whole matter should be viewed from an Australian stand-point, and no consideration as to how Queensland should be linked up should prevent honourable members from giving effect to the best proposal for the settlement of the Territory.

I hope that X have misinterpreted a promise which the Minister gave aa a reason for saying little about the section of the NorthSouth railway earamecting Oodnadatta w i th the Macdonnell Banges.

Theengineers engaged on this bridge w ill have toguard against the torrential rains,, otherwise the first half of the bridge may be washed away before they w ill be able to proceed with the second half. I have heard the evidence tendered by men who are qualified to testify. They state that it w ill be no easy matter to build a bridge over the Katherine Eiver. The building of this bridge w ill delay the work very considerably. I presume that it will' be necessary to construct the bridgebefore an engine can be used to convey structural materials to other parts of the line.

213,Mr Lacey (Grey) [6.16],"I do notB ill , but I bope it w ill not in any way prejudice tbe construction of tbe line from Oodnadatta northwards. I rise to answer certain allegations that have been made during the discussion. vernment must have some reason for starting tbe line from the northern end, while making no provision for the southern end. It may be that a departure from the agreement made with South Australia is contemplated. It is essential for the development of the Northern Territory that there should be a direct line north and south, as proposed in the agreement w i th South Australia. Running out from that line there might be spur lines -to develop the country to the east and west. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) referred to the construction of the EastWest line. His remarks had reference probably to clause 9 of the B ill . Whilei t is the intention of the Government not to let the whole of the work, or any large section of it , by contract, the honourable member for Wakefield endeavoured to prove to the House that work done by contract is cheaper than that carried out by day labour. When dealing w i th tlie question of contract versus day labour last Thursday, I quoted very extensively from a report by MrA . W . Robinson, Chairman of the Railways Standing Committee in South Australia. I do not wish to repeat what I said on that occasion, but in reply to the honourable member for Wakefield, to apprise Government I desire to place the f u l l facts regarding East-West The honourable member for Wakefield was unable to state offhand the estimated cost of constructing the transcontinental railway. ing Committee in South Australia shows that the estimate submitted by Mr Henry Deanei n 1911 was £3,508 per mile, excluding rolling-stock. The greater portion of the construction wae carried out by the present Commissioner, Mr Norris_ G. Bell, and it was estimated that the final cost of the line would be £5,807 per mile. The total estimated cost was £4,045,000 and the actual cost to June, 1919, £6,04,5,017, or £5,750 per mile. It has been said that there was a shameful waste of public money because the estimate was exceeded by £2,300 per mile. Complaint might just as reasonably be made that the line was too cheaply conThe Gostructed, because in 1913 the South Australian Railway Department estimated that a similar line, with the same ruling grade, between Salisbury and Port Augusta, would cost £7,833 per mile. Mr. Deane's estimate and the estimate of the South Australian Railway Department were based on wages at 10s. per day, whereas the average wage actually paid was 13s. OJd. The actual expenditure included £1,246,265 for work for which Mr. Deane's estimate made no provision whatever. It is only fair to state the details of the work which was actually carried out, but not provided for in the original estimate, because the comparison made by the newspapers and everybody else is a comparison of the estimated cost with the actual cost. --The honourable member may not relate the history of the East-West railway unless he can apply it specifically to this Bill. remarks is clause 9, which will allow the Commissioner to carry out work by contract.

The honourable member contended that the estimated cost of that line was largely exceeded because of the Commissioner's incapacity. It is perfectly true that the estimated cost was largely exceeded; but I deny that that was because of any incapacity on the part of the Commissioner. I should like to quote a few figures in regard to the dost of the line. The estimate, prepared before the present Commissioner took office, was £4,04'5,000. It was an estimate f a r lower than it should have been. Excluding rolling-stock, it represented £3,508 per mile. The rails, fastenings, and sleepers alone cost £3,000 per mile, which, under the estimate, l e f t a little over £500 per mile for laying the An y surplus rolling-stock road, doing all the earthworks, building the bridges, culverts, telegraph lines, and so for t h . POT permanent way material alone the estimate was short by no less than £1,270,000; that was for the purchase price of the material, and landing it on the works. The weight of r a i l was in creased from 7tf lbs. to 80 lbs. per yard. Ballasting was done as against earth packi n g ; additional earthworks were carried out in order to give better grades. A great deal of the line was ballasted in a more permanent way, and resulted in a line superior to that anticipated when the estimate was framed. Perhaps the best way of proving that the cost of construction was not excessive is by comparing it w i th the cost of construction of railways within the State of South Australia. The actual cost of the railway, excluding rolling stock, was £5,900 per mile. The Gawier to Angaston line, in South Aus-",44,Northern Territory Railwa Yextensionbill Second Reading

I have had prepared a comparison of the costs of work carried out under contract by Mr Teesdale Smith over 14 miles, and by the Commissioner over an adjoining 14 miles. Under the Teesdale Smith contract the price of cuttings was 4s. 6d. per yard, and under the Commissioner 2s. 3|$d. pei"" yard. The price of hanks under the Teesdale Smith contract was 2s. 6d. per yard, but under the Commissioner this cost was included in that of the cutting.

I do not know whether the honourable member, when Ministerf o r Works and Railways, ever travelled over the transcontinental line. member was Minister? ber has accused the Chief Commissioner of incompetency, but it appears that when he was invited by the Commissioner to travel on the line he did not accept the invitation. tbe Minister! that the honourable member did not accept what was a very proper suggestion for the Chief Commissioner to make. The EastWest line is the best equipped and the best conducted in Australia, and it gives greater satisfaction to the travelling public than any other railway in this country, and probably in the world. These results have been obtained under the control of a Commissioner who for half an hour today was the subject of a tirade of abuse from the honourable member. Let me now quote some of the opinions expressed by world-wide travellers on the way in which the East-West line is conducted by the present Commissioner. The original letters in which these opinions appear may be seen by honourable members if they so desire. In one letter it is statedThe railway struck rae as being extremely well managed and equipped. Another letter saysI do not think T could have heen more comfortable. AnotherI have travelled in many parts of the world, and I do not know in any service more careful attention to the travelling public. AnotherI have travelled iu most of the famous European expresses, and this year crossed The price of surface formation North America by the New York Central and Canadian-Pacific Railway. Your cars exceed anything I experienced in America in comfort. The recognised standards of cost in operating railways are, for maintenance, the cost, per average mile of railway open, and, for locomotive and traffic working, 'the cost per t r a in mile. The management, under Commissioner Bell compares more than favourably with that in South Australia. The maintenance of permanentway under Commissioner Bell costs £ 7 2 per mile, while on the South Australian railways that cost is £ 1 7 1 per mile. The traffic working on the Commonwealth line costs 19d. per mile, and on the South Australian railways 28d. per mile. TheT h e honourable memhonorable member for Wakefield cannot refute those figures. thing I ber went on to say that the extra locomotives referred to were ordered by Mr. Bell. As a matter of fact, these locomotives, which, in the words of the honourable member, "" have not turned a wheel,"" were ordered by the Fisher Government, and not at the request of the Commissioner.",45,Northern Territory Railwa Yextensionbill Second Reading

Are the Minister's remarks relevant in a second-reading speech on the Bill? -The honourable member's point of order is scarcely a good one, in view of the fact that several honourable members have been permitted to discourse on the relative costs of the East-West railway in contrasting the contract and day-labour methods of construction. tude. ber had reasonable latitude, and the M in ister must have the same, and no more. but I shall not unduly labour the point. I should like to quote an extract from a speech made by MrA . W . Robinson, M . L . A . , of South Australia, in moving the adoption of the eighth general report of the Railway Standing Committee in the House of Assembly, Adelaide, i u 1920. the East-West line, he saidThe actual cost to June, 1919, was £0,045,017, or £5,750 per mile. It is said to be a sliameful waste of public expenditure, because the estimate was exceeded by £2,300 per mile. It might be just as well to complain the line was too cheaply constructed because, in 1913, the South Australian Railway Department estimated that a practically similar line, with the same ruling grade, between Salisbury and Port Augusta, would eost £7,833 per mile. I quote these extracts in order to show that the Commissioner, who will have charge of the construction of this line if the B ill passes, is not, as suggested by the honourable member for Wakefield, in competent, but is a man who can safely be trusted with such an undertaking. The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner has had a long and honourable service. He was for twenty-eight years in the service of Queensland, and has I am not going to been for nine years in the service of the Commonwealth. Hehas rendered loyal and f a it h f u l service. The honourable member for Wakefield suggested that he intended to get r i d of this officer because of his incompetence. I wish to say that I do not concur in the opinion which the honourable member expressed. I do not regard the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner as an incompetent officer. I have seen the files, Only to-day he has been appointed for a further term of two years, which w ill bring him up to the age l i m it for retireI rise to a point of order. ment-sixty-fiv e years. That should in dicate my opinion of him, and during the next two years I can leave it to members whether the honourable member for Wakefield or myself is the better judge of a competent railway engineer. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) suggested the use of ironwood sleepers, and we will go carefully into the points he has raised. posed, according to the estimate of the cost of t h » line? I understood that as many wooden sleepers were destroyed by white ants, it was proposed to use conI ask for no more, crete or steel sleepers. tion is to use steel sleepers, but in view of the remarks which have been made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, if the Commissioner finds on investigation that there is some substitute for steel sleepers which would give as Referring to construction costs of good or better results, we w ill not tie ourselves down to their use. There have been many complaints by honourable members coming from South Australia. They have complained that for years and years not a solitary thing has been done towards the construction of the NorthSouth line. Thab is perfectly true, but the present Government is not responsible for the inactivity of previous Governments. A f t e r six months of office it has submitted this B ill to the House, and a concrete proposal for the expenditure of over £1,500,000 on the North-South line. It is strange that honourable members should complain of the inactivity of the Government when it is the only Government that has so f a r shown any desire to be active in the construction of the line.",46,Northern Territory Railwa Yextensionbill Second Reading

247,Mr Stewart,"The present intenvernment is active in the wrong direction. the construction of the southern section of the line is not lost sight of by tbe Government. It is under consideration, and in order that We may be fully apprised of the conditions under which its construction must be proceeded with, I intend, as I said before, to go over the route of this section, look at the country for myself, and report upon it to the Cabinet. It has been suggested that some members of the Public Works Committee have not the necessary experience fco enable them to give a valuable opinion aa to the pastoral and other possibilities of the country through which the extension proposed by this Bill will pass. Perhaps, without trumpet-blowing, I may be permitted fco say that I have had some experience of new pastoral country aud practical experience of agriculture. I know as well as most honourable members, and better than some, what are the potentialities of new and undeveloped country. I have great faith in the inland districts of Australia. The history of settlement in this country is that the pioneers who took up the out-back portions were regarded as optimistic lunatics. In the early days in Victoria when pioneers went out-back to Donald, Birchip, and Rainbow, in the lower Mallee, they were regarded as fools who had gone beyond the safety lino. But a few years later men moved out to Woomelang and to Ouyen, also to Carwarp and the Yatpool country, where I selected land. pessimists asked us, "" Do you ever expect to grow wheat in that country ?"" and when we put in our seed in 1914, and there was a drought, aud we grew no wheat, they said, ""We told you so."" that although we grew no wheat, settlers 150 miles further south grew none in that season. To-day Carwarp aud Yatpool aro sound agricultural settlements, though less than ten years ago the land was used only for the raising of a few sheep. I believe that the history of the Mallee will be the history of other outback country in Australia, and that land that is to-day regarded as beyond :he pale and useless, will by future generations be regarded as sound pastoral country, if not also as sound agricultural country. present GothinkI can say that the other members of tlie Government hold the same view. We haye great faith in the outback country, and so far as our financial position will permit, we will do all that we can to open up the back portions of Australia. This Bill represents a first instalment of work in that direction, and as the motion has been fully debated, I ask honourable members to give the Bill the quick passage its merits deserve. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3The Commissioner may, subject to this Act, and to the Commonwealth Bailways Act 1917, extend the railway in the Northern Territory by the -construction of a railway from the southern terminus of the railway in the Northern Territory to Daly Waters. clause gives power to the Government to extend the Northern Territory railway to Daly Waters. I do not suppose there is one member of the Committee who would vote for the extension of the line to Daly Waters unless he knew that the Government had a distinct intention to carry it further. I was unfortunately ill when the report of the Public Works Committee was being considered, and I , though Chairman of the Committee, had no association with it. Buti t shows that this extension will carry the Northern' Territory line into very poor country. The recommendation of the Committee The in favour of it is based on the presumption that further action will be taken by the Government, and I think that the Minister for Works and Bailways( Mr Stewart) should take honourable members We replied into his confidence, and tell us what the Government intend to do after the line is constructed to Daly Waters. He should say whether it is intended to continue the line directly south or divert it towards Camooweal. The Public Works Committee ihas recommended 'that the line should be diverted towards Camooweal, but we should know the intention of the Government, if it has come to a decision on the point. I think that we should consider first of all the development of the Northern Territory.

Some extracts from the minutes on which the resolutions were based have been quoted for a purpose, but nob io unduly influence Parliament. I submit that the Committee has merely endeavoured to do its duty. This afternoon, I made certain statements as a matter of public duty. They gave me, not pleasure, but pain. I intend to speak as plainly again to-night in reply to the Minister( Mr Stewart). Every word he has said has been said several times ibefore, and is in print. All his arguments have been replied to. He has not replied to a single vital objection raised by .South Australian members. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Watkins) -The honourable member is not in order on this clause in replying to a speech made on the motion for the second reading. another course. The clause relates to "" Power' to construct the railway,"" and I shall deal with the men who will be intrusted with that work. I ask for your ruling, sir, whether the clause giving authority to construct does not provide the Committee with an ""opportunity of discussing the capacity of the officials who arc to have charge of construction. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN Clause7 provides for the appointment of officers. be appointed by the official in charge of construction. Upon the clause now. before the Committee, I can appropriately repeat in the public interests the statement. I made this afternoon, that the Government are proposing to allow this work to be constructed by officials whose past services prove them to be unequal to the big responsibility involved in future undertakings. emphasis every word I uttered this afternoon in that regard. charge that I made has been refuted by the Minister. the rolling-stock is all right, but the man who designed the coaches could not continue longer under the control and direction of the present Railway Commissioner, and he left the Commonwealth Service to take another appointment at double his former salary. I could continue for hours mentioning the names of most efficient men who found it impossible to remain under the control of the Commissioner.

The Minister has a great deal to learn in regard to this matter. I do not blame him, but I do blame the senior members of the Ministry, especially the Attorney-General( Mr Groom), and Senator Pearce, who have knowledge of a waste of public funds to an extent unprecedented in the history of this country. I feel bound to say this. Are not business methods to be employed in connection with public works'f Are we all incapable? I charge those honourable gentlemen who were Ministers at the time that these great losses occurred with incapacity similar to that of the officials. The taxpayers of this country will suffer the loss of millions of pounds if the methods of the past are continued. It seems a tragedy that our memories of the awful losses of public moneys are not more vivid. The Minister of Works and Railways referred to the cost of construcing the East-West railway.

I could continue for two hours enumerating similar mistakes, every one of which has been recorded in Hansard, and has been criticised by every metropolitan newspaper in Australia. These things are forgotten by the gentlemen who to-day have the handling of the public purse, and advance such trashy replies to the charges made against them. The Attorney-General was a member of the Ministry when the then Prime Minister( Sir Joseph Cook) sent a wireless message to Mr Johnson asking him to return to Australia, and take over the completion of the East-West railway, because the Commonwealth was in such desperate straits. In regard to the Teesdale Smith tenders, I told Sir Joseph Cook that I could get him a tender for half the amount that the line was costing by day labour. Three or four contractors had put their heads together, and the Government did not realize the fact. After £2,000,000 had been spent on the railway I introduced Mr Joseph Timms to the Prime Ministeri n 1913, and he offered to complete the railway for another £2,000,000. The Government submitted the offer to the engineer, who afterwards became Commis* sioner, and he stated that he could build the line as cheaply as could a contractor, and he recommended that he be allowed to complete the job by day labour. Let the Attorney-General deny that statement. Timms' tender for earthworks, which was 2s. per yard higher than the cost by day a decision regarding the expenditure of labour.

There which he has seen fit to make an attack is hardly a locomotive on the railway of the right type for drawing an express train. These are solid facts, and the opinion I am expressing is shared by the best railway men in Australia. The construction of the East-West railway made day labour stink in the nostrils of the people, and drove more nails into its coffin than has any other work carried out by the Government. I repeat every word I said about the incapacity and inefficiency of the officials who built that railway. I am only echoing the opinion of leading railway men. has no authority to say that. the Attorney-General with having been as much responsible for that disastrous business as was anybody else. I ask the people of the Commonwealth to decide whether that sort of thing is to continue.

' I take up the debate from the point where it was l e f t by the honourable » member for Hindmarsh ( MrM a k in ) , though I do not propose to say whether the Public Works Committee has been impartial or partial. I shall let the Committee's actions speak for them-, selves. I refer to, its report.

I ask the Committee what it meant by that motion, which was carried 1 W h at right had the Committee to attempt to interfere w it h the compact made between the Commonwealth Of Australia and the State of South Australia? Clearly, and distinctly the Committee exceeded its authority in making the proposal contained in that motion, which is completely condemnatory of the Committee, and shows the attitude it has adopted.

The Public Works Committee unquestionably exceeded the ambit of the references to it in giving expression to the views contained in that motion. It has made a distinct side step. That is not the only paragraph in the report which I have shows the attitude of the Committee. The report is one of the most inept productions that we have ever had from a Committee which was appointed to deal I recollect that a former with a big public work. It has recommended a line that will lead nowhere and which, it admits, will contribute very little towards the early development of the Territory.

302,Chairman Mr Yates,"I hope that the honorMataranka to Daly Waters will of itself contribute very Httle towards the early development of the Northern Territory, and that the recommendation for its construction is only agreed to as being a section of an eventual line to cross the Barkly Tableland to Camooweal, vid Newcastle Waters. The Committee has placed on record for ""all time that it agrees to the construction .of a railway which will not contribute to the development of the Territory. Had the Committee done what it really wished to do it would have recommended, straight out, that a line should be constructed to Camooweal' v id Newcastle Waters. that that statement is justifiable if they look at the map which is attached to the report. Why is that map attached to the report? It contains on it dotted lines which represent railways that theCommittee suggest shall be constructed. One of those lines is from Daly Waters to Anthony Lagoon and then on towards Pellew Island, in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The( Mr Watkins) -The honourable member is getting wide of the question, and quoting the Public Works Committee's report on other lines. the construct]on of this line we should find out whether another route might not be preferable. The question is whether ( we shall consent to a line from Mataranka to Daly Waters. The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN The honourable member's remarks would be quite in order on the second reading, but the House by passing the'second reading has agreed to construct this particular portion of the line. The honourable member must not at this stage discuss the B ill as a whole, particularly the report of the Public Works Committee regarding other proposals. am out of order when other honourable members, including the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) ancl the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( MrM a k i u ) have been allowed to discuss alternative recommendations of the Public Works Committee. I am now suggesting reasons why we should not agree to the clause, and pointing out that the Public Works Committee has recommended or suggested alternative routes. My contention is that fche best route for the line' would be to another terminus. The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN The House has already affirmed the proposal for constructing the line between the two points named in the B ill . that honourable members have no power fco amend this clause; because, on the second reading, the House affirmed thc proposal for building a railway from Mataranka to Daly Waters. I was under the impression that it was the right of every honourable member to move an amendment to any clause, even if that amendment had the effect of altering the whole Honourable members w ill see B ill . As I say, the Public Works Committee suggested alternative routes, even one into the territory of Western Australia. If we cannot act on the recommendations of the Public Works Committee, I should like to know why that Committee went beyond its ambit in this manner in order to suggest a policy to the Government. However, I can only say that if the route laid down in the penalized, and the agreement with the Commonwealth flouted. seems that something I said, this afternoon, has created a little consternation amongst my Queensland fellow members of the Public Works Committee. As soon as this fact was brought under my notice I gave an assurance that when my Hansard proofs reached me to-morrow I would see exactly the words I had used, and, if necessary, would withdraw any objected to. When I made use of the word ""unbiased,"" I may have been a little unfortunate in my choice of a word. PerhapsI can more clearly express myself by saying that the members. I spoke of were the only ""disinterested"" members. The Tasmanian and Victorian members of the Committee can hope to gain nothing for their States whether the line goes into Queensland or into South Australia, and that was what I desired to convey to honourable members this afternoon. I do not impute any improper motive whatever to the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Macleay), or the other Queensland members of the Public Works Committee.

324,"Mr Makin.,","Does the Minister notmember suggest that this extension of 160 miles should be built on the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge? this extension of 160 miles should be constructed on that gauge, but that the existing Northern Territory line should be converted to the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. claim that that is a sensible suggestion. My great complaint in respect of many public undertakings in the Commonwealth is that those responsible for them contented themselves with meeting existing conditions, and did not look forward to the demands which would arise in years to come. Before honourable members agree to the construction of another 160 miles of the Northern Territory railway on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge they should realize what it will cost to convert it to the standard gauge of 4 f t . 8% in., and also ithe existing railway from Darwin to Mataranka to the same gauge. I have not taien part so far in the discussion of this matter, but I have listened with interest to what has been said. One thing that has been rankling in my mind since I read this Bill is this clause proposing the construction of the line on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. In view of the gauge of the existing Northern Territory railway, it does mot seem to me to be a practical proposal to suggest, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh ,( Mr is an optimist. Makin) has done, that this extension sliould ibe constructed on the 4-f.t. .8-J-in. gauge. I move'That the following words be added to the an optimist.

The the clause to pass without making proMinister said that the additional cost vision for sleepers long enough to carry would amount to £1,000 per mile, but in a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge line. I trust the comparison to the total cost of the line Minister will accept the amendment. I that would represent but a small realize that a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line is all honourable amount. We are proposing to spend over £1,500,000 in building 160 mile3 of railway, and by not having the sleepers of sufficient length for a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge we shall be perpetuating the evil and inconvenience which has cost this country untold nrllions up to the present time. I was much struck by the picture which I the Minister painted of what might happen in this part of Australia in the light of what has happened in other parts of the Commonwealth. How a man holding such views as he has expressed can recommend the extension of this line with sleepers capable of carrying only a 3-ft. 6-in. line I cannot understand. I have it on good authority that steel sleepers would probablylast forty or fifty years. Who can say what will happen in this country long before that time has elapsed? Very little more than fifty years ago, in my father's home, some wise people said that uniform railway gauges in New South Wales and Victoria were desirable, whilst others said that the railways would never meet in their lifetime. Yet before fifteen years elapsed the New South Wales and Victorian railways met on the northern bank of the Murray. The .same thing will occur aga'.n. This country is not going to .stand still. I venture to think that we are in for an era of advancement and prosperity in this country never previously equalled siwee ithe days of the gold diggings.
