Colonel Bridges, Chief of Intelligence, -when he will be able to furnish the report, and he informed me that it will be supplied almost immediately. exactly when it wiil be ready; but I think that it will be available in the course of a week or two. to honourable members ? might be well to hive it printed. £833-2 the Minister of Trade and Customs if he can say when the report with regard to .the working of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural 'Machinery) Act will be furnished, and also why Excise duties under that Act have not been collected up to the present time? to-morrow or Thursday to be able to give the honourable member some information which has been supplied to me. Excise duties been collected? give the honourable member that information, too. .Trade and Customs, upon noticeI n reference to the following statement from a Geelong merchant"" A palpable grievance is the new levy made of n duty on the cases, &c., containing the goods imported. It was always understood that the 10 per cent, added to invoice cost, and on which duties are levied, was the cost of bringing the goods here. Such charges as freight, packing, insurance, & c , and latterly the inland carriage, were not allowed--and now the packing, equal on an average to 2^ per -cent, in point of factso much more duty levied""Docs this condition of affairs exist, and will the Minister be able to immediately amend it? swer to the honourable member's question is as follows:Under the former Tariff all' outside cases in* which goods were usually imported were free. This exemption has now been taken away under the new Tariff (following the recommendntion of the Commission) in regard to goods on whicVad valorem duty is payable. In regard to such goods the law requires that the value for duty shall be the f.o.b. value at the port of shi). ment. Any alteration in practice must await the action of Parliament. In regard to Axed rate and free goods the outside casing (other than casks and tanks) is still free. ment ought to stop these references to the reports of one section of the Tariff Commission as the reports of the whole Commission. able friends are angry when we do not we do.",14,Setup

25,Mr Speaker,"Then, the honorableI n Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from 23rd August tffiide page 2343), of motion by Sir That duties of Customs and duties of Excise -he imposed according to the following Tariff {vide page 1648). In giving my views in regard to the Budget, which includes the Estimates and the Tariff, I desire to say that I do not hold -myself in any way responsible for -either; observation to convey that I intend to deal with those two very important -questions in anything but what I consider a fair and reasonable way. I propose, first, to deal with the Estimates, and several important matters of policy which are connected with them, and then to -deal briefly, and not in detail, with the Tariff proposals of the Governrnent. I think that the estimate of revenue made by the Treasurer is based on a sanguine view of what is likely to be received. Of course, it is impossible to say what the effect of the Tariff, when it is enacted, will ibe; .but, at the same time, I think that a very sanguine view has been taken of the revenue when an increase of £ 9 > 9 3 4 that of the previous year js estimated. The proposed expenditure is, no doubt, -somewhat large, being £ 9 8 0 , 6 9 1 more than that which was expended last year; but it is only fair to say that two items to which I shall refer in a minute account for a good deal of that increase. It will be noticed, too, that the total amount returned to the States last year in -excess of the constitutional requirement of three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, was £ 8 0 5 , 7 6 6 , whereas for the present year the Treasurer estimates that the amount so returnable will be only £103,992. -growth of the departmental expenditure of the Commonwealth. "" the Parliament,"" the increases proposed amount to £ 2 , 7 3 8 , in the Department of External Affairs they aggregate £ 1 4 , 3 4 0 ; in the Department of.the Attorney-General, £ > 5 5 5 j in r t n e Home Affairs Department, , £ 2 3 , 4 0 6; in the Treasury, I am glad to -say, only £ 9 1 ; in the Department of Trade and Customs, £ 2 5 , 9 4 9 ; in the Defence Department, £ 8 9 , 5 1 4 ; and in the Department of the Postmaster-General, the large sum of £ 1 8 1 , 8 9 1 , making the total departmental increases, £ 3 3 9 , 4 8 4 . been transferred. ing for that, the departmental expenditure of the Commonwealth is growing very rapidly. I do not make that statement in any hostile spirit to the Government. I am merely pointing out what I have felt for a long time, namely, that the departmental expenditure of the Commonwealth is increasing too rapidly. Under"" Works and Buildings,"" an increase is proposed this year of £ 3 4 7 , 0 9 3 , which includes but I do not wish that £ 2 1 6 , 0 5 0 as a special defence appropriation. Then there are special appropriations for the current year, which show large increases. For instance, there is an increase in the sugar bounty of £ 2 4 0 , 7 9 0 , and a new item of "" Bounties,"" upon which it is proposed to expend £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 . Then there is an appropriation for the trans-continental railwaya new itemof £15,000, and for miscellaneous items, of £ 9 , 3 2 4 , making an increase on the special appropriations this year, as compared with last, of £ 2 9 4 , 1 1 4 . This amount makes the total estimated increase of expenditure over that of last year £980,691. Of course, it is only fair to acknowledge that there are two items IZ o v e r in this large amount which represent a very heavy expenditureI refer to the increase in the sugar bounty of £ 2 4 0 , 7 9 0 -a n increase from £ 3 2 8 , 2 1 0 , last year to £ 5 7 3 , 0 0 0 this year-and also the new special defence provision, of £ 2 1 6 , 0 5 0 . So that the proposed expenditure, after all, represents only £ 4 7 , 0 7 0 more than we expended last year, viz., £ 4 7 2 , 7 8 1, if those two items are eliminated. It would b« very interesting if honourable members were told how it is proposed to expend the special defence vote of £ 2 1 6 , 0 5 0 . U p to the present time, nobody seems to know how that money is to be expended. WhereI now wish to refer to the is this sum of ,£216,050 to be expended, and how ? We have not been told whether In connextion with it is to be spent in the building of submersibles, or of torpedo boats, or in the construction of an ironclad. Similarly, we have not been informed where the smallarms factory and the cordite factory are to be situated. It seems to me that the Government ought to make up their minds very soon on these matters, so that honourable members may have tlie information before them. A t present, their location seems to be in nubibus.. Although we are",15,Postmistress Daysdale

28,Sir John Forrest,"Even allowasked to provide £ 2 1 6 , 0 5 0 this year, with an ultimate expenditure of considerably more, we have not been told how the money is to be expended, or where the factories are to be situated: I do not think that is a satisfactory position, and I hope we shall soon be favoured by the Minister of Defence with f u l l information in that connection. I should word or two in reference to the Commonwealth Public Service, which, as we all know, is carried on under the Public Service Act, which was passed in 1902. the Act as a fairly good one, and I make that statement after having had some experience of the way in which it has worked. The Commissioner who was appointed has proved himself an able and good administrator. facts I cannot say that the Act is working completely satisfactorily. I think that the principle of relieving Ministers from responsibility in regard to the growth and the emoluments of the Public Service -becaus e that is what the present system practically amounts to-is a bad one. Ministers have little, if any, responsibility in regard to the appointment of new employees, or the salaries paid to the public servants, because the responsibility for both is vested in the Commissioner. The result of this practice has, I think, been a large increase in the number of employees. Dozens and dozens and dozens of officers have been appointed without any Minister incurring any responsibility, although, of course, the to approve of what the Commissioner does, but practical lv these officers have been appointed without any practical scrutiny or supervision being exercised on behalf of the Ministry. vice Commissioner satisfy himself that the these incrementsa thing which he has noservices of additional _ officers are required legal right to do. In granting these inbefore he appoints them? -nevertheless demands are made from lutely illegal way. The Public Servicevarious Departments for more officers, and Act declares that no provision in it shalfc it is not easy for the Commissioner to be regarded as an appropriation, and that resist them. If a Minister says that he nothing shall justify the payment of an inmust have additional men, it is not easy for crease upon any salary above that which is the Commissioner to stand up against voted by Parliament for the purpose. him, especially in view of the fact that he holds merely a seven years' tenure of ofcreases are not considered to have beeiv fice. I think that the Public Service Comsanctioned under the Supply Bills which* missioner should have a permanent tenure. both Houses of Parliament? should have a tenure of office similar to* that of a Judge. His appointment for seven years is not an independent tenure, but I do not make that statement as reflecting in any way upon the existing, holder of the office. like to say a political influence and replaced it by social influence. Sir JOHN FORREST I do not know that. But I make this definite statement, after having had some experience of the I may say at once, that I regard working of the Public Service Act, that under it Ministers have been almost entirely relieved of responsibility in regard? to new appointments, and to the emoluments to be paid to the Public Service. I do not think that that But despite these is a good thing for the country, and! certainly it is not good for its finances. There are other provisions in the .Public Service Act which I do not think are good. ber would not resort to political patronage again ? present time. I wish honourable members to understand that I am merely criticising. I am not constructing, but merely giving the Committee the benefit of my experience. I am not doing that from any spiriir of hostility to the Government, but merelv as a public duty. The Public Service Act provides for automatic increases to officersup to £ 1 6 0 a year. These increases are Governor General has given as a matter of course, I think, togood, bad and indifferent officers. Mr W. H .

Another point to has been scarcely any demur to the which I have to refer is that under our expenditure of so large a sum in Public Service system there is no such sugar bounties. But the fact remains that thing, as far as I have seen, as retrenchthere is an import duty of £ 6 per ton on ment.

Yet the value of our whole production of sugar is not more than £ 2 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 . So that in order that that sugar may be produced in Australia the consumers of Australia have to pay £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum more than they otherwise would be required to pay. .

Tf an Excise duty is imposed at all, it should be'for purely revenue purposes, though I do not say that I should be in favour of that. come, in my opinion, when we should sweep away both the Excise and the bounty on sugar, and secure whatever protection I is necessary for the production of sugar by means of a sufficient import' duty. At present the only revenue that comes front this source into the national exchequerI shall not stop to inquire whether it goes intothe Commonwealth or State Treasuries-is the difference between the Excise and the bounty. The Excise this year is estimated at £ 7 4 6 , 0 0 0 , and the bounty at £ 5 7 3 , 0 0 0 , so that the only real gain to the revenues of the States or the Commonwealth from the sugar industry is a sum of £ 1 7 3 , 0 0 0 . Mr W. H . IRVINE It is a little more than that. There is a sum of £ 6 8 , 0 0 0 paid in duty on imported sugar.

Sir JOHN FORREST I have said that the total sum that goes to the national exchequer on account of the growth of sugar in Australia is only £ 1 7 3 , 0 0 0 . The Kanakas having gone, and the retention of the bounty and Excise being no longer necessary in connection -with the White Australia policy, there is a great and useless expenditure going on.

Sir JOHN FORREST figures with me. gentleman will find that the amount is very small. member can easily obtain the figures, but I know from personal observation that there are Commonwealth officers at all the mills supervising the details I have mentioned, and that the Customs officers in all the States have a great deal to do in connection -with sugar supervision. Eveni f the expenditure is not very great, it is not necessary. gentleman is an ex-Treasurer. Otherwise, I should not have asked him for the information. within the management of the Customs Department.

It is unnecessary expenditure, and should be swept away. to have their industries supervised when there is no occasion for it. wheat, or maize grower wants a lot of Government officers about him supervising his industry, unless there is occasion for it . The man who grows sugar-cane should be placed in the same independent position. I see no reason whatever now for the present system. There was a reason for its existence before, because we were carrying out a great national policy. So far as I can see, that policy has now been consummated. It is a thing of the past, and there is no reason to continue the existing system. I dare say the Customs Department would say that they would be very glad to be rid of it, because it gives them a great deal of annoyance and trouble. sav ? ' Sir JOHN.

I never could understand its necessity in carrying out a great policy. honourable gentleman desire to have the Sugar Bounty Act repealed ? Sir JOH N FORREST -Certainly , and also the Excise Act.

It came almost as a shock to me that my honourable friend should have spoken in such an airy and indefinite way about a matter which had caused the Government so much anxiety and trouble, and which had engaged the close attention of the Prime Minister himself for a long time. I was surprised that he should tell us that he did not know anything about it, and have added that he did not think it had ever been considered in Clabinet, and that if it had been he was not present when it was discussed. Cabinet or not is beside the question. The whole question is whether the Government are responsible for it or not. As a matter of fact, it was discussed on two, if not"" more, occasions, as my late colleagues can tell honoifable members, and the Prime Minister and myself had numerous conferences, both in writing and verbally, about it. As honourable members know, there have been five Conferences with the Premiers and Treasurers of the States with the object of arranging some plan which would be mutually satisfactory to the States »nd the Commonwealth. At the ConferInce held in Melbourne, on ioth October last year, the Prime Minister, addressing the assembled States representatives, saidMy colleague, the Commonwealth Treasurer, has prepared what we believe to be the best and fairest scheme to adopt all round. That statement is on record in the ofncia\ report of the Conference. Previously, in delivering the Budget speech on the 31st July, 1906, in this House, I saidI come now to a very important matter, and that is to my recommendations with regard to the financial problems of the Commonwealth under the Constitution. I have been able to submit these recommendations with the full concurrence of my colleagues we are not prepared to put one matter bein the Government. ment is to act as far as possible in accord with the wishes of the States. When I became Treasurer, I felt that it was my duty not to follow, but he has not said so yet. I say, deliberbut to endeavour to lead, in this crucial matter. ately, that the present Treasurer has no I felt that it was the duty of the Commonwealth Government, and, if with all. diffidence I may say so, the duty of Parliament as well, to lead the wav rather than to leave it to others is going to do. to discover a ""suitable road. Acting upon this principle, the Government have taken the responsibility, of propounding a scheme with that object in view. that we have arrived at finality, the scheme' I have propounded, has been approved by the Government, the best for the purpose that could possiblv he devised. But I do say that I am convinced that the plan I have proposed is a good one, that it will meet the circumstances, and give Sir John Forrest. satisfaction, not only to the Commonwealth, but , 7 also to the States. Further on I saidThe proposals submitted have, as I have already said, received the approval of the Government, as a scheme most likely to meet with thesupport of those best acquainted with our constitutional and financial circumstances, and honourable members will find in the Budget papersthe f u l l proposals, with complete returns and; tables which will be found useful in thoroughly investigating the position. That was the position of affairs when, the Brisbane Conference was helda ConWhether it was discussed in ference which was desired by the Prime Minister and by myself, and, after great difficulty and trouble, was held. On the 28th. May, 1907, in my address to the Conference as Acting Prime Minister on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, I saidI t is gratifying to know. that the proposalsput forward by the Commonwealth Government* met with such a large amount of support from the Melbourne Conference. Three days afterwards, when the work wasover, I said at the ConferenceI desire to express my satisfaction at the decision you have arrived at with regard to theannual return of the Customs and Excise revenue to the States. It has now been arranged in at way that meets with the approval of the Commonwealth Government. For everything I did at the Brisbane Conference, I had the authority of the Prime Minister, not only verbally, but in writing. I was aware, of course, that Parliament had to approve; and as the arrangement proposed for taking over the States debts was deferred-it might be possible for the Prime Minister to say, "" It is true we did put forward those proposals in reference to a return of the surplus to the end I am glad to say that of 1920, but we associated with that the taking over of the whole of the debts, and The desire of the Governfore Parliament without the other."" It is open for tlie Prime Minister to say that; right,. or power, without the authority of the Prime Minister, to do what he said he I do not for a moment say was going to do? or that is Prime Minister said that he was not going, to accept the proposals. we cannot do impossibilities.",20,William Lyne

It occurred to me that it would have been a very nice intimation for the honourable gentleman to take back, with him from the London Conference to his friends in Sydney that the naval base at Port Jackson was to be discontinued, that it would no longer be the head-quarters of the Squadron, but that now and again a big battle-ship would visit the port in order that Sydney people might see what such a vessel was like. in which to make Federation popular. would .be a nice way in which to make the Acting Prime Minister popular.

IORREST -The idea has emanated from this side, and from the Prime Minister; no one else has any authority. ther this is a time when we should seek to undo the agreement? Why was this retrograde movement started ? this House wants to cancel the agreement? Did any one express that view at the general election? Do we want to spend £200,000 a' year under the supervision of This our local Naval Department in building torpedo boats, submersibles, or something else in Hobson's Bay? If we do not want the money for that ""purpose, why should we not leave the agreement alone? If we want any submersibles or torpedo boats for Hobson's Bay, Sydney Harbor, Fremantle, or elsewhere, let us get them, but do not let us touch the Agreement, which has still years to run, and which gives us a small share in the British Navy. Certainly a one hundred and fiftieth part is a small share, but to that extent we are co-partners with the Admiralty in the British Navy, and of that I think we might well be proud. provided in the Agreement that the ships mentioned in the Agreement are the minimum number of the Australian Squadron, but that there may be as many more ships kept on the station as may be found necessary. they are wanted in other places. jection to that.

But her population is small, and her output is not equal to the public demand. immense quantity of imports, which formerly produced revenue to the Treasury of Western Australia, now enters that State free, and I have no doubt some of what was formerly paid in duty finds its way into the pockets of the people of the eastern States, by the increased prices ob tained. admitted free recentlv. about £ 2 3 4 , 0 0 0 a year by the abolition of which was expressed by Mr Fielding, the the Customs duties. fbi-years' period? amount that the peonle of Western AusI t is good tralia sacrificed in this way in one year was about £ 2 3 4 , 0 0 0 . amount ? lost it , and I have no doubt the people here gained some of it. member argues in that way when it suits him to do so. ber knows that my statement is true.

Minister takes the benighted view that the consumer does not pay. to enter into a controversy about the effects of free-trade and protection. I will take item No. 104-starc h flour-o n which there is a preference of one halfpenny per lb. The amount of preference is £ 6 4 , and the whole value of the import from the United Kingdom is only £392. Still this is put in as a sort of advertisement. I come now to pickles. The value of the imports of that article from the United Kingdom last year was £88,392, and the value of the imports from other countries was only ,£10,408. The amount of the preference offered to Great Britain is stated to be ,£4,268. Will not the Government's proposal tend to increase the price of pickles to the consumer, seeing that the United Kingdom has £88,000 out of £99,000 worth of the trade now? the only effect of putting an extra duty on will be that the British manufacturer will say, "" I can get a little more for my pickles in Australia than I used to. There is one halfpenny per lb. against other countries. I want one farthing of it, so I shall increase my price by one farthing at any rate."" I do not think that would be a desirable result to Australia. I . come now to. item No. 133-Socks and Stockings, Woollens, &c. The value of the imports from the United Kingdom last year was £305,132, and the total value of the imports from other countries was only £6,280. I should like to know how preference in this case will help the United Kingdom, unless-we wish her to raise her prices? T think the Treasurer does wish her to do so, when he proposes to give her a preference. That must be his object. The honourable gentleman shows-erroneously , in my opiniona. preference to the United' Kingdom of 5 per cent, on the .£305,132 worth of imports for which she already has the market. He states the value of that preference as £15,257, although the United Kingdom supplies those articles now to the value of £305,132, and only needs to sell to us £6,280 worth more to get the whole lot. Still, the honourable gentleman charges the percentage that he proposes to give on the total amount, showing that he intends that the mother country should increase her prices The to us by 5 per cent. pay that. facturer in England will get more. That is not a result that we wish to bring about. We want these articles to come to us as cheaply as possible.

I do not say that it is intentionally misleading, but it is as.misleading and erroneous as possible to say that the preference is to be upon the trade that the United Kingdom already has, and intends to keep. It is totally incorrect to say that she is to get an Consequently advantage of £15,257 when she has only to secure £6,280 worth of trade which she has not got already. If the United Kingdom obtained that trade, the preference would amount to £314, instead of £15,257 as stated. Take again the case of gloves, Item No. 121. The imports from the United Kingdom amounted to £80,981, and from other countries, £151,698. The preference is to be 10 per cent. Surely, in view of these circumstances, it is reasonable to suppose that the price of gloves will be raised to us by 5 per cent, at any rate? The whole 10 per cent, will not be used to give us cheap gloves. Part of it will no doubt be used to secure a portion of the trade now enjoyed by other countries, while part of it will be used to increase the price to us of the £80,981 worth of gloves that we now import from the United Kingdom.

This case is different from the others that I have quoted, because Great Britain does not supply the major portion of the imports.

I do not think that it is an industry that is likely to flourish here. If we do not make gloves, what is the object of the Government's proposal ? The only object must be to increase the price. I will take the item of corrugated galvanized iron, galvanized not corrugated iron, and vice versa. The value of the imports last year from the United Kingdom was £1,032,118, ancl from other countries £37,056. The United Kingdom, therefore, has the trade already, but the preference is shown on the £1,032,118 as amounting to £51,606, whereas it should be shown 011 the £37,056, which would mean a preference of only £1,852. Kingdom to raise her prices it is difficult to were decided upon at the last moment? understand the object of theserecommendations. They are most misleading as to the extent of preference offered in the cases I have quoted. In the item "" Pianos,"" nearlv the whole trade seems to be with countries other than the United Kingdom. The importations amount to £^216,771 from other countries, and to £24,586 from the United Kingdom, that is, one-ninth of the imports are from the United Kingdom. I know there was a piano factory in Sydney in the free-trade days, and I have heard no complaint that the old Tariff was not effective. facturers still import parts. they do. which Mr Beale asked for a duty of 33 per cent., and the Acting Prime Minister proposes a duty of 40 per cent. tion was sufficient j and, I suppose, this10 per cent, of preference will add to the price of pianosa result which will be approved by the two or three manufacturers in the Commonwealth, though the purchasers of pianos are not likely toview it in the same light. Then cotton, and linen piece-goods, item 124 E, are very important. These goods are not manufactured in the Commonwealth, and the importations during last year from the United Kingdom amounted to .£3,017,517, while those from other countries amounted to .£ 9 ,IOI. 2 2 It will be seen that the United Kingdom already has the trade, with the exception of £292,101 ; and unless, as I said before, the preference isintended so that British manufacturers may raise the price to Australian consumers, I should like to know what the gain is ip the United Kingdom. The proposed preference is 5 per cent., and amounts to only ,£14,600, although the Acting Prime Minister, in the return he has submitted, declares ^hat it amountst 0 jQ^S ^! The Acting Prime Minister0 6 That is Item 143. has bolstered up this preference in an erroneous and inaccurate way, as I think I have clearly shown. I will not pursue the subject, as the instances I have referred to show that the preference proposals arehaphazard and have not been thought out, and that they will increase prices unnecessarily, if they are to be at all effective. Unless we expectthe United member not think that these preferences have shown also, I think, that the preference proposals have been put forward in a very inaccurate and misleading way, though I do not wish to say that that has been done intentionally. There is one more item to which I should like to refer. This is an item included in item 304, "" wicker and bamboo manufactures,"" which were free under the old Tariff. The imports from the United Kingdom amounted last year to ,£15, and from other countries to £1,301, and the preference to the United Kingdom is £ 1 . Such is this boasted preference, which, as I have already said, is ill-considered, and should be regarded merely as an advertisement unworthy of serious consideration.

But it is not easy to give preference when we desire to manufacture the very goods for ourselves without increasing prices. Preference to the mother country is a beautiful idea, which commends itself to my mind. My desire is that, as British people, we should be united and help one another. proposals at first appeal to one's sympathy and patriotism; but when we come to apply them we find the work not so easy. I long ago said to those at the head of this movement, both here and in the old country, that I am in full sympathy with the idea of binding the 'British people together in trade and commerce to a greater extent than at present, but I urged that there should be some definite policy-that the mother country should tell us what she is prepared to give us, and that we ought to be able to say what we are prepared to give to the mother country, and thus arrive at some arrangement mutually satisfactory. If such information is not forthcoming, the whole proposal is in the clouds. we are trying to get command of the trade by high protective duties our manufacturers will not consent to be interfered with by the United Kingdom or any other country. If you tell any manufacturer in the city of Melbourne that 5 per cent, of preference is to come off his profits, he will object to the arrangement, and he will say that he cannot afford to give away anything, in view of the fact that he has to face factory laws, Wages Boards and high wages, and has to sell his goods as cheaply as he can in order Budget. 2365 to get the market. Such a manufacturer will urge that, however much he would like to give a preference to the mother country, he cannot afford to do so; and the same Neither can afford, unless he gets a quid pro quo, to give away what he desires to keep for himself. Besides, no one wants us to give away anything that is valuable to British Government nor the British people would wish us in Australia to injure ourselves in order to confer upon them some benefit-the y have too much sense to expect it, and too much regard for us to desire it. They know we have a great Imperial work to do on this continent-that the giving of a few thousands, or tens of thousands of pounds in preference to them is as nothing compared to the value of the work which faces us in building up in Australia another home for the British race. Are we not doing greater work in developing this continent, with the object I have indicated, than we should be by extending a little bit of preference here and there, sometimes amounting to a sum as small as jQi? We have done and are doing a great work in endeavouring to fill this continent All such with people of our own race. Australia is occupied by only a fringe of people, while the great northern part is almost unoccupied, and some of it completely unknown. .There is, as I have said, much to be done by the 4,000,000 of people already here, and those who, in the future, will come from the other side of the world to help us. Who has asked, or who desires, us to give away something which we want for ourselves, and which is so necessary for us in order to carr)' out this great work ? No one. We are quite willing to make an agreement which will be mutually beneficial, but we cannot afford in these early days to give anything away. We have no right to give anything away, when we want ten times While more than we already have in order to carry out our duty of building up this country and filling it with people of our own race. We are doing better service for the Empire in subduinsr the wilderness and making the country habitable, than in extending a paltry make-believe preference, which is a mere appeal to the gallery, and is in no way genuine or real.

I quite agree with the leader of the Opposition, when he pointed to the small increase in agriculture throughout Australia during the last few vears notwithstanding the extraordinarily good seasons we have had on the whole. But while he alluded to what should be a very salient feature of our industrial condition, and regretted the fact that more attention had not been devoted to agriculture, he did not indicate how in his opinion the existing state of things could be remedied, or how far am thing should be done to encourage agricultural production.

Only the other day the gentleman at the head of the Immigration League of Australia, Dr. Arthur, addressed to Mr Marshall Lyle, who is connected with the Melbourne branch of that organization, a communication in which he advised that gentleman to conceal the fact that in Australia land is scarce-in other words, to endeavour to attract people to Australia under false pretences. In my opinion, that is not a proper thing to do. I agree with him that in a counNothing but the naked truth should be put before the people of Great Britain when we ask them to come here and share our lot with us.

220,Mr Watson,"Exactly. . The mereber of settlers. In New South Wales, notwithstanding that the Government had been engaged for some time in buying back estates, cutting them up, and apparently putting settlers on them, the number of large estates-that is, estates of over 20,000 acres-ha d increased in 1904 and 1905. I have not the figures for 1906. that in New South Wales the Government have put 11,000 families on the land since that period? sav that they have. New South Wales can say what they like. What they have done has been to cut up and sell a number of estates, but in a great many instances the allotments were merely transferred to men who already owned land, in some cases a large area. The sale of an allotment did not represent in every .case new settlement. In a great number of instances the buyers of the allotments were not new settlers who had gone on the land for the first time, but men who had either increased their holdings in the neighbourhood, or temporarily left holdings in other parts of the State. know anything about country conditions, it is idle for any one to talk about the Government of New South Wales having put 11,000 settlers on the land. the other day that during the last two vears the Government had put 6,000 families on the land. 'Carruthers, that statement is not correct. When Mr Crick was Minister of Lands in the State, he used to point to the thousandsof selections which had been taken up, and to assume that every one of them meant a new settler. Nothing was further from the truth. Those who knew anything about the land laws of the Stateand as the representative of a country constituency, I used to know a good deal about them-kne w that it did not mean new settlement. has gained thousands of people from toria. We are very glad to have them, but nevertheless a disgrace to Victoria she oermitted them to leave.' area and the cheaper land available in New South Wales which have attracted them. toria has room for many hundreds of thousands more than are here to-day. Within the last dozen years this State has lost over a hundred, thousand of her young people to the other States, and that fact I s it riot a fact is certainly not a certificate of merit to those who are charged with the administration of her affairs. In anv case, those whom New South Wales has gained from I think not. Victoria and South Australia are not new The Government settlers. Of course, we are glad to have them. Thev are good citizens, and, for the most part, good farmers, and I admit that they have done a lot to help to develop New South Wales. But that consideration does not appear to me to touch the real point at issue. The point is .that we desire to see a large increase in population in Australia, and that that increase cannot besecured unless we make land available for settlement. I ask whether the "" piffling "" attempts in which the States Governments have been engaged for some four or five years amount to anything in the shape of effective action?

Why should these men-som e of whom are in receipt of a very small salary indeed-be kept out of j £ i o or £ 1 5 or £ 2 0 for an indefinite period ? I know of one instance in which an officer was due to receive an increase of , £ 5 . Yet for eighteen months after that increment was legally due to him, and for nine months, to my own knowledge, during which it might have been paid, the ex-Treasurer refused to pay it. cases in which officers have not received anv increase since this Parliament first met. which I refer the increase had been, approved by the responsible authorities. scheme ? stances, I think that the Treasurer has done the right thing. I am sure that Parliament will raise no objection to the payment of these increments, which have to be met anyhow. Regarding the statement with which we are constantly met as to the growth of Federal expenditure, I think it is wise to allude to one or two points concerning that gradual and persistent growth which do not seem to be sufficiently appreciated by the public, however they may be regarded by honourable members. To-day the ex-TreasurerI admit in no carping spiritpointed to the immense growth of expenditure in the Post Office. He did not, so far as my hearing served me, put the position from the other side. rally understood that in administering the affairs, nf semi-commercial departments we cannot expect to earn additional revenue without engaging in additional expenditure. The Post Office, after all, is not a governmental institution in the narrow sense, but a semi-commercial institution, and if we are to earn the large increases in revenue which have characterized it for some time, we must expect to pay more by way of outgoings. The same remark is true of railways and of the largenumber of semicommercial governmental undertakings so common in Australia-undertakings ' to which our friends in the corner would no doubt object upon the ground that they are socialistic. Nevertheless, they must be conducted upon business lines. Now, in the Post Office, during the six years which have elapsed since Federation was accomplished, the expenditure has increased by nearly ^500,000. But during the same period the receipts have increased by more than £800,000. That shows that we have a better net result of £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 -per-annum from the Post Office than was obtained six years ago. That fact demonstrates good management, even though .it does mean an increase in our expenditure-a n increase which is more apparent than real-of some ,£500,000 per annum. Yet. it is one of those growths of Federal expenditure to which allusion is so frequently made. balancing and of the side upon which we come out. opinion that, in the great departments of State which are of a commercial or semicommercial character, only the balances should be taken into the national account. For instance, the Railways Commissioners ought to be an independent corporation, except so far as they are subject to the control of Parliament regarding the lines of policy which they shall pursue, and their accounts of receipts and expenditure should not be lumped with the general receipts and expenditure of the community. If the balances only-whethe r debit or creditwere taken into consideration, the public would more readily appreciate the fact that our expenditure has not increased by nearly so large an amount as has been represented. purpose if a schedule were prepared setting out that expenditure. among critics of public finance is-withou t It should be genemaking any allowance whatever-to take the total sum received and the total amount expended by the Government, and allude to it as governmental expenditure. than anything else. that that is not a fair way 01 dealing with our public finances, but they adopt it nevertheless.

Nearly£ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 is apparently added to our Federal expenditure because of fhe sugar bounties. But that is not true expenditure, because, although not nominally so, it is in essence merely a rebate of a portion of the Excise charged against the sugar-growers. It was at first termed a rebate, but because that was held to be possibly unconstitutional another name was applied to the same payments. It is now called a bounty, but the effect is the same. It is really and in essence a rebate of money that is collected by way of Excise. money which we collect. truly a Federal expenditure."" consumer is just the same. have to pay anything on account of the Excise or the bounty.

But whether you have an Excise or a bounty, or neither the one nor the other, makes not the slightest difference to the price charged to the consumer. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is not quite correct. The import duty, no doubt, governs the price of the article until the local production overtakes the consumption; and until the present year we have not anticipated being able to overtake the local consumption of sugar in Australia by the local production. exactly the same whether there is an Excise and a bounty or not, so long as there is an import duty.

We are now paying for public per ton paid by those who employ coloured works out of revenue for which the States labour. One point in this connection to which I direct attention is that of the sum This year the of £ 7 4 6 , 0 0 0 which is receivable next yeas by way of Excise, only one-fourth will be available for. the Federal Treasurer. The other three-fourths will be paid over, under the terms of the Constitution, to'the various States Treasurers. That means that £ 1 8 6 , 0 0 0 will go to tlie Federal Treasurer, and that, on account of the interwoven operation of the Braddon section, the Commonwealth Treasury will be out by the bounty payments to the extent of £ 3 8 6 , 0 0 0 during the coming year. That is to say, we are nearer to the absorption of our one-fourth Customs and Excise revenue by £ 3 8 6 , 0 0 0 because of' the payment of the bounty. We are so much to the bad on that account. I pointed out when the last Bounty Bill went through what the effect would be in this' connection. I pointed out that through the operation of the Braddon section we, as a Federal Government, should be paying out eventually, when all the sugar was grown by white labour, £ 4 by way of bounty, and only receiving back , £ i into the . Federal Treasury; of course, the States Governments would receive the other £ 3 . That raises a condition of things which cannot possibly continue. When the right honB u t the effect on the orable member for Swan was referring a few minutes ago to this particular subject, the reflection was inevitably forced upon one-wh y did he not make those observations when the last Bounty Bill was going through last year. honourable member says that this is all use-less expenditure. He did not point out how matters were likely to stand when the It is absolutely correct.

In regard to the erection of post-offices and many other public buildings, under the Federation we are incurring expenditure that would not .have figured against the expenditure of the States from revenue before Federation. member's party was answerable for that. it. that did it. our party alone was responsible, but I think that I sounded the first note of opposition to loan expenditure, and I was very glad to see a majority of the House, -comprising members of all parties, taking up the attitude that only in the last resort would we go to the money market for assistance. timated that it is going in for loan expenditure shortly. bas done nothing of the sort. cerned, any proposal for loan expenditure, unless the occasion be urgent, and unless the purpose be very important indeed, will meet with strenuous opposition. Every effort that I can put forth to prevent Australia engaging upon a borrowing policy will be put forth on this and every other occasion when I have the opportunity in Parliament. -works like our defences, which are in the nature of an insurance against possible disaster, and for similar matters, are not fit subjects for the expenditure of loan money. of war might be unavoidable. ties of the country in case of war would create a different situation. But it will take a lot of expenditure on public works our of revenue on the part of the Federal Government to make up an equivalent for the unjustifiable loan expenditure on public works by the States Governments in the past. We can go a long wav in this direction before we bring about an equalitv as between the present and the next generation. sider what the States have done in the past. put our own house in order. We have to recognise circumstances, not as they ought to exist, but as they do exist; and if the States Governments have overrun the constable and spent loan money in unjustifiable directions where money ought to have been provided son why we should go slowly until we bring about something approaching a balance. I think that we did the right thing. I am prepared to say, in reply to the suggestion of the honourable member for Grey, that much greater extravagance would probably have characterized the Australian Parliament if we had embarked in tlie first instance upon a loan policy. There is always a much greater disposition to be careless about expenditure when we have not to bother ourselves about taxation in the meantime. We know that the landlord presents his' bill in the morning, and that the piper has to be paid some time, but generally with loan expenditure extravagance is winked at until the bill is due. We are much more likely, therefore, to secure the economical management of the nation's affairs while we keep away from borrowing of any description. We are faced with a number of Federal obligations, to which I alluded some weeks ago, as well as about eighteen months since. They are large obligations that will face the Commonwealth in the near future, and that in the interests of Australia from a national stand-point ought to be undertaken-that is, if this great country is to be developed in the near future. They are national proI say, emphatically, that jects that only a central Government can cope with.

The ex-Treasurer a few minutes ago pointed out something of this Whether it is called in booksort, yet he is the same gentleman who a very short while ago proposed to extend the operation of the Braddon section for another ten years from the end of 1910, and in a shape that made it worse from the stand-point of Federal finance than is the case at present. The right honourable gentleman admitted that all these obligations ought to be undertaken. He said that the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway should be carried out, although it means a big loss for some time after its completion.

He suggests that New South Wales and Victoria should initiate the scheme by federalizing their portions of the old-age pensions system, trusting to the good will of the other States to fall into line. The right honourable gentleman does not seem to appreciate the fact that while it will be an easy thing for New South Wales and Victoria to hand over their old-age pensions systems to the Commonwealth, and to authorize the Federal Treasurer to deduct from their three-fourths the necessary amount, his proposition would not help the Treasurers of the smaller States in the slightest degree. member think that there is even a possibility of the States 'of Victoria and New South Wales doing it? of the gentleman at the head of affairs in New South Wales,-1 do not know whether he would agree to any proposal, no matter how reasonable, that emanated from the Commonwealth Parliament. the people of New South Wales are supporting the Premier. at the forthcoming election;but, judging from some indications, it seems very unlikely that the people are supporting him. The point is that in the smaller States there must be new taxation before old-age pensions can be provided. Federal or the States authorities, new taxation must be imposed before old-age pensions can bepaid under the bookkeeping system, whereby each State has to bear its own share of the burden. When the States Treasurers, as suggested by the right honourable member for East Sydney, are requested to allow the amount necessary to pay old-age pensions in their States to be deducted from the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, they very naturally say, as was said at the Conference in Sydney, that the duty of finding money for old-age pensions is one for the Federal Parliament-and quite a proper attitude. Wales of that burden, we shall relieve it of £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 of taxation straight away. with another suggestion-that the of New South Wales, there is no trouble whatever. If all the States were paying old-age pensions, as Victoria and New South Wales are doing, there would be no problem ; it is because old-age pensions mean new taxation in four out of the six States that the States Treasurers and Premiers will not agree to have the amount necessary deducted from the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue. The only honest course for those gentlemen on the Opposition side, and on this side also, who say they are against direct taxationfor Federal purposes, and who, at the same time, desire to extend the operation -of the Braddon section, is to say at once that there shall be no old-age pensions, or no other big obligations entered upon> during the next thirteen years. special duties for the purpose. able member think that, in addition to the duties now proposed, a number of which are revenue duties, we should be justified in imposing special duties for the purpose?

But nothing of that kind has been indicated. The Government of Great Britain-actin g quite within their rights, as instructed by the people-sai d that they could take no hand or part in preferential trade, so that there does not seem to me to be the necessity for our making the advances in that direction that there would be if that Government were favorable. Holding that view, I do not feel very much concerned about whether the preferential aspect of the Tariff is retained or not. Where it is not likely materially to affect our own production, I have no objection to our welcoming the. idea of giving an increased incentive to British imports. But I do not feel the enthusiasm in that regard that I would experience if Great Britain were prepared to meet us half way. Leaving that aspect of the case, it seems to me that in .the Tariff the Government have laid too great a stress on the revenue aspect. We are accustomed to the statement that the people of Australia are taxed to an enormous extent. That is only true of indirect taxation. lightlv taxed people in the world. most lightly taxed peoples in the world. While the proportion of indirect taxation is much larger in Australia than in the .old country, the proportion of direct taxation is much larger in the old country than in Australia. In view of the fact that the working classes generally-that is those who are least able to bear the burden of taxation-hav e to pay more than a fair proportion of indirect taxation, I feel that we should "" ease up "" as far as possible on revenue duties, and resort to direct taxation if the needs of the Commonwealth should so require. The working classes will contribute to revenue duties a much larger proportion than will the richer people-that is having regard to the amount of wealth which they possess. ""From each according to-his ability"" is reckoned to be a reasonable and proper principle of taxation. But the Customsduties imposed for revenue purposes leave out of account any consideration of that, sort. The additional revenue of ,£8oo,o6o> which is expected to be raised by means of the new Tariff means, under the Braddonsection of the Constitution, an increase of only £200,000 to the Federal Treasurer.. To raise that extra sum for Federal purposes we have to impose taxation upon the people to the extent of £800,000. That, I think, is not a good way to finance, and so> far as I am concerned,' that portion of the Tariff which is imposed for revenue purposes will meet with opposition. In regard to revenue duties, there is one very interesting feature to which I think the attentionof honourable members might be drawn. Although the Government have adopted same revenue duties, still they have not gone nearly so far as the recommendations of the so-called free-trade members of the Tariff Commission went. There was a time wrier* a proportion of those persons whoespoused free-trade as a political doctrine associated with it the idea of direct taxation. The men who found most of thebrains for the free-trade movement were just as strongly opposed to indirect taxation or revenue duties as any protectionistcould be. able member for Lang and others in this Parliament. So far as proposals for revenue duties are concerned, the free-trade members of the Tariff 'Commission have outHeroded Herod. Leaving out of account those items on which the Government have imposed duties, those free-traders also suggested the imposition of duties on a number of items which the Government have made free, in both the general and the preferential Tariff. In no less than fifty-one instances the Government have made free in the general Tariff articles on which the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission recommended that a duty should be imposed. On fifteen items free under the proposed Tariff, they recommended a duty of 5 per cent.; ontwentv-five items, a duty of 10 per cent.; on seven' items, a duty of 15 per cent.; and on four items, a duty of 20 per cent.

In 114 instances a duty has been recommended by the free-traders on an article which the Government have made free, either generally, or as regards Great Britain only. those items must have some relation to the duties on other items. cluties pure and simple. Take, for instance, the farmers' sacks and bags. From honourable members .on the Opposition side we have heard wails about the condition to which the primary producer will be brought by means of the Tariff. We are told that he is ""cribbed, cabined and confined"" in all directions, and the proposal of die free trade section of the Tariff Commission is that his bran bags and his chaff bags shall be subjected to a duty of 15 per cent'. The Government proposal is that they shall be admitted free. I do not say that the Tariff cannot be altered for the better. On the contrary, I say that it can be so altered. it would be very interesting-if the Customs officials could spare time to undertake the work-to ascertain what amount of revenue would be yielded by the Tariff which has been recommended by the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission. cers are preparing that information at the present moment. interested to learn what amount of revenue would be yielded by the Tariff which they recommend. member think that that line of argument is quite fair to the free-trade members of the Commission? in accusing them of being free-traders. They are revenue tariffists. and from that stand-point are justified in putting forth any set of revenue duties which they favour. But I do say that no less than 114 free items in the Tariff-5 1 of which are free to the manufactures of the world, and [ 8 ] -2 4 63 to those of Great Britain-woul d be subjected to a duty ranging from 5""to 20 per cent, if the recommendations of the free trade section of the Commission were adopted. chance to raise money for old-age pensions. even £ 4 raised by means of Customs duties would be such a very valuable aid to the granting of old-age pensions, seeing that the Commonwealth would be able to use only jQi of it. To raise sufficient money for old-age pensions would necessitate an additional £6,000,000 per annum being taken from the pockets of the people in the form of Customs duties. Of that amount we should be able to use £1,500,000, and we should be compelled to return the balance to the States. which the honourable member speaks recommended by the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission in substitution for other duties ? schedule, and I have picked out of it the various items framed by the Government.

This list picks out nothing but imported lines. That is to say, in the matter of candles, it takes it for granted that the people are going to buy imported goods at an increased price, rather than Australian-made candles. Then also, in regard to condensed milk, maizena -whic h is made all over Australia-and a large number of similar items, the Argus takes item after item, and assumes that people are going to use nothing but imported brands. governed by' the price at which men can import. right honourable member ought to know that if a local industry is sufficiently developed, the price of its commodities may be lower than the price of imported articles upon which duty is paid. will be hardly any imports. is so. Condensed milk is a case in point. The prices of a number of similar articles are, I know, lower for locally-made articles than for imported goods, because the local production is so great that there is competition amongst the manufacturers. The price is consequently kept at a reasonable figure. If manufacturers do increase prices unnecessarily, then, I say we should take steps to reduce the duty. As far as I am concerned, if the local manufacturers are not satisfied with the increased profit that will come from an expansion of their trade, and if they insist upon a higher price for their goods, T shall not be prepared to vote for increased duties for them. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m. departure by the Government from the recommendations of the Tariff Commission I cannot agree. In regard to the iron industry generally the protectionist section of the Commission recommended, primarily, a duty of 10 per cent, on raw iron, and, starting from that point, went on to recommend duties of 20 and 25 per cent I do not think exceeding the latter figure-upon completed machinery, whereas, under the old Tariff, the importation of raw iron was free, and there was a i 2 per cent. duty ? L duty on machinery. The Government propose to adopt the recommendations of the Commission, so far as I can glean, with respect to completed machines, subjecting them to duties of 20 and 25 per cent., but have omitted the duty of 10 per cent, on the raw iron, which comprises pig-iron, angle and sheet irons, and various other descriptions of the raw material. That, I think, upsets the whole base of the Tariff Commission's report. I admit that under section 6A. or 6B. one that puts the duty on raw iron; 6B. raises the duty on metals and machinery. which are to come into operation under certain conditions are proposed to* put duties on raw iron, but increase the Tariff Commis sion's recommendation so far as the manufactured article is concerned. 1 do not think that there is any justification for the departure from the Tariff Commission's suggestion. They very properly seek to insure some measure of assistance to the production of raw iron in the Commonwealth. Personally 1 think that that is, perhaps, the most important industry that we could encourage in Australia. It has been pointed out with truth on many occasions that it is in every way a basic industry. Upon iron manufacture a great number of other industries depend for their successful establishment, and a great deal should be attempted, and, if necessary, some sacrifice made, in order to establish the iron industry upon a profitable and permanent basis. The Government propose, primarily, to give a bonus for the production of iron. This matter has been threshed out on two or three occasions in the House, and in one instance a Royal Commission, of which a number of other honourable members and myself were members, went very fully into the question of giving a bonus for the production of iron. I have not changed the opinion I held then as to preferring some form of duty to a proposition for a bonus. I do not take up any antagonistic attitude to bonuses generally, as was indicated by the course I adopted towards the Bounties Bill that passed this Chamber a little while ago, but 1 consider that, to give any effective assistance by means of a bonus, so far as iron is concerned, would entail a financial obligation for which I do not think Australia is prepared at present.",48,Honourable Members Hear Hear

With regard to the financial aspect of the bounty on iron, we must remember, as has been indicated on quite a .number of occasions recently, that we 'have ahead of us many important financial -obligations, which, as I said earlier, are -pressing from a national stand-point. If we give anything like an adequate bounty for the production of iron, it will involve such .a strain upon our financial resources as will preclude activity in other and perhaps quite as necessary directions.

Bearing in mind how small a duty that really is, and how small a tax it would be upon those who have to use raw iron even if the full amount of duty were exacted by way of additional price, it seems to me that no great sacrifice is needed in order to secure the successful establishment of the industry. The honourable member for Barrier asked me just now who would pay the duty. I admit at once that until the industry got firmly on its feet the price of pig iron would probably be increased by approximately the full amount of the duty, but after all, by how much would that handicap the engineers? When we remember what a small proportion the value of the raw iron bears to the value c i the completed article, it is easily seen that but a small sacrifice would be expected of the engineers.

Mr Franki pointed out to me in his yard an immense steel bloom which he had had in stock for about sixteen years, in view' of the contingency of some big steamer breaking a shaft, and requiring a new one to be forged here. During all that time Mr Franki had been losing interest on the original cost of the bloom, but he had been compelled to keep it in view of an emergency. That was an expense to which he would not have been put had there been local iron works! the honourable member to another part of his works he would have talked free-trade to him on the same day. Franki talked free-trade to me in any part of the conversation. In my view, the assistance to the iron industry should be in the form of a 10 per cent, or a 12\ per cent. duty. Having in view the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, first, that there is no need for the Government to propose a bonus on the production of iron, and, secondly, that if they rely on the duty method, there is no need to increase ithe duties on machinery by the extra 2 per cent, mentioned in division 1 V I . B of the Tariff, I am quite prepared to view of the importance of the iron* industry, an early decision should be sought by the Government on their proposal to extend assistance by way of bounty. The Government should take the first possible opportunity of discovering thewill of the House, because if , as on a previous occasion, there is a majority of honorable members against the proposal for a bounty, it is obviously a proper thing that the House should have an opportunity of considering the general range of dutieson iron and iron products.

In regard to woollen piece goods, the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission was not satisfied with leaving the duties as they were, but actually tions of woollen piece goods, apparel, and proposed a reduction from the old duty of 15 per cent, to 10 per cent. From the protectionist stand-point, I think that that proposal was too low. It was generally understood that the Commission were not going to propose any duties materially below, the old Tariff; and, in my opinion, some increase on the original duty of 15 per cent, was necessary. vernment propose on woollen piece goods? cent.; and there, again, I think the increases are more than are necessary. I am prepared to support duties up to 25 per cent, on this class of goods; but nothing higher would, in my opinion, be justified. any idea of the value of woollen piece goods made in Australia, or the value of the importations? the woollen piece goods imported, but not the value of those made in Australia. It seems to me that there is room for considerable development in our woollen manufactures generally. ing full speed now. why we should be prepared to give some extra encouragement, in order that more factories may be established, and a greater proportion of our wool locally manufactured. The honourable member for Barrier, in his interjection, voices what may be a popular view amongst free-traders, but, after all, it is hardly more than a superstition. imported is because local manufacturers cannot cope with the demand. that we require more factories. The idea with some honourable members seems to be that, so long as one or two factories are going full speed, there is no need to bother about the industry. The broader view, from a protectionist's stand-point, is that, here we have what most nearly approaches a natural industry in Australia; and yet a very small proportion of our wool is locally manufactured. I was very much interested to hear the honourable member for Illawarra, .when speaking the other evening, put forward the same argument as that just now advanced by interjection by the honourable member for Barrier. I took the trouble to ascertain the value of last year's importaattire. I find that it amounted to £3,629,000. portations were of British make. ential proposals apply in that instance ? the case of a natural industry, such as the woollen industry, we should not manufacture practically the whole of the woollen goods we require. The honourable member for Illawarra said that the section of the Tariff Commission to which he belonged estimated that the labour cost in the production of woollens was 20 per cent. If we take that estimate of the labour cost on a production equal in value to over £3,500,000, it will be seen that if the woollen goods imported last year had been locally manufactured, we should have had nearly £750,000 more to give in wages to employees of woollen factories than was spent last year. It must not be forgotten that in addition to that increased expenditure on wages, allowance must be made for substantial advances in subsidiary industries on account of additional coal consumption, machinery, oils, and the many varied requirements for which an additional demand would have been created by greater local production of woollen goods. £45,000,000 worth of goods last year.

Some have been losing money, and I have not been able to discover that the best-managed of them has paid more than about io per cent. When one takes into consideration the risks of loss of trade, poor seasons for particular trade, and the ephemeral character generally of the public favour in respect of a particular article, of importing earthenware is 33^ per cent. it cannot be contended that a profit of io per cent, is an exorbitant one for a trading concern. I understand that in one or two instances woollen factories have paid 10 per cent., which is not after all a glorito value, and there is not in the case of ous return, whilst a number of others have paid 4 per cent., or 2 per cent., and some 1 have paid nothing in the way of dividends. These results do not indicate a very flourishing condition of the industry. But even though the limited number of mills we now have in the Commonwealth is doing well, that would be no reason why we should not insure a greater development of the industry than has occurred up to the present time. I may have misunderstood some honourable member, and I have no wish to bind him down to a particular statement, but I think I heard an interjection early in this debate to the effect that colonial tweeds are "" a jolly bad lot."" I wish to say that, in my experience, colonial tweed goods are as good material as' any one would wish to wear. I do not say that the Australian factories have been justified by the comparatively limited demand up to the present time in making provision for the same wide range of patterns as do the mills in other countries having an enormous output, but with these limitations the Australian tweed goods are splendidly made, look well, and wear well. better than the imported goods. worse, and my own experience is that they are at least as good as the very best imported tweeds. money. that they are very good. I believe there is an immense field for further development in the woollen industry of Australia. I think that the item of earthenware requires reconsideration. It should not be forgotten that there is a big natural protection on earthenware, and there seems to ibe no necessity for imposing a duty on this article of 30 per cent, and 35 per cent. From the protectionist stand-point, there should be no need to go beyond a duty that will fairly encourage local manufacturers to establish the industry. Earthenware has such an immense bulk in proportion to its value that it does not require the same amount of direct protection that is necessary in the case of other goods. with all the details, but it is apparent that earthenware goods must carry a very heavy freight charge in proportion such goods the same necessity for the imposition of a duty of 35 per cent, that might be claimed in respect of other articles. member say the same of glassware: bottles, and so on? very cheaply, especially if they are full. There is another item on which I should like to ask some questions. I refer to strawboard. The Govern-, ment proposal is to increase the duty on strawboard from is. per cwt. to 2s. against the United Kingdom, and 2s. 6d. against the world. There is no strawboard manufactured in the United Kingdom, and we can therefore consider the item merely as a proposal that there should be a duty of 2s. 6d. per cwt, against the",52,Chapman Th E Nearest Accept Their General Conclusion Irs

A statement which was made to me by a person privately has been confirmed by the Associated Card-box Makers of Australia. It is to the effect that since the duty has been imposed the local strawboard factory has increased the price of strawboard by 30s. per ton. The managing director of the factory told the Tariff Commission that if an extra duty were imposed he would not increase the juice of his strawboard. If there is any reason why the local price of an article should not be increased, surely it applies in t he Case of this article. No one can say that the material out of which it is made has been increased in value by the operation of a duty. It is made from local straw and other constituents. So far as I understand, the Tariff has made practically no difference in the local manufacture of strawboard. But notwithstanding that fact, my information is that the managing director of the factory has increased the price of the article from £ 7 10s. to £ g per ton. That is a very serious matter to card-box manufacturers, and demands some consideration at the hands of the Committee. per cwt. on straw. amusing, in view of the fact that practically none is imported.

I merely say that in my view we can insure some regard being paid to fair conditions and policing without any great expense to the State That is all I claim for the proposal. I admit that many defects will still exist Some employers, even in the face of a Wages Board decision, will take advantage of the necessities of their employees to cut them down and infringe the law. We have had some experience of that in New South Wales as well as in Victoria. But such things must .be provided against in another way. We must rely upon effective organization of the employees to give information as to breaches of the law in these respects. In my 2395 opinion, the proposals we put forward are much more practicable than those agreed to by the last Parliament in connection with the harvester duties. Incidentally, I think that those proposals did a great deal of good, and especially in marking the initiation of a new departure in Tariff legislation for Australia. That, to my mind, was the great good accomplished by the harvester provisions. We think that the proposals we now put forward are more. likely to accomplish the tion.

Let us analyze the cause of the addition to "" other "" expenditure. It is chiefly due to policy, over which, of course, we have control, and for which we are responsible directly to the electors. The bounty paid on the production of sugar last year was £ 2 8 5 , 4 2 0 to Queensland, and £ 4 2 , 7 9 0 to New South Wales.

That is the mistake which the Minister of the day made, and which is costing us over ,£40,000 a year in the case of New South Wales. Last year the total amount paid in sugar bounty was £ 3 2 8 , 2 1 0 , and this year it will have risen to £573,000. see the effect on the revenue of the States. In 1906-7 the Excise duties yielded ,£546,653, and ,£143,830, making a total revenue of £""""690,483. Deducting the amount paid in sugar bounty, namely, £ 3 2 8 , 2 1 0 , we get a net revenue of £ 3 6 2 , 2 7 3 to the Commonwealth, against a revenue of .£780,000 in "" dumping "" our sugar in South Africa 1901 from the importation of sugar, which by this time, making allowance for the sugar policy is working out. our greater consuming capacity under the happier conditions of production and disActing Prime Minister allows that to be tributionI will not say increase of popudone. lation, because that is practically non-existent ought to have been closer to when our revenue begins to shrink, and the ,£1,000,000 than to £ 3 6 2 , 0 0 0. Let us see expenditure .fixed in an exceptional year It includes everything. the conditions this year. The Excise duties are estimated to return £746,000,' and the Customs duties £ 6 8 , 0 0 0 , making a total revenue of ,£814,000 for the year. Deducting £ 5 7 3 , 0 0 0 for the payment of the That is £ 2 4 1 , 0 0 0 . I do not wish to be local, but I would point out that that means that in 1907-8 South Australia will have a revenue of £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 from Customs and Excise duties on sugar, will pay sugar bounty to the amount of £ 5 4 , 1 5 6, and will have a net result of £ 1 5 , 8 4 4 , against a normal revenue of about £ 5 4 , 0 00 from sugar duties prior to Federation. What are we getting for all that? I find that the total number of labourers earning the bounty is put down at 28,203, but from that number we must deduct 5,610 in New South Wales, who are getting, but not earning, the bounty. That leaves 22,593 as earning the bounty in Queensland, but a great many of those white labourers were employed in the work prior to its enactment. I believe T h a t is no fault of that if the matter were worked out by some of the statisticians who bother us with It is the fault of the last figures which are not very relevant to our I attempted to get in an present legislative duties, it would be found that it would pay the Commonwealth much better to directly subsidize the substitution of white for black labour than to keep up that tremendous waste of revenue in connection with our sugar policy. W o u l d that have member give any protection to the sugar growers ? point that we are giving a ridiculously high protection. to them. For my part, I would impose nothing more than a comparatively small import duty, but I would not give the whole benefit of that import duty to the sugar grower or refiner.

All that I can say is, that those engaged in the mining industry who are now taxed, not only as general consumers, but in respect of their machinery, in respect of their timber, in respect of their lights, in respect of their crucibles, and in so many other respects; the farmers, whose implements of trade and agriculture are taxed; and the poor labourer, who 'finds that the purchasing power of his meagre wages is curtailed to the extent of about one-eighth or one-ninth-ar e really experiencing the beneficent effects of this new protection of industries which two and a half years ago, when the Tariff Commission was appointed, were declared one and all to be in extremis, but which now, after having had a foretaste of death, are displaying, according to the figures, remarkable recrudescence and vitality. Under this national policy, how are the consumers and the primary producers being affected? Last year, in 1906, the primary producers of this country exported, hi round figures, £65,000,000 worth of products. The manufacturers worth. portation in the proportion of about 65 to 2, comparing the exports of the primary producers with those of the manufacturers. In the case of these great primary industries of ours, the policy of protection is useby the American Statistical Bureau, namely, less, because the duties imposed on sheep and some other lines are, of course, purely illusory. should induce the Government to be a little considerate for these great industries. About a third of the total workers of Australia are engaged in the primary industries, and only about one-sixth in manufactures, but only about one-twentieth of these operatives in manufactures which compete with imports. It is only the one-twentieth who can possibly be benefited-if the policy can succeed at all-b v the policy of protection. Eveni f we assume, which would be absurd, that their industries would be destroyed were a Tariff of this sort not adopted, still, its effects can only benefit one-twentieth of the total industrial workers. honourable member think that if this Tariff be adopted, the one in twenty will be increased to five in twenty ? calculation upon the local figures, but-they exactly fit in with the English statistical records. Robert Giffen was 5 per cent, of the total workers of England as the maximum which could possibly be benefited by protection. The production of the mining industry in Australia in 1906 was £26,730,000 The hands engaged numbered 111,714. The plant was valued at £12,476,000. Many of the mines are working-as may be seen from an interview which appeared in this morning's Argus and in yesterday's South Australian Register with the ex-member for ores, though the sum total of the output of them is very great. A slight addition to their burdens may mean all the difference between a margin of profit which enables the employment to be continued, and the abandonment of the works. Then compare the mining machinery manufactures of this country with the claims of the mining industry. In engineering-whic h is a wider term than one which would embrace only the trades manufacturing mining machinery-ther e are 15,022 hands, as against 111,714 hands engaged in mining, and the plant in the engineering trades exported about £1,500,000 is valued at £ 1 , 1 9 5 , 0 0 0, as against So that we actually had an ex£12,500,000 utilized in mining.

There is another fact which mining plant is made in Australia ? A great deal of it, I think, was made at Gawler. class of machinery whicli is principally wanted for mining purposes. Moreover, freights are against the"" mining population. Last year, as far as I can remember, something like £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 or £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 was paid in duty on mining machinery. That shows that a great quantity was imported, and paid duty at 12J per cent. That duty, moreover, is plus the cost of importation, which is set down by the Tariff Commission at 26 per cent. So that, without any additional protection being given to the manufacturers of mining machinery, they would enjoy and ad valorem duty of something like 40 per cent. But, notwithstanding that fact, theimport duty is to be increased I do not. I base my to 35 per cent., and 25 per cent, against. Great Britain.

In Canada they began in 1858 with import duties of 5 or 10 per cent., which in 1866 they raised to 15 per cent. compromise for a series of years, and in 1873 the rate was increased to 17J per cent., and in 1879 the Tariff was increased practically to its present limits. Of that Tariff Sir John Macdonald saidThe Tariff, with its preference clause in favour of Great Britain and the Colonies and India, its German surtax, and its dumping clause, is now complete. So far, however, was it from being complete, that in 1903 the manufacturers of Canada, by a resolution passed at a meeting representative of the whole of the Dominion, demanded an immediate and thorough revision of the Tariff in favour of greater protection. back.

Some honor[86] able members would regard a tax, for instance, of £ 1 6 upon harvesters, which was rejected even by the protectionist m.embers of the Tariff Commission, as the true tax as against the £ 1 2 tax in the last Tariff, which was £ 1 ios. higher than that recommended by the Tariff Commission last year.

I find in the evidence taken before our Tariff Commission a statement by Mr Ripley that 75 per cent, has not improved the manufactures in America, as is proved by the fact that to-day the whole Of the middle and better class goods are imported, the only goods in which the Americans excel being cheap goods called ""domestics."" An impost of 75 per cent., after duties have been increasing for a hundred years, has failed to produce the results that are cocksuredly declared to be certain to follow from a duty of 35 per cent, in our present Tariff. I do not object to giving some considerate protection to the -woollen industry, but I object to penalizing the consumer too much in order to encourage an industry that is already fairly flourishing. I am happy to say that my own district is a centre of the woollen industry, which is getting on pretty well there. But I do not believe for a moment that it would countenance such an addition to taxation in its favour as a too complaisant Minister asks this Committee to adopt. If I were inclined to reflect upon Ministers, I should say that the Tariff seems to be their chief stock-intrade. They seem to have an idea that the moment they stop meddling with the Tariff they lose their principal support. Rather] might put it, in the words of Shakespeare, that they seem to be of opinion that. Keeps honour bright : to have done, is to hang Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail . In monumental mockery. They seem to feel that the moment they stop tinkering with the Tariff, or increasing protection, they are in imminent danger of political, extinction. It ought to b$ some satisfaction to protectionists, and some inducement to them to be moderate, to reflect on the facts with regard to the balance of trade. They generally claim that everything is right with a State so long as it exports a lot and imports little, holding that then the balance of trade is in its favour. Looking at the statistics of foreign trade-that trade which is so obnoxious to most protectionistsI find that in -1906 the balance was strongly in our favour. The imports from foreign countries amounted in round figures to £11,417,000 in value, but the exports to those countries reached over £23,000,000. We imported from France a value of £462,000, but we exported to it a value of £5,553,000. I am not sure whether a large proportion of that was not wool, but, even excluding wool, Mr Glynn. v the balance of trade with France is strongly in our favour. We imported from Germany a value of £3,204,000, and exported to that country ,£3,725,000 worth. The balance is even more in our favour if we take into account the different methods of estimating prices. I have seen that done, and it enhances the lesson taught by these figures. countries a great deal through London. of wool to the Continent through the London market, and some through Antwerp. Our imports from foreign countries show, during the last three years, an increase from £10,000,000 to £11,560,000, in round figureSj but the exports to those countries increased from £14,750,000 to over £23,000,000, so that, adopting the protectionist view of its significance, the facts of the position are absolutely against any alleged necessity for interfering with the operation of the late Tariff. They are too seldom apprehended by the people. I have referred to the woollen industry; and surely the bearing of the figures given by the honourable member for Illawarra last week in regard to the employment it gives ought to be recognised. The honourable member pointed out that under the 11 per cent. Tariff of Victoria in 1878 there were . . Perseverance, dear my lord, 736 hands engaged; that in 1888, with a 22 per cent. Tariff, there were 784 engaged; and that in 1903, with a 16 \ per cent, incidence Tariff under the Commonwealth, there were 1,013 hands engaged, showing that employment under the higher duty of 1888 was actually less than it is at the present time. Then it is shown in the report of the Tariff Commission on woollens that New South Wales, without any.duty, was exporting goods of this class to Victoria and Queensland, against, in the one case an ad valorem duty of 25 per cent., and, in the other case an ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. quantity of goods was. sent, or the length of time the higher duties operated. said, the honourable member would find some qualification to destroy the effect.

686,Mr Glynn,"No matter what wasCommission,"" in view of the operation of duties on the Continent Of course, it is alleged that Sir Robert Giffen is a mere, theorist; but it must be remembered that he is a . statistician^ and a profound thinker. As regards the alleged loss of employment by the increase of imports, the effect of Sir Robert Giffen's exceedingly minute scrutiny of the conditions on the Continent and in England, and of his examination of general conditions, is summed up in the following quotationI t is not tiue that imports of any kind displace home production, because what competition may displace in one direction is compensated by a demand in another direction, and by the greater profit of the community from buying in the best market as compared with the purchase of the dearer article from the weaker home competitors, and it is not true that investments at home, other things equal, are better than investments abroad. That can be proved, not merely by statistics given by Sir Robert Giffen. It is proved by this, amongst other facts, that during the forty years ending 1901-2 there has been an enormous increase in the imports into the United Kingdom of wholly or . mainly manufactured goods, the increase being from £3.1,000,000 to £131,000,000. . During that time, although foreign imports were so largely increasing, wages had gone up in the aggregate from £300,000,000 to ,£700,000,000, far outstripping the increase of population. Whatever may still be the errors of distribution I say nothing about those, because neither free-trade nor protection will cure the radical errors of our. present systemit is proved that the wages paid to labour in the aggregate have not diminished, but increased with the increase in the importa'tion of manufactured goods from abroad. wages been universal in both free-trade and protectionist countries? ately.

[ 8 6 ] -2 us now turn to preferential trade. We are told that preference is advocated, either in the interests of Australia or in the interests of the mother country. Last year, and the year before, preferential trade was advocated from the point of view of Imperial necessities, in order to prevent or check the decline of the mother country. AllI can say is that a country which in 1854 had an external trade of about £268,000,000 , that had in 1896 an external trade of £738,000,000 , that in 1906 had an external trade of £973,000,000, and that for the half-year ending 30th June last, had an external trade of £586,000,000 , is one that is not yet "" staggering under the too vast; orb of her fate."" To show what would be the effect of the adoption of a policy of protection, without which we cannot give the fiscal preference advocated by some on this side of the world, Mr Lloyd George, speaking in the House of Commons, on the 20th February, 1907, called attention to the fact that "" the building of a great industry, shipping, was based on free-trade.'' What are some of the figures given by Mr Lloyd George, as shown in the report of the Imperial Conference? During that Conference, we were told by the present Prime Minister of Australia, that there was a difference between a duty on imports and a tax on importssurely a psychological distinction that very few of us can recognise .so clearly as does the Prime Minister. The honourable gentleman excused the tax he was seeking to impose on imports in favour of the Colonies,, on the ground that it was not a tax but merely a duty. difference. of the eminence of the Postmaster-General can recognise the difference, but some of us f a i l to do so.

It is said that that would riot result in any addition to prices. But if there were ' no addition to prices, the preference concession could not benefit us unless we have no market other than the United Kingdom into which we can send our produce; that, in other words, there is surplus produce for which we can find no market, but for which we may get a market if this concession be given to us. That is one ground on whicli the concession might be asked; and the ground is untenable. The other ground is that we shall get an additional price, but the moment that is suggested, the idea is repudiated. Nevertheless, it is said by the Prime Minister that, though the British ports are thrown open to the Colonies and British possessions, Australia desires greater advantages in the. British market. That is to ask for something to which we are not entitled, and cannot get. No wonder that Mr Churchill, at Edinburgh, on the 24th May, saidThe Liberal Party had stood like a rock between the hard-working masses, and all who would exploit their food supply and squeeze some shameful little profit out of the scanty pittance of the wea""k and poor. red the door, and said there was no chance of that object being gained.
