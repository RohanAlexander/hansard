As launched on Australia or Australian territory. most honourable members would know, the Kangaroo 83 exercise was largely set by those of The difference in our understanding and our us on this side of the House.

The Kanlaunches an attack that he will not want to garoo 83 basis is certainly a scenario for which launch an attack on us at all. We think deterthe defence forces have to have an ability. Our rence is better than a strategy of denial. I do not problem is not that they should not develop an believe that a strategy of denial is anywhere near ability in that area, but that it should be the as effective, in the uncertain and insecure straonly ability. There are many other areas where tegic situation which we face in this part of the the Defence Force must be able at least to world, as a strategy of deterrence. A deterrent maintain some core capability. I fear that in the strategy ensures that we build up our core force changing of the constraints within which there and our overall defence capability so that anyis to be planning for the future, to place entire body who is looking at any sort of attack on emphasis on these lower level contingencies is Australia knows that not only will there be a really to restrict the Services in meeting so many denial of a lodgement but that there will be of the other events for which they should be repercussions, a strike capability, and an ability capable. to ensure that he will be hurt. As the Minister said-at page 14 of his stateI should have thought that in the International ment-the core force was developed to try to Year of Peace that would have been a concept enable a build-up in whatever areas the Defence that would have had appeal even to the AustraForce might feel necessary. There is very little lian Labor Party. It would have been far better concept within the Dibb report of the basis of if, looking at the structure of the defence forces, his rejection of the core force concept. While at the Government had said: 'We don't want our times I have had reservations as to whether the Australian defence forces ever to have to fight a core force was an adequate basis, it is notable war. We would prefer that our Australian defthat Mr Dibb has said that it was developed on ence forces were strong enough that no enemy the basis of having a warning time and to enable would want to launch an attack against us'. That a reasonable breadth of capability within the concept is not part of the Dibb recommendaDefence Force. Once we have disposed of that tions. It is important that there should be a core force and we provide a capability to meet capability of ensuring, in our strategic situation, only a lower level contingency, I do not believe that there is an ability to deter any aggressor. that we will have the broad ability-for examFor that reason, I do not believe that the stratple, certainly because of changes in the Armyegy of denial has as much validity as it should. to enable a build-up if any significant defence As I commented earlier today, I think that rethreat should emerge. lying on strategic geography, the areas of direct military interests and the sphere of primary straThe strategy of denial, which is the core of tegic interests, is to set up a Maginot Line in the Dibb concept, is one that the Minister seems another concept. to have been pursuing for some time. In this place I have expressed my concern about any The Minister talked about the distance of that type of Fortress Australia concept. While the area and he spoke about the enormous stretch Minister asserts that denial is not a Fortress of ocean that is embraced in the general primary Australia, he does it on the basis of that large strategic interests sphere. Essentially, the Minisarea of country that is represented by what he ter is saying that there is a line behind which we says is the thousand nautical miles which fall will fight the war. It is that strategic concept within that ambit of his strategy of denial that that is our worry. One does not fight an enemy is set down by Mr Dibb in his report. While I by saying; 'If you come across this line we are accept that there is certainly a difference begoing to tread on your toes'. We believe the tween the concept as enunciated by Mr Lance Government should be saying: 'If you dare to come anywhere near any of those interests that States and problems within the ANZUS arrangeaffect us, or our allies, or come near an area ment, the whole of the ANZUS agreement is associated with interests that are certainly signifnot nearly as secure a protection in this region icant to Australia, we will be able to attack you as it was a few years ago.
