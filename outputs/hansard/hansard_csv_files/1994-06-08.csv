The proceedings of the Main Committee are very much proceedings of the parliament and, as such, warrant the same respect as those conducted in the House of Representatives chamber. As a general rule, the practice and procedure observed in the chamber will apply in the Main Committee unless the standing orders specifically provide otherwise. Consequently, for example, members wiIl be required to acknowledge the chair on entering or leaving, will rise to seek the call and will address the Committee standing unless incapacitated. Remarks must be addressed through the chair and members moving within the room in which the Committee is meeting must not pass between the chair and the member addressing the Committee. The speech time limits applying for consideration of business in the House apply in the Main Committee. Where an extension of time is available under the standing orders it will also apply in the Main Committee. However, it will not be possible for standing and sessional orders to be suspended in the Main Committee for the purpose of providing for an extended speech time or for any other purpose. One aspect of the Main Committee that differs from the House of Representatives chamber relates to the seating for members. No seats are reserved for specific m-mbers. It would be expected that government members would be seated to the right of the chair, and nongovernment members to the left. Members should address the occupant of the chair as 'Deputy. Speaker', whether the chair is occupied by me, the Second Deputy Speaker or a member of the Speaker's panel. Other members should be referred to by the name of the electoral division they represent or the office they hold. The standing orders provide that the quorum of this Committee shall comprise the occupant of the chair, one government member and one non-government member. Under the standing orders, if the chair takes note that a quorum is not present, proceedings are to be suspended or the Committee is to be adjourned. . Proceedings of the Committee must be suspended to enable members to attend any division in the House. The lights activated by the ringing of the bells will operate in this room, but the bells will be muted. Advice will be relayed directly from the chamber as to whether a division is in progress or a quorum is required and proceedings in the Committee will be suspended if a division is occurring. Committee proceedings will recommence when the chair here is resumed. Should the House adjourn, the· Committee must be adjourned forthwith by the chair. The Committee will be adjourned by the chair on completion of consideration of matters referred to it. Every question in the committee is to be decided on the voices. It is not possible for the committee to divide on a question and any dissent from the result announced by the chair is to be recorded in the minutes as an unresolved question for decision by. the House.

In this case the Committee shall return the bill to the House for further consideration. Any member may move at any time during consideration of the Main Committee for further proceedings on a bill to be conducted in the House, and the motion shall be determined without amendment or debate. The official record of proceedings of the Main Committee will be the minutes of proceedings of the committee kept by the Clerk of the Committee, and will form part of the Votes and Proceedings of the House for the sitting during which the committee meets. A transcript of proceedings will be produced and will form part of the Hansard repo.rt of the House for that day. A sub-table office for the purposes of the Main Committee is located at the rear of this room. Staff, advisers, members of the media and other passholders will be required to enter this room by means of the central corridor. Members of the public will also enter and leave by these central corridor doors. Members may, of course, use all entry and exit points. However, the door in the north-eastern corner-towards the House of Representatives sidewill be reserved for entry and exit by members. Given the significance of this first meeting of the Main Committee, permission has been given for the taking of photographs for official and media purposes. The same guidelines will apply to the taking of photographs by the media. The signal of proceedings will be carried throughout the building by the House monitoring service. As a general rule, the guidelines applying to television camera operators in the chamber will apply to coverage of the Main Committee. The physical arrangements for the Main Committee enable members of the public and others to be much closer to where consideration of legislation and other matters is taking place than is possible in the House of Representatives chamber. However, the area allotted to members in this room is clearly delineated, and the integrity of that area must be respected at all times. The first mee!ing of the Main Committee heralds a new era in the deliberations of the parliament. There has been much discussion about and interest in the proposed operation of this Committee. I am sure that, with the cooperation of all members,the Main Committee will make the positive contribution to the workings of the House of Representatives envisaged by the Standing Committee on Procedure.

I know that we will all take heed of the strictures that you have placed upon us in terms of our conduct in this chamber. I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1990, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990. These acts relate to the provision of superannuation benefits to civilian Commonwealth sector employees.",135,Representatives Main Committee
225,Mr Beazley (Swan,"Minister for Finance) (10.06 a.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, may IWednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1727 The main purpose of the bill is to make amendments to allow superannuation schemes for Commonwealth civilian employees to comply with the .Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and associated legislation. The bill also makes some technical corrections. The Government decided that its own superannuation schemes that were at least partly funded should comply with the occupational superannuation requirements in the SIS legislation in the same way as private sector schemes. Commonwealth schemes that are not funded will be required to comply in principle with the major thrust of the controls, such as vesting and preservation. Among other things, the SIS legislation requires that the rules of a superannuation fund may not allow the trustees of the fund to be directed by another person, nor may any other person exercise discretions unilaterally. In addition, the rules of the fund should not be able to be amended without the approval of the' trustees. All these rules have some exceptions spelled out in the SI(S) Act itself, and some to be provided for by regulations under that act. The main exception relates to directions, discretions et cetera that would affect the employer's contributions to the fund. Currently, the Superannuation Act 1976 provides that the Commissioner for Superannuation and a board of trustees share the responsibility for the administration for the scheme set up by the act, the Commonwealth superannuation scheme or CSS. The bill gives the responsibility for administration of the CSS completely to the board of trustees. All discretionary decisions that were previously made by the commissioner will be made by the board from 1 July 1994. The Minister for Finance also has a role under the 1976 act. Some of the powers exercised by the minister are to be transferred to the board. However, other powers which relate to employer costs under the scheme will remain with the minister. Certain other powers were exercisable by the board after consideration of principles issued by the minister. In the case of these powers, the act generally has been amended to incorporate into the legislation any principles that were issued, and any remaining discretion is to be exercised by agreement between the minister and the board. Similar amendments concerning the powers of the minister are to be made to the Superannuation Act 1990. The scheme established under the provisions of that act is already administered by a board of trustees, so no transfer of power from the Commissioner for Superannuation is necessary. I emphasise that no changes are to be made to the benefit structure or the scheme design of the schemes covered by the acts that are being amended. One of the technical changes being made is to allow certain delegated instruments to operate with retrospective effect and to put the validity of past instruments beyond doubt. These amendments are a response to concerns raised by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. The instruments would enable members to continue membership in circumstances where they may have inadvertently been forced to leave the scheme if there was no retrospectivity. The bill also amends the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990. This act enables the Minister for Finance to exercise certain di§,cretions to oversight and control superannuation arrangements established by Commonwealth employing authorities other than the Commonwealth itself. Consistent with the SI(S) Act, the existing ministerial discretions would be replaced with provisions preventing Commonwealth employers from establishing and operating superannuation arrangements unless they are able to satisfy certain predetermined 1728 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 requirements. An added feature of these requirements is that they will impose an obligation on employers to report annually to the minister in relation to those arrangements. I now turn to the financial impact of the bill. As none of the changes result in any change to the benefit designed for superannuation schemes involved, there is no financial impact. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the bill to the Committee. Deputy Speaker. Beazley), in marking the inauguration of the Main Committee. It is, as the Leader of the House said, something of an experiment in the parliamentary life of Australia. I hope it goes well. The opposition takes the view that it will give the mechanism of the Main Committee its best shot. If the Main Committee can add to the intelligent dispatch of business and, in this rather more intimate atmosphere, lift the quality of debate on some of the less contentious but nonetheless detailed pieces of legislation, the whole parliamentary system and the community will be the beneficiaries. I have a couple of remarks about the ambience of the room. In the short time available, the people responsible, and I compliment the Deputy Clerk as their representative, have done quite well. There might be some consideration given to placing an Australian coat of arms behind the Deputy Speaker's chair. If that is decided on, I hope that is the full-blown coat of arms and not the terribly short one. I like the full-blown one with the wattle in its complete lustre and bloom. I can promise him that one thing we will not forget is the Speaker's chair when we win the next election, but it will be going back into the main chamber. There could be some consideration given to a few other adornments in this room. However, we will do our best to make the Main Committee work; I hope it does. I thank the Clerk and the others responsible for assembling things. It will be a very interesting exercise. of his remarks. I say to the honourable member for Banks that it was predictable that he would make the first interjection in this place. through you, to the clerks, and I express the wish that this chamber succeeds in the objectives set for it by the government. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 was introduced into the House on 9 May after it passed through the Senate on 5 May. It was referred to the Main Committee on 2 June, making it the first of several bills to be referred to this Committee. The bill sets out to ensure the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, CSS, and the Public Sector Superanriuation Scheme, PSS, are compatible with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, known as the SI(S) Act, and with associated legislation. This is a goal which the coalition agrees with, no matter what concerns we may have with the provisions of the SI(S) Act. Therefore, the coalition does not oppose the legislation.

233,Mr Rocher (Curtin) (10.13 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I add my best wishes to you and,Wednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN .COMMITTEE 1729 begins operating from 1 July 1994, makes provision for the prudent management of certain superannuation funds and for oversight by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. In particular, the SI(S) Act aims to ensure that members' moneys are as secure as-possible. Although the SI(S) Act allows for certain public sector superannuation schemes to be exempted from it, the government has nevertheless decided that all Commonwealth superannuation schemes with an invested fund will comply with the SI(S) Act. This is the first measure to ensure that Commonwealth schemes comply with the SI(S) Act. Further legislation, such as the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, has been introduced with the stated aim of bringing all Commonwealth superannuation schemes with the SI(S) Act. For the infonnation of the Main Committee and others, this bill will bring the parliamentarians' superannuation scheme within the SI(S) Act. Those without an invested fund will still need to comply with the main requirements of the principal act, such as preservation. In order to ensure that Commonwealth superannuation schemes can continue to be eligible for taxation concessions after 1 July 1994, the governing rules for those schemes, including the legislation, are to be amended. The main thrust of the proposed amendments is to give trustees greater responsibility for and control over the administration of the scheme. This results in the powers of the relevant minister in the role of employer being diminished in some ways and shared with the trustees in other ways. In other instances, discretions previously exercisable by the minister have been replaced by specific provisions in this legislation. Importantly, the SI(S) Act provides exemptions so that employers are able to retain control of decisions, discretions and amendments which affect the cost to the employer of a scheme. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill before us will amend four acts. They are: the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1990, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990. The vast majority of amendments are made to the Superannuation Act 1976, however, which is the act that established the CSS. Several amendments are made to this act. They are mostly of a technical nature and include the powers and role of the trustees of the CSS, ensuring that the rules of the CSS enable the payment of certain. unclaimed benefits to eligible rollover funds as required by the SI(S) Act; providing for the making of and saving of previously made retrospective regulations and other legislative instruments under certain provisions of the act in order to ensure continuing membership of the scheme in certain circumstances and certain other technical amendments that ensure that references to other legislation are correct and that the CSS complies with the SI(S) Act. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1990 amended the 1976 act as well as other acts as a result of the review of superannuation for Commonwealth employees that led to the introduction of the superannuation scheme provided for by the Superannuation Act 1990. This bill proposes to amend the amending act to correct a technical deficiency in one of its provisions. The Superannuation Act 1990, the 1990 act in brief, provided for the establishment of the PSS under a trust deed and rule. This bill amends the 1990 act in several ways, including changes to the power and role of the trustees that mirror the changes to the CSS, as stated, providing a regulations making power to enable alternations to the 1990 act so that it can easily comply with future amendments to the SI(S) act, its regulations and other 1730 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 regulatory laws and mirror the changes to the CSS so as to provide for the making of and saving of previously made retrospective regulations and other legislative instruments. The Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act of 1990 allows discretions to be exercised by the Minister for Finance on the oversight and control over the provision by Commonwealth employees of superannuation benefits for their employees outside the CSS and PSS. The amendment to this act enables the Minister for Finance to maintain strategic control of Commonwealth employing authorities superannuation schemes in a manner that is consistent with the SI(S) Act. Under these amendments, Commonwealth employers will not be able to establish and operate superannuation schemes, unless they are able to satisfy certain requirements that are predetermined by the minister. The amendments proposed in this bill do not alter in any way, shape or form, the financial entitlement accruing to members of the CSS and PSS. Overall these amendments benefit the members of the two Commonwealth superannuation schemes, because members will now have access to the superannuation complaints tribunal, with its low cost dispute resolution mechanisms. Fund members will also maintain access to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, giving members a choice of process by which they can seek redress if they feel hard done by. These amendments are also reaSsuring for Commonwealth public servants because their funds will not be protected in the same way as private sector funds are by the provisions of the SIS legislation. This is especially important because invested funds in the CSS and PSS will be subject to the SI(S) Act's prudential standards, which become effective on 1 July this year. Though the SI(S) Act exempted certain public sector schemes from these controls, this legislation brings nearly all Commonwealth public servants under SIS provisions. Many state schemes are apparently unable to comply with the SI(S) Act at this stage, but are expected to be able to do so in the near future, I understand. The legislation currently before us is fairly straightforward and does not involve a great deal of contention or controversy. However, some aspects of the CSS and PSS warrant discussion, as well as some more general superannuation issues which. relate to the SI(S) Act. As honourable members are aware, no doubt, there are no employer contributions from the Commonwealth to meet future claims upon the CSS, and only very limited contributions to the PSS. On retirement, the employer component of the CSS and most of the PSS comes from consolidated revenue. That means, in effect, that, for the CSS alone, there was an unfunded liability of $33 billion as at 30 June 1992. That was a liability of $1,903 a head for every Australian man, woman and child. For the PSS, the employer contribution is only three per cent of salary. This leaves the remaining 12.4 per cent unfunded. However, the government's potential liability does not end there. In the CSS, employee contributions are invested by Commonwealth Funds Management, CFM, with returns to employees based on investment outcomes. In the PSS though, employee contributions are invested by the CFM, but the return is guaranteed and not limited to investment returns. The Commonwealth thereby has to make up any shortfall that occurs, further exposing consolidated revenue in the future to the need to payout PSS members on retirement. A fully funded superannuation scheme is arguably the most desirable scheme to have in place. The strongest argument in support of full funding concerns the principle of intergenerational equity. Put simply, it is more equitable that the cost of liabilities currently Wednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1731 incurred should be met by the current generation and should not be left to be paid for by future generat-pns. Future generations may not have the capacity to pay the superannuation of their predecessors. This lessening of fiscal responsibilities severely inhibits the ability of future generations to make the necessary decisions on where expenditure would be best allocated. P.P. McGuinness in two columns in the Australian of 1 February and 5 February amongst other things said: The ageing of the Australian population is a problem that is attracting increasing attention as we look forward to the next century. What has now become quite clear is that the baby boomer generation has created a burden that will blight their children's lives. This blight will occur because the children of the baby boomer generation will, according to McGuinness, be left to pay the unfunded superannuation and pensions of their parents, as well as the mounting bills for health and nursing homes. McGuinness, even if somewhat emotive, has mounted a good case for fully funded future public and private sector superannuation. Superannuation is also an important component of labour costs, and governments should be recognising these costs and paying for them as they occur. This could have the added bonus of giving governments increased resolve to keep staff numbers under control and inhibit government from engaging in activities for which there is no real benefit to the community at large. Fully funded schemes would also have the advantage that governments would need to keep schemes within economic levels. One of the few arguments against the full funding of public sector superannuation is that, while Australia is, a net borrower, it does not make sense to borrow further in order to fund public sector superannuation. Although that is a valid point, and there are some others, the reasons for establishing fully funded schemes are more persuasive. The government, when establishing the PSS in 1990, took the decision to partially fund that particular scheme to avoid a large increase in unfunded liability. So at least the government is aware of the problem. The government, when establishing the PSS, not only made it partially funded; it reduced the level of future entitlements due to fund members. This has been achieved by reducing the new entrant contribution rate-that is, average employer contribution expressed as a percentage of salary from 22.8 per cent to 15.4 per cent. The Commonwealth is not the only government to reduce the level of its contribution: New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia have all created new public sector superannuation schemes that are partially funded with reduced employer contributions. As of 30 June 1992, Victoria's unfunded superannuation liabilities amounted to $18 billion, which is $4,063 for each and every citizen of the state of Victoria' and it is the worse liability of any state fund in the nation. New South Wales's unfunded liability was $13.9 billion, at the same level of employer contribution as Victoria-that is, 21.5 per cent-while Western Australia, after Victoria, had the highest per capita liability of $2,694. This is a reflection on the previous Cain and Kirner governments in Victoria that destroyed Victoria's fiscal base, in one of the worse examples of economic vandalism, by employing more public servants from 1982 to 1988 than all the other state governments and the federal government combined. These extra public servants became an impossible fiscal burden to carry, in terms of their wages and on-costs, as well as the added future cost of massive increases in unfunded superannuation liabilities in that state. It is small wonder that, in those circumstances, the Kennett government has been reducing the size of the Victorian Public Service. Both the 1732 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 Commonwealth and the states as at 30 June 1992 had total unfunded superannuation liabilities of $80 billion, with this figure rising to $90 billion when local government is also taken into account. This is an extremely large burden that tomorrow's taxpayers will have to carry. Queensland is the only state that has a fully funded superannuation scheme which, though a modest scheme, is affordable. Ms Crawford-Hear, hear! for that, and I am sure the honourable, member who just said, 'Hear, hear!' would agree with me. He should be remembered as the Australian state premier who established Queensland's excellent financial state of affairs, which the current Goss Labor government has inherited. It is time that all government public sector superannuation schemes become fully funded and meet the requirements of the SI(S) Act. Another superannuation issue that I have spoken about in the past is the operation of the superannuation guarantee charge, which discriminates against many casual, part-time and itinerant workers. The coalition has received many representations from working men and women in Australia who have been affected by the rules current applying to the SGC. These problems were acknowledged by the then Treasurer as long ago as August 1993, when he announced that the government would give high priority to resolving the problems experienced by casual and itinerant workers under the SGC scheme. I seer it has surfaced again, and we are getting the same assurances as we had in 1993, but we still have very little to show for them. This is a problem which requires a strong government response. If the government had addressed the issue in the past two years, or as long as two years ago, lower income earners would now have a rational superannuation system. Sections 27 and 28 of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 are, at the heart of the problem that penalises casual, part-time and itinerant workers, and penalises them very severely, indeed. Casual and itinerant workers often work for many employers and change jobs regularly, resulting at the moment in membership of multiple and separate superannuation schemes. Administration fees and exit fees whittle away those funds because they take no account of the available balance. For example, a worker earning $600 per month would receive a superannuation contribution from his or her employer of $18 per month, or an annual benefit of $216. However, there is a contribution tax of 15 per cent that reduces the balance to $184, and there is a further administration charge of $50. The remaining balance is only $134-$82 is gobbled up by taxes and administration fees. What hope does this hold for a worker who works only a few hours a week or who can get only occasional work? .Many of these schemes, into wnich contributions are made by the employer, often lie dormant after a casual worker has moved on to another job. These dormant superannuation schemes, if more than $500-or less than $500, but not withdrawn from the super fund-will continue to be charged an administration fee of approximately $50 per year or, at best, a dormant account fee of $26. There are also the exit fees when workers decide to rationalise their superannuation holdings. These provisions penalise women disproportionately to men, as women are more likely to work in part-time positions and occupations that are less well paid. I have mentioned several solutions to that problem in the past in the chamber, so I am not going to regurgitate them here. . However, in his budget speech, and as recently as 26 May, the Treasurer ( Mr Willis) announced the government will issue a statement before 30 June on superannuation including",138,Representatives Main Committee

The exchange that will obviously happen there and the closeness of the debate will help us; The main reason for this committee is to deal with non-controversial legislation. I think the message is that it is often forgotten by many people out there in broader Australia-and it is an opportunity to say it this morning-that much of the legislation that actually goes through the parliament is non-controversial and goes through with the support of all members of the parliament. I believe that, as the debate goes on in this chamber, this is going to give us the opportunity to emphasise that more. Overall, the success of this place will be up to each and eyery one of us as members of parliament-not so much you, sir""':""'in the way we contribute to this place. The success that will follow will be how we make our contribution to this place. I think it will be very important. I look forward to making my contribution in this place from time to time and discussing these matters .that come before the parliament. Mr Deputy Speaker, the matter before us today, the first day of operation of this place, is the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. The main purpose of this bill is to enable the Commonwealth superannuation arrangements for civilian employees in the COmnionwealth superannuation scheme, the CSS, and the public sector superannuation scheme, the PSS, to comply with revisions of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, the SICS) Act, and associated legislation which largely come into operation from 1 July 1994. It will do this by amending the four acts dealing with superannuation for Commonwealth sector civilian employees. These acts are: the Superannuation Act 1976; the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1990; the Superannuation Act 1990; and the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990. The SICS) Act takes effect from 1 July this year, and makes provision for the prudent management of certain superannuation funds in particular, to ensure that members' money is as secure as possible. This is understandably a matter of great concern to the public. It will also allow the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to supervise its operations, another very important aspect.",142,Representatives Main Committee

238,Mr Les Scott (Oxley) (10.36 A.m,")Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence,could1734 MAIN COMMiTTEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 The government decided that its own superannuation schemes that were at least partly funded should comply with the occupational superannuation requirements in the SIS legislation in much the same way as private sector schemes. Commonwealth schemes that are not funded will be required to comply, at least in principle, with the major thrust of the controls such as vesting and preservation. Commonwealth superannuation schemes with invested funds will consequently come under the supervision of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, who is responsible for ensuring that superannuation funds comply with provisions for prudent management in the SI(S) Act. The Commonwealth superannuation schemes without invested funds will also comply with the requirements of the SI(S) Act such as preservation and benefits and vesting. The main provisions of the bill are intended to ensure that the CSS and the PSS comply with the SIS legislation in the following key respects. Subsection 58(1) of the SI(S) Act requires that the trustees should not be subject to direction by any other person except to the extent permitted by subsection 58(2) and the regulations. This will require the removal or limitation of the power of the minister to issue statements of government policy and principles of various matters to be followed by the boards. Paragraphs 4.1, 4.6 and 4.16 actually apply to that. Subsection 59(1) and the SI(S) Act provide that a person other than a trustee must not be in a position to exercise discretion except in certain limited circumstances permitted by subsection 59(2) and the regulations in paragraphs 4.7 and 4.15. This legislation is all about providing adequate control and supervision over money built up by members of superannuation funds. These amendments will mean that the Commonwealth funds will comply with the SIS legislation. This is a very good idea, of course, and to illustrate this I will remind honourable members of the nature and the intent of the SIS legislation. Among other things, it requires that the rules of a superannuation fund not allow trustees to the fund to be directed by another person, and that no other person may exercise discretion in that group. In addition, the rules of the fund should not be able to be amended without the approval of the trustees. As you can imagine, this places a great onus on the trustees to provide the fund members with regular, quality information about the ongoing operation and performance of the fund. The CSS and PSS schemes are examples of funds that are doing this, and the managers of these schemes should be commended for their commitment to adequate protection for their members. The main benefit that will flow from these amendments is that they will give trustees greater responsibilities for, and control over, the scheme. This implies, of course, that they will also have higher standards to match regarding prudent supervision of the funds. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is important to note that these proposed amendments do not alter the benefit design of the schemes provided for by the legislation, so there is no net financial impact of this bill. The members of the Commonwealth superannuation funds will not lose any money from this, but they will gain increased protection. Under this legislation, the trustees of both the CSS and the PSS are not subject to any direction from any person except the minister, as provided for under the SI(S) Act. This is reassuring for Commonwealth public servants, as they will know that their funds will now be protected in the same way as the private sector funds are protected under the SI(S) Act. This is a debate that has raged for some time now, but there is nothing wrong with that. We are, after all, talking about very large sums of money in these funds. The topic of the adequate supervision of superannuation funds has received a great deal of attention over the last few years. To illustrate the necessity for the changes outlined in the legislation currently before Wednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1735 us, I take the opportunity to remind honourable members of what the parliamentary banking inquiry, which I was involved in, said two years ago. The report of the inquiry recommended that 'a council of financial supervisors be established to facilitate closer coordination between the supervisors of the financial system'. Whilst the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill does not propose to set up any such council, the important point in that quote was the necessity for better coordination, and these amendments will help to achieve this. As I said before, the legislation will place greater standards on trustees. This is a very important part of any superannuation scheme. This was another point that arose from the banking inquiry. In line with the need for the best possible supervision of funds is the control and management of investor's funds. It is essential that the trustees and managers of the funds be accountable to the fund managers. These amendments will ensure that this is the case, as the funds will comply with the SIS legislation, which requires that the trustees report down to the members and, as I said before, must not be directed by another person. It is one thing to have elected trustees of funds to represent members' interests. However, who those trustees authorise as the fund managers is equally important. Mf Deputy Speaker, the government has made several significant and positive decisions to ensure adequate protection, and this.process will continue as superannuation continues its rise into prominence in the savings pool of the future.· The following are some of the significant main changes proposed by the bill to each of the acts setting up the CSS and the PSS. For instance, clause 4 declares that the object of the amendments proposed by division 2 of part 2 is to ensure the rules of the CSS are consistent with section 58 of the SI(S) Act. Subsection 58(1) of the SI(S) Act broadly provides that the rules must not permit the trustee of a superannuation entity to be subject to direction by any other person. This general· prohibition against directions to trustees is subject to certain exceptions provided in subsection 58(2). In the case of employer sponsored funds, such as the CSS, paragraph 58(2)(e) provides that the employer sponsor-or an associate of an employer sponsor-may direct the trustees in certain circumstances prescribed by the regulations. Regulation 4.03 prescribes the circumstances where an employer sponsor or an associate of an employer sponsor may give a direction to a trustee. Subregulation 4.03(1) provides that such a direction may not be given if the implementation of the direction will result in the fund becoming technically insolvent and if the rights of the members to accrued benefits are adversely affected by the direction. Subregulation 4.03(2) provides five specific circumstances where a qualifying direction may be given. These relate to the admission of new members, the category of members into which a new member or an existing member may be placed, thus the allowing of a person to become an employer sponsor of the fund, the termination of a fund and the appointment of a trustee to an entity that does not have a trust deed. Division2 of the bill amends the CSS Act so that the minister may only direct the Commonwealth board of trustees No.2, the CSS board, in circumstances authorised by section 58 of the SI(S) Act. Subsections 27C(6) and (7) of the CSS Act provide for the minister to issue a statement of Commonwealth government policy in relation to performance of the functions of the CSS board. As the issue of such statements may be considered as providing directions to the board, contrary to the provisions of section 58 of the SI(S) Act, these subsections are being repealed by clause 7 of the bill. As all sections currently providing for the issue of principles by the minister are being repealed from 1 July 1994, clauses 14 and 15 amend sections 153AL and 153AS to provide 1736 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 for a delegate of the board or the board itself to make determinations before 1 July 1994 on the basis of principles issued by the minister prior to that date. Section 161 of the. CSS Act provides for financial statements issued by the CSS board to be in the form approved by the minister. It also provides that the annual report ·should contain details of a statement or a policy issued to the CSS board by $e minister. Clause 16 of the bill omits these requirements and provides for the form of financial statements to be agreed by the minister and the board. Clause 17 declares that the object of the amendments proposed by division 3 of part 2 is to ensure that the rules of the CSS are consistent with section 59 of the SI(S) Act. Subsection 59(1) of the SI(S) Act broadly provides that the rules of a superannuation entity must not permit any person other than the trustee of a superannuation entity to exercise a discretion under the rules except in certain circumstances. Paragraph 59(1)(a) provides that such a discretion could be·exercised by a non-ttustee if the rules require that trustee to consent to the exercise of the discretion. In addition, paragraph 59(1)(b) pr()vides that, if the entity is an employer-sponsored fund, the discretion which a non-trustee· may exercise must relate to the contributions the employer will be required to pay after the exercise of the discretion; or the discretion must relate to the termination of the fund; or the circumstances of the exercise of the discretion are covered by regulations made for that purpose. Regulation 4.04 prescribes the circumstances when a non-trustee may exercise a discretion. Subregulation 4.04(1) provides that such a discretion may not be exercised if it will result in the fund becoming technically insolvent and if the rights of the memberS to accrue benefits are adversely affected by the exercise of the discretion. . Subregulation 4.04(2) provides five specific circumstances when a discretion may be exercised. These relate to the admission of new members, the category of members into which a new member or an existing member may be placed, the allowing of a person to become an employer-sponsor of the fund, the termination of a fund and the appointment of a trustee or an entity that does not have a trust deed. , Division3 of the bill amends the CSS Act so that the discretionary powers at present exercised by the commissioner or the minister other than those exempted under section 59 of the SI(S) Act are transferred to the CSS board. Section 60 of the SI(S) Act requires that the rules of a superannuation entity must not permit its rules to be amended unless: (a) the trustee has consented to the amendment; or (b) if the entity is an employer-sponsored fund: (i) the amendment relates to the contributions that an employer-sponsor will; after the amendment, be required or permitted to pay to the fund; or (ii) the amendment relates solely to the termination of the fund; or (iii) the circumstances in which the amendment was made are covered by regulations made for that purpose; the amendment is made solely to confer on the trustee the power to consent to amendment of the rules, . (c) the amendment is made solely for the purpose of conferring on the trustee the power to consent to amendments of those rules. . Regulation 4.05 prescribes the circumstances under which the rules of a superannuation entity may be amended. Subregulation 4.05(1) provides that an amendment may not be made, Wednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 1737 if it·will result in the fund becoming technically insolvent, and if the rights of the members to accrued benefits are adversely affected in consequence of the amendment. Subregulation 4.05(2) provides five specific circumstances when an amendment may be made without the consent .of the trustee. These relate to: the admission of new members; the category of members into which a new member or an existing member may be placed; the allowing of a person to become an employer-sponsor of the fund; the termination of a fund; and the appointment of a trustee to an entity that does not have a trustee. Division3 of the bill attempts to amend the CSS Act so that the rules of the CSS may not be amended without the approval of the board. With regard to investment of funds, section 42 of the CSS Act provides that the CSS Board must consult with the Commissioner for Superannuation regarding moneys that are required to be maintained for the purpose of paying benefits under the CSS Act, in the course of managing the fund. As the board will have responsibility for the payment of benefits under the CSS Act, clause 26 of the bill removes the requirement for consultations with the Commissioner of Superannuation. Presently, subsection 42(3) of the CSS Act provides that the board may invest the money of the fund through im investment manager or managers. Subsection 42(4) requires the board, until 30 June 1995, to engage only Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd (CFM) as the investment manager, to invest any money of the fund. Section 33 of the PSS Act places similar restrictions on the board of the PSS. . Under the SICS) Act the trustees are generally responsible for the investment of funds through an investment manager of their choice. This is a discretion vested in the trustees which goes to the essence of prudential management. It may therefore be argued that, as long as the provisions of section 42(4) of the CSS Act and section 33 of the PSS Act require that the trustees of theCSS and the PSS should only engage CFM as investment managers, there is a contravention of section 59 of the SICS) Act,. which provides that the rules of a fund must not alIow any person other than the truste.e to exercise a discretion. There is, however,. scope for the contrary view that parliament made a definite exception to the requirements of section 59 of the SICS) Act, in the case of the CSS, on the discretion to appoint an investment manager, by not repealing the requirements of subsection 42(4) when it amended subsection 42(1), and that therefore the provisions of section 59 of the SICS) Act are subject to the provisions of section 42(4) of the. CSS Act. Againsnhat view, it may be argued that, as section 42(4)iil the CSS Act and section 33 in the PSS Act existed prior to the enactment of the SIS legislation:-which introduced an entirely new legislative framework· for the prudential management of the superannuation industry-any exception to the key provision of section 59 of the SICS) Act should be found in that act or regulations made thereunder. . If the CSS and the PSS, the two funds we are speaking about, are, to be complying funds, it would be best to remove any doubts about whether the legislative measures to appoint CFM as the investment manager until 30 June 1995 create an exception to the provisions of that particular section, section .59 of the SICS) Act, either by amendments to the CSS Act and the PSS Act or by regulations und-r the SICS) Act relating to section 60. As honourable members undoubtedly are aware, this is an extremely wide ranging bill in the work that it does, and I have by no means covered all the aspects of the legislation and its impact. In the short time left, I reinforce the importance ·of .the bill· with respectto supervision of investment by .funds managers. While the· thrust of this bill is to provide 1738 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 protection for funds; I make some short comments about some possible investment alternatives for the future of superannuation. It is anticipated that growth in superannuation funds will continue and will in fact accelerate. It has been estimated that by' the year 2002 more than $500 billion will be, held in superannuation stocks. This huge ,pool of savings, could provide enormous opportunities for Australian industry investment, and there is a good' argument that a portion of these funds could be used for industry development. If such a proposal were to be considered, the primary concern would have to be the safety of the members' funds. By adequately supervising the investments, and by ensuring that they are spread across different portfolios tominimise the risk, the safety of members' savings should be assured. The, changes to trustees' reporting and supervisory requirements brought about by the amendmenin this bill would already go some way towards this, in respect of Commonwealth superaimuation funds but, of course, further complementary legislation should be considered. It is not likelythatthe superannuation industry will suddenly move in that direction, and I would suggest that perhaps we will need to ensure that superannuation funare legislated in sQme way, to encourage them to invest that pool of funds into industry ;development.,1 am very pleased -o have the opportunity to support the bill before us today. opportunity to congratulate you on the setting up of this. chamber. I also congratulate you on assuming the role oCdeputy spe!lker and on conducting the affairs .of the Parliament of Australia in this chamber. I e}l.tend my congratulatioto the clerkS and the staff of the parliament for their preparation of this chamber and for transforming it from a committroom into the Main Committee chamber. ' . ' The size of the chamber reminds me a little, of the size of the Victorian Legislative Council whence I came. However, it does not have the gracious adornments of that chamber, nor does it have any gold leaf. Nevertheless, I believe that it will be a very good debating chamber. I am sure that the close proximity of the government and the coalition will lead to some very good debateS. I am pleased to be.able to speak on a bill that is before tlieHouse ,on this historic day in the Main Committee chamber. ' I want to address a few comments to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill. Superannuation has changed quite dramatically in .this country over recent years. Those changes have led to much confusion and greater complexity than we have ever seen before. There was a time when individual citizens CQuld negotiate their own superannuation with comparative ease. They were abl-to understand theimplicatipns of what the superannuation requirements were, what their benefits would be after paying into it for an extenped period, and what their net benefit would be at the end of that period. Much has changed in the field of superannuation since that time. Change upon change upon change has been'wrought on the superannuation industry over that period. It is now such a complex area that very few people in this nation understand how superannuation works., The superannuation guarantee charge continues to be a, source of concern for many employers. Apart from being an additional impost on the cost of employing every worker, the administrative costs must be added to the already long list of the costs incurred over and above direct worker payments. One of the widespread concerns that I have picked up about the operation of the superannuation guarantee charge is the way in which smalL balances in superannuation funds can be eroded by administrative costs, particularly for itinerant,casual and seasonal workers, who often see their small balances disappear completely. The problem",143,Representatives Main Committee
239,Mr Reid (Bendigo) (10.55 A.m.),"-Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence I take theWednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMITI'EE 1739 is also particularly serious for many women workers because of the broken periods they spend in the work force. I recently had a complaint from a young man in· my' electorate. He was desirous of working and he had a friend who operated a fruit property in Sunraysia, so he went up there to do some fruit-picking. Obviously, he was paid for that work. The superannuation guarantee charge was deducted.from his earnings and was paid into a superannuation fund. I think a sum of a little over $48 was paid into that superannuation fund. After a period of approximately 12 months, this young man discovered to his dismay that the whole of that amount had been swallowed up by administrative charges. This situation is of real concern because that person may take on a number of part-time or itinerant positions and yet all of those small amounts of money would obviously be swallowed up more or less totally by the administrative charges ofthaf fund. So the government has got serious problems with that. I should note that I understand that the Senate has requested that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation take submissions and, conduct hearings nationwide on the problems associated with that su,perannuation guarantee charge. One of the other issues related to superannuation was the promise made by the government leading up to the 1993 election. That promise was that superannuation funds would be made available for housing. I am sure that the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Gibson) would be well aware of the election promise made that people would bea:ble to use their superannuation funds for housing. Of course, the government has now reneged on that. It has disappointed a lot of young people who have paid into superannuation and who could have had access to, those funds to provide a deposit on a house. The government has reneged on that promise and it is not going to implement the scheme. .Since then the superannuation for housing report was issued by the Senate Select Committee on Superannua:tion. That was in mid-May. The committee took submissions from many interested parties on this issue and the report received unqualified support across Australia. I might add that for the benefit of the honourable member for Moreton. There were many people who were desirous of having those superannuation funds freed up. for housing. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation did identify a narrow but certainly a significant band of individuals who would be better off being allowed to use their superannuation money to finance the purchase of a home. There are many ways in which that could have assisted people, particularly young people; to get their first home. Of course, now the government has reneged'totally on that promise and those funds will not be available to them. The other .issue that is related to that, concems a letter that I received from Mr Roy Wilkinson, who is a constitu-nt of mine in the Bendigo area and who has spent a lifetime in the life assurance industry. tIis working life has been devoted to that industry. his letter to me he expressed grave. ,?oncerns about the direction in whi-h superannuation and life assurance were heading. He believes that the industry is in danger as a result of a whole range of changes made by the government. They are so far-reaching that people simply do not understand . the complexities . . of it all and the pitfalls that may be involved. 'He does say that the savings potentild of life assurance is one of the major factors that Australia needs in its economic planning and, he has expressed .his concern .at the way the industry is going. He has implored me to put a Cl!.se that common sense be put back into the insurance ,industry and the superannuation industry in Australia. The implementation of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act imposes an additional cost. The honourable member for Curtin( Mr Rocher), who was in the. chamber earlier, 1740 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 expressed concerns about the additional costs that would be imposed and the administrative complexity of the superannuation changes that have been made. I can only reiterate them to the honourable member for Moreton, who is the government member present, in the hope that those issues will be taken up. There are also difficulties imposed on public offers of funds too. I think that therelll'e a number of issues that the government needs to address. Superannuation, as I say, has become more and more complex. People do not understand what is happening now with their superannuation, the extent of the changes varying from one year to another. There have been so many changes over the.past three or four years that people are totally confused about the way t4at the superannuation industry does in fact operate. People who do itinerant work. and are moving from job to job are suffering as a result of the administrative· charges of the superannuation funds. I think that that is one issue that the government needs to address very quickly. It needs to do something to simplify the processes of the superannuation industry. The other major issue which I drew attention to was the use of superannuation money for housing, on which the government has let down the public yet again, making promises in the lead-up to the election, building up people's expectations of being able to use their superannuation funds for housing, only to dash those hopes by reneging on its promise. With those few remarks on this historic occasi-n, I will finish my contribution to the debate. after deliberating on the proposals that led to the establishment of this Main Committee. over the past months, we probably take it a little bit for granted, but this first day of operation of this chamber will go down in the annals of history of Australia as quite an historic day. The establishment of the second chamber obviously was. supported by both the government and the opposition and it seems, from its operation so far this morning, that it is going to be on occasions a rather more Civilised place than the main chamber of the House of Representatives. That is the way it has been designed to be. Ironically, the first bill that we are debating here today is a bill that deals with amendments to superannuation for Commoriwealth parliamentarians. It will be interesting to see what the pundits say in 10 or 20 years time when they are writing about the first day's operation of the Main Committee and the first piece of legislation that comes before us. Another irony in the first day's operation of this. Main Committee is that the Main Committee was established primarily to hasten the flow of legislation through the parliament, particularly the lower House, to get the Senate to speed up the process of government in its part of the legislative process. It is designed to give the opposition a better opportunity to speak, to give more members 'an opportunity to speak, and therefore to give a greater number of Australians, through their representatives, an· opportunity to 'be heard on different legislation that is being passed through the parliament, by transferring the passage of non-contentious items of legislation from the House .of Representatives chamber to this second chamber. Yet, on this first day of operation of this chamber, in the House -f Representatives chamber the guillotine will be enforced all day on different items of legislation that are going through. That is the very mechanism that is at the disposal of the government from time to time the use of which we are trying to overcome by establishing this chamber. So let us hope that in the future it does have the effect of eliminating more often the use of the guillotine on legislation which members of the opposition would like to debate in the main chamber but which today a lot of us are not going to get the opportunity to actually debate.

240,Mr Vaile (Lyne) (11.07 A.m.),"'-On this very historic day in the life of this parliament,Wednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1741 out the bugs in the establishment of this chamber and we get it running, I expect that it will help to overcome that problem. I must congratulate the staff of the Clerk's office on the work that they have done over the last couple of months in getting this chamber, and all the technicalities that go with it, established. Obviously some finetuning changes will need t6 be implemented over the course of time to help smooth out the running of this chamber, but I am sure that it is going to work quite well. We recognise that, as one of the reforms undertaken by this government, it probably is going to be quite a positive move. The main purpose of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill is to amend the three acts which deal with superannuation for Commonwealth parliamentarians. The amendments primarily affect the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, the amendments to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Act 1981, and the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Act 1983. The proposed amendments to the PCS Act allow the superannuation scheme established under it to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act and associated acts and. regulations in relation to vesting and preservation of members' benefits and disclosure of information·to members of the scheme. As well, inequities that exist under the current scheme will be corrected. They relate to former members who hold offices of profit, to invalidity retirement and to transfers between the Commonwealth parliament and state and territory parliaments. There will also be minor amendments to spouse benefits. The SIS legislation provides for the prudent management-'prudent' is a very operative sort of word when we are talking about superannuation of any kind-of certain superannuation funds, particularly with regard to the security of members' moneys, and for certain minimum standards. Although this act provides the capacity for unfunded public sector superannuation schemes to be exempted from these arrangementS, the government has decided that all Commonwealth schemes should comply with the main operative provisions of the SIS legislation, that is, vesting, preservation, and disclosure of information to fund members. There are a couple of very important aspects. The SIS legislation and the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 require that all employees receive a minimuin level of employer sponsored superannuation support. The pension benefits provided under the current scheme to parliamentary retiring allowances, where they are payable to a former member or spouse's annuities where the pension is a revisionary benefit payable to a spouse of a former member, will meet the minimum requirement in all cases. However, the lump sum benefits of persons who do not qualify for a pension will not,· in some cases, meet the minimum requirement. This bill will amend the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act to increase the amounts of lump sums so as to ensure that they comply with the minimum requirements ·of the superannuation guarantee legislation. . There are no provisions under the present scheme which require benefits to be preserved. The SIS legislation requires that certain lump sum benefits be preserved in a superannuation fund or an· approved deposit fund until beneficiaries reach the preservation age, which is currently 55, and retire from the work force, or that they be used to purchase a deferred annuity which cannot be accessed until the preservation age is reached. The pensions paid under the current scheme meet the preservation requirements of the SIS legislation. There are currently no provisions in the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act of 1948 that require disclosure of information to members. This bill proposes to amend the act 1742 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 to require information to be disclosed to members in line with the requirements of the SIS legislation. The Parliamentary· Contributory Superannuation Act currently provides for the reduction of a pension where a beneficiary is a holder of an office of profit. This bil] proposes amendments to the act to provide for the decrease in the amount of pension reduction from $1 to SOc for each dollar earned from an office of profit, and to provide a threshold below which earnings from an office of profit cause no reduction of pension. The PCS Act currently provides for the recognition of periods of service in a state or territory parliament and for the reduction of benefits payable from the present scheme where the beneficiary is a member of a state or territory parliament or is receiving a pension as a result of a such a membership. This bill proposes that the act be amended so that periods of service in a state or territory parliament are recognised in the scheme only to the extent that a transfer value paid from the state or territory scheme to the Commonwealth scheme is used to purchase Commonwealth service. If a transfer value were paid, the state or territory service would be recognised on the payment of a transfer value. It is proposed that benefits paid under the act would continue to be reduced where the beneficiary is a member of a state or territory parliament or currently receives a state or territory pension, but would not be reduced where a new beneficiary of the scheme is also in receipt of a state or territory parliamentary pension. Transitional arrangements will apply to ensure that current members are not disadvantaged. It is impossible to quantify the precise financial impact of the changes in this bill because of the limited application of the amendments in the small parliamentary superannuation scheme. However, the restoration or partial restoration of pensions to certain persons who currently hold an office of profit are estimated to cost about $80,000 in a full year. It is expected that in the longer term these additional costs will be more than offset by savings made by the Commonwealth no longer recognising prior state or territory parliamentary service, at no cost to the state or territory. Therefore, any changes in immediate budgetary outlays or change in long-term cost from the measures in the bill are expected to be relatively insignificant. However, there are two contentious matters that need to be looked at. The first relates to the requirement in section 60 of the SICS) Act that the trustee of the CSS musapprove amendments to the rules of that entity. The CSS Act is part of the rules of the CSS, and therefore compliance with the requirements of section 60 will require the board of the CSS to consent to any proposed amendments to the CSS Act. The explanatory memorandum to the bill states that, as any express provision to that effect will be a restriction on parliament's ability to amend its own legislation, no action has been taken to provide for making the consent of the CSS board a condition for amending the CSS Act. This may be construed as creating a further exception to section 60 of the SICS) Act. In the case of the PSS, the bill introduces a provision that the minister may not amend the trust deed without the consent of the PSS board. Such amendment can only be made by the minister by signed instrument, which is a disallowable instrument. If parliament intends that only the CSS should be exempt from complying with the provisions of section 60 of the SICS) Act, it should provide for this exception specifically in an amendment to the CSS Act or in regulations under section 60 of the SICS) Act. A mere statement in the memorandum that it is not proposed to take any action to provide for obtaining the consent of the CSS board to Wednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1743 proposed amendments to the CSS Act may not be adequate to exempt the CSS from complying with the provisions of section 60. The second contentious point relates to the lack of discretion in the trustees to change the investment manager should that step be considered necessary by the CSS board, and the PSS board, as is in the CFM legislation, to be the sole investment manager until 30 June 1995. The removal of this key discretion, which is essential for the prudential management of the funds of a superannuation entity, would be contrary to the provisions of section· 59 of the SI(S) Act. As the legislative provisions in the CSS Act and the PSS Act existed prior to the enactment of the SIS legislation, which introduced an entirely new legislative regime for the prudential management of the superannuation industry, the view may be taken that any exception to the key provision of section 60 of the SI(S) Act should be found in that act or regulations made thereunder. This is a fairly pertinent point to wind up on. The key element and the key concern as far as superannuation generally in Australia is concerned is of prudential management. We have seen a number of areas where this has not existed. I suppose it would be fair enough to say that the honourable members speaking on this bill today would expect prudential management to be at a premium and at a very professional level for the Commonwealth scheme. A major concern being expressed by a lot of people right across the industry, particularly in the private sector, is how their funds are being managed, how the superannuation industry is being managed, how it is conducting its business and how it is looking after the funds of its members. I think there needs to be far more attention paid to ongoing changes to legislation and an ongoing review of the system so that we can get far greater accountability, flexibility and transparency within the superannuation industry. As far as superannuation is concerned, the government is going in the direction that it ultimately wants to replace the current pension and social security system. It is terribly important to try to get people to provide for their own retirement, which at the moment is quite difficult. The private sector has been experiencing a lot of difficulties with the government legislation that relates to private sector superannuation schemes, particularly through the superannuation guarantee levy and the charge that comes as a result of that. Those difficulties are partially because of the concerns of employers about affording it. Employers are concerned about the implications Of the extra costs and the paperwork that they will have to go through. They will have to deal with the taxation office in this regard. Employers have had the opportunity on a number of occasions since the superannuation guarantee levy came into force in August last year to have representatives from the tax office in Newcastle, in my electorate, to try to explain it. Some employers did not anticipate the possibility of this charge. It was quite awesome to a lot of employers. Therefore, rather than getting caught in What they saw as another lot of bureaucratic and government red tape-and a further trap-they did not gqahead and extend their employment. They structured the people that they had employed in such a way that they were able to keep themselves below the superannuation guarantee levy threshold. Therefore, it had a counterproductive outcome in the community and that is something the government needs to address. We heard the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Reid) referring to the possibility of people who have been contributing to superannuation funds having access to those funds for housing, but that did not eventuate. That caused a great deal of concern and heartache within the community. A lot of people were relying on that. It would have saved them getting caught by higher interest rates for housing, because they would have been able to buy a house with 1744 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 funds that they had put aside for themselves. A lot of people do not have access to private sector finance through the banks or anywhere else. However, that did not eventuate and I am sure the government is certainly aware of the upset that has caused in the community. It will be interesting to see the result and recominendations from the Senate inquiry that is taking place at the moment. My electorate covers a number of coastal resorts and areas where there is a lot of part-time employment. People work through the holiday periods in tourist resorts and tourist attractions, and their employers pay ridiculously small amounts into the scheme, which are never seen again. That brings us back to the aspect of the accountability and transparency of these funds. This money is only going to get gobbled up by the administration costs of these superannuation schemes. I have had numerous representations from employers who have shown me foolscap pages covered with the small amounts that they have contributed on behalf of people who have worked on a part-time basis in their operations. These people will never see that money again. It is not going to help them in· their retirement. It is not going to help alleviate any financial impact on future governments: all it is doing is filling the pockets of the superannuation fund managers. I know the government is in the process of addressing this problem but I believe it has been too slow in addressing it. With respect to the public sector, I was interested to note some of the figures that the honourable member for Curtin( Mr Rocher) used in his address on this bill in relation to the unfunded liabilities of a couple of our state governments. That must be of great concern to the taxpayers in those states. A key element in budgetary strategies, when I was involved in local government, was to make sure that our employee entitlement reserves were always substantially cash funded. We have seen the diminution over the years of these funds at all levels of government throughout Australia. It must be of great concern where there is a heavy call on some of these state funds. The honourable member for Curtin used the example of the unfunded liability in Victoria, which is about $18 billion, and in New South.Wales, where it is $13.9 billion. We come back to the aspect that we have been discussing this morning of the prudential management of these funds. There is a big nest egg there and the temptation is very great for government to use those in a less than prudential manner as far. as the fund members are concerned. In days gone by, people would invest in something associated with the government or subscribe to something supervised by the government and there was a reasonable expectation that it would be there the day people wanted to call on it. There was a reasonable expectation that it would be managed properly. Unfortunately, in recent times there has been an element of doubt cast across that aspect for people who contribute to these funds. In closing, I would urge the government that, in all future considerations with superannuation, both private and public, it focus on that aspect of prudential management because, from here on in, these funds are going to carry enormous amounts of money. Without that sort of accountability there is a real risk of less than professional management, and the only people it will disadvantage will be the members of the· funds. .

241,Motion (By Mr Lavarch),"by leave-agreed to:Wednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 1745 Consideration resumed from 24 March. Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. This bill proposes a number of amendments to improve the operation of the Corporations Law and to facilitate the operations of the Australian Securities Commission, ASC, and the Corporations and Securities Panel, the panel. . I foreshadowed this legislation last year in introducing the Corporate Law Reform Bill 1993. At that time, and in the debate on that bill earlier this year, I also referred to the major long term process I had established to simplify the Corporations Law. While I am pleased to report that good progress is being made with simplification, that process will take time. In the meantime, the current law governs the corporate sector and some reforms must continue to keep that law in tune with the rapidly changing commercial environment. When deficiencies are revealed, they need to be rectified. When new products, services and structures challenge the boundaries of the law, those boundaries need to be moved. That is why this bill is being brought forward at this time. These amendments cannot wait for their turn in the queue for simplification. As is the usual practice in relation to corporate legislation, this bill, or more accurately, most of this bill, was released for public comment in December 1993. The period of public exposure ended on 28 February 1994 and public submissions made during that period have been taken into account in finalising the bill for introduction; I have qualified my comment on the extent of the bill's public exposure as there is one important proposal that was not, in fact, included in the exposure draft of the bill, but which has arisen subsequently and has been included in the bill prior to its introduction. The proposal in question is that to refine the law governing clients' segregated accounts maintained by futures brokers. There is also a second proposal in the bill, as introduced,. that did not appear in the exposure draft of the bill-namely, the proposal to enable trading on stock and future markets of new products which do not fall squarely within the current definitions of 'securities' or 'futures contract'. However, I wish to inform the Committee that the government will not be proceeding witl). this proposal at this time. The amendments to the definitions of 'securities' and 'futures contract' were intended to enable trading on stock and futures markets of certain new hybrid products. In particular, they were intended to facilitate the trading of a new product by the Australian Stock Exchange from 1 July 1994. I have now been informed that the exchange will not be ready to trade this product until later in the year. In light of that I consider that it is preferable that the amendments have further exposure. The government will be moving an amendment during debate on the bill to delete those amendments. To facilitate the public exposure process I have asked my department, as a .matter of priority, to develop the proposed regulations that would govern the trading of these new products. I",154,Representatives Main Commitiee
242,Mr Lavarch (Dickson,"Attorney-General) (11.28 a.m.)-I move:1746 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 consider that this will clarify the situation and provide adequate infonnation fora more detailed consideration of the policy underlying the proposed amendments. I intend, at this stage, to introduce a separate bill containing the amendments following that exposure period. I will now mention a few of the most important amendments proposed by the bill. One of the most important reforms is the conferral of civil jurisdiction on lower courts-such as magistrates courts and district courts-to hear small civil claims arising under the Corporations Law. This proposal has been developed in response to concerns from the business community and the legal profession· about court judgments over the last year which. have held that civil jurisdiction under the Corporations Law is confined to superior courts, that is, the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Supreme Court in each state and territory. Concern has been expressed that legitimate civil actions will not be able to be brought under the Corporations Law becaUse of the cost and delay involved in bringing actions before the superior courts. For very small claims, it will often be that the cost of the filing fees alone would prevent the commencement of civil proceedings in a superior court. This government is cOfllmitted to the principle that justice should be available to the community at an affordable cost and with the prospect of a speedy resolution. It is for this reason that it has moved to amend the corporations legislation to confer civil jurisdiction on lower courts in regard to those civil actions under the Corporations Law which are in the nature of debt recovery,· monetary compensation or minor administrative remedies. The legislative framework for the national scheme of corporate regulation means that effective jurisdiction·can only be conferred on lower courts if complementary amendments are made by state and Northern Territory governments to·the corporations acts of the respective jurisdictions. The Ministerial Council for Corporations has already agreed that the necessary amendments should be made as soon as possible and I anticipate that a uniform date can be set for the operation of these amendments in each jurisdiction in Australia. These amendments are expected to receive widespread support from the business community, given that they will reduce the cost and delays associated with bringing small civil actions under the Corporations Law. It is important that these reforms be implemented as soon as possible. The bill also proposes a number of amendments to support the introduction of the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System-commonly known as 'CHESS'-to be introduced by the Australian Stock Exchange. CHESS will bring the settlement procedures of the Stock Exchange to world best standards. The aim of CHESS is to have transactions settled and delivered within three days after trade and to replace the current paper document of transfer with electronic transfer. The basic legislative framework for CHESS was established by the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992. Since the passage of that act, and in progressing the CHESS project to its final stages of development, the Stock Exchange has sought a number of additional amendments to the legislative framework. These amendments are basically refinements of the existing legislative scheme. They are essential to the smooth operation of CHESS. They deal with such matters as the c-ncellation of certificates by brokers; .electronic acceptances; off-market transfers before official quotation; and establishment of record dates to determine entitlement to vote and receipt of dividends and other benefits. The Stock Exchange presently envisages Wednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1747 that CHESS will commence operation on 1 July this year. In view of this imminent start-up date, it is important that these amendments proceed as a matter or urgency. Another important set of amendments proposed by the bill' is 'the provisions dealing with the application of the Corporations Law to non-bank financial institutions, the collective term for such bodies as building societies and credit unions. The enactment of the. uniform financial institutions code by the states and territories in 1992 has highlighted the uneven and inconsistent application of Corporations Law and state and territory legislation to the activities of financial institutions. The resolution ()fthe interface between the Corporations Law and state and territory legislation was a matter left for future consideration at the, time the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory entered into the heads of agreement on future corporate regulation in June 1990. This has resulted in doubts and uncertainties for financial institutions as to which law applies to their activities, as well as a degree of regulatory and administrative duplication. Last year, the Ministerial Council for Corporations and the Ministerial Council for Financial Institutions agreed to principles on which the interface between the two bodies of law could be rationalised. A key' aspect of this resolution was agreement that the fundraising activities of financial institutions, in their state of incorporation or elsewhere, should be governed by the Corporations Law. This reflects the Commonwealth's policy that tl-ere is a significant public benefit in there being a single regulator and uniform regulation of public, fundraising in' Australia. In other areas, such as the duties of officers and charges over, the property of financial institutions, the Corporations Law will bedisplaced by the financial institutions code as that is considered a more approprIate form of reg\llation for these bodies in those l,lI'eas. In addition, the registration 9f financial institutions under the Corporations Law as registrable Australian bodies will no longer be required. These amendments, together with complementary amendments to state and territory financial institutions legislation, will not only reduce regulatory duplication and clarify which law applies to particular areas of activity, but will also promote investor protection and confidence. The certainty that these amendments will bring to this area of the law is also urgently needed. Special mention should be made of the proposed amendments' to the operations of the CorporationS and Securities Panel. The panel was established as a peer review group, a body to examine conduct in takeover matters referred to it for review by the ASC. In particular, it was empowered to make declarations of unacceptable conduct and acquisitions in respect of a takeover and to make orders to remedy such conduct. The panel's legislative charter was to conduct hearings with as little formality and technicality and with as much expedition as possible. However, the very first matter to come before the panel bogged down in legal argument over its procedures; Following consideration of this case, the government has decided that the panel should be restructured to remove the procedural difficulties that this first case disclosed. The bill provides for the extension of the jurisdiction of the panel to takeover conduct generally, and specifies with greater precision what constitutes procedural fairness for the purpose of the panel's inquiries. Procedural fairness does not require that the panel behave like a court. Likewise, cross-examination of parties and witnesses is not a requirement of procedural fairness. The emphasis will, instead,be on written submissions by parties and strict time limits for submissions. After examining those submissions, the panel will decide whether a conference or oral inquiry is necessary. 1748 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 Given that the panel's deliberations do not generally relate toteehnicallegaI matters, rather to matters of market behaviour and market standards, it is more appropriate that the parties rather than their legal advisers address the panel. The legal advisers may, of course, be present to assist but will. not be entitled to address the paneL This is the approach that has been successfully adopted in predetermination conferences by the Trade Practices Commission and it should be equally successful here. .' The amendments also provide for regulations to set out in a comprehensive form the procedures for the conduct of the panel's inquiries. Draft regulations have been released for public comment and the government intends to have the regulations in place at the same time these provisions come into force. The bill will also provide for the establishment of retail screen based trading markets for collective investment schemes which are not listed on a stock exchange. The establishment of such retail markets is asignificant development in Australia. Investors are currently reliant on the liquidity of scheme assets and the ability of the manager of a collective investment scheme to buy back the investment. The measures proposed by the bill will greatly enhance the liquidity of such investments. As with stock markets, approved security organisations and exempt stock markets, the establishment of any such market will require the approval of the Attorney-General. Each market will be operated in accordance with business rules, relevant agreements contemplated by those rules, and any conditions which are imposed on special market approval. The powers of the ASC to supervise the special m-rkets will be similar to those which it currently exercises in relation to the stock market ora securities exchange. The business rules will also require the appointment of an independent and appropriately qualified person to monitor compliance with the. business rules and to report a contravention of those rules to the ASC. . I now return to the first of the two amendments which, as I have already mentioned, were not included in the public exposure draft of the bill: that is the proposal to refine the law governing clients' segregated accounts. The segregation of client moneys from that of brokers is a fundamental investor 'protection rule of the futures industry. Thus, the Corporations Law requires that a broker maintain a client segregated account into whiCh client funds are placed, and permits the withdrawal of funds from that account only in certain circumstances. Funds held in this way are immune from claims by creditors of the broker. However, changes to the way the futures industry operates have highlighted the need· for some refinement of the detail of the law governing such accounts, so. that it keeps abreast of developments in the. industry. In particular, the bill recognises that in a futures transaction involving a chain of intermediaries, moneys can be identjfied as client moneys and continue to be ,treated as such. The result will be that client moneys involved in such transactions will enjoy the full protection afforded by the Corporations Law. Among other reforms proposed by the bill are the introduction of a modified regime for the notification of persons .affected by ASC decisions of their rights of review under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act of 1975; the introduction into the Corporations Law and the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 of the penalty unit system for the prescription of penalties; and the transfer of unclaimed money functions of the Attorney-General under the Corporations Law to the ASC. A complete list of the reforms proposed by the:bill is set out at the start of the explanatory memorandum. Wednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMI'ITEE 1749 The bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on government or business, as the.majority of the proposed amendments clarify existing provisions of the Corporations Law and will not result in additional costs.' The explanatory memorandum details the extent of the potential impact on business. Finally, I return briefly to the simplification program. It is now seven months since the task force first met. The task force consists of four experts, two of whom work in the private sector. It is responsible for developing proposals and draft legislation. A private sector consultative group has also been established to provide expert advice and assistance to the task force. This group consists of representatives of large and small users of the law. In December, the task force released a plan of action which outlined how it proposed to go about the overall project. That plan of action identified. seven initial priority areas where early practical gains for business are possible. They include streamlining the corporate structure for small business, facilitating share buybacks, rationalising annual reporting requirements and reducing the burden of maintaining company registers. The aim is for simplification to occur in manageable stages. so that the benefits can be achieved as quickly as possible. The task force's first simplification proposal, concerning share buybacks, was released in early March of this year. The law in this area is extremely complex, burdensome and expensive to comply with. Its cumbersome nature and complexity deters companies from using the provisions. The task force's proposal on buybacks involves an emphasis on the basics. The aim is to discard the excessive detail and technicalities in the current law. By the end of the consultation process we will have developed provisions that companies can actually use, consistent with the need for adequate safeguards for shareholders and creditors. The same principles for simplification apply to small business structures. Our smallest companies are currently regulated under a scheme primarily designed to supervise our largest companies. Clearly, this not only makes life difficult for small companies but in many situations is simply illogical. A proposal to simplify the proprietary company structure to ease the burdens for existing and new small businesses was released for public comment also in March. The twin emphasis on clarity and elimination of unnecessary paperwork continues in the task force's proposal, released at the end of April, to do away with many of the requirements for company register keeping. Where adequate information for investors and creditors is readily available through the Australian Stock Exchange or through access to the ASC database, unnecessary requirements to maintain registers can be removed. In other cases the information held is unnecessary. The proposal would make the remaining obligations easier to use by bringing them together in the law, streamlining the requirements and making them more uniform. The latest task force proposal was released in May and deals with annual returns and financial reporting to shareholders. Under the proposal, the annual return would be streamlined by reducing the number of items of information it contains by around 75 per cent. In addition, companies which are required to prepare annual accounts would have the option of sending concise financial reports to shareholders. This would have the dual benefit of cost savings for companies aneasier-to-read financial reports for shareholders. The task force is working towards a first draft bill for public exposure about mid-year-I think early August is the latest date-but the process will not be rushed. In particular, the task force is determined to consult widely on its proposals before it drafts the legislation. This will provide an essential opportunity for business and other user groups to influence the basic 1750 MAIN COMMIITEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 policy as it is being developed. The first simplification bill would deal with buybacks, proprietary companies and company registers. In conclusion, I confirm that, in accordance with the heads of agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the ministerial council on corporations has been consulted and, to the extent necessary, has given approval for the introduction of the bill into the parliament. In particular, the amendments proposed by schedule 3 of the bill, rationalising the interface between the CorporationS Law and state and territory financial institutions legislation, has received the unanimous agreement of the council. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the bill to the committee. explanatory memorandum. Does the Attorney-General want to present that now or when he moves the amendments? certainly present that. principles to be applied in choosing whether bills come before this Main Committee or come before the House may needsome refining. This bill makes amendments to corporations legislation in a number of non-related areas. The explanatory memorandum states that the amendments are necessary in advance of the finalisation of the program to simplify the Corporations Law, which will 'take some little time to produce results'. The coalition. does not oppose most of the measures in the bill. Those measures tidy up pockets of difficulty and facilitate desirable reforms. The coalition does,however, oppose an aspect of the provisions of the bill relating to procedural changes to the Corporations and Securities Panel. In ow:. view, it is unacceptable that the government is seeking to prohibit legal and other representatives of the parties from addressing the panel. 1 propose to move an amendment that will entitle a person who appears at the inquiry to have another person address the panel on his or her behalf. The bill in its current form provides that the rules of natural justice are not applicable to the panel. It was the government's intention to provide for procedures before the panel to be dealt with by regulation. To· accommodate coalition objections, the government has agreed to proposed amendments to recast the provisions. I will deal with the Corporations and Securities Panel provisions and the unopposed provisions of the bill in a moment. I would like first, however, to comment on the provisions of the bill which sought to alter the definitions of 'securities' and 'futures contract', which the Atto!1ley-General( Mr Lavarch) has indicated will be withdrawn. I welcome the government's deCision to withdraw the amendments. As the Attorney has mentioned, those amendments were slipped into the bill after an exposure draft had been circulated. Given the potential ramifications of the amendments, this was somewhat surprising. Part of the reaction against the amendments has resulted simply from the. limited time for adequate consideration; together with the lack of any initiation by the government of consultation with those concerned. It appears that the only industry body consulted by the government was the Australian Stock Exchange. After the amendments came to light when this bill was introduced, considerable concern was expressed by both industry and commentators as to the scope of· the amendments. The amendments would have given the government extensive powers to vary the definitions of 'securities' and 'futures contracts' by regulation, and without any necessity for industry or public consultation. The practical effect would have been that the government could direct that",155,Representatives Main Committee

This would mean that the safeguards of chapter 8 of the Corporations Law which apply to futures would not apply to the affected instruments, but the different provisions of chapter 7 relating to securities would apply-and vice versa. The coalition accepts that there is a need for some flexibility to allow the Stock Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange to conduct markets in new products and to maintain an ability to compete with overseas exchanges. Any arrangement proposed for exchange-traded products should not have adverse consequences for over-the-counter derivatives; and any interim measure must be compatible with long-term reform presently under study by CASAC, the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. The amendments which were proposed by the government go much further than is necessary or appropriate, and I am therefore pleased that the amendments have been withdrawn. In his second reading speech the Attorney was a little more specific in relation to the purpose of the proposed amendments. He stated that the amendments were to facilitate the trading of a new product by the ASX from 1 July 1994. The exchange will apparently not now be ready to. trade the products until the end of the year. The Attorney has also stated that his department will develop the regulations that will govern the trading of the new products. I welcome that opportunity for greater consideration. The current concerns, however, will not be addressed simply by the government preparing in advance for scrutiny the regulations it intends to adopt to facilitate the trading of a particular product by the ASX. As amendments should be designed to facilitate flexibility in the interim, they should be limited in scope and they should be discrete. In the absence of a wider review of derivatives regulation, there may be significant difficulties with changes that widely delegate to the executive the power to regulate derivatives, no matter how strenuous the assurances that they would be exercised sparingly. I note the announcement that the ASX is drafting new business rules to cover the trading of derivative products. This move has been made in anticipation of the reintroduction of provisions which are to be withdrawn. While suitably drafted business rules provide a step in the right direction, in my view it is very important to ensure that the developments in general do not hijack the benefits of a broader approach to the regulation of derivatiyes. I will now deal with the coalition's objections to the provisions of the bill that deny the right of a person or body appearing before the Corporations and Securities Panel to have any other person address the panel on his. or her or its behalf. I will also refer to a more general uneasiness I have with the thrust of the reforms in relation to the panel. To understand the coalition's objections it is necessary to examine the nature of the panel and the impetus for these amendments. The panel came into operation at the beginning of 1991 upon the introduction of the Corporations Law. The role of the panel' was to examine the acceptability of takeover conduct by reference to the so-called Eggleston Principles which are set out in section 732 of the Corporations Law. The panel was required to conduct a hearing with the power to make enforceable orders it considered necessary or desirable to protect the rights or interests of persons in a takeover. The panel was established because the National Companies and Securities Commission, which previously examined such behaviour, risked being perceived as investigator, prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner. The establishment of the panel was also in part a move to bring peer review into the difficult area of acceptable behaviour and market integrity. 1752 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 The members of the panel were chosen for their business, financial, legal and other experience relevant to takeovers. The panel has had one matter referred to it which concerned a reverse takeover of Titan Hills Australia Ltd by Precision Data Holdings Ltd. That hearing and determination process was criticised as being cumbersome and overly legalistic. Additional criticisms were that the jurisdiction of the panel was und-ly narrow and that the panel was unable to enforce undertakings given by parties. The amendments contained in this bill are in part an attempt to render the panel procedures as informal and expeditious as possible. This bill has addressed those concerns. My core difficulty is that the amendments pull in opposite directions. On the one hand they emphasise the peer review nature of the hearings by freeing up legalistic procedures. On the other they expand the court-like powers of the panel. The current power to make enforceable determinations is expanded by the power given by the bill for the enforcement of undertakings. There is a contradiction, in my view. It is not appropriate in the black-letter law world of Australian takeover regulation to create an informal peer review body that has the power to make binding determinations which materially affect rights and interests. While it is true that the panel will not be considering technical legal issues but market behaviour and standards, the background to any inquiry is the takeover law, which is highly technical. An appreciation of the takeovers background will be vitally important in making any determination. Regulation through black-letter law and by peer review may well be desirable but the panel should exhibit the characteristics of one approach or the other but not both. In this regard I note with interest a report of an interview with Mr Tony Hartnell in the journal Company Director in December 1992. Mr Hartnell was asked about peer review in corporate governance. He stated: The idea of peer review. is to take the debate, the exposure to corporate conduct, much wider than the narrowness of the black-letter law, and debate precise situations, not general formulations. This would be done within a body that was set up as a peer review body, with no powers to punish anyone. But it would have powers to publish its views at the end of their examinations. And continuing the quote: An ideal vehicle for the development of this vision could be the Corporations and Securities Panel. That relatively inactive body presently has a quasi-law enforcement role within the confines of a strict legal process with a black-letter jurisdiction. However, this body has always been conceived of, in policy terms, as a peer body ; .. No more ideal body of persons exists in Australia with relevant qualifications for peer review of corporate conduct. In fact, my perception is that the body, as presently staffed, is more suited to the peer review function than the quasi-judicial process it currently possesses. The present amendments confuse even more the role of the panel. It is in this context that the coalition cannot accept the proposed ban on advisers addressing the panel. The bill excludes advisers-legal, financial or otherwise-from representing persons appearing before the panel by addressing the panel. Advisers will beable to be present to assist their client but may not address the panel. Given the power of the panel to directly affect parties' rights and interests and the complex black-letter law background, this is unacceptable. In that context, it cannot be said that the presence of legal and other advisers will impede its work. The ability of legal and other advisers, who might include stockbrokers, financial analysts, merchant bankers and others, to make comments may well result in distillation of the complex issues involved and, in fact, serve to expedite the process. Wednesday,S June 1994 MAIN COMMIITEE 1753 Further, given that the adviser may be present but cannot speak; there will be the ridiculous situation of advisers whispering to their clients what they should be saying, or presenting written submissions and comments for their clients to recite. I cannot support the relaxing of the judicial type procedures in a situation where the panel has the power directly to affect interests by means of coercive powers. If the government were to propose the establishment of a body of the type envisaged by Mr Hartnell, that would be an entirely different matter and it would be considered in a positive context by the coalition. The amendment that I foreshadow moving would omit the proposed subsection 194(4) and substitute a subsection in these terms: 'A person who appears at an inquiry is entitled to have another person present· to assist the person, and a"" person who so assists is entitled to address the panel.' I wish to comment further on the provisions relating to the applicability of the rules of natural justice. Although those· provisions are not opposed by the coalition, I am distinctly uneasy about the way they have been formulated. The bill currently specifically provides that the rules of natural justice do not apply in relation to an inquiry. The government has indicated that it was its intention that the rules would be replaced in a streamlined form by regulation. As a result of opposition pressure, the government proposes to recast the provision to provide: It is intended that this division and the regulations will set out procedural requirements that equate to the rules of natural justice. In my view, there is little substantive change effected by that amendment. It is, in my view, unsatisfactory and it should not be regarded as a precedent for any other situation. Before cormilenting further, I will provide a little background. Natural justice is a common law doctrine which safeguards the rights of persons who may be affected by an administrative or quasi-judicial decision to procedural fairness in the making of the decision. Examples of the rules of natural justice are that the person whose rights are affected has the right to be heard and that the decision maker should not be biased. The courts have clearly established that rules· vary from· one situation to another. That flexibility in itself causes me to wonder whether this amendment is required. If an expedited determination is inherently necessary for the process to be effective, as it is in this case, a coun would take that into account in determining that more streamlined procedures were appropriate and met the standards of procedural fairness .. In any event, the government has stated that the content of the rules of natural justice is to be expressly set out in regulations and will facilitate quick commercial decisions. Prior to the coalition making clear its objections, we had no idea what the regulations would look like. There was no guarantee that the regulations would be promulgated before the relevant provisions of the bill entered into force. That was entirely unsatisfactory. The government has now seen fit to provide draft regulations. However, the regulations are extensive. and the time within which they were provided has not allowed for a detailed study or any consultation. The provision of the regulations does provide some measure of improvement, however; but I must say that it is my personal view that, if the rules of natural justice are eradicated or replaced, at the very least the principal substitute rules should be set out in primary legislation in the enactment that abolishes the rules that would otherwise apply. The coalition, however, is not taking that point in this case. 1754 MAIN COMMfITEE Wednesday,S June 1994 I should note that my views in relation to both representation and natural justice have been echoed by the Senate Standing· Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills; The committee has expressed the view that the proposals maybe considered to breach the committee's principles in that they trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, and that they delegate legislative powers inappropriately. I simply repeat that, while it is not opposed, the technique of substituting a statement such as that in the proposed subsection 195(3) is unsatisfactory and should not be regarded as a model. But the coalition will move an amendment to substitute a subsection 194(4) to deal with representation. I now turn to some of the less contentious areas of Corporations Law to be amended by this bill. The bill makes it clear that the lower courts have jurisdiction to hear certain claims under the Corporations Law. It is presently unclear whether lower courts such as district and county courts and magistrates courts have such jurisdiction. The inability to bring action in lower courts may have the practical effect of discouraging parties with legitimate but comparatively small civil claims from bringing action. This is due to the comparative cost of bringing action in superior courts. . The difficulties are compounded by a superior court reluctance to consider minor claims. The bill confers, on lower courts in each state and territory, civil jurisdiction in respect to corporate law claims relating to debt recovery or monetary compensation. Jurisdiction is not to be granted to lower courts where high-level discretionary powers are involved. The amendments are welcome and, although he has now been replaced in the chair by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Fitzgibbon), I know that the previous Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Truss), has a personal interest in seeing these amendments through. The bill makes changes to the clearing house electronic subregister system commonly known as CHESS. The Corporate Law Reform Act 1992 provided a legislative framework for the electronic settlement of transactions on the ASX. It allowed for the creation of CHESS, which aims to have transactions settled and delivered within three days after trade and to replace the current paper document of transfer with electronic transfer. The bill makes further technical amendments to facilitate the introduction of CHESS. Those provisions are not opposed by the coalition. The bill implements a decision of the ministerial councils for corporations and for financial institutions to· rationalise application of the Corporations Law and of state legislation to' financial institutions-principally, building 'societies and credit unions. At present, intrastate activities of credit unions are governed by state legislation, and interstate activities are governed by the Corporations Law; In broad terms the amendments are unobjectionable. However, commentators have made a number of specific criticisms that should be noted: The bill removes charges over the property of financial institutions from. the registration scheme of Corporations Law, part 3.5. That is to say, charges are to be regulated only under financial institutions legislation. This worsens the fragmelltation of the personal property security registration systems in Australia. The Australian Law Reform Commission, in its report No. 64 in 1993, commended a move to simplify registration and searching using the register under part 3.5 as the base for a national scheme. While it seems that the ministerial councils did not agree on a centralised register, it seems unfortunate that fragmentation becomes more entrenched as a result of these amendments. One Wednesday; 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1755 practical question that I ask· is whether there will be a transfer of charges over financial institution property registered Under the Corporations Law to the state registers. If not, dual searches will need to be undertaken. This will be cumbersome, time consuming and costly. The assertion in the financial impact statement that the bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on business has been challenged by a commentator as ludicrous. Under the· bill, the fundi'aising provisionS of the Corporations Law will apply to financial institutionS with certain exceptions. The view is expressed that it will be costly for financial institutions to comply with the complex and uncertain prospectus provisions for fundraising activities. It is doubted whether this will be offset by the elimination of duplication. The section of this bill implementing these amendments contains a table to help in determining which provisions of the Corporations Law apply to financial institutions. While the inclusion of the table provides a useful tool to those seeking to understand the legislation, it does exemplify the ever growing complexity of the Corporations Law. The bill modifies the way in Which the ASC must provide notice to persons affected by its decisions to facilitate appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 requires a person who makes a reviewable decision to take all reasonable steps to give any person.whose interests are affected by the decision notice of the making of the decision and. the right to have the decision reviewed. This creates significant practical difficulties for the ASC. In many instances it is difficult to identify all those affected by broad-ranging decisions. . The Administrative Review Council, in conjunction with the ASC and the Attorney-General's Department, has examined all categories of decisions of the ASC to determine the extent to which exemption from the notification of the making of the decisions and the review rights may be justified. The bill legislatively implements that review. It should be noted that the bill enacts in primary legislation a regulatory scheme which has been in operation since 11 December 1993. The categories of decisions excluded from the standard AAT Act requirements are subject to a modified regime for notification of persons affected by such decisions of their rights of review under the AAT Act. The changes appear to balance sensibly the need for notice to be given to those affected by decisions against the administrative difficulties in giving notice. In implementation of the scheme it would be desirable if the ASC were to issue policy statements listing the sorts of persons to whom it would be likely not to give notice. That would enable representations to be·made by interested parties at the exposure draft stage, enabling the ASC's final determination to be improved. The bill allows companies limited by shares to convert to no liability status. At present, a no liability company can convert toa limited liability company, but there is no procedure for conversion in the other direction. No liability companies are generally mining companies. The no liability status allows the company to offer shares at a discount without a requirement to obtain court approval for the offer. This makes investment more attractive. The amendments address a legislative irregularity which has created difficulties for the mining industry and are not opposed by the coalitibn. I have a personal interest in the amendment in that I was involved in relatively fruitless litigation in a former life as counsel on the very question which is now being dealt with. It was a matter that came before several courts on several occasions in recent years. ' The bill provides for the establishment of stock markets in unquoted prescribed interests on which the interests may be traded by means of an electronic trading facility. Any market will 1756 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 be required to be approved by the minister. The bill, supplemented by regulations, is said to provide the necessary basis for the supervision by the ASC of any such approved market. The ASX has submitted that the amendments do not provide a sufficient framewotk for the provision of an efficient market and for ensuring that the interests of the public-principally, the smaller investor to whom this type of market·is· directed-are safeguarded. The ASX is concerned that the legislation itself provides no minimum standards. Particularly, it is concerned that the protections in sections 774 to 779 are not necessarily applicable to stock markets and unquoted prescribed interests. The ASX also has doubts about the proposed structure of the management company providing a market, surveillance work being contracted out to a supervisor, and participants in the market not necessarily being members of the management company. The exchange asks whether the proposed structure is capable of providing a comparable level of regulation and compliance. In the absence of other criticism of the framework, I am willing to accept for the present-at least until demonstrable evidence proves to the contrary-the proposed mechanism for screen. based training systems. I do, however, find it troubling that the legislative skeleton has no flesh whatsoever. No minimum standards are detailed in the legislation. They ardeft forinclusion in regulations, or to be determined on a case by case basis as applications to· the minister are made for approval of relevant stock markets. There needs to be application of consistent standards. As the ASX points out, providing for substantive matters to be dealt with by way of regulation is undesirable, as it reduces opportunity for scrutiny and comment. The delegation of substantive policy making from the legislature to the executive has been a troubling theme in this bill. It has been most seriously evident in the provisions dealing with the definition of 'securities' and future definitions of 'securities' and 'futures contracts'. Thankfully, they are to be withdrawn. Had they come into effect they would have given to the executive government inappropriately wide policy making power. So too is the attempt to replace rules of natural justice with regulatory replacement. Laws affecting fundamental rights of citizens should not be made outside a parliament.

As is the custom today, by way of indulgence, can I congratulate you and the clerk on the establishment of this second chamber.

My suggestion is that, as within this building we are broadcast on chanrie1 5, it would be convenient for viewers if the remaining time that a member had to speak was indicated on that channel, so that one would have a very good appreciation as to how much longer one had either to admire or to endure.

248,Mr Duffy,"Behave yourself, Tim. There are procedures.Wednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1757 there are a range of issues which arise from this bill, but I would firstly make some general points. As is the custom with corporations legislation, this bill has, in a sense, done the rounds by way of the public comment process. In the COlU'Se of the exposure draft, comments have been received in the usual way from a range of interested parties: the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the Australian Securities Commission, the Credit Union Services Corporation, the Australian Institute of Credit Management, the Attorney-General's Department, the Law Institute of Victoria and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. So in this area,. Mr Deputy Speaker, we very much are dealing in an area for the technical aficionado where the public comment process is very important, but where the genera) policy which applies is also important. I support a range of amendments to the Corporations Law in the bill. There is one which is in the original bill, which the Attorney-General has indicated he proposes to withdraw. That relates to the definition of 'securities' and 'futures contract'. I agree with the sensible decision of the Attorney-General to withdraw and proceed with that on a later occasion. A third amendment in respect of the Corporations and Securities Pane) has been the subject of some discussion and is the subject of two amendments, one in the name of the Attorney-General and one in the name of the honourable member for Tangney( Mr Williams). It is my view that the amendment in the name of the Attorney-General ought to satisfy those reservations which have been raised by the honourable member for Tangney. I make the general point that the Attorney-General, in his second reading speech, referred to the simplification process. That is a process which I know is supported by members on both sides and is certainly supported by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities, of which I am fortunate enough to be chair. I think it is important to make the point, which the Attorney-General did in his second reading speech, where he said: While I am pleased to report that good progress is being made with simplification, that process will take time. In the meantime, the current law governs the corporate sector and some reform must continue to keep that law in tune with the rapidly changing commercial environment. When deficiencies are revealed they need to be rectified. So the simplification process goes on, and the Attorney is to be complimented for that, but life goes on as· well and we need to consider these amendments. I will start in the reverse order to the honourable member for Tangney and deal with some of the range of amendments before coming to those which have been more contentious. The first one to which I draw attention is the proposal to extend the civil jurisdiction under the Corporations Law to lower courts in areas of debt recovery and monetary compensation. I think this is adequately described in paragraph 7 of the explanatory memorandum, where it states: The court jurisdiction amendments will facilitate business, to the extent that those businesses with legitimate civil claims under .the Corporations Law will be able to bring those actions in any lower court in Australia if the Claim is within the court's usual monetary limits, without worrying about technical jurisdictional issues such as where the cause of action originated or the State of Territory jurisdiction in which the defendant company was registered. There are two important policy points here. One is the general access to justice, which relates to the cost of bringing actions in superior courts. The second is that this is effectively an extension of the cross-vesting jurisdictional arrangements. I again draw attention to the Attorney-General's second reading speech. He summarised very succinctly the access to justice point when he said:",166,Representatives Main Committee
249,Mr Stephen Smith,"We are being very civilised in this chamber. Mr Deputy Speaker,1758 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 This government is committed to the principle that justice should be available to the community at an affordable cost and with the prospect of a speedy resolution. That is the principle behind this amendment and the principle behind the access to justice action plan tq which the government generally is committed. So far as cross-vesting is concerned, we are very fortunate that we have in this chamber today the honourable member for Holt( Mr Duffy), the former Attorney-General. He and I were reminiscing about former lives, his as Attorney-General and mine as principal private secretary to an Attorney-General for Western Australia, Mr Joe Berinson. We were reminiscing about the cross-vesting arrangements. I said to the honourable member for Holt that the original cross-vesting arrangement, which was achieved at a meeting in Brisbane of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, was actually sealed over lunch between the Attorney-General for Western Australia, Mr Joe Berinson, who is also a predecessor of mine as a former member for Perth, and the former Commonwealth Attorney-General and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lionel Bowen. The comment that the honourable member for Holt made, with which I wholeheartedly agreed, was that that lunch no doubt brought with it some very clear drafting instructions for the parliamentary counsel. On a serious note, this is an extension of those cross-vesting arrangements and I think it is another example of the great sense of that cooperative venture. The second of the non-contentious matters to which I wish to draw attention concerns the amendments in respect of the CHESS arrangements. In very many respects, I think these changes have been understated. The effect of these amendments is that the Corporations Law will provide a legislative framework for the electronic settlement of transactions on the Australian Stock Exchange. It will enable the ASX to introduce a new clearing house electronic subregister system, CHESS, through the establishment of an approved securities clearing house and legislative support of its business role. The aim of CHESS is to have transactions settled and delivered within three days after trade and to replace the current paper document of transfer with electronic transfer. That is a significant improvement in arrangements so far as the ASX is concerned. The legislative underpinning will ensure that there is an appropriate legislative regime in place to effect those arrangements. The honourable member for Tangney and previous speakers referred to those amendments which relate to the fundraising provisions of building societies and credit unions. As that is the subject of a decision of the ministerial councils for corporations and financial institutions, this chamber can be well assured that those amendments are worthwhile. In passing, I draw attention to the adoption of the penalty unit system to prescribe penalties. The final amendment to which I wish to draw attention is in respect of the segregation of client moneys by futures brokers. This is an important amendment to ensure the protection of investor funds. It is an issue that cannot be understated. This is not an ainendment that was contained in the exposure bill but it is not an amendment that has been the subject of adverse comment. On the contrary, it is an amendment that has been· the subject of endorsement. It is sensible and is firmly based on the principle of ensuring that at all times, through either the Corporations Law or ASX arrangements, investors' money is protected. I will move to that area of the bill which is the subject of the Attorney-General's amendment to delete the proposed amendments in respect of the definitions of securities and futures Wednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMI'ITEE 1759 contracts to facilitate the trading of equity based instruments having the characteristics of Qoth equity and futures contracts. I think the decision to defer these to a later day are very sensible and, far from being a matter for which the Attorney-General should be the subject of adverse comment, it is a matter in respect of which he should be the subject of positive comment. The Attorney-General has, I think, a growing capacity to be taking sensible and wise decisions and taking them in a timely fashion. He outlined in his second reading speech one of the reasons why the need to place this amendment into the bill without it being in the exposure bill has now passed. There are a couple of references that I wanted to draw attention to in order to reaffirm the point that this is a sensible decision by the Atton,.ey-Generai. I refer to an article in Butterworths Corporation lAw Bulletin under the heading 'Wolf in sheep's clothing'. I must confess, when I first saw that, I thought it was article on the change of the opposition's leadership, but I then saw the subheading 'OTC markets under the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994'. It is an article by Michael Hains, who is an author of Butterworths Australian Corporation lAw. In his contribution in that piece, he says: However, what appear to be fairly minor amendments proposed by the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill ... may herald a wholesale change to the way derivatives are regulatedHe goes on in his article to make the point, at its conclusion: It is evident that several important policy isSues are raised by the amendments. It is imperative that the amendments be deleted from the Amendment Bill and that a considered, informed and consultative process be implement-. If proceeded with, the amendments will create uncertainty and will confuse the regulatory regime in Australia. This will adversely impact on both exchange traded arid OTC derivatives markets. I am not necessarily agreeing with the final comment but that is one indication which supports the sensible decision' by the Attorney-General to delete this particular provision from the bilI. There was a second reference that I wanted to draw attention to on this issue, which is an extract from an article in the Australian Financial Review by Mr Ian Rogers, under the heading 'Law could give ASX derivatives'. It says: A partner with Freehill, Hollingdale and Page, Mr John O'Sullivan said the reforms would 'lessen the certainty that designers· of new products can have about the regulatory treatment of the product at the time that the product is designed.' . He said the amendments were an 'admission of defeat' by the legislative draftsman. It would be easier for the Australian Securities Commission to ensure that instniments that were similar in economic substance had the same regulatory treatment. Again, I am not saying that is necessarily correct, but Mr O'Sullivan is a practitioner of some standing in this area and it is views such as these that I am sure that the Attorney-General has taken into account. O'Sullivan not only because he is a practitioner in the field but also because many years ago we were students together. In the tradition of many young lawyers, we went to London to do a masters at London University. He, of course, being a corporations lawyer studied Corporations Law. I, of course, being a labour lawyer, studied comparative constitutional law and human rights.",167,Representatives Main Committee

Returning to the futures issue, for those reasons, I believe the amendment which is listed in the name of the Attorney-General ought to be supportedI will move to the issue which has been the subject of an amendment tabled by the honourable member for Tangney and by the Attorney-General and that is· in respect of the changes to the Corporations and Securities Panel. I think it is important to put the comments that the honourable member for Tangney has made on natural justice and procedural fairness into context. The Corporations and Securities Panel is established under part 10 of the Australian Securities Commission Act, and its powers are defined in part 1 of the Corporations Law. Upon application by the ASC it examines takeover conduct and may make declarations and orders concerning unacceptable conduct and acquisitions. These declarations and orders are enforceable by the courts. The activities of the panel have'been greatly curtailed following its examinations of conduct involved in the shares of Titan Hills and Precision Data Holdings. In the Titan Hills matter, the panel found that its jurisdiction did not extend far enough to cover the fairness of the amount of information provided during a related series of takeovers. In both cases the panel became involved in litigation which prevented it from reaching a rapid decision. The amendments contained in the bill would have the following effect: to extend the panel's jurisdiction to cover matters concerned with takeover conduct generally; to allow a person appearing before an inquiry to have another person present to assist him, although they remove any right to be represented by a barrister or a solicitor; to allow regulations to be made dealing with submissions, the right to appear or be present at an inquiry and the matters to be taken into account when making a decision; to reduce the risk of delays through litigation; and to empower the panel to accept undertakings which are enforceable by the court. The first of the two amendments that we have before this chamber is in the name of the Attorney-General. As the explanatory memorandum notes, this amendment will, in effect, omit the express exclusion of the rules of natural justice in. relation to an inquiry in proposed subsection 195(3) and substitute a statement of the government's interition that the requirements of the rules of natural justice will be met where the procedural requirements set out in division 3 of part 10 of the ASC Act and the regulations are followed in the course of the inquiry. The amendment which is in the name of the honourable member for Tangney hathe effect of suggesting that a person who appears at an inquiry is entitled to have another person present to assist that person, and the person who so assists is entitled to address the panel. That is code for ensuring that a person is entitled, as of right, to have present a legal practitioner, in effect, who can address the panel. The issue here is one of procedural fairness. Procedural fairness does not require that the panel behave like a court, and likewise cross-examination of parties and witnesses is not a requirement of procedural fairness .. The emphasis of the panel will instead be on written submissions by parties and strict time limits for submissions. After examining these",169,Representatives Main Committee

255,Mr Stephen Smith,"That is very important. The honourable member for BennelongWednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1761 submissions, the panel will· decide whether a conference or oral inquiry is necessary. Given that the panel's deliberations do not generally relate to technical legal matters but rather to matters of market behaviour and market standards, it is more appropriate that the parties, rather than their legal advisers, .address the panel at any such oral inquiries. Legal advisers may of course be present to assist but will not be entitled to address the panel. The issue which the honourable member for Tangney has raised is the ability of a person not just to assist but to address the panel. The rule of natural justice, which as a result of the amendment in the name of the Attorney-General will be incorporated, has the effect that a person does have the opportunity to be heard but not necessarily the right to be. heard orally. The rule of natural justice does n()t necessarily require that decision makers hear arguments from a person's legal representatives. It does require that a person have. an adequate opportunity to present his or her case and, whilthe. bill has the effect that a person does not have the right to be represented by a legal adviser, it does enable an adviser to be present and to assist the person in the presentatioq of that case. These amendments have been modelled on the system of pre-decision conferences under the Trade Practices Act. That is a system which, to my understanding, works very well. We ought to have every confidence that similar procedures ·adopted here will work equally well in this area. To return to a point I made earlier, I believe that will prove to be the case because the panel's deliberations .do not relate to technical legal matters· but to matters of market behaviour and market standards. One does not need to have legal representation to make those points adequately. In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, i( I can, in a sense, conclude where I began, I compliment the Attorney-General on his simplification process. The amendments which he has put before the House are all. worthy of support, and the important changes to Corporations Law which are envisaged by this bill reflect, once again, the ongoing commitment that the government has to el)suring that the Corporations Law operates effectively and efficiently, and that the 'interests of all players-and investors, in .particular-are supported by an effective legal regime, which needs to change continually with changing circumstances. The bill. and the amendments which the Attorney has put before the House effectively satisfy those requirements. . in regard to the matter which is beforus, which is the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. There have been a number of matters that have concerned the opposition. The panel and the natural justice issues qaturally come to mind. Th.e Attorney-General( Mr Lavarch)has sought to re-establish a process which covers the natural justice issue. It is not the ppposition's proposal to press that matter, but instead to take· up the matter referred to by the previous speaker, the honourable m-mber for Perth( Mr Stephen Smith). That is the area of the panel itself. We just feel that, in the circumstances, despite the .assurances that have been given, natural justice is an issue. I think the terms used were that natural justice need not be served by people giving oral expression to their concern. To me, it is a strange thing indeed that natural justice can be thought to be served by anything other than Someone having the opportunity to, in any way .they think· appropriate; express their objection or concern· about an issue before the government or before a court. So there should be no limitation on the way in which persons",170,Representatives Main Committee
256,Mr Cadman (Mitchell) (I2.36 P.m.),"I will not keep. the chamber longiri my comments1762 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 can express themselves; The limited process of expression being adhered to by the government is not something that is endorsed by the coalition. I will· quickly run through the main provisions of the bill. Firstly, there is the conferral of jurisdiction on lower courts, something that the opposition will not oppose. The next is the clearing hbuse electronic subregister system. I notice that government speakers have said this will have a massive impact, far wider th.an is supposed by many in the industry. The reverse appears to be the case, and there have been expressions of concern from various interests. To quote: . Several listed public companies have adopted artictes which confer on their boards the power to refuse to register a transfer in favour of a company which.is a foreigri company for the purpose of the Foreign Acquisittons and Takeovers Act 1975. See, for example, Equiticorp Industries Ltdv ACllnternationai Ltd. . . The justification of such articles is said to be that if transfers are registered in favour of foreign persons, the company may itself be classified as a foreign company and this may cause it to lose business opportunities in Australia. The Australian Stock Exchange has expressed its view on this matter, and it is not the intention of the opposition to oppose this measure. The third area is the application of corporate law to financial institutions. The bill removes charges over the property of financial institutions for, the registration scheme in the Corporations Law part 3.5, and that will not be opposed. . The Corporations and Securities Panel is an area which is of-concern. The bill seeks to remedy some of the faults by excluding the rules of natural justice in relation to an inquiry. Excluding legal and other advised representative persons before the panel, advisers will be able to be present to assist their client but m.ay not be able to address the panet The bill allows the court to enforce undertakings given to the panel, andbroaderis the jurisdiction of the panel to investigate certain conduct associated with a takeover. . . This is the area of contention. My colleague the honourable member for Tangney( Mr Williams) has moved an amendment seeking to rectify that problem. I have already said that it is my view that persons ought to be able to give expression in these circumstances in any way they see fit, whether it be written, by tape or orally. They ought to have their representative prepared in such a way as to ·beableto do it The argument presented is that· this will work like a pre-hearing tribunal of thTra,de Practices Tribunal under the Trade Practices Act. That is .qne, except I point out to the Attorney that a court .stands behind the panel and the court has the capacity to enforce uridertakings given to the panel. Therefore,no-one could put any blush on the fact that the proceedings before· the panel are not important. They are very important, both to· the individuals and to their organisations. I submit that not to allow legal representation could inhibit the proper and fair pursuit of an issue being considered by the panel. I do not think anybody wants to get itltoa full-blown court situation but there is a court standing behind the panel. That makes it different from a tribunal or a dispute,settling process which is not formal. Before most tribunals or panels there is a process whereby one may not have judges present, such as in social security, veterans' affairs or immigration. There is a large range of processes whereby negotiations and settlement take place before a tribunal or panel. In all these instances there is no court standing behind the panel to enforce the undertakings given to the panel. That is the distinction we want to draw; In this instance there is a court behind the panel and therefore legal representation is valid and should be allowed. So we, are moving our amendment along those lines. Wednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN. COMMITTEE 1763 I wish to refer' to other factors in·this legislation, such as the notification Of review of decisions and the screen-based trading systems. The Australian Stock Exchange has submitted that the amendments do not provide a sufficient framework for the provision of an efficient market and for ensuring that the interests of the public,and principally those of the smaller investor,.to whom this type of market is directed, are safeguarded. Some of these criticisms are detailed and complex and appear to be influenced by the desire on the part of the ASX to ensure that markets are restricted to the existing forms of markets. That mayor may not be right, but the ASX has offered a comment and a criticism. As the process develops we need to be very sensitive to ensuring that Australia can capitalise on its particular geographic location in South-East Asia and draw on the expertise and security our markets offer in this area. So the government will need to listen to the Australian Stock Exchange. Finally, I mention the conversion 'of companies to no-liability status and the series of other less consequential amendments. I wish to raise two matters in particular-the program of simplification of the Corporations Law and the conduct of the investigation by two members of the Simplification Task Force. Comments were made by Miss Claire Grosse and Dr Robert Eggleson, who hinted that the company register paper would allude to the need to eliminate the requirement of companies to hold registers in multiple locations. They appear to be eminently suited to the task in which they are engaged. That leads me to the second matterthe Attorney-General's comments. reported in the Australian Financial Review on 29 Aprilwhich basically say to the corporate world, 'You get your act together and we will support you.' I think that is a sensible way to go. I am pleased with the tack that is being taken in relation to this matter. The government could move in and be very prescriptive and use black-letter law and heaps of it. However, there is an adopted attitude or an inherited attitude about this. The former Attorney-General was very much of that ilk: he did not want to move to complete preSCription. In the latter days of his term he tried to gain a mix-an interrelationshipbetween black-letter law and fuzzy l-w, and he did that successfully. . I wish. to compliment the present Attorney-General. I hope his actions help to end the difficulti-s .that the country has experienced over. a long period and about which the government really failed to take action until the horses had bolted. It has been too little too late in some ways, but the Attorney-General. is going about it in the right way. Amendment Bill 1994 require a brief examination of the history of the Corporations and Securities Panel. When honourable members look at this history,. they will see that it picks up many of the points made by the previous speakers. The panel was established, as the honourable member for Perth( Mr Stephen Smith) pointed out, as a peer review group to examine conduct and takeover matters referred to it by the ASC. In particular, it was empowered to make declarations of unacceptable conduct and acquisitions' in respect of takeovers, and to. make orders to remedy such conduct. Unfortunately, the first matter that came before the panel 'was the one referred by the honourable member for Tangney( Mr Williams)'-the Titan Hills takeover case. In terms of peer review, it' must be said diat that case was a total disaster because, rather 'than a peer review, it became an exercise in legal technicalities. It was clear' at that point to the government that the panel could not operate without changes to ·facilitate the panel's conduct of inquiries. That is what the government is doing in this legislation. The Attorney-General",171,Representatives Main Committee
257,Mr Duffy (Holt) (12.47 P.m.),"The proposed amendments to the Corporations Legislation1764 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 8 June 1994 ( Mr Lavarch) and the government should be commended for that because I think it is an important panel. It could not work in the past and these amendments will make it work. That is the aspect of the bill that I particularly want to deal with. All of the other matters in the bill are matters of significance, apart from some consequential matters. A large amount of litigation was directly generated by the Titan Hills-Precision Data reverse takeOver. It is true that some of those actions-these points have been made by other peoplesuch as the constitutional challenge to the panel's power, will not come back to haunt us. I think that that has probably ended. However, as I have indicated briefly, it did become clear during the Titan Hills matter that there were a number of other difficulties with the panel's operations. The most obvious difficulty evidenced by that case is that, despite the panel's legislative charter, hearings have to be conducted with little formality and technicality and with as much expedition as possible. There is potential for that process to be totally bogged down as a quasi-legal forum for legal representatives to present lengthy arguments. The factis that there is a precedent, which was touched on by other speakers,although they were not agreeing with it. That precedent is the procedures before the Trade Practices Commission in the early stages. The worrying part about all this is that when the government attempted to go for peer review there was only one case, because the exact opposite happened. It got bogged down in the most extraordinarily complex legal arguments, and something had to be done about that if we were going to make any sense of peer review at all. The member for Tangney raised the issue which Mr Tony Hartnell, former Chairman of the ASC, pointed out in a fairly recent interview. I do not have the quotation in front of me, but Mr Hartnell said words to the effect that we should have a panel with no power to punish but merely a power to publish what it felt about the behaviour and the standards of behaviour that people had engaged in. That is all very well, but what concerns me about that is that there is nothing at all to stop corporate Australia doing precisely that now. There is nothing that the Attorney could do to stop corporate Australia doing precisely that. In fact, the contrary; and that was touched on in the latter part of the speech by the member for Mitchell( Mr Cadman). For a long while, if not for ever, there has been a total lack of a culture ,of peer review in this country. People tend to say that there has been an overreaction to the corporate excesses of the 1980s, and that is why vie had so much legislation in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But it is not an ovel!eaction to something that happened in the 1980s.The history of it, unfortunately, goes back a lot further than that. One thinks of Cambridge Credit, the Korman empire, Reid Murray and Poseidon. Norie of that happened in the 1980s. It goes back well before the 1 9 8 0 s . ' . . There. has been no history of any 'real attempt by those people involved in corporate Australia to deliver peer review. I well recall occasions on which I spoke to a man who can be referred to as one of our leading chief executive officers; the executive director of a leading Australian public company. He always became very concerned when it was put to him that the behaviour that we were seeing in corporate Australia was appalling. He would always respond-and it -as particularly in relation' to the general area of the Corporations Law concerning loans to directorS that he made this respQnse-that in the company of which he was the chief executive and executive director, none of those things happened. I always had to remind him, time and time again, that no-one suggested that they did. As far as anyone could see, in that company there was a record of accountability along the lines that this government has said should be upheld in the area of corporate law in this country. Wednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1765 This government has said right through its period of government that, where people are dealing with other people's money, a standard of behaviour is required which is far beyond that which might apply if they wanted merely to fritter away their own money. I well recall having to say to that person on many occasions that if, at some stage in the future, he was asked by a judge, 'When did you actually make a strong speech to the Institute of Directors,. the Business Council of Australia or whoever, on what should be the proper behaviour in corporate Australia?' the answer from him at best would have to be, 'Your Honour, I just happened to be passing by at the time.' In many ways that sums up the problem that the government has-and in particular the Attorney-General has-of getting it into the minds of those people that, if they want a culture of peer review, they have to do it. He as Attorney-General cannot do it. This government cannot establish it. The government and the Attorney cannot put a culture into the minds of people; they have to do it themselves. They have not done it. The honourable member for Tangney quoted the eminent Tony Hartnell, for whose drive, initiative and energy as the first Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission I have the greatest respect; and one can understand what Tony Hartnell said, as quoted by the member for Tangney. But the fact is that that is not a criticism of the legislation that the Attorney is bringing before the parliament. Itcannot be a criticism of it, because what they are appealing for-as much as I can understand precisely what the honourable member for Tangney and Mr Hartnell are appealing for-seems to be some body which does not punish but has to publish and, therefore, highlight misbehaviour of corporate Australia in a particular instance. As I said before, there is no question that that is what this government has always been on about. If corporate Australia wants to engage in that sort of self-regulation through peer review, then it should go right ahead. I think there is no question that the last three Attorneys, including the present one, are on record as saying that, if people want to talk about peer review and if they really are serious about it, they should get on with it. The other point made by many people was that this legislation was not necessary. The old, but correct, point was made by them that, if it is not broken, do not fix it. I can tell honourable members that this legislation was necessary because unquestionably it was broken. This panel had to be fixed. It could not operate in the way it did. The government, and in particular the Attorney, should be congratulated for attempting to bring it back on the rails. But again let me emphasise that it still probably will not work unless corporate Australia is prepared to give it a chance to work. If people wish to tum this again into a quasi-court, they will be able to do it through various means. Do not blame the Attorney-General, or the government, if that happens. Corporate Australia should not run around saying, 'The government did not make an effort to bring about peer review'-because it has. That is what this legislation is attempting to do; it is attempting to fix something that was broken, and it was broken in a way which indicated that corporate Australia had not learned a lesson of allowing a body to take its course and, in a limited way, have that peer review. Mr Deputy Speaker, this is only a limited way. The Attorney cannot do it; the government cannot do it. It is up to corporate Australia. I think I have reached the stage where, if I hear one leader of industry in this country again say that he wants more self-regulation or more peer review, I will become ill, because we know that people are not going to do it. If they want to go out and do it, we invite them to start right now. From the moment of this bill, let them show the Attorney and the government that they are capable of conducting peer review, because they have no culture or no record of it to date. 1766 MAIN COMMITTEE ,l Wednesday, 8 June 1994 Mr Deputy Speaker, it being almost 1.00 p.m., I seek leave to continue my remarks at a future time.
