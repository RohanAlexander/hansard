Wednesday, took the chair at S.80 p.m., and read prayers. Kingdom Ministers since the war seem to have been unable to see any further east than Suez, and as the British Army seems to be dwindling and committing the same errors in. Malaya as it committed before the war and early in the war, I ask the Prime Minister whether the Australian. Government gave the impression, as reported in the Straits Times of Malaya, that it would refuse to grant any military aid in Malayai f an official request were made? If this was unintentional, as I believe it was, will the right honorahle gentleman take immediate steps to correct the false impression? Furthermore, does not the Government consider that some real commando units in Malaya would more effectively help to stop communism in South-East Asia than the maintenance of a force in Japan is doing, for that force is of no real use and actually causes loss of face for Australia because Japan is being run by the United States and not by Australia ? If the recent statement of the Minister for External Affairs is to be taken seriously, should not the Government offer some real help to Malaya in its present difficulties? statement which apparently has appeared in a newspaper. AllI can say is that no statement has been made on behalf of the Government on that matter. The points that have been raised by the honourable member will certainly be taken into very close consideration by the Government. for External Affairs to state the establishment strength of tbe Embassy for the Russian empire at Canberra. How does it compare in point of numbers with the Australian Embassy at Moscow? Has the Minister any knowledge of the activities of the personnel at the Russian Embassy and the numbers engaged (a) as March, 1960. administrative workers, (6) as domestics, such as valets, and (c) as persons witb undefined duties? Is ""there any restriction upon the movements of menibers of the Australian. Embassy in Moscow? If so, what knowledge has the Minister for the comings and goings of members of the Bussian Embassy staff at Canberra? Australian Embassy at Moscow is very small by comparison with Russian representation in Australia. The number of officers and workers employed by the Soviet Embassy ia on record and I shall supply the exact figure to the honourable member later. announce the figure now? approximately twenty, including not only administrative oflicers and others engaged upon embassy work, but also others, such as door-keepers. member may describe them as valets.

At the moment we do not propose to take any steps, but the matter is being very closely observed. to encourage saving by the people, will the Prime Minister consider excluding the surrender value of life insurance policies when computing the capital of age and invalid pensioners? Men, when young, take out insurance policies, but when some of them reach the time of application for an age pension they find that they are not entitled to the pension because of the surrender value of their polices, which were originally secured to make provision for their wives and children.

I for one do not propose to make it a matter of general debate at this stage.

The points which have been raised by the honourable member for Cunningham are of value, and I assure bim that the Government will give them earnest consideration. It is true that most of the oflicial delegates to the conference were medical men with an expert knowledge of pneumoconiosis. chairman was Dr. George, the medical adviser to the Joint Coal Board, who, I think, is held in high regard by all sections of the industry in Australia.

[3.25] -Perhaps I should, at the beginning of my speech, congratulate the Minister for External' Affairs( Mr self pointed out, international affairs are Spender) upon the statement on foreign affairs that he presented to the House. Australia is fortunate in that the predecessor of the present Minister laid the foundations of the department so well that the new Minister, within a few weeks of assuming oflice, was able to present to the House so comprehensive a statement. Much of what he said was simply a re-statement of the policy of the last Government, but regarding some of the other principles enunciated by him there is less reason for enthusiasm. Before considering what should be done in the future, it is as well to turn back for a moment, and examine the events that have led up to the present situation. None of us will have forgotten the Munich Agreement of the 1st October, 1938. We recall with a good deal of regret some of the undertakings given at Munich,, which were disregarded almost as soon as they were published. None of us has forgotten that when the then Prime Minister of Britain, Mr Chamberlain, returned to England, he announced as he steppedfroin the plane that he had achieved "" peace in our time "". Neither have we forgotten what happened within twelve months of his making that statement. Going back still further, we recall that Hitler's Nazi, policy was the cause of the last war, and we are not likely to forget that as early as 1933 some of the financial institutions of England were financing Hitler's programme for the restoration of Germany. Because of that, those of us who are responsible for making decisions to-day on international policy would do well to remember what led up to the second world war, so that we may avoid repeating the errors into which our leaders then fell. Hitler, the Nazi leader, had no scruples about disregarding all the undertakings he gave at Munich. He took advantage of the help in 1933 to build a war machine that almost destroyed our civilization. Let help some one else-name s do not matter for the moment-to plunge civilization statement, into another fight for its existence. We are aware of the difficulties that faced the Minister for External Affairs in preparing bis statement. As he himfluid. Almost every day the situation changes. We know that the powerful American newspaper group controlled by Colonel McCormack has expressed uncompromising opposition to the principles enunciated by the Minister for External Affairs. However, another section of the American press has voiced a warning that Australia and America could at any time in the immediate future find themselves isolated. Those of us who are in the trade union movement have not forgotten that before Bussia became engaged",21,Questions

88,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),"in the last war there were people in Australia who declared that the war represented a clash of money interests, and they continued in that attitude even when England had its back to the w-all and was being blasted by German bombs. We also remember only too well that immediately Russia came into the conflict the opinion of those people changed. The situation then resolved itself into a struggle between democracy and totalitarianism. When the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) was speaking last night, some honourable members opposite suggested, by innuendo, that he was peddling the wares of the Communist party. I wonder what, the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) thought when Russia entered World War II . against the Nazis. It is safe to say that there was not an Australian, Englishman or American who was not glad that tbe western democracies were to have the assistance of the Soviet at that time. Great, Britain poured out large sums of money in 1933 to enable Hitle r to strengthen against the Russians, but, in 3941, Britain again poured out vast sums of money to assist the Russians to resist the onslaught of the Nazis. Russia entered thewar with tbe feeling that it was being used by the Western Powers to pull tlieir chestnuts out of the fire, but students of international affairs realized that a falling ont between the two dictators, Stalin and Hitler, was inevitable. Russia and Germany concluded a treaty of non-aggression in 1938, after which Hitler felt free to enforce his demands upon Poland. The fact, is inescapable that once a country adopts the totalitarian form of government, it matters little whether the regime is Leftist or Rightist, because the principles of totalitarianism are the same. A dictator who has the ambition to become tbe master of t.he world w ill not tolerate for very long the existence of another dictator whose word is law over more than 200,000,000 people. Therefore, the r if t between Hitle r and Stalin waa inevitable. When Nazi-ism and fascism had been democracy and communism in Asia and crushed, Russia's distrust of the western between democracy and communism in democracies became even more proEurope. History shows that the Chinese, nounced than it bad been before the outbreak of World War II . in 1939. It is easy for us to say that the number of countries wbicb are now dominated by Russia are proof of the Soviet's expansionist designs. All that the Russians have done has been to erect a protective screen around their own country, ancl, in doing so, they are only emulating our own example. The strength of Russia is prodigious. The correspondent, Alan Moorehead, bas made the following appraisal:Asi t stands now, Western Europe is not in a position to defend itself, for the Russians are infinitely more powerful than we are. Unlike the Allies the Russians never ceased arming after the last war, and they never really ""demobilized. The Eussian Forces at the present time are so much greater than anybody else's that there can be no question about the race to catch them up, for that can never be done. The American Secretary of State, Mr. Dean Acheson, announced on the 15th Marsh last that the United States of America wanted peace, but not peace at any price, and he enunciated five conditions to which Russia must agree before Germany as a bulwark satisfactory talks between the Soviet and the western democracies would be possible to relieve world tension. The former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr Churchill, made the following statement tbe next day:Don't nurse, foolish delusions that you have liny other overall effective shield at the present time from mortal danger than the atom bomb in possession, thank God. of the United State*. But for that there would be no hope that Europe could preserve its freedom. [Quorum formed.'] Having regard to the Statements by Mr Dean Acheson and Mr Churchill about Russian preparedness in Europe, we can arrive at only one conclusion. Tests of strength occurred in Europei n 1914-18 and again in 1939-45. If we agree that Russia is preparing for a third conflict in Europe, we must examine with considerable caution the policy that has been outlined by our Ministerf or External Affairs. I disagree with the opinion which the honourable gentleman has expressed that there is very little difference between the conflict between for example, are not aggressors, and I do not believe that they have aggressive aims. According to press reports yesterday, approximately 200,000,000 Chinese are starving. It is obvious that a nation in that plight is not in a position to begin a war of aggression. So, the conflict to-day is as it was in 1939 and 1940. All the forces of war are poised for a European conflict. If we analyse that position we shall agree that a very wide gulf exists between the Communist approach to world domination in Europe and the Communist approach to domination in Asia. Russia's interests in Asia are merely secondary to its interests in Europe. Its approach to the problem in Asia represents an attempt to guard its own back door lest some nation should be strong enough to rap on the door and take up the gauntlet which has already been thrown down in Europe. We have to decide whether this country should be tied up by military preparedness for war. We cannot again send Australian soldiers to fight in France and Flanders. Our whole approach to this problem has been wrong. Having regard to the global situation, it would be much better for us to assist the starving millions of China, irrespective of the type of government that may be established in that country, and to aid Burma and other friendly nations to withstand the onrush of communism, than to attempt to build up a worthwhile military force. We sbould do everything possible to assist to provide the wherewithal to keep together the bodies and souls of the 200,000,000 starving Chinese, rather than prepare to send another army to France or Flanders. If one but analyses the situation carefully it is as clear as crystal. It has been suggested in some quarters that, in an attempt to rejuvenate Japan, the TJnited States of America may do something that would be against the best interests of Australia. (Extension of time granted.'] I thank the House for its courtesy. I shall not trespass on the patience of honourable members for very long. I appreciate the Minister's difiiculties in approaching this problem. I suggest to him and to the Government that the greatest co-operation should be achieved as quickly as possible by the members of the British and the English-speaking countries which Mr E. James Harrison. share our ideals. I do not agree with the view expressed by an isolationist newspaper of America thatAustralia and Great Britain, having first assured their ipeople of a republican form of government, could always apply for admission as new States into the American Union. That point of view is being actively canvassed by one section of the American press. I urge the Minister to endeavour to achieve the closest consultation between British Commonwealth countries on this important subject of foreign relations. It is time that we clearly understood where a global conflict may lead us, and the points at which the armies of Britain and Australia will be needed. Australia, with a meagre population of 8,000,000 people, could do more to break the yoke of oppression of communism by providing food for the starving Chinese than by providing a military force to take part in a global war. sending sufficient food to Great Britain. How could we send food to China? production will not be increased if every available man is conscripted to serve in the armed forces. We should try to win the confidence of the starving masses of China by providing their urgently needed food requirements. Having regard to our numerical strength, Australia's best role would be to assist the starving millions of Asia to withstand the onslaughts of the Communists. If we were like Switzerland, a small concentrated country in which every man is trained militarily for the purpose of defence, and which no outside force was likely to invade because of our long period of disinterest in war, we might perhaps do something along the lines that have been suggested by honourable members opposite. Unhappily, our position cannot he compared with that of Switzerland and accordingly our policy must be shaped having regard to global considerations. Russia did not put nineteen divisions of troops on the European frontier and none on the Chinese frontier with the object of launching ,an aggressive movement from China. Commonwealth Aggression will come not from China but from Russian satellites in Europe. Only",22,International Affairs Given To Him By The English Financiers

91,Mr Osboene (Evans) [3.48],"I could be used as' an instrument of war.have no right to insist on their future observance. There is ample proof of what I say in the happenings of the last year which represented the steady formulation of a de facto peace between America and Japan. An official statement dated the 16th May, 1949, by the American representative on the Far Eastern Commission contained the statement that there bad been a change of policy by the occupying authority in relation to the expansion of Japan's internal industries. It is clear from the statement that from that time the Japanese were to become entitled without restrictions to build their own ships, to build ships for foreign buyers and to establish unlimited steel plants. In justice to the occupying authority, wo must recognize its imperative need to put Japan on a self-supporting basis. It is costing the American taxpayers no less than 400,000,000 dollars a year to maintain the occupying forces in Japan, and we oan understand that, from their point of view, Japan must be allowed to re-establish itself. But we have a right to insist that there shall be safeguards suitable to our needs, and that we shall have the further right to ensure their observance. On tbe 1st December, 1949, the Supreme Commander announced that tbe Japanese export trade had heen restored to an entirely private basis. That is evidence of the degree to which Japan is being readmitted to the full status of a peaceful state. In January of this year, Mr and I think most importantly, the United Acheson, the American Secretary of State, said that Japan must be protected, either through a permanent settlement or otherwise. Japanese currency problems, lie said must be solved "" under a treaty or, if procedural difficulties of that nature are too great, under some otber mechanism"". templates the possibility that a final peace honourable member for Angas( Mr with Japan shall be reached without any treaty. [Quorum formed.'] I was directing the attention of the Houso to evidence of the de facto peace that has been reached between America and Japan. I believe that the final and most conclusive evidence resides in a directive from the American Department of State to the Supreme Commander, Allied Powers, dated the 25th February, Mr Osborne. 1950-onl y four weeks ago-whic h included the following statement:The Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, suhject to his discretion and continued control, should permit Japan to participate with other nations or groups of nations in such international agreements, conventions and conferences of a technical character as Japan may be invited to enter into, accede to, or attend. In other words, Japan is to be given a limited right to negotiate agreements with other nations. I suggest that when present limitations have been removed Japan will have been restored to the full status of a state at peace. It is true that the peace agreement that America is arriving at with Japan is, in tbe main, a satisfactory one. Japan has been thoroughly disarmed. Its future development has been limited and, in general, the lines which the occupation authority is following are suitable to us. But there are certain important matters on which we differ. The TJnited States of America relies on its disarmament of Japan to preserve peace in the future. Australia fears Japan's capacity to re-arm: The TJnited States sees no danger in allowing Japan to construct shipping. Australia has every reason to fear that. The TJnited States, naturally, is moved very greatly by a desire to restore Japanese economy. Australia fears that if it is too thoroughly restored it will represent a future danger to this country. Finally, States of America believes in the moral regeneration of Japan. We have strong reasons for being at least somewhat doubtful of that. No fewer tban five honourable members of this House had unrivalled opportunities to observe tbe workings of the Japanese mind over a considerable It is clear that America conperiod of years and one of them, tbe Downer), has said that he finds it unbelievable that such a moral regeneration could have occurred in Japan so quickly. However, the conviction appears to be deeply rooted in the mind of the Supreme Commander, Allied Powers, who recently saidTo the Japanese people I can pay no higher tribute than to repeat that they have f u l ly and f a it h f u l ly fulfilled their surrender commitments. General MacArthur also made the following declaration in his New Year's Day statement this yearYour new leadership, strengthening under the stimulus of responsibility, is rapidly becoming safe guarantee against either the reemergence of those institutions which brought your race to tlie brink of destruction or the substitution of alien concepts no less provocative of disaster.

This is an insecure safeguard upon which Asia and the Pacific region In pleading to found the future prosperity and peace our cause we shall be pleading the of the Pacific area. The cause of the long delay in concludthe United States of America to accept ing a formal peace with Japan has been, our point of view, we shall do a service of course, the refusal of Soviet Russia to not only to ourselves but also to the rest of co-operate with us.

92,Mr Keon ( Y A R R A ) [4.6],"Lest timeMinister( Mr Menzies) has made concerning the future of Radio Australia, that he proposes to divert it from short-wave overseas .broadcasting to the task of broadcasting to inland Australia. I submit that, if he does so, the Government will deprive Australia of a vital weapon in the conflict that will inevitably take place, whether in a diploacute because, if press reports are to be matic sphere or in a more violent sphere, between this country and governments of a Oommunist hue in Asia. Radio Australia is an efiicient instrument for the disseminationof our views throughout Asia. expenditure of a great deal of time and money, and the Government should be very earefnl about employing that instrument for other purposes. If the Department of External Affairs has not yet been consulted about the proposal, and if the move is merely in pursuance of the Government's policy of making some pretence of cleaning up the Public Service, I urge Ministers to take a more responsible view of the situation and to reconsider their decision. Radio Australia might well he of the greatest importance in protecting Australia's interests in Asia. can be achieved by the I was interested more in matters that were ignored by the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) during his statement on international affairs than in many of tbe subjects that he discussed. One of the matters upon which I waited in vain for some enlightenment was the proposed attitude of the Government to the decision of the United Nations concerning the internationalization of Jerusalem. As honourable members know, the previous Australian Government last year sponsored a resolution, which was adopted by the Genera] Assembly of the United Nations, calling for the internationalization of Jerusalem in order to protect the holy places and to ensure that Christians and people of other faiths should have free access to them. The Government of Israel in effect put its fingers to its nose man's scientific ingenuity now enables and announced that it had no intention wliatever of taking any notice of the resothat the Minister should deliver a lengthy lution. The matter has been allowed to rest there. No attempt has been made either by the United States of America or by the United Kingdom to insist upon the adherence of the Government of Israel to the decision. I regret that the Minister Mr Keon. did not refer to this matter, because tiie people of Australia are eager to know whether the Government proposes to maintain the policy that was adopted by the previous Government or to reverse it and allow the Government of Israel to defy the United Nations. Unfortunately, the position seems to be growing more believed, the Government of Israel has already refused to grant many people access to the various holy places in Jerusalem. I ask the Government to clarify its attitude in this issue by Its development required the making a pronouncement to the people. I consider that the only sensible decision would be to insist upon observance of the decisions of the United Nations by the Government of Israel. Indeed, just as it might be claimed that the doom of the League of Nations was sealed when it refused to take any notice of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, so the complete impotence of the United Nations may well stem from this absolute and studied defiance of a decision of the General Assembly. If we believe that anything of value United Nations, we must determine that all interested parties shall carry out its decisions. At the moment, the Government of Israel is openly defying the United Nations, and the United Kingdom and the United States of America are very conveniently trying to overlook the fact. Undoubtedly either of those countries separately, or both acting together, could bring the Government of Israel to heel without any trouble whatever. Asubject that was mentioned only briefly by the Minister, but which warranted a special anouncement, is the control of atomic energy. The peoples of the world are waiting in a state of desperate anxiety for the discovery of some means of controlling the dreadful weapons of war that unfortunately us to make. It'was most extraordinary statement on international affairs without making more than a passing reference to the subject. After all, we are living on borrowed time. Who knows whether some of the great nations to-morrow or the next day, instead of boasting about the atomic bombs that they possess, may begin to use them. The vicious circle of growing fear that arises from this situation must be broken, or, if it cannot be broken, at least we should attempt to break it. ""We have been assured by the most impressive scientific authorities that human life itself may vanish from the earth if those weapons are brought into use. Eveni f such prophecies should not be fulfilled, and the weapons prove no worse than those of the last war, human life would be scarcely worth supporting. The most urgent task of every democratic government to-day should be to secure some workable means of controlling those weapons, if that be possible in the face of the deliberate hostility and truculence of the Soviet TJnion. I referred recently to the failure of the newspapers to restore the morale of democracy and keep it on a high plane. One instance of this failure that springs to my mind is the complete ignorance of the peoples of democratic countries about the gesture that was made by the TJnited States of .America in relation to the control of atomic energy. For the first time in human history a nation which exclusively controlled tbe most dreadful weapon ever made and which could have imposed its will on the world, indicated that it was prepared to make the information it possessed about that weapon available to tiie peoples of the world for conversion to peaceful purposes. It stated that it was prepared to destroy its stock of atomic bombs provided that a genuine system of international control, by a responsible body vested with the power to inspect and control factories and installations set up for the production of atomic energy, could be instituted. That offer was unprecedented in the history of mankind; yet very little reference was made to it in the press of this country. If the average man in the street were asked whether the democratic nations of the world had made any serious attempt to secure genuine international control over atomic energy he probably would not be able to answer. That offer wa9 made, but was not accepted because the democratic world was faced with the stubbornness of the Soviet TJnion. Tbe people of the democratic world have not been impressed with the urgency of the control of the use of atomic energy, or the efforts that have been been made to solve it. That is one reason why the problem has not been solved. Probably the use of atomic weapons cannot be justified in any circumstances, even if it means risking the destruction of .any country pr of a large part of the civilized world by our enemies. These weapons, if uncontrolled, will be used in warfare. The time has come for the democratic countries to lay their cards on the table and to stop the useless farce .that is being played at Lake Success when, if anytliing of importance arises which may adversely affect the Soviet Union, the veto is immediately applied. That hopeless pantomime, due to the actions of the Soviet Union, must be stopped once and for all. The democratic nations must say plainly what they are prepared to do in relation to disarmament and the control of atomic weapons. If the co-operation of the Soviet Union and its satellites cannot be secured, we must put an end to the useless farce of the Disunited Nations, and form a new body of United Nations without the Soviet. We should restore our own morale if we were to put forward a good and consistent policy in which we had confidence; a policy by which our people would be fully assured that we were trying to secure peace in our time, and the abolition of the dreadful weapons* of war that are available. I do not underestimate the difiiculties of adopting such a policy. We must try again so far as the Soviet Union is concerned, because the results of failure are too dreadful to contemplate. The result of our failure to secure peace will undoubtedly lead to the total destruction of mankind or to a destruction of such a big part of it that the other part will wish, too, that it had been destroyed. .It is not a problem to be solved during the next decade or the next century, it may need a solution next week or the week after. The problem must be solved., No one underestimates the difficulties of those seeking a solution. Let us strengthen our own conscience and the belief in our own cause. That would come about if we laid down a plan indicating how far we are prepared ""to go in order to preserve peace. If we do that we shall be stimulating confidence and doing something constructive, instead of looking for something constructive from the present TJnited Nations. The TJnited Nations ia solving a number of smaller problems but on the big problem of world peace it cannot hope to function as it should while the Soviet TJnion uses the veto. So far as this Government has power to do so, although it does not have a great deal of power, it should attempt to put that plan into action. The Minister said that Australia is a Pacific power, but I say that it is only a Pacific nation. Power is derived through the possession of armaments. Australia has not the necessary armaments and, therefore, it has not the power to enforce its will. This nation should not try to be any more than a Pacific nation. However, by the assertion of moral influence we can impress upon the nations the necessity for truth, justice and peace in the councils of the nations of the world. This Government has responsibility to do that. It should not be led astray by delusions of grandeur in relation to our foreign policy because we have not the necessary power to implement that policy. The Minister spoke about Japan and the peace treaty. Everybody knows that the peace treaty, by and large, will be written as tlie United States wants to have it. That country may ma^ke some concessions to please us, but on any fundamental point should the United States come into conflict with other nations, its view will prevail. It would be most unfortunate for Australia if the United States were not present to make its view prevail. ""Whatever we may think should be done to the Japanese, we are incapable of doing anything whatsoever without the help of the United States. We are completely dependent on that nation. It is just as well for UB to realize that fact, and that basic relationship should be formalized by a union or an agreement between the English-speaking nations of the world so that we shall not have fundamental conflicts on policy. I cannot see how the British Commonwealth can possibly' survive unless there is such a federation with the United States. The British Commonilr. Keon. wealth has been an outstanding success in the field of international affairs because it ha9 shown that nations, while remaining free to conduct their internal affairs, can remain a part of a Commonwealth. Although the Australian Government cannot exercise great power in the affairs of the world, I hope that it will raise its voicein urging some such union. Perhaps this country could be the bridge leading from the British Commonwealth on the one side to the United States on the other. The last matter in the Minister's statement that I wish to refer to is in relation to China. Whether or not we consider that that country ie controlled by a Communist government, a statement that I noticed in the press yesterday seems to indicate that the Premier of China, Mao Tse-tung, has no illusions about his relations with the Soviet Union. Apparently he has just returned from a visit to Moscow and has declared that he is a loyal Stalinite and is very thankful for the assistance which the Soviet Union has given to the Communist party in China during the last 33 years. The position may or may not be as it was recorded there; but irrespective of what attitude we adopt towards the Chinese Government we must remember the people behind the Government. [Extension of time granted.'] The Chinese people are something apart from their government. I hope that this Government will give very serious consideration to the continuance of the operations of Radio Australia so that its short-wave broadcasts to the Chinese people may continue. Chinese coolies have radios? Chinese coolies have very little voice in the Chinese Government, no matter what type of government it is. The radio messages should he addressed to the educated classes of China which make governments, whether Communist or Nationalist. The best method of helping tbe Chinese masses is to relieve their want and misery. Statements about our civilization and our way of life will sound silly and empty to the Chinese coolies,",27,International Affairs Given To Him By The English Financiers

If we are to compete against the glow of hope that communism brings to the depressed people of the world we must help to raise them out of their miserable state. Although we need to get our message to the educated people of China who control the Government, our best method of checking communism in Asiatic countries is to attack the misery and want that causes it . We must let those people see that communism is not the only alternative to sueh conditions, but that there is a better way of life. We must not waste time addressing pleas to ourselves and to the European people about the protection of our way of life, but we must realize how empty these tilings are to the teeming millions of the East. the honourable member do to change their conditions? fundamental rights as human beings. If we do that we. sliall be making a start on the solution of the problem.. There is no choice between black and white in these matters. We require the Chinese people on our side because otherwise we shall be faced with a very difficult situation. We must .accept the lesser of two evils. As for Japan, since in the final analysis the TJnited States of America will decide tlie terms of the peace treaty, let us confine our efforts to the re-education of the Japanese people, if that is possible. If it is not, then let us not antagonize them more than is necessary. We are not in a position to impose our views or w ill on the Japanese without the assistance of the TJnited States of America. In regard to world peace generally, and the control of atomic energy in particular, let us lay our cards on the table. Let us demonstrate to our own people that we are sincere. Let us call a disarmament conference, if that is desirable, and say how far we are prepared to go. If , as seems almost inevitable, the Soviet w ill not allow international inspection of armaments, & c , if it is not prepared to lower the iron curtain to that extent, then it will stand convicted before the free nations of the world as the breaker of world peace. refused to permit such an inspection. tbe Minister knows, in characteristic Communist style Russia agreed to inspection by a body representing thn United Nations, in which it exercises the right of veto. Apartf r o m that, Bussia has consistently refused to allow an inspection to be made. The problem has become more difficult since Russia has itself succeeded in making the atomic bomb. Whereasi t would have been impossible to conceal from inspection plant for the making of atomic bombs, tbere would be no difficulty in concealing a large stockpile of tbe bombs themselves. Therefore, I urge that we should put all our cards on the table, and discard the United Nationsi n this matter, as we know that in the deliberations of that body Russia has power to exercise the veto. We should let our own people know the We must recognize their position, and then, with clear consciences, do what is possible to solve the problem. Actually, I have no confidence that we can achieve much with people who are convinced Marxists, and believe that our social system must inevitably destroy itself because of the contradictions in capitalism. However, we ought to make an effort, not by doing a Moscow crawl, as was suggested by the Conservative leader in Great Britain, but by making our position clear to our own people and to Russia, and by submitting a straightforward proposition which, if the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics refuses to co-operate, should lead us to form a real body of united democratic nations. I regret that the Ministerf or External Affairs did not, in the course of his statement, mention the Government's policy on the proposal for international control of Jerusalem, and the protection of the H o l y Places. The House is entitled to know whether the intention is to apply the policy of the previous Government in regard to those matters, or to reversei t. I particularly regret that the Minister did not refer to the last Government's proposals regarding disarmament and the control of atomic weapons.

98,Mr Keon,"It has; but then, asat such control might be in vain, but it is our duty to makeit. ""When our representatives attend the next meeting of the. Assembly of the TJnited Nations theyi must bring these matters forward for discussion. the Minister for External Affairs( Mr have evinced a disposition to control their Spender), and the Government, for. having submitted a statement on international affairs so early in the life of this Parliament.. We could, concern ourselves with no more important matter than this, and it is therefore well that honourable members should be afforded the opportunity to express their opinions on the international problems witb which we are confronted. During the last half-century tremendous changes have taken place in Australia and throughout the world. From being a remote community "" down under "", we have now come into the front line of international affairs, and must accept new responsibilities. Science and invention have so reduced the effects of distance tliat practically all world problems have now become our problems. At one time, we could disregard happenings far away in Europe, and in some parts of Asia. We can no longer afford to ignore what happens in Europe or Asia. One' of the most important features of the Minister's statement was the announcement that the Government proposes to appoint a standing committee on foreign affairs. That was a wise decision. The appointment of the committee will enable honourable members to become conversant with world problems, and will give the Australian people a better understanding of tbem. In time to come, the action of the Government in appointing the committee will be regarded as one of the most important things it did. I am sure that the people will follow with great interest the debates that will take place on the recommendations of the committee. We must recognize that Asia has changed. The people of Asia want to control their own destiny, and it is our duty to give them every encouragement by raising their living standards. By so doing, we shall help to promote world peace. By helping to raise Asiatic living standards, this Parliament can ensure that the people of Asia, will become partners in, world development. In the. past, Britain and the United States of America, did a great deal to forward the development of such countries as India, Burma, China and Malaya. Of recent years, however, the people of those countries own affairs, and many of them are training themselves for the task. Recently, when I was examining certain activities 1 in the United States of America, I was astonished to note the number of Chinese and Indian engineers and technical men who had gone there to study industrial and developmental problems to qualify themselves to participate in the development of their own countries on their return. That sort of thing has been going on during the last 25 years, but more particularly during the last four or five years. It is in our interests that the people of Asia should raise their living standards, and accept full responsibility for guiding their own affairs. If they are able to govern themselves on sound lines they will be more likely to prefer the democratic way of life to communism. I propose to refer now to the importance of Africai n the Empire, a matter not previously mentioned in this debate. Strategically, Africa is most important to Australia. In every war that has involved Africa in recent' times, Australia has played a part; Africa is important to us because of the Suez Canal, and because of the Cape route to Europe. We should seek to establish closer relations with South Africa, as well as with New Zealand. Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand have common interests, particularly in defence. When Egypt was under British rule, we knew where we stood in regard to the defence of the Suez Canal and of the Nile Valley. Now, however, British interests in Africa have withdrawn to Kenya, East Africa, Rhodesia, South Africa, and to the various colonies and protectorates. We must establish closer relations with South Africa, Southern Rhodesia and the British colonies in Africa. If we do that, we shall have much to gain from, our overseas activities, and, ultimately, it will have a real effect, on international affairs.",31,International Affairs Given To Him By The English Financiers
99,Mr Eggins (Lyne) [4.34],"I thankAn examination of the position in Europe compels us to recognize more than ever before the difficulties that conlead to a conflict between the Western front the democratic powers. This debate has been of great value, because it has clarified many problems, and emphasized the difficulties in the international sphere, actual fighting. That, briefly, is my view and the responsibilities of the Minister for External Affairs, who is charged with the duty of preserving our peaceful relations with otber countries. Honourable members must be impressed with the absolute need for the strongest efforts to bind into an even closer union all' parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations and the United States of America, because our safety lies in that association of powers. exaggerate when I say that, at any time, the world may be again involved in serious trouble. I am not one of those who believe that war is inevitable, but I recognize that we must be prepared for any emergency. Germany, is divided on a most uneconomic basis into two main zones. The Eastern Zone is controlled by Bussia, and the Western Zone is controlled by the British, Americans and French. The German National-Socialists, who feel intensely proud of their country, believe that the only possible way in which it may rise again will be as tbe result of another war in Europe. That statement may sound unnecessarily stark, but I see no other way in which Germany can rise again while Russia stands astride half the country, and tbe Western democracies occupy the other half. Great Britain and America would withdraw their troops from Western Germany to-morrow if they could be certain that Bussia would not immediately overrun that territory. Socialists base their hopes on another war in Europe, in which Russia will be defeated, and their country will be liberated. Tbey consider that until Bussia has been defeated, there will be little or no hope for Germany. Honourable members must take that factor into consideration when they examine tbe European scene. I should not trust Germany at any time, because I believe that, at the first opportunity, thc National-Socialists would provoke war in order to regain their freedom. They would cause trouble in i::Â«S] the Bussian Zone, or the BritishAmerican Zone in the hope that it would democracies and the Soviet, and they would endeavour to gain their own ends without taking a prominent part in the of the situation in Europe. The honourable"" member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) appears to consider that Mr Churchill and the late President Roosevelt "" sold out"" Europe to Russia at the Yalta Conference. I do not know on what authority the honourable member made that statement. I do not pressed, not by the honourable member for Parkes, but by the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mullens). ber of the Opposition stated that Mr Churchill and tbe late President That great nation, Eoosevelt had sold Europe"" up the river"". Before an honourable member ventures to condemn those two great men, he should consider the circumstances in which the representatives of the Western democracies met the Bussian dictator at Yalta. The war had reached a crucial stage. Great Britain and the United States of America were about to openthe second front in Europe by landing a vast army in France. Statements . that have been made about the Yalta Conference leave the impression that Stalin, with characteristic cunning, made severe demands on President Eoosevelt and Mr Churchill. Probably, the Eussian dictator threatened that if his demands were not met, tbe Soviet would make a separate peace with the Nazis, and withdraw from the conflict in eastern The German NationalEurope. Mr Churchill and President Eoosevelt were placed in an impossible situation. All preparations had been made for the landincr in France, and the success of that large venture might havo been seriously jeopardized if Stalin had made a separate peace with Hitler. The Bussian dictator saw the chance to demand his pound of flesh, and the representatives of Great Britain and the United States of America had to make concessions in order to prevent the development of a split between tbe Allies before the opening of the",32,International Affairs Given To Him By The English Financiers

101,Mr Eggins,"A t all events, a memsecond front. Had Eussia withdrawn from the war at that stage, the whole of thc German Army in Eastern Europe could have been transferred to the Western Front, thereby immeasurably increasing the difficulties of the invaders and certainly causing greater casualties than were suffered. Those considerations must of necessity be recognized before any attempt is made to condemn Mr welfare. Churchill and President Roosevelt for alleged errors of judgment in making concessions to Stalin at the Yalta Conference. The remarks that I have made about Germany apply with almost equal force to Japan. America were to withdraw its occupation troops from that country, there would be little or nothing to prevent Russia from taking control of it. The menace of Russian activity is greater to-day than at any other time in history. The Communists are awaiting an opportunity to spread their influence in every country, and to obtain a grip on the world, economically and politically, until the Soviet Government in Moscow can tell itself with satisfaction, "" Now we have the situation well in hand "". During the last few years, the scope of Australia's influence in international affairs has widened considerably. This country has substantially increased its representation abroad. [Extension of time granted.] Sitting suspended from 4.5^ to S p.m. its courtesy in extending my time. I shall occupy it, in part, by endeavouring to summarize the points wbich I made before the suspension of the sitting. I express my thanks to the Government and to the Minister for External Affairs for placing before this Parliament a factual summary of the events that have taken place in the international sphere and a statement of Australia's policy in relation to them. It is important that our relations with other countries should be understood by honourable members and by the people as a whole. Tbe Government decided to place before bonorable members very early in the life of this Parliament a statement on international affairs so that they, and in particular those who are newcomers to this House, may gain a proper appreciation of our relations with other countries and of the problems that face us in connection with tbem. I strongly support the proposal of the Government to do everything possible to bring about a better understanding between Australia aud the otber member nations of the British Commonwealth. The attainment of such an objective is fundamental to our future I also stress the desirability of achieving the utmost co-operation between ihe British Commonwealth and the TJnited States of America. As the result of the recent war, the TJnited States of America If the TJnited States of has entered much more closely into Pacific affairs than it has ever done before. We sliould encourage that country to extend its bases in the Pacific as close to Australia as possible so that we may have the protection of a strong ally at all times. We need the strength of that great country and the powerful aid of the member nations of the British Empire to enable us to defend the principles of democracy in this part of the world. We should also strive to bring about a better understanding between Australia and ' the Union of Soutb Africa, the Dominion of Rhodesia and the African colonies. All of those countries are important links in the Empire and the better the mutual understanding between them and Australia and New Zealand, the better will we be able to defend this country against an enemy. We are vitally concerned about what is happening in world politics to-day. At our near north, right at our very door, tbe peoples' of Asiatic countries are endeavouring to establish their own institutions of government and to develop their own way of life. We should do our utmost to encourage them to raise their standards so that they in turn may develop to a stage at which their main objective will be the preservation of peace. Unless they are able to develop their own forms of self-government their countries may well fall, into the hands of Russia, in which event the danger to this country would be immeasurably increased. During this debate many references have been made to Germany and Japan. I should not, in any circumstances, trust either the Germans or the Japanese. With Germany un economically divided!",33,International Affairs Given To Him By The English Financiers
102,Mr Eggins,"I thank the House forAS it is at present, half of its area being under the control of Russia and the other .half under the occupation of British and American troops, the Germans believe that only another war in Europe can make it possible for Germany to rise -again. They hope, of course, that they will not be embroiled in the conflict and that Russia will be defeated, thus enabling -Germany to rise again to importance in European affairs. A similar situation -exists in relation to Japan. peace treaty with Japan should be concluded as soon as possible, but even if that oountry grows in importance its repreis done, Japan may still fall into the hands --of Russia. A Russian-controlled Japan would constitute a greater menace to the safety of Australia than is the Japan of to-day. Having regard to the problems that face us in the east and the west, heavy responsibilities rest on every honorable member of this House. We should take every opportunity to study the international situation and to consider its implications. For the first time in our history there is international affairs policy will .be firm. to be established as a part of the legislative machinery of this National Parliament a standing oommittee on foreign -affairs. The proposal for the establishment of such a committee constitutes a very great step forward. The deliberations of the committee will enable its members to make a close study of international affairs. Its activities will bring to the people a realization that more than ever before the difficulties that -confront us in tbe realms of international politics are the responsibilities of all of us. The reports of its deliberations should give honourable members better information of the problems that lie ahead -of us in the international sphere. We should do our utmost to develop our international policy along such lines as will help to promote world peace at all times. In 1948, I had an opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge of the activities of -our representatives in other countries. Erom personal conversations with them, I was able to gauge the responsibilities of their office, and the tremendous difficulties that face the Australian -Government in its relations with other -countries. The map of tbe world is -changing so rapidly that in order to keep abreast of world developments one must study international affairs very closely. Our overseas representatives give to the Government first-hand information ahout the problems that confront the countries to which they have been assigned. Our career diplomats in overseas countries have outstanding qualifications and the results that they have achieved are a credit to them and to this country. They watch the world situation carefully and The advise the Australian Government of all important happenings abroad. As this sentation overseas will have to be widened so that it will be able to play its part fully in international affairs. We have a fundamental responsibility to bring about the greatest co-operation between Australia and the other members of the British Commonwealth. I am sure that all honourable members are imbued with a desire to achieve such an objective. Wc must also achieve the greatest possible measure of understanding with the United States so that the foundations of our There can be no doubt in the minds of honourable members of the importance of this debate. The number of honourable members who have so far taken part in it is an indication of the growing interest of the members of the Parliament generally in Australia's position in international affairs. A great many honourable members opposite appear still to base their views about Australia's future position on a terrible fear of the might of the Soviet Union. However, it must be admitted that even if the Soviet Union did not exist, many of the ills that beset the world to-day would not automatically disappear. For instance, the Soviet is not responsible for the starving millions of people in Asia. It has no responsibility for the difiiculties that now exist in Italy. The peasants of Italy are seizing the land simply because they are land hungry and poverty-stricken. The situation which exists in many countries to-day stems from the continuance of the capitalist order of society. It is rather interesting to note that whilst some honourable members concentrate all their attention on the threat of communism, they do not givo",34,International Affairs Given To Him By The English Financiers
103,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [8.10],"any attention to the spread and the growth of fascism, which is capitalism in its more highly developed form, and which is an even more imminent danger to democracy. Many of those who joined the underground movements in European countries during the last war and assisted the democratic forces of the allies to overthrow the Nazis, are now undergoing terms of imprisonment. Many others have met their deaths at the hands of the fascist authorities who collaborated vvith our enemies during the war. As an illustration I quote what is happening in Greece. In that country many prominent trade unionists have met their deaths at the hands of the fascist element of the community. One unfortunate Greek who was commended by the exiled Greek government for the part he played in the underground movement in Macedonia is now facing trial on a charge of having deserted his post during the occupation of his country. democracy comes from the growth of the fascist forces in those countries.

I do not believe that capitalism is there must be a third world war. I the best system of organizing a nation am one of those who sincerely believe .Ifr. Ward. for tbe good of the people. I am firmly of the opinion that socialism is the correct policy and that therefore socialism is something worth striving for. But in order that capitalism may be saved, some honourable members are prepared to endanger the future of civilization itself. Their view is that they must prepare for the coming threat of the Soviet power against what they term the Western democratic powers. I believe that no genuine effort is being made to-day to preserve the world peace that is so important to the peoples of all lands. Discussions have been along the lines of Atlantic pacts, Pacific pacts and various other pacts. It has been assumed that we are going to have a third world war and if there is going to be a third world war it is obvious that the only two nations capable of waging war on the scale war is waged in modern timesthe United States of America and the The real danger to Soviet Union-mus t participate in it. The tenor of practically all the discussion has been that war is inevitable. I hate to think that war is inevitable. If there us We sbould be doing something to see Both sides will suffer asserted that such action would be merely that we ought to strive to preserve world peace. An arrangement for preserving world peace cannot be made unless the nations start to discuss the subject. That is a principle which applies in everyday life. It applies to our industrial affairs. Eepresentatives of the parties concerned must start discussions and negotiations before they can accomplish an agreement. The same principle applies in regard to international affairs. Probably some of the honourable gentlemen opposite who have taken part in the debate consider that they know a great deal more than I do on these war-like subjects, but I know that the workers, no matter in what country they reside, ultimately lose as a result of their participation in war. They have never gained from any conflict. The greatest threat to Australia's safety would be a resurgent Japan. What is happening? It is said we ought to get closer to tbe TJnited States of America. I should like to see agreement between Australia and the United States of America but I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) that there is more than one opinion on foreign affairs in the United States of America and I should hate to believe that there were members of this House who really believed the American propaganda whicb tells us that the Japanese of to-day, after a few years of occupation, are not the Japanese that we knew and against whom Australians fought in tbe last war. Surely honourable members do not believe that the Japanese have now accepted the principle of democratic government and have abandoned their old ways of life and action in the international sphere. After the first world war some people believed that Eussia would threaten Avorld peace. Is it not a fact that the nazi regime in Germany only came to power and gained in strength because of the tory element in Britain? Hitler would never have gained his position of power without the support of these people. If the workers' government which was in charge of Germany shortly after the end of World WarI . had received tbe same support and cooperation from the British and American authorities as the Nazis it is probable that the enormous burden of expense which in World War II . would not have occurred. But British and American financial interests believed that by strengthening and re-arming Germany they would turn that nation to the east and they did not mind if Germany went to the east and attacked the Eussians. But they made a mistake because Hitler reversed his plan and decided to attack tbe Western Powers. We appear to be going to repeat a stupidity performed after World WarI . If there is a resurgent Japan it could become a real threat to the safety of Australia. 1 agree with the Minister that what happens in this part of the world is of much greater importance to its than what happens on the other side of the world; although, in a sense, whatever happens in any part of tbe world is of great importance to Australia. The great scientists of the world who were responsible for bringing this dreadful atomic power into existence realize what it will mean if we do not achieve international agreement and control of the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb. What does it matter whether there is a Pacific pact or an Atlantic pact if the opposing forces are using atomic bombs? In a conflict in which the TJnited States of America and Great Britain opposed Russia the British would be annihilated. America might have some prospect of survival, although it would certainly suffer enormous damage, and so might the great Soviet power, but Great Britain could not protect itself adequately against atomic bombs. I have spoken to men who saw the destruction of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. When Professor Oliphant addressed the Chifley Cabinet when I was a member of it about two and a half years ago, he told us that bombs had already been developed in America at least 100 times as powerful as those used over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Scientists know the possibilities in the event of another conflict between nations armed with this type of weapon. Britain to-day has many difiiculties to overcome. There is need for improvement in the living standards of the British people, but the living standards of the people of any country cannot be improved to any great extent if they have to bear many cases, although referred to as defence expenditure, is really intended for offensive action. To-day, Britain iÂ» spending Â£800,000,000 a year on its detbat it might strengthen a ring of nations fence programme, but even that expenwhich would eventually endeavour to diture cannot provide Britain with the destroy it. We have to try to induce the type of defences it would require against great nations to discuss tbe need for interatomic bombs. To minimise the destrucnational control of atomic energy.

I understand an additional against the atomic bomb, yet honourable reason why the Russians objected members opposite say there should be no to the scheme of the Western Powers agreement with the Soviet. ""We should was that at the time this inspection was try to obtain agreement and we sbould suggested there was doubt as to whether appreciate that all of the faults for the the Russians knew how to manufacture failure to reach agreement are not on the the atomic bomb and whether tbey had one side.

The Russians established a stockpile.

What so as to prevent them from falling imder the influence of the Communists? Let us be frank. The poverty of the Asian millions would not have become an important subject for debate in thia Parliament or elsewhere had it not been for the fear engendered by the spread of communism. That fear is the motive that has actuated the Government in proposing the formation of a Pacific pact. It is afraid of the growing influence of communism. My own view is that most of the progressive movements in the world to-day are national in character and are not Communist-inspired. Yet it must be said that any movement that is designed to overthrow existing authority or to make great fundamental changes in the organization of a country is dubbed by the political oj>ponents of the Labour party as a Communist revolution ! Most of the teeming millions of Asia are illiterate. Does the Government imagine for a moment that communism means anything to them? They probably do not know the meaning of the word. But they know the meaning of hunger, and tbey know the meaning of imperialism, which has brought hunger to them. They know that they have been exploited by the imperialists, and a great surge of nationalism has arisen for the purpose of overthrowing those oppressors and making great changes in their forms of government. Consider the situation in Indonesia. I am amazed by the present attitude of the Government and its supporters towards that country. Soon after the establishment of the Bepublic of Indoprotest against the proposal of the nesia had been announced, newspapers in Sydney and elsewhere published articles urging Australian businessmen to jump in and seize the opportunity to expand trade because of the goodwill that was said to be entertained by tbe Indonesians towards the Australian nation. Who created that goodwill ? I recall that at the time the Indonesians were fighting for their independence the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) declared very strongly that the moulding of foreign policy had been taken out of the hands of the Australian Government and that decisions were being made and enforced by the Waterside Workers Federation. It is true that the actions of for its members to work as a united the waterside workers in co-operating with the republican movement in Indonesia did more to establish goodwill between Indonesia and Australia than any other factor in recent years. We ought to give the credit where it is due. I remember the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) talking about Dr. Soekarno as a collaborator of the Japanese and the Communists. But now the honourable gentleman has suddenly changed his opinion, no doubt because he has received assurances from Dr. Soekarno that he is not a Communist and approves of the use of capitalist methods of developing Indonesia. . What is tbe situation in China? Question after question has been asked of the Minister for External Affairs concerning the attitude that the Government proposed to adopt towards recognition of the Communist Government of China. The Minister promised that he would deal with that subject when he made his statement on international affairs. I listened very intently to that wordy speech, but not one word was said in it about the attitude of the Australian Government towards the new government of. China. Why does this Government hesitate on the matter? The TJnited States of America and Great Britain, evidently with conflicting interests, bave adopted different attitudes. The Government of the TJnited States of America, instead of officially recognizing the new government of China, has been talking about making some gesture for the defence of Formosa and has made no nationalist forces to blockade part of the coast line of China. The TJnited Kingdom Government has formally recognized the new government. In order to be consistent, therefore, it would have to treat anybody who tried to violate the integrity of that government or of the territory under its control in the same manner as it would treat a pirate. Obviously Australia could become involved very easily in further unfortunate incidents in the east. Where does this Government stand? We have heard a great deal of talk about Australia being a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations and about the need body. Wby have we not worked in unity in relation to China? The Government no doubt finds itself more in sympathy with the policy of the TJnited States of America than with that of the United Kingdom. facts sooner or later. There is a growing tide of nationalism throughout the east, and it must be realized that great changes are impending. The Government cannot maintain capitalism in the form that it would like to maintain it, with imperialist governments exercising dictatorial power to exploit the people of Asia and to suppress freedom of speech and the liberty, of the subject. Even if Australia had the power to after hearing the excellent and compreimpose its will upon other nations and hensive statement of the Minister for wanted to do so, it could still make its External Affairs( Mr Spender) and some greatest contribution to the cause of world of the speeches that have been made by peace by entering into negotiations other honourable members.

I regret that there It must face the has not been more talk in this very important debate about the need for preserving world peace than there has been about preparations for a third world war and how to win it.

104,Mr Mccolm (Bowman) [8.40],"Imenace to tlie Pacific region, because, as history has shown, any nation that goes into China goes into trouble. Up to the present, Soviet Russia has not gone into China. Some members of the present Chinese Government have been greatly influenced by Russian methods and Russian teachings, but a vastly different situation will arise if Russia tries to take any active part in the internal management of the country. I believe that events of the next few years will prove that the Communist Government of China will have tremendous difliculty in controlling the country, because, as has been said, tbe average Chinese is not interested in communism. He is not really interested in any government unless it provides him with what he wants. We know that China suffers from serious famines from time to time. According to recent newspaper reports, about 200,000,000 Chinese are facing starvation now, but I believe that those reports have been grossly exaggerated. usually regional in cliaracter, though, nevertheless, on account of the vast population, they affect millions of people. As armies have rolled backwards and forwards across the country during the wars of recent years, small peasant farmers, who normally grow mo3t of the food for China, hare learned that, if they grow more than they and their dependants can consume, one army or another will seize their surplus. A stage has been reached, and I am speaking about things that have been told me in recent times by people who have spent a long time in China, when the peasants are refusing to sow a greater acreage of grain than they can handle in their own small communities. When that occurs in a country like China it must cause tremendous famine in tbe years to come. Within the next four or five years there will be famine in China on a far greater scale than ever before. If tbe Communist Government is in power when that happens it will be far too concerned with its own internal problems to worry about bothering any other country. The only danger that I see in communism in China today is in the Chinese Government being used for the extension of Communist propaganda into the neighbouring States of Vietnam and Thailand, and thence into Burma and Malaya. That danger should be fought in all possible ways, especially by assisting the other countries of the world to make the internal conditions as good as possible. That should prevent dissatisfaction amongst the people and the consequent growth of communism. The lionorable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) told us that the only thing which would save the world was socialism. Then he told us that, the greatest danger in the world was fascism. He quoted German fascism to prove his point. I suggest that the honourable member has completely forgotten that Hitler's Germany was a national socialist Germany. much socialism in it. experience the honourable member has had of fascism, but I lived under Hitler's national socialism for four and a half Famines in China are years. An honourable member said to-day that he wondered whether any Australians were not overjoyed when Russia came into the last war. When Russia entered the war I was in a German camp near the Baltic, and people in that camp of all nationalities were overjoyed when Russia entered tbe war. At that time the Russian people, as was proved by events, were not prepared for war. As time passed by, and Russia grew in strength and power, it began to put up a tremendous resistance. Then the admiration of the whole world was roused and the sympathy of all people went out to the Russians. I know that is so because I saw the attitude of sympathy growing in that camp. With the assistance of the capitalist countries of the United States and the United Kingdom, the Russians then threw back the German armies and went on to a combined conquest of Germany. When Russia helped to conquer Germany, it missed the greatest opportunity it will ever have of converting the world to communism, because a vast majority of the people of Europe were prepared to accept the Russian form of communism because of what Russia had done during the war. member heard of the Ribbentrop-Stalin pact?",40,International Affairs Given To Him By The English Financiers

I believe that those gentlemen, without whom we would all be national socialists to-day, were firmly convinced that they could, in the future, cope with Stalin. monkeys of them. about Stalin's sincerity, but Roosevelt had none. Roosevelt firmly believed that he could deal with him. That view was no doubt founded on the same basis as the view of the people of Europe at that time. They believed that they could trust Russia, but time has proved that Russia cannot he trusted. In the opening lines of the Minister's statement, it was indicated that the aims of Australian foreign policy are essentially the preservation of peace and our way of life. In considering the preservation of world peace it must be borne in mind that any efforts on our part may be made impotent by the ultimate purpose of Soviet policy. If that policy aims at world domination by Moscow, as it appears to-day, whether the honourable member for East Sydney likes it or not, then if the Soviet Government ever senses itself in a position to embark on world conquest, there can be only one way of preventing war. That is for the western democracies to maintain their fighting services in sufficient strength to match the Soviet at all times. It is not sufficient that one or two of the ""Western Powers should be strong. The United Nations could have ensured world peace had it not been emasculated by the Russian veto. That organization can no longer exert a. great power for peace amongst the more important nations of the world, and therefore all the western democracies or so called western democracies should play their part in preparing for defence against Soviet Russia. The British Commonwealth of Nations would naturally participate in any such scheme and this country should be prepared to shoulder its f u ll share of the burden. It is not enough that we should be strong; it is necessary that Russia, should know' that we are strong. not even enough that Russia should know that we are strong; it should further know that, if necessary, we will use that strength. Some horrible mistakes have been made in the past because world diplomacy has followed a somewhat tortuous line in many respects. Perhaps the worse example of confused diplomacy was given in 1914 when the Kaiser was led to believe that the British Empire woiild not go to war. Our diplomacy must be crystal clear in its intentions. It must be forthright aud honest and must prove to Russia that we sincerely want peace but that we will fight to retain our way of life. The very long statement which was read to the House by the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) is largely a departmental document and is a playback of a lot of things that I have heard before. The burden of the story is that for our own security we should have a Pacific Ocean regional security pact. That pact is to be subscribed to by the western nations in the Pacific as 'well as by the Asiatic nations. We were told a lot about the poverty of Asia and about the communism which always results from poverty. That is a note which the Labour party has been striking for many years. We are ready to subscribe, in part, to the views expressed in the document on the best way of meeting tbe situation beforo us. The people of this country live in a portion of the earth which geographically belongs to Asia. This country comprises 3,000,000 square miles of the British Commonwealth. It is the largest island and the smallest continent in the world, and it has 12,000 miles of coastline enclosing it. This vast territory is inhabited by a comparatively small population which for the most part is jammed betAveen a range of mountains near the eastern coast ancl the eastern seaboard. The country can never he held by us, or by our descendants, unless our population is considerably increased. It is the height of folly to talk of relying on Asiatic nations to give us assistance in the fight against communism as a doctrine, or in a possible fight against Communist China or a resurgent Japan.

111,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [8.55],"is the head throughout tbe Japanese war. The Minister saidI spent several days in Djakarta on iny way to the Colombo Conference, and had thc opportunity of meeting President Soekarno and most of his Cabinet. I formed the conclusion that they were able men with moderate views and a sober realization of the immensity of the tasks in front of them. NowI propose to regale the House with a few statements from the Liberal party propaganda about those men who the Minister found were men of moderate views. In a publication, that I quoted the other night in part, which was issued from Ash-street in Sydney, these sentences appeared. . . Dr. Soekarno, in 1927, as an acknowledged Communist had led a Nationalist revolt in Java resulting in bloodshed, and he fled the country-to go where? To Japan! He was later decoratSd by the Japanese Emperor for service? rendered. On the fall of .lava in 1.042, and within 10 days of that fall, ho was leader of a puppet government for Japan. Soekarno is the one man who has emerged from the recent awful cataclysm without losing any prestige whatever. He was the puppet president in Japan of the Indonesian Republic and is now the president of the Indonesian regime that this Government has recognized. He is the person whom the Minister for External Territories describes as a man of moderate views. On the testimony given by the Liberal party he does not seem to be a man of very moderate views. The Minister, when he was in Opposition, spoke in this House on the 16th February, 1949, about the Delhi Conference to which the honourable member for East Sydney referred a little while ago. Every member of the Liberal and Australian Country parties castigated the resolutions of that conference as a. sellout of the British Empire unti l Mr Churchill said that the work performed by it was tbe acme of statesmenship and something to which he gave f u l l support. Then the criticisms disappeared. honourable member for Warringah said on that dayThat conference affirmed that white people had no right in South-East Asia, and declared that thc Dutch should get out and leave the entire area of tlie so-called Indonesian Eepublic to the political body set up by the collaboraJapanese Commander-in-Chief presented tions with the Japanese, and those who have, in fact, the blood of white people on their hands. Yet the Minister, who is the same honor* able member for Warringah went to Djakarta recently and shook hands w it h the people who, in his own classical terminology, have the blood of white people on their hands. I do not think the Australian .public will readily accept the testimony of the Minister on the work of D r . Soekarno and Dr. Hatta. I shall tell honorahle members what D r . Soekarno himself said over the radio stations of Java during the war. Those statements were monitored by our own Australian short-wave station and were issued in roneo-ed aud printed form by the Dutch from time to time. On the 26th November, 1945, tbe Netherlands East Indies. Government. Informatio n Service issued a document in Melbourne in which Dr.. Soekarno is quoted as having said in June, 1943America WG will iroii out, England we will break open with a crowbar. That, is the gentleman whom the Minister says is a man of moderate views. In November, 1943, Soekarno went to Tokyo to offer thanks at the Yokusumi Shrine to the spirits of the Japanese who fell in the course of Java's liberation. Hirohito conferred on h i m the Order of the Sacred Treasure (Second Class) in recognition of his co-operation with the Japanese military authorities in Java. I wonder whether Dr. Soekarno showed the Order of the Sacred Treasure (Second Class) to the Minister for External Affairs when he so impressed that honourable gentleman with tbe moderation of bis views and the reasonableness of his approach to the problems of his own country and of ours. On the 20th July, 1944, during the festivities to celebrate the Japanese Marine Day, Soekarno saidWo Indonesians wil! continue to co-operate with Japan, even should we be defeated. I am convinced that Japan is right in this war. Now, the Ministerf or External Affairs is The convinced that he is right in the peace. Two days later, Dr. Soekarno made this statementWe, the people of Java, in co-operation with the new Cabinet, will sacrifice our bodies and souls to obtain victory in the present GEA War. On the 12th September, 1944, the Dr. Soekarno with two paintings, one depicting the rising sun set in cherry blossoms, and the otlier Fujiyama, symbols of tbe Japanese spirit and virginity. am no longer Minister for Information . Perhaps the Minister for External Affairs can tell us what was meant. Perhaps he saw those symbols of the Japanese spirit and virginity. Soekarno said on that occasionOJI behalf of the entire people I herewith express our gratitude to the Japanese forces who regard us as their younger brothers, and who guide us politically as well as economically and in military affairs. Your Excellency That means the Japanese Commanderin-Chief accept the slogan of "" Indonesia Baroe""(New Indonesia) ""Do or die with Japan"". I eliminate a number of interesting and illuminating excerpts, and pass on until we arrive at the 19th August, 1945, when the independence of Indonesia was declared by the Japanese Commander-inChief, who named Soekarno as President of the Bepublic of Indonesia. The Japanese announced that henceforth they would leave the Government in the hands of Soekarno, confining themselves to the maintenance of law and order. Then came Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, who, insofar as he could, put an end to all that. When he received the surrender of the Japanese, he commanded them to annul their proclamation of the Republic of Indonesia. But Soekarno bas not changed. He has been talking quite a good deal lately, and I have a little dossier on him . According to the Melbourne Sun News Pictorial of the 17th January last-m y friend, Sir Keith Murdoch, would not let me clown-thi s is what Soekarno saidIrian (Dutch New Guinea) would join the Indonesian Fatherland before the end of the year. But tbe most interesting quotation is the following: Indonesians fought the first battle for indecally Indonesia on the one hand from pendence against the British force at Sourabaya in 1945. Now, the Minister for External Affairs asks us to believe that a republic led by such a man could be a bulwark for the defence of this country. We are relying on a rotten reed if we rely on Soekarno. The Minister says he was impressed witli what Soekarno, and Hatta and one or two others, had told him. He then repudiated the claim that Indonesia was going to grab Dutch New Guinea before the end of the year as not worthy of consideration. These are his wordsHonorable members will recall that an unofficial spokesman and I emphasize the words "" unofficial spokesman "", as if he were a person of no account. He continued. . . in Indonesia recently declared thnt Australian New Guinea should be incorporated in Indonesia. I thought it desirable to make an immediate rebuttal of any such claim, and I was pleased to see that the Indonesian Government lost no time in disclaiming that it enjoyed any official support. That was a misleading statement. Yamin's statement 'did enjoy official support. I quote fro m that great organ of public opinion, the Melbourne Argus, which reported the Minister for External Affairs as 'follows:Any such claim would not admit a moment's consideration. It would be rejected immediately. That statement was published on the 1st February last, but D r . Usman, who is about to be recognized by this country as ambassador for the Bepublic of Indonesia, addressed an adult education summer school somewhere in Australia on the l l t h January, and is reported i h the Melbourne Age of the following day as having saidIndonesians are anxious that their new Republic shall include Dutch New Guinea, as the Dutch had agreed to it when they created the State of East Indonesia in 1940. I interpolate the observation that I do not believe that the Dutch ever agreed to any such thing. D r . Usman declaredDutch New Guinea belongs to us. We have all declared in our various ways, and on various occasions, that the Indonesians have no more claim to Dutch New Guinea than they have to Siam. There is what is known as the Wallace Line, that divides ethnically and geographiDutch New Guinea and Papua and the Australian mandated territory of New Guinea on the other hand. The Minister for External Affairs did not tell us that Dr. Usman had made that claim on the l l t h January and that he had allowed it to pass. The Minister seized on Yamin's",42,International Affairs Given To Him By The English Financiers

There was also the statement by Soekarno, published in the Melbourne Sun-News Pictorial on the 17th January, a fortnight before the Minister disputed the claim by Indonesia, to Dutch New Guinea. I refer to the statement in which he declared that I r i a n , or Dutch New Guinea, would join the Indonesian fatherland before the end of the year. The Minister did not attack Soekarno for making that statement, nor have we been told that he asked Soekarno to repudiate it. A t any rate, Soekarno certainly did not repudiate the statement. I now turn to the SundayT r u t h of the 12th March, only a little more than a week ago, in which is published the following message from D j k a r t a : Indonesian ambitions to take over western his claim by saying that democracy New Guinea were dramatically highlighted to-day, when the Indonesian Lower House reand communism, as distinct from comsolved that the territory must be brought under munistic imperialism, can live together.

Tbe first world existence as a western nation; the other war ended with communism installed condition is the abandonment of the White over more than one-sixth of the earth's Australia policy. We shall never be able surface and dominating the lives of to make an alliance with Indonesia or 180,000,000 people. In the second world any other Asiatic country unless we give war, Russia was mauled, but communism to the people of that country the same was strengthened. That is certainly one opportunity to settle in Australia as is of the extraordinary paradoxes of modern enjoyed by Europeans, and we could do history. To-day, communism has moved that only at our peril. We have never westward to the Oder-Neisse line, in allowed it , and we cannot abandon the White Australia policy now. L i otber parts of his statement, the Minister tried to glide over difficult problems. I was amazed at the temerity he exhibited in niaking the following statement:We do not accept the inevitability of a clash between the democratic and Communist way of life; there is no logical reason why democracy and communism (as distinct from Communist imperialism) should not be able to live together in the world. The claim that the democracies and communism can live in the world together is the Russian Communist line; it is the Affairs says, in effect, "" That is all right with ine, too"". It cannot be done, no matter how he qualifies What is the distinction between comance with the teaching of dialectical about world revolution? It has always T world cannot be divided in t.he way the central Europe, south to the Adriatic, and to within a comparatively short distance of the Dardanelles. engulfed China, and is moving south and south-west towards India and the islands to the north and north-west of Australia. A third world war might destroy Russia. I think that the Americans would undoubtedly be successful in such a conflict, yet so much human misery and material destruction would be caused by it that communism would then probably be entrenched over an even greater area of the earth's surface than it occupies to-day. I believe that there are spiritual weapons with whicb to fight communism, but I also believe that there are materialistic considerations, and that it is right to st.rongthen those countries that may be affected by communism, and certainly to strengthen our own country primarily against such an evil. I mean by that an improvement of our social and economic conditions. I do not think that, in national affairs any more than in the life of an individual, salvation can come from outside. Man's salvation depends primarily upon his own effort, and the nation's salvation depends upon its own efforts. Minister for Immigration nearly five years ago, I expressed the opinion in this Parliament and outside it that we might have only 20 or 25 years in which to make the best possible use of our second chance to survive. I stated that there was an obligation upon everybody to help as many people as possible to come to this country while we yet had time to increase tbe population of this nation as rapidly as we could. We are taking calculated risks, but -risks nonetheless, but any risk that we take in increasing the population of this country is small and insignificant, compared with the risk of leaving it unoccupied and a prey to those who may be inclined to attack us. [Extension of time granted.] sorry that my time is so short, because I should like to say a good deal about this matter. I disclaim the views that have been expressed by honourable members opposite to tbe effect that realism is the key-note of the foreign policy of the Menzies Government. realistic, we should not be worrying about Pacific pacts with Asiatic nations. Hr. CalweU. We should put our faith in whatever we can do for ourselves, and in whatever Communism has assistance we can get from the United States of America. At the moment, that country is not interested in making a Pacific pact with Australia. New Zealand and Canada are in the same category, whilst England is in no position to accept commitments outside Europe, and, unfortunately, is not even strongenough to adequately discharge its commitments in Malaya and other places. The American concentration in thePacific is in the area from the Aleutian Islands to the Philippines. Its main centre of activity is based upon Japan. American global strategy, as I see it, is designed to use England on one side of the earth's surface and Japan on the other as aircraft-carriers from wbich to use its weapons upon Russia. America will increase its strength in the Pacific in the area to which I have referred, and at the moment it is not interested in any area south of that. Manus Island. Therefore, when I became interested in Manus Island to the degree to which the position was misrepresented by some people. There is no statement in any documents to the effect that the Americans ever requested that ManusIsland should be ceded to the United States of America, or that we should forgo our authority over that island. However, that is now history. America to-day may be a defensive screen for us against Communist China, but other forces are rising closer to this country. I believe that the Minister for External Affairs should tell Soekarno, Yamin, Hatta, Sjahrir and other Indonesiansthat no nation shall come into Dutch .New Guinea, other than the Dutch, and that if any otber people try to interI am fere, the Australian Government will assert its authority in that territory before them. I do not express that view because I believe that we sbould be imperialistic or should want to annex any territory. I have said before that the suzerainity over the territory of Dutch If we were New Guinea should be granted to tbe United Nations, and that that organization should give a trusteeship to Holland alone, or to Holland and Australia",44,International Affairs Given To Him By The English Financiers

115,Mr Calwell,"Americ a was neverjointly; but we can never allow any -other people to come within that area, because if we do, the whole of Northern Australia will become untenable. This debate has served a useful purpose, reality, and abandon some of those probut I consider that some honourable gentleposals. He should not mislead himself men opposite should have paid a tribute, as the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan) did, when in Opposition in the Eighteenth Parliament, to the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) regarding the honour that was conferred upon this country and upon the right honourable gentleman himself when he was elected President of the General Assembly of the TJnited Nations. That is the highest omce within the gift of the free peoples of the world. Tbe right honourable gentleman discharged the duties and responsibilities of his high office with great credit to himself and some advantage to the Australian nation. I expected that the Minister for External Affairs would make some references to Europe. On the 28th May next, 600,000 Germans are to march into the Western sector of Berlin under the control and protection of 30,000 German policemen who have heen trained by the Bussians. The Russians have said that tbey will give protection to those Germans who march into the Western sectors in a neoHitler putsch. If those Germans are able to march from the Russian sector and assert their authority for a few hours in the Western sectors, not many weeks will have elapsed before they will return, and the Allies will be forced out of Berlin. If that should happen, it will not be many months before Russian influence will stretch far beyond the OdorNeissline to the English Channel. In deed, before long Russian influence will be dominant from the Baltic Sea to tbe Mediterranean Sea, and across to the English coast. That state"" of affairs can happen over night. We live in a most difficult and dangerous world. We have few friends. The day of the white man's supremacy and domination in Asiatic countries has ended, but the day of the white man's influence is not yet over, if we are able to help other people who have obtained the right to govern themselves, in the way to peace. I do not believe that the salvation of this country can be assured, or even possiblyguaranteed by pacts of the kind that have been envisaged by the Minister for External Affairs. He should get down to or the nation into believing that the exchange of ambassadors with the Philippines Government and the Indonesian Goverament will give us added security or added friendship. The Filippinos and the Indonesians will not give us real friendship unless we agree to allow their nationals to come into this country, as we allow Europeans to enter it, despite the fact that those countries themselves, as well as all Asiatic countries, have discriminatory laws in respect of thr entry of other Asiatic people. I conclude on this note. The Minister directed attention to the fact that there are Chinese throughout the Pacific area, including 5,000,000 in Malaya, and that thcy all are friends of the new Communist Government. It was because I believed that they formed a potential fifth column that I wanted to remove the 600 war-time refugees of Chinese origin who are still in this country, yet the Menzies Government has decided to allow them to remain in Australia. I listened with intense personal interest to the statement on foreign policy that was delivered by the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender). Insofar as I am in a position to judge, the statement was frank and forthright, and I welcome now, as I welcomed before during the debate on the motion for tbe adoption of the Address-in-Reply, the Government's splendid intention to establish an all party standing committee on foreign affairs. I assume that the two parties that constitute the Government, and the Opposition, will be represented on that committee. I am hopeful that it may do as much for us as similar committees have done for other countries within and without the British Empire. As I stated, I listened with intense personal interest to the speech of the Minister for External Affairs and I have since listened with the same degree of interest to the speech of the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), but",46,International Affairs Given To Him By The English Financiers
116,Mr Roberton (Riverina) [9.25],"I confess to an increasing feeling of utter bewilderment. Eoreign policy affects tbe lives of every man, woman and child in this country in an accutely personal way, yet the subject was discussed by the right, honourable member as something remote and wholely impersonal, and as an academic thesis or some kind of involved political abstraction. Such an approach is of no earthly value to me. Speaking as a member of the working class if tbere is a working class, and honorably members opposite assure me that there isI say emphatically that to treat foreign affairs as an academic thesis is of uo earthly .use to me or to the electors of Riverina. I use the word "" earthly "" in its literal sense. Foreign policy is an acutely personal matter, and must be laced in an acutely personal way. If this discussion is to be in the clouds, I admit quite frankly that I have no contribution to make to it, because it will not serve any purpose for me, as a member of the Parliament, representing a rural constituency. The foreign policy of a free country should be the deliberately predetermined Miul expressed attitude of tbe people of tliat country towards the people of any and every other country. That matter is nf the greatest personal importance to me and to every good Australian. As a country man, I consider that it is not possible for us to occupy this continent effectively unless we can be reasonably certain of periods of comparative peace. Foreign policy is designed to achieve that condition. A sound foreign policy is more important to us now than it has ever been before. We are, numerically, if for no other reason, the weakest link in tbe chain of continents, and that situation has developed within recent years. For the first time in our history, we find oursociety. Nor was it .exclusive to us. The selves utterly defenceless, and grimly and terribly vulnerable, and it is the urgent duty of this Parliament to rectify that lamentable position. To-day, no powerful British Navy sails the seven seas, nnd no British armies are posted at Strategic points throughout the world. To-day fhe influence of the great British people has been reduced to a shadow of its former self. We are not a race of people that is native to this country. Unfortunately that fact is very often for* Mr Roberton. gotten. Indeed, it was forgotten in this House last night. So that, whether we like it or not, we began by having kith and kin scattered all over the world. We can be loyal to our own kith and kin or we can be disloyal to them. The choice has always been ours, and it still is. Conversely, of course, our kith and kin can either be loyal or disloyal to us. The choice, on the other hand, has always been theirs, and it still is. We could renounce the British Empire, or the Empire could renounce us; we could betray the British Empire, or the Empire could betray us. Up to this point in our history, it has always been presupposed, both at home and abroad, that we should want to remain loyal to our kith and kin wherever they may be, and that they in turn would want to remain loyal to us. The time has come for a clear restatement of the position. Such a restatement of the position is, in my opinion, basic to the fundamentals of Australian foreign policy. Withouti t we are a vagrant people soliciting shabby, illicit and impermanent friendships in the streets of the world. When I listened to the right honourable member for Barton discussing foreign affairs as if they were new and obscure stars that he himself had discovered in the celestial sphere, the thought came to me that our foreign policy of the last 50 years, with all its faults-whic h no one knows better than I do-ha s been extraordinarily good to both of us and, indeed, to every honourable member in this House. When we were born into this world tbe British Empire was strong enough to give that degree of comparative peace and security that was necessary to enable us to establish ourselves as more or less reputable members of democratic strength of the British Empire was available to every ""man and every nation of good intent. It opened the doors of opportunity, and held them open, for the right honourable member for Barton, for me, and for every man and every nation willing to play the game of life according to the simple, decent rules laid down by ordinary British people. That was the blessed state of affairs that brought me from obscurity, through education, to the plough, and brought the right honourable member for Barton from tlie same obscurity, tlirough education, to distinction. The world was wide open to both of us. We could go anywhere and engage in any form of activity, and as long as we observed the simple rules of decency, we were safe and no one could harm us. Twice during the last 50 years that blessed state of affairs was attacked with increasstrength will not, in itself, be suflicient. ing violence, and twice during the same period it was saved for me, for the right honourable member for Barton, and for every honourable member of this House by the blood, sweat and tears of valiant men and women. We have survived, but the heart of the Empire has been torn and shattered, not by our enemies, but by our self-inflicted wounds. That, is our shame. Twenty years ago no man and no nation had anything to fear while the British Empire was strong. To-day every free man and every free country is in deadly fear of communism. That is what comes of disaffection, of destructive criticism, and of the British blaming the British for all the wretchedness and woe that have been visited on the world since the dawn of h u in an history. Yet that disaffection, that destructive criticism is voiced in this House. Here, too, the British blame the British for all the wretchedness and woe that are evident in the world. Such criticism is unworthy of honourable members and of our British tradition. These self-inflicted wounds are bleeding us to death. The sooner there is a general recognition of that sad fact, the sooner shall we be in a position to rectify that deplorable and tragic state of affairs. Wc, who have enjoyed comparative peace and security in the past, have wantonly destroyed any prospect of comparative peace and security for our children. The conditions that the right honourable member for Barton and I enjoyed wben we were children are not now available to our children or, in fact, to any British child throughout the world. We have lost the strength that gave us that security. In my humble and contrite opinion it should be the first objective of a sound foreign policy to re-establish that strength as rapidly as possible. A foreign policy is utterly useless unless as a first step it provides for the restoration of the strength of the Empire. The restorative process must begin by the component parts of the British Empire bringing to those parts of the world over which they have any influence a maximum degree of production, not exclusively for the benefit of the British people, but for the benefit of mankind. A restoration of economic It must be coupled with a restoration of military strength if for no other reason than to enable the Empire, in association vvith other reputable. nations, to bring ahout a general re-arrangement of human affairs under which nations will be compelled to behave. With the strength of the Empire restored we can once again win the confidence of our friends and merit the respect of our enemies. If we bring about closer relations with Western Europe and the United States of America we shall be able to attract to our cause every free and peace-loving people on the face of the earth. That is the only possible answer to the threat of communism. I was intensely interested ' to hear the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) express himself in terms that led me to believe that he, too, wants to buttress the free countries against the threat of communism. 'Outside the Empire, or within a weak and impotent Empire, we are the Achilles heel in South-East Asia, without even the protection of a sock of western civilization. We have nothing to offer to Indo-China, Thailand, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia or the Philippines except advice, the responsibility for our defence and tbe blind admiration of a section of our people for their revolt against the French, the British and the Americans. That advice and admiration will be rejected for the very reasons that have been stated by the honourable member for Melbourne. It has to be admitted that there are alternatives to the restoration of the strength of the British Empire, and the people should be told of them, not in academic terms, but in terms of stark realism. PerhapsI may be permitted to mention a few of them that I regard as particularly unsatisfactory. [Extension of time granted.'] I am indebted to the House for its courtesy in extending my time. The first possible alternative is a policy of isolation. If we adopt a policy of complete isolation from our kith and kin, from the Empire and from the world, that could only serve to excite the contempt of our friends and the cupidity of our enemies. Invasion would be inevitable and the consequences would be disastrous. So we must rule out isolation as an alternative foreign policy. Perhaps we can toy with the idea of partial isolation. At tlie first sign of danger we could go screaming once again to the TJnited States of America to save us from the consequences of our own criminal negligence. But the TJnited States of America would not be likely to hear our cry. After its last bitter experience, it would be more likely to let us scream our beads off like a truculent child, as a salutory punishment for onr own neglect. We could explore the possibilities of entering into alliances with all sorts of people. Perhaps we could try Ceylon, India and Pakistan. It. has to be remembered, of course, that, else, the same degree of security and the States of Ceylon, India and Pakistan are still experiments that have to be tested in the crucible of experience. They have to compose their religious ancl racial differences, and that has never been an easy problem either there or anywhere else."" We could try Ireland. We conld try the new Scotland that is allegedly to arrive after the new battle of Bannockburn has been fought and won. We could hawk ourselves all over the world trying to find an ally. But whatever country we entered into an alliance with, we should be expected to rush to its aid at the first sign of its danger with all our resources in men and material and we have never been good at that. There are people in this country who would welcome an alliance with Soviet Bussia at this very moment as the complete solution of all our international problems. That would be a base betrayal of our heritage and could happen only after the extermination of every man who values the spiritual and temporal liberty that British people have enjoyed throughout history. Perhaps the TJnited Nations gives us a final opportunity to escape from our own responsibilities in foreign affairs. I some realization of the basic truth of this 3fr. Roberton. am very glad that even the right honourable member for Barton has not suggested that we should rely on the TJnited Nations to iron out any of our international difficulties. The right honourable gentleman did mention with considerable pride the partition of Palestine as a splendid example of the effectiveness of the work of the United Nations. There are millions of Arabs who will not agree with him and millions of other people who cannot see merit in the arbitrary division of a country, regardless of the sentiments of the people of that country-no t even this one. It is the duty of this Parliament to devote what talents it may have to an examination of the position of foreign affairs in order to re-establish the strength of the British Empire for the sake of all good people, and for the everlasting good of mankind, and in order that the right honourable member for Barton and I may leave to our children, if to no one liberty that he and I have enjoyed for so long. I rise to support the motion for the printing of the paper on foreign policy submitted to this House' last week by the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender). I regard that paper as a very complete and comprehensive review of the foreign policy that was laid down in the Governor General's Speech and during the pre-election period by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the leading members of the Liberal and Australian Country parties. The main basis of Australian foreign policy, as it is laid down in this document, should be complete co-operation with the British Commonwealth in order to preserve our way of life and to preserve peace in the world. Whilst it is reasonable for the Minister for External Affairs to indicate that peace in South-East Asia is of vital importance to Australia, it is equally important to all other South East Asian countries. It is reasonable to assume that, irrespective of the various nationalistic movements in those countries, there must he amongst the educated people wbo are leading those movements,",47,International Affairs Given To Him By The English Financiers
117,Mr Graham (St. George) [9.61],"fact. We must endeavour to be realistic. Equally as important as our own ideas and attitude towards the foreign nations involved is there attitude towards us. In the assessment of these facts, I believe that the House has become slightly confused during this debate. I do not think that tbe honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) could sincerely believe the statements he has made unless he is unaware of the actual facts associated with this case. I do not wisb to maintain the general tenor of the debate shocking inactivity and spinelessness.. that war with the Soviet Union is inevitable. I believe there is one chance for the avoidance of a third world war, and that is the removal of the leaders of' the Politburo in Moscow. Time, which is the great healer, may provide mankind with some form of escape. If the policy that is in existence to-day is continued, we shall have to meet, that poliey of the Politburo with force. The leaders of the Politburo have evolved what I described to this House recently as the most diabolical and efficient conspiracy that mankind has ever known. It is not sufficient to speak about attempts at compromise. We have to realize that in dealing with the Soviet Union we are dealing with people who have maintained a state of hostility since the cessation of what has been described as the shooting war in 1945. There has been no cessation of hostilities. The war is still going on. The matter is merely one of a change of attitude on our part and an awareness of the real facts involved is required. tastic fashion in which the Soviet That awareness is dependent upon the capacity of the governments involved. I agree with many of the statements that have heen made by the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Roberton). It is deplorable that the policy of the British Empire during the last ten or fifteen years-particularl y since the end of the war-shoul d have resulted in what has been described as the dismemberment of the British Empire. It is reasonable for a person who believes in socialism to be a believer in passive resistance. The Government of the United Kingdm appears not to have been particularly worried about tbe reduction of Britain's international status. From 1945 onwards its policies have made it abundantly clear that it was more interested in tbe establishing in its own country of what it regarded as a desirable form of governmental economy than of maintaining the strength of . its Empire overseas. Despite the good feeling and' the ties of kinship .that exist between this country and Great Britain, we should be able to criticize the British Government's policy. It is balderdash to say that, we should deny ourselves the right of criticizing the British Government. ThatGovernment has been guilty of the most During the last eighteen months the prestige of Britain in the Far East has= dropped to an all-time low and had it not been for the lieutenant-commander of a little ship called Amethyst, it would have been lower to-day than in all past history. It was the work of that lieutenant-commander that restored Britain's prestige at least, temporarily in the Far East. It is evident that the socialists in the United Kingdom have made up their minds that being an empire does not interest them. The Australian socialist Government recently made it abundantly clear that it was more interested in being a Commonwealth than in preserving the Empire. It is useless to turn to enemy nations with an abundance of good faith, in the milk of human kindness. History has revealed that human beings cannot be trusted beyond a certain point. I have no brief for the Soviet Union. I have great respect and admiration for the fanpeople have achieved their aims. To speak of Mao Tse-tung as being a deviationist or a Tito-ist, or something of that ilk, is to my mind sheer stupidity. His achievements almost parallel the early achievements of Genghis Khan. He bas provided a complete army in China, well-equipped and well-generalled. He has outfought, and out-generalled the forces of the Kuomintang and has beaten them completely and utterly. He has been lauded in Moscow and has set up a Communist government. There can be no doubt that the aggressive tactics that have been developed by the Communist forces will be brought into full play by that Chinese generalissimo. We should be foolish to imagine that he will permit Hong Kong to remain as it is or that we can come to an agreement with him, for any given length of time, over the commercial interests that the British peoples have in the Orient. One cannot make peace with dictators and keep face. One honourable member said earlier to-day that the Australian force in Japan was causing us to lose face because of the peculiar mental standards of the Japanese people and their attitude towards the fact that Australia is not sharing fully with the United States of America in the government of that country. I believe that the interpretation of the oriental outlook is of vital importance. We must be militant if we are to maintain our prestige in the Far East. Otherwise we shall be virtually dislodged from the Orient and forced either to go to war or to back down. One cannot make peace with dictators and maintain national prestige. The cold war situation that exists to-day, with fifth column developing throughout the world, represents merely a variation of the standards of war. Peace does not exist. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, there has been no cessation of hostilities. If ever people lost face, surely the Westeru Powers did so at the beginning of the Berlin blockade. Only the brilliance with which the airlift was carried out restored in some measure our prestige with the German people and the rest of the world. But the very fact that the airlift was necessary was absurd. The senior Russian military authorities must have asked themselves, "" Are these people so anxious for peace that they will get down on their knees and beg us to lift tbe blockade?"" reasonable appeal to Russia without success? For honourable members to suggest that there is a reasonable hope of making peace with dictators is absurd. Such situations have existed before, and I have studied with interest the history of the periods of uneasy peace which, in the past, have been only breathing spaces between wars. I refer honourable members to the situation that existed in tbe early part of the nineteenth century, when the French empire of Napoleon Bonaparte found it necessary to come to some form of hypocritical agreement with the British found that the Government of Great Mr Graham. Britain, because of its own inertia and weaknesses within the country, was willing to accept peace at any price. One of the greatest Englishmen of all time took his place in the House of Lords during that period, and he made a statement which, in my opinion, embodied a principle that should be basic to tbe foreign policy of every nation. That man was Admiral Lord Nelson. He saidI , my Lords, have, in different countries, seen much of the miseries of war. I am therefore in my innermost soul, a man of peace. Yet would I not, for the sake, of any peace, however fortunate, consent to sacrifice one jot of England's honour. Our honour is inseparably combined with our genuine interest. That statement still is absolutely true, and if we remember it and make an honest and sincere approach to the problems of foreign policy we cannot go .far wrong. At least we shall go down in history as bonorable men. We shall activities inevitably lose our honour if we continue to talk about the possibility of compromise. Nevertheless I do not believe that we should regard war as being inevitable. There is a chance that time will be our ally and that, with good fortune, the world will be rid of the leaders of the Politburo. Despite our basic interest in the Asiatic scene, we should not lose sight of what is happening in Europe. One interesting story that has not been discussed either in this House or in the House of Commons is that of the fate of tbe German army that was captured at Stalingrad in 1942. I remind honorahle members that Field-Marshal Von Panlus and his German forces were surrounded Did we not make every at Stalingrad in that year and captured. They were offered some form of relief and assistance during the ensuing years of the war on the condition that they accepted certain doctrines and undertook certain training. It has been revealed that Field-Marshal Von Paulus Ls now back in Germany with a large portion of tbe army that was captured at Stalingrad, trained and indoctrinated by the experts in Moscow in order that, when the occupation of Germany ceases, thore will be one powerful force at least in eastern Germany ready to take over tbe country. Would honourable members Government. Napoleon opposite say that the planning for this move did not start years and years ago? Are we being unreal and unfair in levelling that charge at the Union of Soviet Socialist Eepublics? Pursuing the same line of thought, I ask whether any honourable member will assure me that the Union of Soviet Socialist Eepublics would have lifted even one finger to attempt to stop the Webrmacht and the Luftwaffe if they had crossed the English Channel in 1940? Does any honourable member suspect that the Eussians would have been our allies if they had not been first attacked by the German armies? The Eussian leaders are dictators intent upon the domination of the entire globe, ancl tbe sooner honorour White Australia policy. Economicable members realize that fact the better will it be for us. Their disciples have infiltrated every nation and are endeavouring to infiltrate every household, school, parents and citizens association, ex-servicemen's organization, trade organization and trade union in every community. Nowhere is there a group of people which can regard itself as being safe from the interference of agents directed from Moscow. There is abundant evidence to support the truth of that statement. The socialist approach to the threat of communism has a certain ring of sincerity about it. If honourable members opposite really believe everything that they say, their attitude is logical. Nevertheless, I cannot understand how they can believe that the vast movements in Asia, where millions of people are being led by odd groups of militants, are only nationalist in character. declare that the peoples of Asia can form themselves into great industrial nations. But do they believe that, even if standards of living in Asia could be raised quickly to the level that is enjoyed in Australia, the progress of this new movement would stop? Such a belief would be ridiculous. [Extension of time granted.""] There is a story that, when Dr. Sun Yat Sen was approached by American engineers who promised that they would irrigate China and build great dams, he replied, """"Why, if you do that China will not have its outlet! ""We have such a colossal population increase that we must have our regular floods and otber disasters "". A proper appreciation of circumstances in Asia is essential to an intelligent approach to ita problems. Members of the Opposition who speak idly, for political reasons, of imperialism and the inevitability of war do their politcal party irreparable barm. Any analysis of the problems of Asia must be made on a logical level if it is to be of any use. We.do not believe that the sudden thrust of communism can be countered without a great deal of planning and assistance. We believe tliat, we can assist Asiatic nations by securing the co-operation of various movements within those nations but we do not consider that, in the process, we must amend ally, we have no choice but to maintain the White Australia policy, and in any case vve have no desire to change it. I wish that Mr Churchill were the Prime Minister of Great Britain. That wish may he dictated by my political faith, but honourable members opposite should not imagine for a moment that I , and others like rne, would not go anywhere to fight for Mr Attlee's right to be the Prime Minister of Great Britain. We bave not lost faith in democracy. Some honourable members opposite have said that democracy became defunct in Australia on the 10th December last, but we do not believe that democracy has died in the United Kingdom. However, we look for a .co-ordination of policy with the United Kingdom. We believe that we should face the world together and declare the unity of British They races. That attitude bad meaning in the days of Pitt, Palmerston and Disraeli and during World WarI . and World War II . But the Bussians showed us in Berlin what it means to be British to-day. The honourable meniber for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) spoke of the preparations for a great march of Communist youth in Berlin next month. He may have based his statement on recent newspaper reports. I hope so, because I believe that the Eed Army would be the last authority in the world to issue an official statement to the effect that it would defend those young men during tbeir invasion of the Western zone of Germany. After all, such an announcement would bring Eussia very close to an immediate declaration of war. jnember that that was the Western sector. gentleman to say whether it was an authoritative statement.

124,Mr Speaker (Hon. Archie,"It will aflord me much pleasure to convey to to implement them. Not only in MelHis Most Gracious Majesty the King the message of loyalty from the House of Representatives of the Commonwealtli of Australia to which the Address gives expression. THE PARLIAMENT. -Cameron) --On Wednesday last the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Treloar) asked me a question regarding the wearing of campaign or service ribbons by attendants of the House. I have made inquiries into this matter and have found that there is no record of any previous instruction to attendants. It appears, however, to be a well-established practice in many Gommonwealth buildings for attendants in uniform to wear service ribbons, and I see no reason why it should not -be adopted in thc House. As this matter concerns the whole of the -building, I conferred with Mr President, and he concurs in this view. Accordingly, steps will be taken to advise the attendants that ribbons may be worn on their uniforms should they so desire. Motion (hy Mr ""WHITE) proposedThat the House do now adjourn. number of private hospitals in Melbourne and throughout Australia are closing down. Numerous other hospitals are restricting the services that they render to the public because of lack of staff. The hospitals at Bentleigh, Ormond, and elsewhere are closing down or are indicating that in the future they will be unable to take midwifery cases. Thousands of people are being turned away from hospitals to die. They cannot get admittance, and those suffering most seriously are tbe people whoso economic conditions are the worse. Because of that fact, I invite the attention of the Government to .the position and stress the necessity for urgent action in order to make the conditions in the nursing profession more attractive. The Government has realized its responsibilities in. connection with health by providing large stuns of money for medical and hospital schemes, but those schemes will never come to actuality if staff is not available bourne but also elsewhere throughout Australia this position is to be found. Eecently an ex-member of the nursing profession in South Australia wrote a book entitled A Microbe is (Hem. AroMe Close Behind Tou. In that book she stressed the difficulty of obtaining qualified and suitable nurses. In the light of what I have put, I emphasize the necessity for the Government to take some action to provide scholarships or subsidies for the nursing profession, so that nurses may be attracted to the hospitals and other health institutions of this country. Air and Minister for Civil Aviation) [10.26],-i7 i reply-I shall pass on to the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) the honourable member's representations in connection with the shortage of nurses. It is unfortunately true that a shortage of nurses exists. There are many reasons for that. There is a shortage of men and women in almost every occupation in life at present. I cannot agree that the position with regard to nursing in Melbourne hospitals is quite as bad as the honourable member indicated. Prince Henry Hospital is embarking on very large extensions, and one of the principal buildings in the scheme is the nurses' quarters. Most other hospitals are also extending their premises. Hospitalization is one of the main factors in the Government's health scheme, which will be before honourable members shortly. Pree medicine, whioh the previous Government concentrated on, is of minor importance compared witii the necessity for skilled nursing and more hospitals. The Bed Cross Association has a home nursing scheme, and hopes that in every .home in Australia some person, man or woman, will learn something about nursing. WhatI have said should encourage the honourable member because I know that he is sincere in his representations. The proposal for scholarships and other means of attracting nurses is being considered by the Government, which is fortunate in having an excellent surgeon and an eminent memher of the medical profession as its Minister for Health.
