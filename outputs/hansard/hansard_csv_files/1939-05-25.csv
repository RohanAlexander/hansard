It is particularly necesto a question, the Postmaster-General sary that honourable members should be given that opportunity since Parliament is soon to go into recess for two months, and possibly longer. I take this stand because I know that some members of my own party desire to bring forward urgent matters of public importance. Doubtless, some supporters of the Government are in the same position, and I should he amazed if some members of the Country party do not raise questions of vital importance to the primary producers of Australia. Yesterday, I gave reasons why, in my opinion, it would be unwise to deprive honourable members of the opportunity to discuss three motions on the notice-paper. I realize that I cannot discuss those subjects now, but I stress the wisdom of providing opportunities to acquaint Ministers, with matters that have been . brought under the notice of honourable members by the electorates. I ask the Prime Minister not to adopt this autocratic attitude so early in his career, but to give opportunities for the fullest discussion of matters of vital importance to the people of Australia. The motion of the right honourable gentleman savours of tliat inner group dictatorship which we heard condemned by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) last year. I hope that the present Government will not attempt to adopt dictatorial methods, notwithstanding the evidence of a desire on the part of the Prime Minister to have in his own hands the supreme control of the business of Parliament. He should remember that his Government and party do not represent a majority in this Parliament. I protest against this motion, and I hope that other honourable -My objection to the motion is based on happenings in this House to-day. Ministers are adopting the habit of making statements on important subjects of public importance without providing opportunities for the House to discuss those subjects. That practice places private members at a disadvantage. By House the Government is able to place its views before the public, but honourable members generally are denied a similar opportunity. This afternoon, in answer ( Mr Harrison) said that he hoped to make a statement on the subject referred to next Tuesday. If the business paper were allowed to remain as printed, honourable members would be able to express their views on the subject to-day, and the Minister would then know the mind of Parliament on the subject. It would appear that the only course open to me will be to object to any statement being made on Tuesday next, or, indeed, on any other day, by any Minister, unless oppor-D tunity be also given for a discussion of such statement. Should the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) persist with his motion, I hope that members of my party will agree not to grant leave -to Ministers to make statements in the future.",16,Telephones For Surf Clubs

His promise to restore the democratic nature of the Parliament was given' wide publicity, but his actions yesterday and to-day in moving to deprive private members of their rights, are in direct contrast to his promise. It would appear that no change from the practice of the past is likely during the term of office of the present Prime Minister. In order to rush away to his dugout by the 9th June, the right honourable gentleman, like his predecessors, seeks to close the mouths of private members. the honourable member, who, doubtless, has made some appointments for the following week. any appointments for that week. Much as I dislike Canberra in the winter, I am prepared to remain here as long as is necessary to deal with the business that should be brought forward. I hope that honourable members will vote against the attempt to deprive them of their privileges so early in these sittings of the House. Although Parliament has sat for only three weeks, the Government is prepared, even at this early date, to take this action to close the mouths of the elected representatives of the people. It is niost reprehensible. should be quite inconsistent if I did not protest against this action of the Government, I think the Government is following a most provoking course, , and asking for trouble. Honourable members of this House have their rights, and the Government under the lead of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), thinks that it can take this dictatorial course and get away with it. I have never been a party hack nor do I intend to become one. On the notice-paper yesterday was a most important-notice'of motion relating to anomalies under the Repatriation Act. because of action taken by the Government yesterday, yet I find in the press to-day in relation to this very matter which could not be discussed to-day a letter that the Prime Minister received from the Returned Sailors and SoldiersI m perial League of Australia.

I conclude by saying that if private members' rights are to be trampled upon, and important-subjects, such as that to which I referred, are denied a hearing in the Parliament, the only alternative open to me is to adopt another procedure which the Government cannot stop, that is, to move the adjournment of the House.

The Govei nor-General may from time to time determine the extent to which or the conditions upon which any of the _ matters specified in this section may be administered by the department. by way of amendmentThat the word ""profits"", paragraph e, be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" net profit to six per centum on the value of the actual assets employed in the earnings of such profit"". object of my amendment is to prevent those who will be engaged in the future in the manufacture of munitions and armaments from making excessive profits. We who have considered this matter do not believe that the Government has included sufficient safeguards in the bill to prevent the exploitation which the Government claims to be desirous of eliminating. The Government has set a net in which there are holes big enough to allow the sharks to escape. No doubt, in accordance with its declared policy, the Government considers that the mesh is sufficiently small, and, therefore, the whole point at issue is the method to be adopted to achieve the desired end. -Speaking at the Sydney Town Hall recently, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) directed the attention of his audience to the exorbitant profits made during the Great War by those engaged in the manufacture of arms and other equipment for defence purposes. He referred to the public outcry which the operations of profiteers caused at that time, and he pointed to the steps taken to get something' back into the Treasury from these exploiters, as they were then termed. He said that the opportunity had now arrived for the Government to take action which, in effect, would lock the stable door before the steed was stolen. Some of us believe that it is very hard to find in this measure the lock on the door, and, in fact, some of us have difficulty in seeing even the door. I have submitted my amendment for the purpose of limiting the profits of 6 per cent. The amendment is designed specifically to make sure that there will posal to the committee in the hope that it will be accepted. It is generally agreed, I think, that the advisory panel of accountants is competent to arrive at what it considers to be fair profit for this work in the circumstances that would obtain in a period of national emergency. as a fair profit. much in sympathy with the honourable gentleman in that view, particularly when considering the profits of Government annexes and other establishments of a semi-governmental character that will be engaged in the manufacture of armaments. The Government's plan to prevent excessive profits is to set up a body of experts in costing and accountancy, ,and to leave to them the problem of deciding what will be a fair profit at any given time for individual establishments; but this bill contains no direction as to what the Government considers to befair profit. If we pass the bill in its present form, no direction in that matter will have been given by this Parliament. What authority have the members of this panel to decide what is a fair profit? They are supposed to be men at the top of their professions, and I do not say that they are not competent to determine what they regard as a fair profit, but their opinion in that matter may be entirely different from that of the representatives of the people in this Parliament. We have had some advice on the practicability of this scheme from the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden), who ""is an expert accountant, and as fully qualified as anybody in this chamber to judge whether the scheme can be put into effect and provide the check desired. That honourable gentleman has a business which is probably second to none in Australia, and his decision is worthy of the consideration of this committee, particularly in view of the fact that'not one member of the Cabinet possesses-similar accountancy qualifications. Statements have been made by the Minister' ( Mr",19,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5

115,Mr Mccall,"I find myself veryCasey) insinuating that the sponsors of this amendment are directing their attack against private business concerns, and he deplores the fact that we are not prepared to trust them. He makes an appeal to us to consider the patriotism of these people, and the fair deal that they are likely to give to the Government, or, as he declares, that they will give to the Government in a time of national emergency. I join with him in saying that I believe that the maiority of the private establishments engaged in this work are of the character indicated, but there are always the exploiters, and it is they whom we definitely desire to check, if we limit the profit to 6 per cent, we shall declare to these firms before they accept contracts the maximum profit that they will be allowed to make. The charge laid by the Minister is, I think, unjust, because our leader, the Prime Minister, has announced that the profiteer must be checked. As I pointed out earlier in my remarks, the only disagreement in the committee in this regard is as to the means to be adopted to apply the remedy. We could cite some good examples, even in this period of peace, of individuals supposed to be of unimpeachable character, and highly regarded in business circles, who are not only action contrary to all business ethics, but designed to rob the Treasury of legitimate revenue. I refer particularly to the wealthy financial group in Melbourne which is involved in a dispute with the Taxation Department, and whose liability to that department will, I am led to believe, be colossal. When legal proceedings are instituted, the members of this Parliament will be staggered to know the amount involved. I should be perfectly justified in naming these individuals, but, in view of the fact that income tax matters are confidential, I do not propose to do so. There are many bottles which, if uncorked, would release an unhealthy stench. could be made. What is the object of this urgent desire to limit exploitation by armaments and munitions manufacturers in a time of national crisis? Surely the motive is because the whole nation and its resources should be consolidated for the common purpose of defeating the foe. On the one hand, the young men of this country, including myself and some of the younger members of this House, will be placed in the firing line where we may lose our lives. On the other, hand there will be others who will be sitting back and, supported by evidence supplied to those compiling the national register, will say that they are employed in the production of munitions. Some engaged in such work may make extortionate profits unless definite action is taken to control them. I shall mention some of the steps taken by the Government to assure a continuous and efficient supply of munitions, and show to what degree private concerns conducting governmental or semi-governmental institutions may make tremendous profits. Three avenues will be utilized in producing commodities required for defence purposes first, the eighteen government annexes, secondly, government factories; and, thirdly, the Contracts Board, which peruses all tenders for the supply of war materials. The Government has set up eighteen annexes sixteen of which have been erected at the cost of the Government. The Government has paid for the buildings. taking the buildings? vided the capital to equip them with machinery for the manufacture of munitions. We have been informed that some, . if not all, of these factory-owners have made available a portion of ' the land adjoining their factories on which annexes are to be built. Those conducting such undertakings will be able to make tremendous profits unless action is taken to prevent them from doing so. That is a point which many have overlooked. I shall cite a practical example in order to throw some light on the matter. The Government has arranged to provide these organizations with orders, and agreements Many disclosures have been reached whereby they will be paid a profit of 4 per cent, on their turnover. Supposing that a firm controlling one of these annexes receives an order for, say, £100,000 worth of gas masks, on which a profit of 4 per cent, would be paid. A private firm conducting the business in a' governmental annex",20,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5

It does not mean that he would be paid 6 per cent. ployed. in the form of machinery and equipment to produce £100,000 worth of gas masks otherwise he cannot accept the order. A profit of 6 per cent, on a capital of £30,000 would be only £1,800 as against the £4,000 made by the manufacturer using capital, machinery and equipment provided by the Government. Order! The honourable member has exhausted his time. The honourable member for Bourke member for Martin wishes to conclude his speech, I shall withdraw, temporarily, my right to address the committee at this stage. member for Bourke. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) asked by interjection what justification there is for manufacturers making profits from the production of arms and munitions in times of crisis, particularly when the equipment they are using «has been provided by the Government. I have no hesitation in saying that they are not entitled to any profit at all. What profit accrues to the young men who joined the militia to be trained for defence purposes? What do they receive? Only 8s. a day when in camp, which, if they are receiving only the basic wage is only about one-half of what they would be earning in civil life. What sacrifices are manufacturers to make? There is no evidence of any sacrifice at all. There is no concrete provision in the bill which can operate when exorbitant profits are being made. I regret that the Government should have stated that if my amendment be carried it will have to consider withdrawing the bill.' The respona manufacturer would be sibility is on it.

It is extraordinary that only a few of those honourable members in opposition who on many occasions have expressed themselves so strongly on the subject of profiteering have spoken on this clause. My amendment provides the power to control profits and if it should be found that it is an unjustifiable impediment to the production of munitions, the Government can refrain from enforcing it or bring some other proposal before Parliament for its consideration. This is a practical attempt to ensure definite control of profits. the honourable The honourable member for Martin( Mr McCall) destroyed the whole of the case for his amendment by his closing sentences. This clause is a permissive clause. It does not compel the Ministry to do any of the things listed in it.

He may withdraw that matter from the con* trol of the Minister or impose such restrictions upon it as to make it unworkable and favorable to the manufacturers.. later. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) has circulated an amendment which makes it imperative that in no case shall the Governor General, that is to say the government of the day, withdraw from the scope of this legislation the power to limit and control profits. That means that, although the Governor General may give a direction fixing the extent to which, or the conditions upon which, any other power may be exercised, he shall not be able to deny full exercise of the power to limit or control profits. The honourable member for Martin justified his amendment by saying that the Government need not put it into force unless it desired it. I do not see what advantage an amendment like that would be to the bill. Like every body else, I want to curb the profits made by the producers of munitions, but realize that we are largely in their hands. If this measure is at all necessary, the production of munitions is an urgent consideration for this country. The Commonwealth has not sufficient establishments to produce all of the munitions that the Government contemplates; and it would be useless for the Government to establish a number of factories knowing that, if their need disappeared through war being over, it would be unable to apply them to the production of goods in time of peace. That was well settled in. the High Court's decision in the case The Commonwealth versus The Australian Commonwealth Shipping Board, which was decided in 1926. I shall read the relative passage from the majority judgment of four justices, on page 9 of volume 39 of the Commonwealth Law Reports. The justices saidDespite the practical difficulties facing the city to say what should be a proper rate Commonwealth in the maintenance of its dockof profit, but my incapacity I share with yard and works, the power of naval and milievery honourable member, with the postary defence docs not warrant these activities sible exception of the honourable member in the ordinary conditions of peace, whatever he the position in time of war or in conditions for Darling Downs. I want to underarising out of or connected with war. The activity in which the Australian any particular commodity produced by Commlohwealth Shipping Board had munitions factories, the cost of a gun for tried to engage was the supply, erection and maintenance of turbo-alternator sets for the power house of the municipal council of Sydney at Botany Bay. The doing of that was challenged by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth on behalf of private manufacturers; that is to say, the validity of a Commonwealth administrative act was challenged by the chief law officer of the Commonwealth. The High Court held that, although, in time of war, the defence power was enlarged for the successful prosecution of the war, in time of peace the defence power shrunk to its former dimensions and forbade the Government to apply, for the production of peaceful commodities, a factory which had been erected in the exercise of the defence power. That, of course, makes it uneconomical to have a large number of Commonwealth-owned factories. We are thrown back, therefore, on the use of private agencies, and we are largely in their hands. If the-first consideration is the production of munitions, the limitation of profits can only be a secondary consideration. I do not think that even the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden) could state what should be the proper rate of profit. I cannot understand the basis of calculation suggested by the honourable member for Martin. I cannot understand why 6 per cent, should be based on the assets of the manufacturing company, and why it should not be based on the costs of production. greater measure of profit. that that should be the basis. But that does not make me understand why the rate should be based on assets. I cannot understand why it should not be based on costs. .WhatI understand by an attempt to regulate the price of a commodity, is a forcnula which allows for costs of production and all other things, and then fixes the rate of profit.

132,Mr Blackburn,"I do not suggestinstance, should be based on a certain percentage of the assets of the company. It would appear that the cost would vary according to the resources of the factories. the rate of profit would vary with the company. In each case the Government would have to ascertain what worn the assets of the company before it couid say what price the company could ask for its commodities. assets concerned, would be such assets as were employed in the manufacture. going to be ascertained? It seems to me that the Minister is being asked to embark on an impossible inquiry. It seems comparatively easy to ascertain labour costs, material costs, overhead costs, allowances for depreciation and so on, and that, I understand, is the basis always used by costing accountants. But this business of determining the rate of profit on assets seems to impose on the Ministry a problem that varies with every particular contract and every particular piece of product. Leaving the amendment for the moment, the position taken up by the Ministry, seems to be this: "" There is no reason to suspect that the producer of munitions will seek to make a high rate of profit"". Experience indicates that such producers, in fact any persons who contract to supply the necessities of the Government in a time of need, take full advantage of the position. They will act up to that principle by getting as much profit as they possibly can. Full advantage of the necessities of this country will be taken by the people who produce commodities for the use of the Government. Theni t is said that all that is necessary is a voluntary .advisory panel of unpaid, patriotic person's. When I say that they are patriotic, I do not imply that they are unpatriotic. I think that it is a fino thing that they have offered their services, but it would be better to have a permanent staff whose only interests are the interests of the Government to supervise and check this matter. I believe that that will have to be done. If profits are to be restricted effectively there must be appointed persons whose sole duty it will be to examine all contracts made in order to ascertain the amount and rate of profit made in respect of every contract. That would be a tremendously difficult task. If the Government is determined to apply the principle of controlling and limiting profits made out of the manufacture of armaments and munitions, it will be necessary to have a permanent staff of officials whose duty it will be to concentrate on this work. It could not be done properly by persons working in an honorary capacity, or part time. 1 doubt that this Committee is competent to say what should be the maximum rate of profit, and to lay down once and for all an inflexible, Procrustean rule. It is not competent to determine the basis upon which profits should be computed, whether on costs of production or on the value of assets. be met by inserting a provision instructing the Government with regard to the matter ? Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) has notified his intention to move an amendment to provide that in no case shall the Governor General withdraw from the purview of the Minister, power to control or limit profits. That is the way I approach the issue. I may not agree with m: ny honourable members, but the view taken by the Opposition is that, but for the constitutional objections and the difficulties caused by the lack of sufficient time, the production of munitions should be a government monopoly: We realize that tlie shortness of time in the first place makes that difficult, and also that if a large number of Commonwealth defence factories were to be established, the Government would be imposing upon this country a dead weight of capital costs in respect of establishments which could not be employed economically at the conclusion of any war. Consequently, large staffs of executives and skilled workmen would have to be dispersed. Private manufacturers, on the other hand, have in existence the necessary establishments and labour staffs which are now engaged in the manufacture of peace time requirements. In time of war these could quickly be converted to the production of munitions and other",23,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5

Therefore, whether we like it or not, we are forced to enlist the co-operation of private manufacturers in order toensure adequate supplies of defence equipment iu a national emergency. Buti f we are forced into that position we say that profits must be controlled, and that the mechanism for the control of profits must be as flexible as possible. I repeat that the committee is not in a position to lay down an inflexible and unalterable basis for the computation of profits. with great interest to the honourable memnot question his sincerity in submitting his amendment for the limitation of profits; but 1 think he should have informed the committee of the basis to be adopted for determining the amount of capital assets to be used in the manufacture of government orders. accountants provided for in this measure would do that. that the committee is entitled to some explanation. The limitation of profits is not so easy as some honourable members apparently believe it to be. It would plies would be entitled also to £600 profit. be quite simple to assess profits in a factory which was engaged solely in the manufacture of commodities for the Government, but not easy in the case of .an industrial organization which was employed for only part of its time on the manufacture of Government requirements'. For example, it would be very difficult to assess accurately what assets were being employed by a private manufacturer and for what period in connection with a government order. That is the difficulty which arises according to year. my interpretation of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Martin. If I am wrong I hope he will tell the committee so. Take for instance, the case of a manufacturer who receives an order from the Government for the supply of goods to the value of £5,000. If the value of his assets engaged in the fulfilment of that contract were £10,000, then under the scheme proposed by the honourable member for Martin, the manufacturer, would be entitled to a profit of £600. the amendment proposed the maximum would become the minimum. vided by the Contracts Board. that is the proposal of the honourable member for Martin in a nutshell. might get as much as 60 per cent, under certain conditions. coming to.' Therein lies the great weakness of the amendment. A factory having assets to the value of £10,000 may be utilised for the manufacture of. Government supplies worth £5,000. Under the amendment that manufacturer would be entitled to a profit of £600. There is, however, the possibility that that same plant would be used under similar conditions, several times in one year. It seems inequitable that one manufacturer fulfilling an order for, say £20,000 worth, of supplies and using a plant valued at £10,000 would receive only £600 profit, whereas another manufacturer, having assets to the same value but fulfilling an order for only £5,000 worth of supI know it has been suggested that the Contracts Board, or whatever body is to assume control of these contracts, would take into consideration turnover in fixing the amount of profit; but if a manufacturer received an order in the month of January for £10,000 worth of supplies, how could the board assess the amount of profit which should be made on that order?...To do this it would have to know how many more orders that firm would be asked to fulfill in the same If an arbitrary figure of 6 per cent, is to be imposed as the maximum profit it should be 6 per cent, per annum: Unless that is specified in the amendment it will be impracticable, because it would be possible for a manufacturer to receive numerous orders during one year.

In addition to being directors of the BrokenH ill ProBaillieu and Mr L. Baillieu,. whilst on prietary Company Limited, these gentlemen are also directors of the Australian Iron and Steel Company. Yet the Prime Minister had the audacity to tell us that he was unaware that there is any connection between the two concerns, or that they actually constitute a monopoly in this particular business in the Commonwealth! Everybody knows that that is the position. We expect the Prime Minister, when asked a direct question, to state facts. Zinc is a very important requirement of defence establishments. On the directorate of Amalgamated Zinc Limited are the Honourable Harold E. Cohen, C.M.G., CBE., D.S.O., V.D., M.L.A -a n anti-Labour member of Parliament and, I understand, a close personal friend of many members on the government benches-and the Honourable Sir Walter Massy-Greene, KCMG. members will not disguise the fact that this latter gentleman was at one time very closely associated with them in the political world. Sitting on the directorate of Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Limited we again find the Honourable Harold E. Cohen,. C.M.G., CBE., D.S.O., V.D., M.L.A., the Honourable Sir Walter Massy-Greene, KCMG., Sir Colin Eraser, and MrM . L . Baillieu. In the list of the directors of Zinc Investments Proprietary Limited, another ested in this particular branch of industry, we again come upon the name of the Honourable Harold E. Cohen,. C.M.G., CBE., D.S.O., V.D., M.L.A. Also associated with him on the board of directors is Sir Walter Massy-Greene, KCMG. Yet, if the Labour party suggests that there is any connection between these various concerns honourable members opposite ridicule the idea. Every one knows, of course, that they are so interthese two undertakings are locked that, when tenders are called for the supply of goods in the manufacture of which they are interested, there is no real competition at all. Eor all practical purposes, they form one big ring. Hill. South are Sir Colin Fraser, Sir Alexander Stewart and Sir Sydney Snow, K.B.E. On the directorate of North BrokenH ill are Sir Colin Fraser, MrH . the board of Hume Steel, as we all know, is Senator A. J. McLachlan. There are other directors on these various companies, of course, but I have mentioned those who have been more prominent in anti-Labour political organizations. I do not share with the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) and other honourable members who have expressed a similar view the belief that the men acting upon the various advisory committees are all to be commended for their so-called patriotic offer to render voluntary service. When we realize that Sir Colin Fraser, one of the members of the Industrial Advisory Committee, is a director of Electrolytic Zinc, Broken Hill South and North BrokenH ill ; that Mr Essington Lewis is a director of BrokenH ill Proprietary Limited and of the Australian Iron and Ministerial Steel Company; and that Sir Alexander Stewart is also a member of the directorate of BrokenH ill South, we realize how interlocked are their interests. These gentlemen, in their capacity as advisers to the Government in the expending of millions of pounds, will be in a position to give direct service to the' industrial concerns in which they are interested. Surely honourable members do not imagine that this condition of affairs will not arouse the suspicions of the public. Clause5 imposes, no obligation on the concern which is interGovernment to take any steps whatever to limit profits, and there is a very good reason for that. The Government never intended to limit profits. Paragraph d empowers the Government to make arrangements for the -acquisition, maintenance and disposal of stocks of goods iu connection with defence. I take it that,, under that paragraph the Government desires to create the impression that action would be taken to ensure adequate supplies of oil at a reasonable price. The Government, in order to ascertain the position regarding oil supplies, will have to make inquiries of the major oil companies, and in order to ensure that undue profits are not being made, it will have to ask questions about costs and profits. Every one will remember. just what happened some years ago, when the Commonwealth Government appointed a royal commission to obtain just that information from the oil companies. At that time, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) was the legal advisor of the Shell Oil Company, one of the major oil companies involved in the inquiry. When the royal commission attempted to obtain information regarding costs of production, marketing costs, profits, &c, the Prime Minister, ip. his capacity of legal representative of the company advised it not to give any information whatever. How can he now, as"" Prime Minister, insist upon the companies supplying the very information that, as their legal representative a few years ago, he advised them to withhold? The honourable member's time has expired. Minister for Supply and Development) [4.30] -The Government cannot accept the amendment of the honourable appreciates the motive which prompted him to move the amendment, and it is entirely in sympathy with his desire to restrict the taking of exorbitant profits by any supplier of defence equipment to the Government. However, not only would the result, impracticable of application. first place, it raises the question of the value of the assets employed in any business supplying goods to the Government. The making of such a valuation would be an extremely costly matter. It would require a great deal of time, and it is doubtful whether anything of real value would be achieved. ment no intention to limit profits? by the honora.ble member who moved the amendment would involve the separation of the assets used in the production of any particular product. It is probable that only a part of a great number and variety of assets would be used in the production of a great number and variety of products. To determine the time and extent to which each asset would be used in the production of a particular product would require a computation that would be entirely impracticable. Honourable members have questioned the Government's sincerity regarding the limitation of profits. They have asked why does not the Government put in the bill a provision which would have the effect of placing an effective check on undue profit taking. The Government says in reply that it is taking plenary power in this bill to impose what checks are necessary. The responsibility will then devolve upon the Government to exercise that power, or if it does not do so in an effective and efficient manner, to take the consequences for its failure at the hands of Parliament. The Government will give ample evidence of its sincerity. If it was not sincere, there was no need for it to bring this bill before the House at all; there was no need to make any reference to the limita(Fawkner-Assistant tion of profits, and there was no need to appoint honorary advisers to an accountancy panel. The fact that it did those things is evidence of its sincerity. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has suggested that, because the honorary panel will not be able to make a personal investigation of the many thousands of contracts that have already been let by the Department of Defence, it will not be able to amendment not achieve that serve any good purpose at all. It has but also it is entirely been explained, however, that the funcI n the tions of the panel are not to conduct minute investigations of every contract, but to investigate the present methods followed by the Government in controlling and limiting profits. If it is found by this qualified body, the majority of whose members are experts in cost accounting, that our methods are unsatisfactory-and we do not assert categorically that they are-not-the Government will then be in a position to consider the recommendations of the panel.

Therefore, we are asking this -expert 'body to make an investigation, and to recommend improvements. I think that honourable members are satisfied, in view of the detailed explanation by the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Casey), that, in respect of the overwhelming majority of defence contracts, .an effective control has been exercised, and no possibility of excess profit-making exists. It seems clear that, so far as the :annexe system is concerned, there is little likelihood of profiteering. Most of the criticism has been in respect of the supply of raw matezials to manufacturers. In that regard, the Government does exercise .a check, inasmuch as it has the co-operation of officers of the Defence Department, the Contracts Board, and the Trade :and Customs Department. A very close check can thus be kept on prices of raw materials sold to manufacturers, and, in the past, this has proved very effective. -Copper was mentioned by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) as providing what he considered a glaring -example of fleecing the Government. ment, had to explain the fictitious price -at which copper was quoted. member that, when he.was Minister for Customs, he tabled a report covering the investigation by the Tariff Board of the copper industry in Australia. -excerpts from it to the committee. made in that report was that the producers of copper in Australia were at a -disadvantage in that, while they were paying award wages and observing Australian conditions of labour, they had to meet in open competition the product of the Belgian Congo and Northern Rhodesia, where coloured labour was employed. Despite .that fact, however, and despite the fact that freight costs were worked out on the basis of the shorter journey from Africa to Europe, because the quantity of Australian copper was not sufficient to be taken into consideration, the Defence Department in Australia -was able to obtain copper at world parity prices. In fact, the honourable member for Balaclava recommended that a duty of £4 a ton should be imposed in order to protect the Australian industry. Australian producers are able to compete. pliers of any commodity, such as copper, arecharging unreasonable prices, the Government has a remedy in its power to remove the tariff protection which that industry enjoys. The honourable member specifically excluded the producers of steel from the charges he made. There is one other check: if it be found on analysis that any supplier of raw material is making an exorbitant charge, there is power under section 67 of the Defence Act compulsorily to acquire the commodity at a price fixed by an independent arbitrator. There again we have a definite check should we find any flagrant abuse in this regard. The Government is taking -full powers under this measure. As I mentioned earlier, there was no necessity for it to introduce a bill of this kind, or to include these particular powers. passage of this bill is not vital to the I said that the GovernGovernment ? at all.

I can only repeat that, in askas the remainder of the measure is now ing for full powers under this measure, the Government accepts full responsibility for the proper exercise of those powers, and will be prepared to stand up to any charge which may be levelled against it in the future that it has fallen down on that responsibility. The Government having accepted that responsibility, the committee should not weaken the very full powers which it seeks under this measure by imposing any arbitrary limitation, which might very well have an effect entirely opposite to that desired by those supporting the amendment. The wisest course for the committee is to leave the full powers in the hands of the Government, ancl charge the Government with full responsibility for the exercise of them.

If the amendment to be moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition be agreed to, we can then say to the Government, "" It will be your responsibility under this mandatory clause to check profits, and if you do not"" do so, you will hear all about it from the Opposition "". I propose now to deal with the remarks made by the Minister for Supply aud Development .( Mr Casey) .last night. I often wonder why honourable gentlemen opposite can talk, both inside and outside of this chamber, about the patriotism of these contractors in peace or war, particularly when we have a wealth of evidence concerning the methods by which they fleeced and bled this country at a time when it was fighting for its life. When the honourable gentleman suggests that these interests have undergone a change of heart, or have changed their cent, is the methods, and will not go for as much profit now as they did in the Great War, he would have us believe that .he is one of the "" innocents abroad"". But he is too well connected with big .business not to know that no such change has taken place.

190,Mr Lazzarini,"It is true. Weof these firms engage men who were previously employed in the Taxation Department, because they are fully conversant with the methods of the Commissioner of Taxation. They are induced to join private accountancy firms in order to help in the evasion of taxes. I know of certain firms in Sydney which have their own methods of making out income tax returns, but in order to reduce the tax payable by their clients, engage officers of this kind to water down the return, and, for this service, the latter are paid fees ranging from £10 to £30. In halving the amount of tax. This practice is going on all over Australia. Expert crooks are being employed to fake books in order to enable big businesses to evade taxes. Sometimes they are caught. For instance, a man was fined £300,000 in Sydney recently for an offence of this kind. We all remember the case of the Abrahams brothers, in which a previous government took a hand in the unmasking of roguery. I have no confidence in these accountants; nine times out of ten they prove the truth of the saying, "" Figures don't lie, but liars can figure "". see thoroughly investigated the contracts The Minister also spoke of manufacturers who will not seek to make profits out of the Government's defence contracts, but will be actuated solely by the desire to help their country. During the Great War we saw how the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the newspapers which sooled on our young men to the front, and which, incidentally, holds a big parcel of shares in the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, raised its price for in memoriam advertisements by 400 per cent., and thus exploited the mothers and widows of our dead soldiers. I was in business during the Great War, and I know firms which had thousands of yards of black Sicilian in stock; the price had been Is. Sd. a yard but, because it was old fashioned, it had been written down at the rate of 3d. a year until it represented to them about Is. a yard. But this material was pulled out of their cellars and sold at 10s. a yard to the widows and mothers of soldiers who had been murdered on the battlefield. Similar instances of profiteering might be given in connection with the woollen industry. Let us examine the patriotism of a manufacturer like Henry Jones of Tasmania. After recovering all of his investment and allowing for taxes imposed under the war-time profits legislation, that gentleman made £400,000 out of contracts to supply jam to the Government during the Great War. However, I do not ask. the Minister to take my word on thesematters. When the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) was a member of the Victorian Parliament, he was supplied by the State 'Treasurer ( SirAlexander Peacock), in answer to a quesmany cases they succeed in tion, with a table of figures showing that various firms, identified by symbols, had; made profits ranging from 115 per cent.. to 4,000 per cent, in one year during theGreat War. Those figures can be found, in Commonwealth Hansard, for the 10th August, 1917, Vol. LXXXIL , page 998. I ask the Minister to study those figures. After doing so, I hardly think he will suggest, for one moment, that these robbers will not do the same thing to-morrow, if they get the opportunity, as they did during the Great War. I , personally, should like toalready let for the supply of boots or any other article to the Defence Department. When the Minister speaks of the patriotism of these people, he will not pull the wool over the eyes of honourable members on this side, because this country has had bitter experience of the profiteers. The Government now suggests that opportunities, for profiteering will be considerably limited because of the safeguards which have been provided for the checking of profits on raw materials. I ask the Minister what check did the Government put on the contract let to the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited when that company itself, case hardened as it is, felt too ashamed to take the Government's £1 10s. for shell cases and handed back 7s.? able member in detail on that point. honourable gentleman's reply.

Possibly a certain degree of competition may still occur in the supply of boots, clothing and some other similar articles, but even in connection with these it is well known that firms arrange what are known as a ""gentleman's agreement"". Sometimes it will be agreed that one firm shall obtain one contract on condition that another obtains the next. By this means contracts are distributed, and to a large extent, prices regulated; but whatSupply and Development) [4.58] I ever competition may occur in retail business, practically none exists in the wholesale trade. To-day wholesalers and manufacturers generally not only arrange prices amongst themselves, but they also fix retail prices. If a retailer dares to sell certain goods at less than the fixed price he is refused further supplies. This procedure affects hosiery, underwear and clothing of various kinds. anticipate that any different procedure will be applied to the furnishing of goods to the Defence Department. Nevertheless, I shall be* interested to see what steps the Government intends to take to check profits. We shall be willing to consent to a mandatory authorizing the making of a check on profits, but we shall consent to nothing that will enable manufacturers to put a loading on.their overhead costs. -only effective way to deal with this business, in my. opinion, is for the Government to be its own manufacturer. I ask the Minister to declare specifically, when he replies to these remarks, whether profits are to be allowed on watered -capital and bonus shares. If a company has watered its stock until it has a nominal capital of £1,000,000, but an actual paid-up capital of only £100,000 -or so, and the Government allows profits -on the basis of £1,000,000, the company will be in a very happy position.

In the Mr Lazzarini. case of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, the profit will be very much higher than that, for the honourable' member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Green) indicated very clearly last night the degree to which the company's stock Very little' competition was watered. We also know that the capital of many coal-mining enterprises has been watered to an extraordinary degree. In one case an original capital of £60,000 or £70,000 has been inflated so greatly that the company now has capitalized reserves totalling £3,000,000. member's time has expired. propose to show honourable members that the Government's efforts to restrict profits to a reasonable figure are soundly based. The Government does not believe that it is possible to evolve a magic formula in three or four lines of an act of parliament which will automatically regulate profits. This view is supported by information collected by our officers over a We cannot long period of time, from many other countries of the world. I shall read some statements on this subject from British and Canadian oflScial documents. In both Great Britain and Canada a policy and method similar to that of this Government is being applied. The outlook of the peoples of those countries is similar clause to that of our own people. . The Prime Minister of Great Britain said a. year or two agoThe His Majesty's Government are determined that the needs of the nation shall not serve to pile up extravagant profits for those who are called upon to meet them . . . On the other hand, it is important to retain the goodwill of industry, for in peace time firms cannot be compelled to undertake contracts on terms which they consider unreasonable . . . It w ill be necessary also to co-ordinate the demands of the three Services so that proper priority shall be observed and competition between them,which might lead to higher prices, avoided.

The British Prime Ministeialso s a i d Control to prevent excessive profits will lie effectively exercised by inspection of books, adequate technical costings, audits on behalf of the State and arbitration in cases of dispute. The Government are satisfied that this can he done without impairing the confidence aud enterprise of contractors undertaking novel and difficult tusks. I now direct attention to the f ollowing statement in. ithe Report on the Estimates of Great Britain, which was issued a year or eighteen months ago:My Lords .concur in the committee's view that great difficulties are inherent in a system of non-com uetitive contracts and, in particular, that it is necessary that the question of oncost should receive the closest attention. They agree that the whole position calls for the utmost vigilance, and they assure the committee that the matter will be kept under close and continuous review. My Lords are in general agreement with tlie view expressed by the committee tliat in appropriate cases where a firm price cannot be fixed without undue risk to the Exchequer, contracts. should be placed at a provisional or target price on the basis that if the eontractor in practice reduces the cost of manufacture below the cost allowed for in the target price, the benefit of such reduction should be shared in prescribed proportions between the contractor and the contracting department. The f i r s t R e p o r t on the Estimates of GreatB r it a in issued a year ago statesYour committee are glad to learn that the established methods of placing orders by competitive tender continue to be adhered to as far as possible by the defence departments, and that the type of contract known as time and line, in particular, is only admitted in isolated and exceptional cases. Those extracts show the general trend of thought on this subject in Great Britain, where the contracts involve an expenditure of hundreds of millions of pounds as against a relatively few millions of pounds in Australia. I now direct attention to the following comments made in a report received from an officer in OUT Trade Commissioners' office in Ottawa concerning the Canadian practice:It is the Government's declared intention that Canada's defences be materially strengthened and to this end the programme of modernization undertaken two years ago is to be further augmented, particularly in regard to the air services. ' Together with the plans already under way for the production of bomber planes upon an extensive scale for the British Government, the enlarged Canadian defence programme should stimulate manufacturing and increase employment in a number of industrial fields. A t the same time the Government has mode known its intention to establish a defence purchasing board through which necessary equipment w ill be bought,, and, where private manufacture is necessary,, it will be the duty of this board to see that profits are fair and reasonable. The Government does not propose that private manufacture of defence materials is to be undertaken without profit, but, as the Prime Minister stated to the House on Monday, the 16th January, the production of munitions is to beso safeguarded that profiteering w i ll be impossible. The purchasing board, he added, will be one that will command public respect and confidence. It will thus be seen that neither in Great Britain nor in Canada has any magicformula been evolved which automatically excludes the possibility of profiteering. The fixing of an arbitrary percentage oould not possibly be effective. The aim of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Martin( Mr MoCall) is to limit the net profit to 6 percent, on the value of the actual assets employed in the earning of such profit.. I presume that the honourable member envisages -the retention of the contract system. His idea is that tenders will be called and presumably the lowest tender tentatively accepted. Subsequently an investigation is to be made of costs, and if it finds a profit exceeding 6 percent, of the value of the actual assets employed in the earning of"" it, the tender will he rejected and fresh tenders called. But the Government has no power whatever to compel any firm to sell its goods at a certain price. It cannet direct firms in ""this matter. It cannot even suy that the tender price shall be such as will permit of not more than 6 per cent, being earned. vernment has power to buy raw materials. for Balaclava probably has in mind section 67 of the Defence Act which gives the Government power, undercertain circumstances, to requisition goods and pay for them at a fair priceto be determined by arbitration. That power will, of course, still exist when this bill is passed, and, as the Assistant Minister remarked in his speech, occasion may arise to use it ; but the power-",33,Speaker Hon.

When it isremembered that about 10,000 contracts are let each year, and that the number of them is likely to be greatly increased in the next year or two, it will surely be appreciated that any procedure which causes delay will be serious. Reasonable expedition is essential in the supply of the materials which the Defence Department requires. If undue delay were to occur through the establishment of this new department, it were better that it had never been established, and that the existing practice had been continued. One of the main purposes of the creation of this new department is expedition. Minister said, not 20 minutes ago, that there was no need for this department. suggest to the honourable member for Barker that he did not say quite that. He said that some of the powers to be exercised by this new department already existed. all of them existed and that this bill was not necessary. a true interpretation of the Assistant Minister's speech.

If a departtract system, under which public tenders ment of supply and development is to be established, surely it is appropriate that Parliament should approve of it by legislative action. The functions of the new department are stated in clause 5 of the bill. I call them functions rather than powers, for possibly all the things set out in the bill could be rate of profit. If this done to-day under the provisions of a large number of existing acts. The honourable gentleman will agree that that would not be appropriate. There would be interminable delay in discovering the amount of capital and assets employed in the earning of profits on any particular government order as, fox example, an order for 50,000 tooth brushes or 200 pairs of boots. As was mentioned by the honourable member for Darling. Downs( Mr Fadden), the information could be obtained in respect of a public utility company, such as one which supplies electricity or gas to the public, or performs some service week in and week out throughout each year. In such cases, it would be possible to know the amount of capital and assets involved, and to determine the price which should be charged for gas or electricity, in order to yield a predetermined rate of profit. that A statutory declaration be submitted with the tender, and for checks to be made subsequently? propriate. The honourable member for Werriwa spoke of watered capital.

In his opinion, that action proved that the contract price in the first instance was too high, and he accused the Contract Board of not having been sufficiently vigilant in the policing of prices. The facts are that the BrokenH ill Proprietary! Company Limited obtained a contract at a price which, when compared with the price of manufacture in government factories doing the same job, was quite reasonable. However, when the job had been completed, the company said that it would accept no profit, and would charge no overhead or depreciation, but only the cost of materials and labour. That patriotic gesture on the part of the company led to its returning 7s. in respect of each shell case.

At least two of the gentlemen comprising that mission had had considerable experience in the manufacture of munitions, because during the Great War they controlled their manufacture in Great Britain. policy of the Government in relation to -annexes was discussed with them, and their advice was sought. When they had been told the conditions under which annexes were to operate, they expressed the opinion that the contracts that the Commonwealth Government had entered into with respect to annexes, under which the amount of overhead was reduced by tlie exclusion of about ten items, and, at the same time, the possible profits were reduced to a maximum of 4 per cent., were the stiffest they had ever seen. connected with any industries for the manufacture of munitions? to the British Government during the last war. The Government has given a good deal of consideration to this subject, and it believes that it would be impossible to fix any arbitrary percentage of profit which would stop profiteering. The Government believes that no general rule can be laid down; each case must be dealt with on its merits. It believes that the checks and safeguards that already exist are adequate but it is not certain, and therefore it proposes to set up an accountancy panel, before which all the facts of each case, as well as the procedure followed in purchasing requirements, will be laid. It will be open to its members to advise the Government in any direction that they think fit, and to say what additional safeguards, if any, should be instituted. In this way, 'the Government believes that it will be able to carry out its policy of ensuring that no exorbitant profits shall be made out of the supply of materials for defence purposes. mean by reasonable profit? profit will vary in each case. A profit of 4 per cent, may be exorbitant in some cases; in others it may be quite insufficient. cite a typical instance? so. Materials involving a considerable outlay on the part of the supplier for a relatively few articles come within a difThe ferent category from materials supplied in large quantities and requiring no considerable expense in providing jigs, dies, and fittings. Unless the Government is to allow the writing off of those costs, no manufacturer supplying a small order could carry on at a low percentage of profit.' In respect of standard lines as, for instance, toothbrushes or boots, the position would be different. There are many instances of goods in the manufacture of which a considerable outlay has to be made, even though only a few articles are sold. It would be impossible for a manufacturer to recoup his outgoing in respect of jigs, dies, fittings and tools from a comparatively small order. Either he must be allowed to write off a considerable percentage of the capital cost of those jigs, dies, fittings or tools, or he must be allowed a profit considerably more than 4 per cent. The circumstances of each case will be different, and they will have to be met differently. tained his point in respect of certain aspects of manufacture, but will manufacturers have first to provide themselves with jigs, dies, patterns and tools? different from what it was only a few years ago; instead of making isolated articles, manufacturers now engage in mass production.

We know, not only from our own experience, but also from the experience of other countries that have faced and are facing this same problem, that we would be fooling the Australian public if we were to set an arbitrary percentage, kind rely largely on that for the control of profits. regard a profit of 4 per cent, as fair and reasonable ? in which the annexes are to be run, 4 per cent, would represent a very low profit. over ? tions which the businesses to which the annexes are attached have to abide by, including the provision of fully-trained personnel at very short notice to man these works, I believe that 4 per cent, would be a vary low profit. I am sure that every honourable member who has been associated with this debate is desirous of using every means possible to prevent profiteering in connection with defence requirements. History'shows that in respect of their supplies of war materials, governments have been the victims of profiteers right throughout the ages. Anybody who has taken a very close interest in this debate must have been struck by the fact that whilst the Government has brought forward no concrete proposal to give practical effect to the general desire for the prevention of profiteering, it has raised every obstacle in the way of honourable members who are desirous of incorporating some safeguard in this bill. amazed at the statements of both the Minister and the Assistant Minister that no formula could be set down for establishing a profit-finding basis and that, as a consequence, they were unable to give any idea as to what would be a fair and reasonable muirgin of profit for 'those supprinting trade of New South Wales can plying government requirements. We all costed. The Minister has stated that in the United Kingdom all means possible were used to control costs of production, by inspections of factories and the laying down of formulas established on a definite technical basis for cost finding. The Defence Purchases Board iu Canada had the same methods. If the Government has iu mind as a fair and reasonable margin of profit what it proposes to allow to the firms conducting the annexes, namely, 4 per cent, on turnover, God help the Minister this country in the event of it having to meet heavy expenditure during a time of war. As an experienced accountant I say that I know of very few businesses which obtain or are able to maintain a net profit of 4 per cent, on turnovter. Yet, that margin is to be allowed to those concerns which are controlling the annexes for which the Government has to find the whole of the equipment, the works and the buildings, and, in most cases, the land. These annexes are to be fully equipped by the Government and private enterprise is to be asked to find only the skilled labour, out of the employment of which it is to be allowed to make a profit of 4 per cent, on total output or turnover. We have been told that it is impossible to lay down a formula.' WhilstI do not contend that the formula suggested by the honourable member for Martin regard it as an honest attempt to prescribe a reasonable limitation of profit. The Government itself can work out the details of its application. I have before me a cost-finding questionnaire sent out to members of the Printing and Allied Trades Association in New South Wales by Messrs. Sorenson Purves and Company, a well-known firm of chartered accountants established in Sydney and Melbourne. This questionnaire, which I was was sent out in order to arrive at a costing basis for the printing trade in New South Wales,, asks for particulars concerning various factors that operate in that industry. I shall not weary the committee by referring to the details. The point I wish to make is that if the evolve a basis for the determination of",37,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5

The suggestion made by the honourable Balaclava ( Mr White), has been wrongly interpreted by the honourable members for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) and Bourke( Mr Blackburn). that profits be limited to 6 per cent, on turnover, but that it be limited to 6 per cent, of the ascertained true value of the assets used in the earning of the profits. The Minister, in stating that the policing of any arbitrary margin of profit would be too cumbersome, drew attention to the fact that there are thousands of contracts to be dealt with, and asked if it was suggested that every one of them should be scrutinized in order to determine the profit made by the contractor. There is no necessity to do that. The system of contract by public tender must be continued, but the system should be carefully policed. Every contractor should be licensed. He should be required to put his licence number on his tender and embody in it an affidavit that the price at whicli he has tendered does not permit him to earn a profit in excess of that prescribed. Competition between tenderers will determine whether there is evidence of profiteering. Can we not depend on the integrity of manufacturers, and, if there is any suspicion of profiteering, inquire into it? We do that in connection with taxation returns. Taxation officials do not scrutinize every commodities-munitions , raw materials, return. They do not look upon every taxpayer as a rogue and a thief. But if in an individual case the department has its suspicions aroused, it investigates profiteering has not been eliminated, it the return and takes appropriate action. If that is found satisfactory in connection with taxation returns, could it not also be done in connection with our huge defence expenditure £70,000,000? If the Government is sincere in this matter, could it not ask the new Department of Supply and Development, the 'Works Department, the Tariff Board and the Contracts Board jointly to police a provision for the limitation of profits ? Instead of placing Mr Fadden, every obstacle in the way of honourable members who desire to protect the interests of the people against profiteers, it should be ready to give sympathetic consideration to their suggestions. creating suspicion by its actions in this regard. amendment proposed by the honourable be of no use unless the amendment forecast by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) be carried. Subclause 2 must be amended in order to mjake it maoadatoiry on the Governor General to give effect to the provisions of sub-clause 1. The amendment of the honourable member for Martin is an honest attempt to impose a check on profiteering. I repeat that the 6 per cent, profit margin will find its own economic level because every tenderer will take into consideration the possible tender of his competitor. Competition will be keen. Unless some definite margin of profit be laid"" down a contractor who bases his tender on a maximum profit of 6 per cent, will be at a disadvantage as compared with another with perhaps a larger turnover, who bases his tender on a profit of 4 per cent. I suggest that the Government could utilize the amendment moved by the honorahle member for Martin as the basis for the fixing of an equitable margin of profit. In Queensland price-fixing legislation has been in operation for years. We are told that the Department of Supply and Development will deal with all kinds of finished articles, motor tyres, toothbrushes, &c. Every commodity in Queensland is subject to price-fixation, and to the scrutiny that it demands, and, if has at least been reduced. The prices of commodities throughout the State are revised in accordance with the conditions obtaining from time to time. It is all of over humbug to say that the Commonwealth Government could not lay down a formula for the control of profits. We could stipulate that profits should be limited to a maximum of 6 per cent, on the capital value of the assets utilized, and prescribe certain charges allowed for overhead expenses, depreciation, &c.

In the schedule to the Electric Light and Power Act of Queensland are set out certain classes of expenditure to be allowed for in calculating the cost of production, so that the f a i r selling price of the commodity may be determined. The act requires certain information to be supplied by the company, and, if the department is not satisfied about it , an investigation is held. If the company has not observed the provisions of the act, it is liable to a fine and certain other penalties. The total revenue is taken into consideration, and from that is deducted the cost of production as set out in the schedule. given.] The Gas Act of Queensland is drawn on similar lines. Under the electric light act, the cost of production within certain prescribed limits and with regard to certain items is ascertained. The amount of profit allowable is arrived at in this way: A sum not exceeding 7 per cent, of the amount actually invested in the undertaking at a certain date is ascertained in accordance with ih -} f iymulii set out in paragraph 2 of the schedule, which states the kinds of assets on whicli that 7 per cent, is allowed.

We are told that the -advisory panel will overlook the work of the board to see if the buying is right, and if all the necessary safeguards are applied.

Every honourable member wishes some limitation to be placed upon profits. I do not believe that a means can be devised to attack profits at the source in Australian industry generally, as was suggested by the Minister for Supply and Development in his second-reading speech. The Minister, in his speech this afternoon admitted that he has not a definite -formula to place before the committee. The of the Governorproposed procedure has not been explained satisfactorily. The Minister mentioned various means by which comgrown upon' or panies can water their stock and thus everything make it almost impossible to ascertain If we are to limit profits the actual profit. It is more difficult to check profits at the source than it is generally to assess them after a year's transI should say that actions are known. Althoughi t may be as contemplated in paragraph said that under that system we would be industry, locking the stable after the horse into consideration each year's had gone, the excessive xjrofit could be recovered and brought into the treasury in tlie following year. The threat tof o r f e it excess profits w ill always be a deterrent to unscrupulous manufacturers. Germany has attacked this problem by It would not be possible to taxing excess profits, and I believe that, that is the only way it can be done effectively in a general way. But definite orders placed w it h a firm or annexes is a. different matter, and a reasonable profit can be determined. The Minister The loading of any has not yet given any clear indiunit might be 2 per cation as to the conditions under which these annexes are to be conducted.

In the majority of instances the companies have not provided capital for the purchase of plant and equipment; it has been provided by The proposed new paragraph the Government. If they were guaranteed a return of 4 per cent, a unit it is easy to imagine the colossal fortunes that of what had been termed could be made, particularly when their By a system of plants were working to f u l l capacity in time of war. The proposed new paragraph which I have forecast departs from the 6 per cent, profit on the unit and provides for a profit of 4 per cent, on the year's turnover. Moreoveri t defines "" munitions"" as relating only to what are known as weapons of death and so limits the scope. In regard to the bigger issue, the advisory accountancy panel should be able to arrive at a sound basis and to check excess profits, as is done in Germany. It is practically impossible to arrive at a reliable rate of profit until the turnover for the year is known. was impressed by the remark of the Blackburn) that this measure has been placed before Parliament because of the need to be prepared for any. emergency. In ensuring that excessive profits shall not be made we must not load the bill unduly, and thus seriously interfere with the efforts of the Government to provide for the effective defence of Australia. In studying this subject we have to consider first the matter of urgency, and secondly the means that may be employed to ensure that no one shall make undue profits out of the manufacture of armaments and munitions. The bulk of the money expended on defence will go not to, say, 10,000 manufacturers, but to those producing raw materials. and the combines which control the metals-the zinc; the lead, the nickel with which bullets are plated, and the steel for machine guns-and the thousand and one other things that the manufacturer must obtain before he can produce those articles on which the' honourable to work out his 6 per cent. Under the amendment, the whole of the concentration is on the manufacturer to see that lie does not bilk the Government of anything, but there is no means to ensure that the men who supply the manufacturers with raw materials and their other needs and possibly are profiteering thereon shall be brought within its scope. They will completely escape the net. I was impressed by the .statement made during the second reading by the former Minister for Defence( Mr precedent for such action exists in the Thorby) that the major portion of Australia's defence requirements came from about five different sources. The honourable member did not name them, but they include the suppliers of metal, rubber, oil and cement. The rubber suppliers form one huge combine in which the Dunlop-Perdriau, Barnet Glass and Goodyear enterprises are represented. A huge ring controls the fuel oils and lubricants needed for our navy, air force and mechanized army. Huge amounts are to be spent on tlie storage of oil. The suppliers of cement control the manufacture of fibro-cement and Hume pipes. None of them would be brought within the net by this amendment. ""What would prevent it? the amendment to embrace sources of supply. In the early days of a state of emergency public spiritedness may be fervent and general but it will soon dissolve and the efforts of combines will be directed to improving their own position. In New South Wales, as soon as the brick combine got things its own way, it skyrocketed prices without consideration of public welfare. There is nothing in this amendment that would strike at the root of the trouble. The only effective protection is, as was stated by the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly) and the honourable They are the syndicates member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn), the sincerity of the Government in enforcing some control of profits. Any words can be put into the bill, but I guarantee that the persons against whom the words are directed will get some smart lawyer to make gaps in the legislation wide enough for a horse and dray to be driven through them. That has always been the case when the interests of big business have been threatened by legislation. The Government should consider two or three things. It should look to the source of raw materials and ensure that the manufacturer of thefinishedproduct is not charged exorbitant prices for his materials. The Commonwealth Government of itself has no power to fix prices of raw materials, but it could do so in collaboration with the State governments, which have the necessary powers. A",40,Speaker Hon.

But I suggest that the honourable member for Lilley was right when he said that the 6 j>er cent, of profit which the amendment aimed at as the maximum would become the minimum and that there would be an accumulation of six-per-cents in the cost of the finished product, whereas, had the profit fixing been left to the discretion of the Government, it might have been kept at a level lower even than that which the honourable member for Martin seeks.' most dangerous. manufacturers would have just reason to say "".We are only producing at the price Parliament has fixed in its own statute "".

If it be too low it will curb enterprise and prevent the Government from receiving tenders for what it requires. The right honourable member quoted the submission of the Prime Minister of Great Britain that industry must be permitted to carry on at a profit. It sounds well to say that there must be no profit, but nothing can be done without profit. Profit taking is part of human nature. could not. employ hands. Profit, therefore, is essential to industry. What we have to ensure is that there shall not be excessive profit. It is the responsibility of the Government of the day, whatever be its political creed, to. check profits and, to that end, the scope of the legislation under which it acts must be as wide as possible. I am satisfied that the present Ministry is sincere. Sitting suspended from 6.1.5 to S p.m. remarks,'I would say that I am satisfied about, the sincerity of ibhe Government to limit profits, but I am not quite convinced about the sincerity of 'those people who stand behind the Ministry-thos e large financial and commercial organizations to Whom Ministers sometimes bow.

Therefore, I propose to support the amendment indicated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. was expected that this bill would arouse a great deal of interest and lead to a Without it industry keen debate dn this Parliament, because in: all countries which, to-day, are engaged in the production of armaments, legislation of a similar form is receiving attention.

264,Mr Jennings (Watson) [8.3],"I tby private manufacturers of munitions may be adequately controlled, .the bill makes provision for the setting up of an accountancy panel to advise the 'Government on the control of prices and profits. aspect of the measure that I wish to direct attention. When this legislation was being drafted, the Government sought Dhe advice of many industrial leaders and men prominent in scientific and conuniercial spheres. No doubt it was the sound advice given by these people which prompted the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to say, in the course of a speeoh delivered in Sydney recently, that if he could only have at his command half a dozen of the 'best business brains available in Australia, he would feel quite happy in carrying on as leader of the Commonwealth Government. The Government has brought down this important legislation to ensure the safety of the nation. Its provisions, as I say, include a proposal for the setting up of an therefore suggest that it is far better to accountancy panel to advise the Government in regard to the making of profits by private manufacturers of munitions and other war supplies in a time of emergency. I emphasize the word "" advise "" because that was the word used by the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Casey) in his second-reading speech, and because the accountancy panel will not itself undertake the actual work of checking. At least I presume that that is so because of the remarks made by the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly) and the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden), both of whom have reputations as public accountants. Members of the Opposition have referred to several gentlemen who will ibe members, of the advisory bodies, such as the accountancy panel, as being representatives of big business interests. I supwith this work are vast industrial organipose that that in a sense is true. Even the ' honourable member for Indi( Mr engaged in the production of raw mateMcEwen), in his speech on the second reading, referred to certain powerful ingoods. How is it suggested that work in terests which were not too remote from the Government, as if he feared that some monwealth would be policed? Obviously unholy influence might be exercised on the Government in connection with the letting of contracts for the manufacture of munitions. I do not subscribe 1281 to these fears, but I believe it to be in the public interest that we should do our utmost to prove them groundless. I go further and say that, in view of the existence of those business interests, we It is to this particular should take every possible step to prevent any undue influence from being brought to bear, any undue prices from being charged, and any undue profits from being made. The Government is wise, in my opinion, in not desiring to expand its munitions factories more than is absolutely necessary. We all know that once a government associates itself with anything actively, it is very difficult to break that association. Of what use would be the expansion of government munitions and military clothing factories entailing the engagement of a large number of additional employees if all our fears about war should prove to be groundless? Obviously we should have incurred the expense of installing new plant and producing new equipment for nothing. I make arrangements with private industrial undertakings for the establishment of annexes in order to contribute to the country's requirements in case of need. The demand for some of these requirements-for instance, aeroplanes and, probably, motor cars-will / no doubt, continue to increase with the years, but we all fervently hope that the necessity to manufacture large quantities of munitions of war will not continue. However, certain experimental orders have been given to private manufacturers, and we cannot yet say how many more order will follow, or whether they be for complete articles or for parts. In several States there are large engineering industries engaged in the manufacture of parts, for assembly in Sydney and Melbourne. Also associated zations and subsidiary undertakings rials and in turning out manufactured these workshops in all parts of the Comthis work could not be done solely by an advisory panel. How are we to arrive a't a fair profit basis? Referring to this matter last night, the Minister for Supply and Development spoke of the work of the Contracts Board.: I believe that the system of inviting tenders for all government requirements is satisfactory to the departments, and fully protects the taxpayers. The Minister told us that, according to a departmental estimate, 60 per cent, of the amoiuit paid for items bought by tender is paid away in wages, and 20 per' cent, is expended on the purchase of materials, leaving a balance of approximately 20 per cent, to cover taxation, insurance, innot because I doubt, for one moment, the terest, charges for premises, depreciation and profit. That seems to me to be a very fair estimate. I agree with the honourable member for Darling Downs that the procedure in connection with the letting of contracts by the Government is sound for the taxpayer. Costs are brought to such a low level that many firms are unwilling to quote, and in some instances will not offer a price at all. Dealing with the question of annexes, the Minister said that in the assessing of profits, the following items were not to be taken into consideration as overhead charges: Interest on capital, selling expenses, advertising, bad debts, income taxes, debenture interest, reserves, commissions and insurance premiums on life policies. The right honourable gentleman said that profit was to be based on the cost of production, which in turn would be computed only direct materials and direct expenses. He should be on the basis of 4 per 1 cent., which was equal to the interest payable on Commonwealth bonds. This seems to me to be a very fair basis on which to work, and I am prepared to accept it. Now in regard to the question of checking costs as the honourable member for Lilley pointed out, there are many accountants who specialize in work of this kind-public familiar with the ramifications of big business enterprises and their subsidiary organizations. If the Government desires a proper check to be made, thus ensuring that no profiteering is carried on, specialists of this kind . should be employed. It is possible that some of these Mr Jennings. men would be prepared to act in an honorary capacity, but in my opinion nobody should be asked or expected to undertake this work without payment. Like any one else, these men have to make a living and, moreover, I think thetaxpayers would prefer that they bo paid. Theni t could not be suggested that undue influence was beingexercised. _ If government officials could act in conjunction with these specialist accountants so much the better. I make the suggestion, bona fides or the patriotism of those who control Australian industry to-day, but because its adoption would allay any possible suspicion on the part of members of the Opposition and would, I believe, give general satisfaction to the taxpayers' of the Commonwealth. Having listened with much interest to the debate on this measure, I note that some honourable members believe that they have a solution for the evil of profiteering. This problem dates back nearly 2,000 years to the time when the Holy Nazarene overthrew the tables of the money changers and drove the profiteers out of the temple at Jerusalem. From that time until to-day, efforts have been made to check the amassing of great wealth from undue profits, but I have yet to learn of any government that has succeeded in defeating the on direct wages, profiteers. I sympathize with the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr also suggested that profits Casey) in his endeavour to cope with these avaricious individuals. As I said in my second-reading speech, I am afraid, that there is no possible chance of curtailing the profits made by those people, who to-day wax fat on the money which they derive from the sale of war supplies. I am disappointed with members of the ""corner party"", who claim to be sympathetic with the working people of Australia. accountants who are I consider that profiteering in foodstuffs is the worse crime it is possible to commit. I hope, therefore, that we shall be able to deal with those unscrupulous indi-; viduals who, in a time of national crisis, corner foodstuffs. The first duty of the Minister should be to take complete control of all .measures necessary for our",43,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5
265,Mr Mahoney (Denison) [8.13],"defence. I have heard the right honourable gentleman refer to Great Britain and ""European countries. Data collated by English and German authorities show that the most drastic steps have had to be taken in Great Britain and Germany to deal with profiteers. sympathetic, loyal and patriotic were certain of the farmers of England that when restrictions were imposed on profiteering in milk supplies, they dried off the cows, fattened them, and sold them as fat beef. The farmers of England stooped to the meanest action they could possibly take, in order to exploit women and children. I have heard it said that Germans are the most patriotic people in the world. I take leave to doubt that. In 1914, Germany had to pass drastic legislation to nationalize industries, fix prices, and supervise the .distribution of foodstuffs. Brazil in order to cause a shortage of that commodity. member for Beid( Mr Gander) has pointed out, coffee was destroyed in Brazil in order to prevent the people from purchasing it at a reasonable price. Wheat was dumped in America for the same purpose. How does this Government intend to deal with its own masters and supporters ? It has been sent here by the profiteers to make it easy for members are afraid that a Labour gothem to exploit the masses. If there is one person whom I would punish severely, it is the profiteer who exploits the nation when it is at war. I support the practical amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), who has demonstrated how profiteers could be dealt with in a time of crisis. If a Labour government has the opportunity to exercise this power, it will deal afraid to deal with the big profiteers in with the profiteer commensurate with his deserts. The Minister has explained what the Government proposes to do in connection with the factories in which munitions are produced. There is to be a panel of experts for costing purposes, but before these gentlemen will be able to come to a decision they will need accurate information on which to base their calculations. industry will be under the control, not of the Government, but of the big industrialists throughout Australia, and these are the only people who know the real cost of the production of munitions. How can they be expected to supply secret information concerning their businesses? SoI agree with the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) that this is all hocus-pocus. I am well satisfied that it is merely propaganda, designed to induce the supporters of the Government to believe that it is pulling the wool over the eyes of the Opposition and the electors. Some people object to the imposition of a fine, and others to imprisonment. WereI a magistrate when the first profiteer was arraigned in a time of crisis, I should have no hesitation in sending him to gaol. The committee is unanimous in professing preparedness to deal with profiteers. That being, the case, the only logical course is to support the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition. The Government must be given a mandate in this matter. Then, if it did not deal with profiteering the responsibility for failure to do so would rest on its shoulders. I have no doubt that the Minister sincerely desires to protect from exploitation the women and children of this country. In all countries it is they who are the most ruthlessly exploited in a time of crisis. I do not agree with the attitude adopted by the Country party, whose vernment might use this legislation to prevent the primary producers from cornering foodstuffs in a national crisis. At such a time the foodstuffs they produce should be placed ih a pool for the benefit of the whole of the nation. I am satisfied that this clause is an attempt to deal with profiteers. T.he honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) is smiling. He is South Australia, who this year made a profit of 60 per cent., and who are exploiting the Commonwealth Government in the supply of materials for the defence o: this country. Certain profiteers who had contracts from the Defence Department became ashamed, and handed back to the Government a portion of their excess profits.

The honourable member who has just resumed his seat ( Mr Mahoney) touched on many subjects. ""AlthoughI admit that the clause gives one considerable latitude, I do not propose to ramble as he has done but shall contfine my remarks to paragraph e. Every honourable member is very greatly concerned in regard to profiteering. Although cheap gibes have been thrown across the chamber, let me say to those who have made them that I am just as much concerned about the limitation' of profits as they are. ber has never stood up to an obligation in his life. always been opposed to profiteering, and have spoken against it whenever the opportunity presented itself. The CHAIRM AN ( Mr Prowse.)I remind the honourable member for Denison( Mr Mahoney) that he is out of order in interjecting in the way he does. I am warning him. statement of the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Casey) that, even under existing arrangements profiteering was practically impossible. I do not entirely agree with him in: that, but I believe that every effort should be made to exclude the possibility of profiteering. He also stated that under.section 67 of the Defence Aot, the Government possessed powers to control profit-taking. I am very pleased that it has such powers, because that constitutes an additional safeguard. However, whether or not the powers conferred in this bill are necessary for the purpose of controlling profits, its introduction has furnished an opportunity to discuss the subject of profits generally. I have studied the proposed amendments, particularly those of the honourable memhonorable member for Balaclava ( Mr limit paragraph e of sub-clause 1. White). In effect, those honourable members have stated that a profit of 6 per cent, is sufficient in all cases. In my opinion, 6 per cent, might be too much in some instances, and not enough in others. Eor that reason I do not propose to support the amendment of the honourable member for Martin. should be up to 6 per cent. They might be only one per cent. ing of the amendment, and I do not like the principle involved in it. Therefore, I shall not support it, but I am prepared to support the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eorde), which takes the form of a proviso that nothing shall exclude provision for the ascertainment of costs, and the control or limitation of profits in relation to the production of munitions. We have heard much about the services of accountants. I believe that there are many admirable accountants, and they should be capable of doing much good work as members of an advisory committee. I point out to the Minister, however, that he should not place too much responsibility on them. It is necessary, in addition to accountants^ to have qualified technical men to advise them. An accountant is a man who deals with figures only, and, in a matter of this kind, he would need the advice of a qualified technician. deceived. whether one has a suspicious mind. The rest of the bill has my support, and I hope that it will have a speedy passage.

278,Mr Casey (€Orio,"Minister forThe clause under consideration is clause 5 of the Supply and Development Bill, but the debate has become so localized that one would suppose that the clause related to nothing more than the profits of big business. I propose to take for the moment a wider view of the clause, congratulating the Minister( Mr Casey), in passing, upon his rapid subsidence after an intelligent count of heads. This clause sets up a new department of State, and it enumerates the matters which will be administered in that department, or which may be administered in it. It may very well be that none of the matters mentioned in the clause and its various sub-clauses will, in fact, be administered in this department. It may be that some of them will be administered for a certain time, and that the administration will then be discontinued, and they will pass out of the control of the department. It may be, as I indicated in my second-reading speech, that they will be administered for certain classes of perself admitted, the objects of this clause sons for some of the time. In this respect, could quite well be achieved under exist-' a new principle of government has been introduced, a principle of which I most heartily disapprove. I point out, however, that an act of parliament is not required for the creation of a new department of State. As a matter of fact, since the establishment of federation, new departments have, from time to time, been created, and old departments have been given new names. Changes more numerous than the changes in the personnel of ministries have taken place, in the definition of their departments as circumstances were thought to require it. At the beginning of federation there were eight full-time Ministers of State, and two honorary Ministers. This Government has established a record. It has reached .the peak. A majority of the members of the United Australia party are members of the. Government. There are twelve fullyLfledged Ministers and four partly-fledged, aspiring Ministers. speech, or is it a speech on the clause before the committee? the clause, which provides for the setting up of a new department, a fact that the profiteers have entirely overlooked in their pursuit of profits. I am discussing the creation of a new department of State, with a large variety of matters under its jurisdiction. I am not discuss-' ing, I remind the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), merely how much 1 can be made out of the trade of blood: That is a subsidiary matter, though, no doubt, a very important one from the point of view of the Government to which he gives equivocal support. The real motives for the creation of this department, with its new Minister who had to be accommodated after he was disrated, and who insists on his precedence, are, first, electioneering purposes, and, secondly, the pursuit of imperialism at the behest of the money masters in and out of Australia. Both as to the electioneering and as to the pursuit of imperialism at the dictation of others, the action of the Government has been directed by high finance. There is really no need for this bill at all. As the Assistant Minister( Mr Holt) has himing legislation. He suggested that the introduction of the bill was a matter of courtesy, a concession to the prejudices' of the Country party. what I said. amazing statement for the Assistant Minister to make. there was no need for this bill.

Richmond( Mr Anthony) says that you must envisage profits, that you cannot carry on business, or pay wages, without profits. acquainted as is .the honourable gentleman with the ordinary operations of the capitalist system. I have laboured under it for a good many years; most of us have, and we have suffered under it, more or les® contentedly; but I point out that this is quite a different matter. What we aTe envisaging is a state of war, and a state of grave emergency, in which there is a challenge and a threat to the lives of the people of Australia, in fact, to the country itself. At any rate the Government says so. We of the Labour party are not concerned with wans in foreign parts in respect of which we propose to take no part, but I point out that the only purpose for which munitions are to he made is for the physical resistance of a fictitious enemy whom we are to destroy with those instruments of death. I point out that, when this invasion takes place, if it does, with these miunitions are to be employed the men of this country, and especially the working class, who will be conand Empire on a foreign battlefield, when scripted for the defence of this country. Then, I ask the honourable member for Richmond, will these gentlemen be entitled to consider their profits with their backs against the wall fighting in defence of the lives, homes and hearths of the people of this country? will be no question of 6 per cent, or 5^ per cent, for tjhe worker® whose lives are to be immolated, and rightly in those circumstances, for the defence of their own country within their own shores. It is for that reason, among others, that I am not interested in your bartering as to whether we are to get 6 per cent, for defending our country, or 5£ per cent, or 3 per cent. I am concerned with the defence of this country,' and the defence of the lives of the people whom the Government proposes to conscript in the service of capitalism, wealth, and. profit. Under, the policy of this Government, solMr Brennan. diers will be enlisted for service in foreign countries, possib.y under conscription in foreign countries. I do not accept the declaration of the Government that there will be no conscription for overseas service. I have no reason to accept it. The honourable member for The present Government contains a Minister who himself declared that he would never be a party to conscripting Australians for service overseas, but who, I am just as well when the occasion arose, determined to break his plighted troth, took his Government to Government House, formally handed in the resignation of that Government and asked for a fresh commission in order that he might pursue the policy of conscription for overseas service. He thus broke his bond with the people in spirit while keeping it in the word. Are these soldiers who serve in foreign parts to be assured of a 6 per cent, profit, or a 5 per cent, profit? Or are they to be put under martial law to do duty for somebody at something less than a living wage? Is that to be the position? I want to know what profits you are going to assure' to the mother of the Australian son, who, driven out of this country by your base betrayal in regard to the social system of this country, loses his life on a foreign battlefield-the mother who finds the blackcoated messenger of death coming into her home, perhaps in my electorate, to be told that her son has died gloriously for KingI know he has given his life uselessly to serve your capitalists. What profit is this Australian mother to get for the loss of her Australian son in buttressing your capitalist system in foreign countries? member has exhausted his time. [8.52] I should not have risen to speak on this measure in committee but for one or two statements made from the ministerial bench, and one from an honourable member opposite. I , personally, am strongly of the opinion that no amendment which can be put into this bill, whether it happens to come from the Opposition or from the Government side, from one lawyer or from another, will satisfactorily deal with what the committee is trying to deal with, namely, the limitation of profits. We might just as",48,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5

286,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"well be frank about these things, and, at least, not attempt to deceive ourselves. A good deal of misapprehension appeared to exist this afternoon and last night in regard to one or two -simple business transactions in Australia in regard to market quotations. Seldom has a more confusing statement been made as to what constitutes a market level, in this instance, for copper, than that made by the Minister( Mr Casey) last night. Then, this afternoon, we heard a statement by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn), who seemed to be completely confused as to the difference between a profit being calculated on the capital involved in the conduct of a business and a percentage profit on the turnover. They are two entirely different propositions. This matter was raised by the honourable member for Martin( Mr MoCall) in regard to the supply of gas masks. If , for instance, you have a company engaged in the manufacture of that, perhaps, necessary, but uncomfortable, article, with a capital of £10,000 and you limit its profit to 5 per cent., it would be entitled, under the amendment now being discussed, to an annual profit of £500. Buti f this company were to make 100,000 gas masks a year at £1 apiece, and you were to limit its profit on that work to 5 per cent, on production, it would be entitled to a profit of 100,000 shillings, which is a very different figure. In order to arrive 'at a proper appreciation of what is involved in this amendment, we must go into questions of that kind, and I suggest that this committee is not exactly the best body to go into such questions. honourable member for Bourke said. and I entirely agree with him in that respect. I can only say, therefore, that I am surprised at the Government's action in accepting the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde). It seems to me as if the Government itself is not quite sure exactly where it stands in this measure. In the second-reading stage, I gave the bill the unstinted support to which I thought it was entitled. To-day, however, I see the Government accepting an amendment which, in its own heart, it must know to be futile, and I hear the Assistant' Mihis^ ter ( Mr Holt) this afternoon declaring that the Government has every power to' do what this bill attempts to confer upon it. said that this bill was evidence of our good faith, inasmuch as if we did not desire to control profits and to speed up defence preparations it would not' have been necessary for us to introduce it . be very interested to see the transcript of the shorthand notes of what the honourable gentleman said this afternoon. will have an opportunity to do so. very much like to have that opportunity. The Assistant Minister said that it was a matter of courtesy that this bill was introduced-that all of these powers were already in the hands of the Government. If that is the attitude of the Government then we are being held here to-night discussing matters which there is no necessity for us to discuss at all. either of the Government or of myself. might as well argue on that point as on some of the matters raised in this measure. I stand now where I stood last week. The provision of a proper system of munitions supply and development for warfare in this country is very necessary, but the manner in which this bill is being put through, and the fact that a sheaf of amendments is coming from the Minister himselfI think that no less than ten new clauses have come into the bill, to is what the say nothing of a host of amendments to clauses already drafted-lead s one to suspect either that the bill was drafted in a hurry, or that the Government is very doubtful as to the course it is taking, and the rate at which it is proceeding al >ng that course. In regard to all of th«>e amendments I say that we might as well get down to tin tacks and recognize that, if it is the declared policy of the Government, by introducing this measure, to give the country"" the impression that profits are to be controlled by some sleight of hand method, we should debunk the thing now and be done with it. We might as well admit that these things are",49,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5

Judging by the debate so far the error is becoming very evident. pleased that the Minister has agreed to accept the amendment forecasted by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Great Britan and back, plus 25 per cent, Forde). I agree with the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron,) that the Government has no real intention to put :an end ito profiteering. At any .rate, if it is attempting to accomplish that purpose, it has succeeded so far only in deceiving itself. A few months ago, in company with other honourable members, I inspected the munitions works at Maribyrnong, in Victoria. At that time the factory was producing shells of various sizes, and we understood that the work was to be continued to We 'have heard that many countries, particularly Great Britain, are fully occupied in providing their own defence requirements, .and that orders have been placed in Australia for materials for the manufacture of munitions. When a bill was passed by .this Parliament last year to authorize the expenditure of £63,000,000 on defence, the Opposition did not oppose the Government in any way. In fact, it gave what amounted almost to an open cheque. If , at that time, the Governis equivalent to £51 5s. in Australia. The ment had asked for more money the Opposition would have agreed to provide more The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) stated that it was the business of the Government to know what was needed for defence purposes, and that it ought to know better than the Opposition what was needed. We gave the Government a free hand to carry out its defence plans. So far I am greatly disappointed at the way in which it has set to work. We heard from the Assistant Minister( Mr Holt) last night that the Government had purchased 800 tons of copper and 300 tons of zinc. I do not know what price was paid foi' the zinc, but the price paid for the copper was £48,000, or £60 a ton. I understand that the price of copper for the last two or three years has been about £40 a ton. According to the Commonwealth. Year-Booh, the price of copper in 1936 was £38.44 a ton. The tbe second-reading debate, price now is £41 a ton. quoting the London price. orable gentleman denied the statement of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) that .the price the Government had paid took into account freight to exchange. As a matter of fact, the honourable member for Balaclava was right. The price of copper in Great Britain at present is £41. If we add to that price 25 per cent, for exchange, a liberal amount is still left to cover the equivalent of freight charges to and from Great Britain. contention is not soundly based. The London price for copper in 1937, plus exchange, was £56 in Australian currency. get to London? noon. answered the 'honourable member's question. I wish to know how the Government arrived at a price of £60. If the 1937 price for copper in London was £56 in Australian, currency, it must have been the highest price ruling in that' year. The present London price is £41, which difference between that amount and the' £60 paid by the Government provides an ample margin for freight to and from Great Britain. allow for insurance and handling charges. fore the honourable member for Balaclava is right. If the Government took into account imaginary transport costs, imaginary wharf fees, and imaginary labour costs in this purchase, the whole transaction was a farce. This matter should be investigated by the advisory accountancy panel. If that panel actually advised the Government in this transaction, its appointment should be terminated. I take exception to the purchase of only 800 tons of copper and 300 tons of zinc. Of what use would that quantity be",50,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5

303,Mr Frost,"That is true. Therefor .the. manufacturers of munitions to supply the whole of Australia's requirements ? When I visited the Maribyrnong factory I was given to understand that it had very limited supplies of metals in stock When we voted £63,000,000 for defence purposes I believed that the Government would lay in a stock of defence materials, but it has not done so. Yet each month large consignments of zinc and copper are being loaded for overseas ports at Risdon in Tasmania. Japanese line of steamers is taking away, not hundreds, but thousands, of tons of zinc every month. Tasmania possesses one of the world's finest copper mines from which copper is exported to many countries. If the Government were sincere in its defence policy, it would be retaining large quantities of copper for its own purposes. Copper and zinc are essential to the manufacture, of munitions. There could be no fear of financial loss because the prices of these metals will never fall. They are now as low as they ever will be. The Government's chief concern is not the protection of Australia, but the constituting of advisory panels, to provide jobs for a few men in Victoria and New South Wales. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) said last night that three or four Victorians had been appointed to one of these panels and-three or four residents of New South Wales and Victoria to the other. The Government has considered only the powerful interests in these two States from which its policy is dictated. I have said 'On other occasions that, if Australia became involved in a war, the first act of an enemy would be to destroy the zinc works in Tasmania, with the result that Australia. would have neither munitions nor materials with which to manufacture them. The 300 tons of zinc recently purchased is scarcely worth considering. The Tasmanian smelting works are the only ones of the kind in the southern hemisphere. the coastline? Derwent River, about 40 or 50 miles inland. The waterway is sheltered and could be easily defended. If the Government .were sincere in its defence programme, 'it would establish munitions factories in Tasmania. Even if.supplies of raw materials could not be transported regularly across Bass Strait, the finished munitions could be shipped as oppor-, tunity offered. At present, if Tasmania, were.isolated by danger from submarines, or from some other cause, the factories on the mainland would soon exhaust their stock of raw materials. No harm would be done if the Government purchased raw materials for its own use instead of perA mitting them to be sent overseas. The Government has announced that it . intends to decentralize defence works, and the Loan Council has intimated that to compensate, the States for the smaller amounts of money granted to them, greater sums would be made available for munitions work's. I ask honourable members to consider the value of the works allocated to Tasmania in the last four years. In 1935-36, £616,000 was spent on defence works in Australia, and' of that amount Tasmania received £14,528.: Comparative figures for subsequent yearsare: 1936-37, total expenditure, £643,000, Tasmania's share, £13,390; 1937-38, total expenditure, £695,000, Tasmania's share, £7,000; 1938-39, total expenditure, £1,342,000, Tasmania's share, £12,000. It can be seen that Tasmania's share is growing smaller every year. smaller States receive in those years in the Federal Aid Roads grants and grantsin-aid ? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Nairn) -Order! The discussion must not proceed on these lines. question by asking him one in return. What amount did Tasmania pay in petrol tax in those years? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member must not pursue that question further. and of importance to all the State's. I trust that the Government will accept the various amendments foreshadowed by the Acting Leader of the Opposition. It is strange that it should have dispensed with private members' day in order to debate an amendment, only to agree to that amendment to-night. member's time has expired. "" '-",51,Speaker Hon.

309,The Chairman,"The honorablemy. second-reading speech I announced that I supported the principle contained, in. this clause. I do so because I believe that it may reduce the lag in defence supplies. Later, in committee, I moved that profits be limited to 6 per cent. I chose that figure somewhat at random,-, in the hope that the Government would propose something better. That amendment was withdrawn in favour of one designed to make the 6 per cent, apply only to the value of the actual assets employed in the earning of any profit. That would prevent any business man from placing money in reserve and claiming that his profit was only*6 per cent. That rate is a maximum. Minister' after Minister has -spoken, only to reveal how palpably unprepared the Government was to do anything specific to limit profiteering. It was claimed that various proposals to that effect were unworkable. I do not say that profiteering is indulged in to any extent, although there may be profiteering. I am glad to have the support of the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Frost) of what I said in regard to copper, as he is in a position to know. Yet the Minister floundered when attempting to deal with the matter, but no explanation has been given; we do not know whether or not excessive profits are being made. In my opinion, the standard of commercial integrity is as high in Australia as in any other country. places. to both manufacturers and importers who tender for supplies to the Defence Department and other departments. The reason that there are no excessive profits in connection with government contracts is that there is definite competition between tenderers. Monopolies are in an entirely different category. So faT, there has been no adequate explanation of the way in which their figures will be checked. There will be no competition for certain metals and other materials, even if tenders 'be called. Private members have no access to the figures of these concerns as has the Government. For that reason, the Government should be frank, and say definitely that this or that, company is making only, say, 1 per cent, or 2 per cent, profit. If that were done, the air would be cleared, and honourable members generally would have more faith in the sincerity of the Government. After all, this debate was initiated by the Government. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said, and other members of his Cabinet have repeated, that there is to be no profiteering in relation to defence supplies. This half-baked bill is brought forward to give effect to that declaration and we are asked to accept it. Because we have criticized the Government's lack of clarity we are told that we are attacking Australian manufacturers. The Government has issued a challenge to manufacturers and importers. We ask it to say how it intends to deal with the matter, but it has failed to show how profits are to be checked. The amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) does not make the position any better than it was before. Instead of "" arrangements for ascertaining costs and for the control and limitation of profits "", the amendment proposes to add the following proviso:Provided that no such determination shall exclude provision foi; the ascertainment of costs and for the control and limitation of profits in relation to the production of munitions. What is the limitation, and how is it to be enforced? Some honourable members condemned the panel of accountants, but such a panel is nothing new for it was mentioned last year. I agree with the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) that the Assistant Minister( Mr Holt) admitted that there is nothing new in this bill, and that all that it seeks to do could be done under the defence powers that already exist. I remand the 'Government that the wartime profits tax brought £7,000,000 to the Commonwealth Treasury, because certain people exploitedtohepublic in connection with the supply of foodstuffs and munitions.

When I was Minister for Trade and CustomsI at least made them appear before the Tariff Board. The Assistant Minister said that I approved of certain duties on copper. I did so, but only on the recommendation of the Tariff Board. When administering the Trade and Customs Department, I endeavoured to get as many men into employment as possible and I remind the House that during -the six years I was in control of the department, 4,000 new factories were established and work was found for over 200,000 additional men. Those figures are a source of great satisfaction to me. It has been said that Australia's policy of protection tends to create millionaires in our midst. I reply that, if there are to be otherwise he would soon become bankrupt. millionaires, it is better that they should be in this country than in other countries; because as residents of Australia they are taxpayers, and the Government can tax tihem. I do not care from what industry excess profits are made; those profits should be taxed, so that the burden of taxation on people with smaller incomes may be made lighter. Last night I read some criticism by the board that "" corner"" prices in Australia are too high, though there were reasons given. This is the time to check profits, not to throw men out of work. Honourable members will recollect that when I reduced the duties on cement there was an outcry; although this was to force down prices several members of the present Cabinet voted against the reduction and temporarily defeated the Government. I repeat that I regarded it as my duty to do .what I could to place men in employment and develop Australia, rather than make it possible fora few' persons to make excessive profits. which reference has been made has averaged less than 6 per cent, profit for the last six years. has shown the profits made by that company.

Bronze and the associated company which took it over. The Mount Lyell Company supplies raw copper. We do not know what profit it makes on that commodity, nor do we know that the panel of accountants will be able to obtain that information. As I have said, the proposed amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition is useless. I adhere to the proposal for a limit of 6 per cent., which the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Eadden), who is an accountant said was a good amendment, although he hoped to improve on it. I disagree with those who say that it is impossible to know what profit is being made. Profits, are ascertainable. No business can succeed unless its owner knows what profit he is making; A constant check must be kept on stocks and costs. sales is not known. proper system of accountancy will soon find itself on the financial rocks. I admit that some firms cannot give their dividend rate for a year, but they should be able to state the cost of any item. I recommend that a statutory declaration should accompany every tender. The Government has power to provide for it by regulation. Tenderers should be required to submit a declaration, in which they swear that the profit made by them is, say, 2 per cent, or 3 per cent., or any rate below 6 per cent. Above that rate they can be rejected, or, if there are special reasons for a higher profit, special legislation can be brought down. Business is competitive, and the facts can be ascertained by qualified accountants.",53,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5

It vests in the Minister powers which may be used in any direction desired by the government of the time. There are some provisions which I fear are definitely not in the interests of the workers and others applied to vested interstrongly against the policy which it was ests which are not likely to be effective in their operation. Much of the debate has related to the method of preventing profiteering in connection with the supply of arms and munitions. The amendment of the honourable member for Martin( Mr that the manufacture of armaments McCall) is nebulous. The honourable member-asks for a limitation up to 6 per cent, on the value of the actual assets employed in the earning of profit. If we were dealing with a firm whose whole activities -were directed towards the production of the same sort of commodity or commodities for the Government, it would be possible to show whether or not its profits exceeded 6 per cent, on the capital invested; but as many of these contracts will represent only a small percentage of the business of the companies to which they are let, it would be unfair to allow them to charge prices which would enable them to pay 6 per cent, on the whole of their capital investment. It is a most ineffective proposal in that, although the profit on the whole of a company's transactions may not exceed 6 per cent., the profit on that portion of .the business represented by Government con-a much lower percentage, or even. loss on other undertakings. Calculations .should fee made of the profit derived on each unit supplied. I have no faith, either, these cases the Government in the efficacy of the clause as it stands at present. In my., opinion it will not achieve the desirable objectives of limiting profits and protecting the people against exploitation. I believe that it has been inserted in the bill merely as a gesture to the public that the Government is doing something to prevent profiteering while initiating new enterprises'for the private manufacture of armaments. The history of the manufacture of arms and armaments has been one of exploitation of the peoples of the world. It is realized by every one that the armaments firms throughout the world have been the cause of many wars. This bill is of outstanding importance in that it sets up a new department and brings about a departure from existing practice of government manufacture of munitions. I remember very well the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), in moving the adjournment of the House some time ago, protesting very stated the then Government was proposing to adopt, of handing over to private enterprise the manufacture of armaments. It was contended by honourable members on this side of the House should be restricted to government factories, and that this country should at all costs discourage the operations of the armaments ring, which have proved such a curse in other countries. On that occasion, the then Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) said that the Government did not propose to depart from the policy of government manufacture of armaments. We find now, however,that this measure has been brought down for the specific purpose of stabilizing the policy for the private manufacture of armaments. To delude the public, the Government has inserted in the bill the clause now under discussion which it says gives sufficient power to the Minister to' prevent profiteering. The policy of the party on this side of the chamber is that 'the manufacture of",54,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5
321,Mr Clark (Darling) [9.2s],"Thisarmaments should be strictly a function of the Government and that no avenue should be left open for private exploitation of the misfortunes of the nation in time of emergency. This bill presents an opportunity for private enterprise to exploit the people of this country in a direclimit the profits of those engaged in the tion never open to it before. As a matter of fact, many of our captains of industry are transferring from civil enterprises to various branches of the armaments racket, in anticipation of making excessive profits. One very important manufacturer has given up his ordinary civil enterprise in order to engage in the manufacture of aeroplanes because he believes that it will be a profitable venture. There should be no profit in the manufacture of war material. A defensive war would be fought in the interests of the capitalists of this country, and it is up to them to make their contribution'to the defence of their country by not seeking to gain unfair profits out of the manufacture of war material. As a matter of fact I would go as far as to say that they should be prepared to manufacture war material at, a loss, because it would be used for the protection of their property. As I pointed out in the earlier part of my remarks, it is impossible to eliminate profit from the private manufacture of armaments, because there are so many means by which profits can be hidden, even from the most competent accountants. As was pointed out this afternoon, although the dividends of semi-government undertakings, such as the Electricity Commission, and of private corporations engaged in the supply of gas, are limited to a certain percentage, it is found from time to time that the profits earned are higher than they should be, so that it becomes necessary to place the surplus into special reserves or sinking funds, or to write down the value of assets. profits may be hidden in such a way that they cannot be ascertained even by the closest Endeavours have been made from time to tiine to prevent the continuance of that practice, but it is almost impossible to do so. While the Minister was speaking of the supply of raw materials to manufacturers engaged in munitions making, I interjected and asked whether it was proposed to limit the profits of those engaged in the supply of raw materials. The right honourable gentleman said that he would deal with that matter at a later stage. He completed his speech, however, without outlining to honourable members the methods proposed to be adopted to supply of raw materials. Eor instance, we have the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited supplying steel and some of the most important basic commodities to the armaments ring. Apparently that company will be able to fix its own price for those raw materials. The Minister has not. told us in what way it is proposed to investigate the prices of those commodities, nor was he prepared to say that steps would be taken to ensure that the producers of raw materials would charge a reasonable price to the manufacturers who turn out the finished articles. The price of metals was also discussed, particularly that of copper. It was pointed out by some honourable members that the Government proposes to pay the London price, plus the Australian exchange rate, for its copper purchases. If it be desired that London parity price should be paid, we should pay the London price less the cost of freight to London. The metal is not to be sent to London. If , for instance, metal is sold for £40 a ton in London, and the freight is £10 a ton, it should be sold in this country for £30 a ton, whereas, if we had to pay the actual London price we should be paying a price which included freight from this country. The scope of clause 5 is indeed' very wide. A later clause in the 'bill gives power to the Governor General to make regulations in respect of all matters specified in clause 5.' It is in respect of those regulations that I .see the greatest danger of abuses. Paragraph d which Thus deals with the acquisition, maintenance and disposal of goods is a very important one for this Parinvestigation of accounts. liament to consider. We have only to remember what happened during the Great War as the result of regula-tions promulgated under the War Precautions Aot. Eegulations were issued under that act over which the Parliament had absolutely no control. As a matter of fact, many of the things done then by regulations were even kept secret from the Parliament. My authority for that statement .is the official booklet Rules for the Censorship of the Press, copies of which were issued confidentially to selected executives of newspaper companies during the war. Each copy was numbered and a signature was obtained for its issue. The recipient was made personally 'responsible for the pamphlet and the secrecy of the information it contained. At first the rules were taken lightly; the press endeavoured to got round them. We found, ""however, after one prominent journalist in Melbourne, and another in Sydney, had been threatened with internment for contravention of the rules, that the resistance of the press was broken down and the newspapers came into line and adhered to the rules. These regulations, issued under the War Precautions Act, which were desigued to prevent the disclosure to the enemy of naval or military information, were most drastic in character. The dual effects of the censorship were to remove impediments to the economic conscription of Australian conscription being twice rejected-and to suppress facts that would reveal the profiteering in respect of war materials and services that had gone on. Regulation 28 (ae) gave power to the military authorities to enter by force, and, if necessary, to seize and destroy copies of newspapers containing ""injurious The dragnet definition of "" injurious matter"" covered "" any matter likely to be injurious to the public safety or. welfare."" The military authorities decided what was injurious matter and there was no appeal against their decision. The object of .tjhe regulation was to put the military authorities absolutely above criticism of any kind. I mention the regulations promulgated under the War Precautions Act to draw attention to the possible abuses that may follow the utilization of powers to make regulations in respect of this clause. There has been much discussion in this chamber lately about the powers of the Parliament being usurped by the Executive. This clause will enable the powers of the Parliament to be still further encroached upon by the 'Government. During the. war we had experience of the rationing of sugar, butter and other commodities tlr. Clark. produced in this country. That rationing was carried out for the purpose of profiteering on the overseas war markets. The wool-growers of this country alone lost approximately £500,000,000 on the war transactions. Section 3, sub-section 21 of the War Precautions Act provided that the publication of oversea quotations for wool and of prices obtained for wool shipped overseas should be prohibited. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N ( Mr Nairn) -The honourable member's time has expired. press my keen disappointment that the Government has not seen fit to introduce into the bill a definite provision with regard to the control and limitation of profits, and that the Ministers who have spoken on behalf of the Government have equally failed to convey to the committee how the clause now under discussion will be administered. As a matter of fact, I think that every explanation attempted by the Minister has left the committee youths-legal with less confidence in the eventual mode of administration. The arrangement which the Government apparently proposes to make in connection with the price of copper, which was dealt with by the committee in detail proves on examination to be entirely unsatisfactory. If the general authority to be given to the matter."" Government for the control of profits is to be administered in the same way as the price of copper has been determined, I should say that the purpose which the Parliament has in mind in thus helping the Government will be wasted. The products of the greatest industries of Australia are constantly realized on by the producersI am referring particularly to the primary producers-o n the basis of export parity; that is, the price prevailing in the great market centres of the world, less all costs incidental to the transportation and sale of the products there. For instance, the wool-growers sell their' products in Australia at London parity, which means the London price, less tall costs incidental to the transportation of the goods to London and the sale of them there. without saying.",55,Speaker Hon.

324,Mr Mcewen,"That, of course, goesthe .only item as far as copper is concerned. should Assistant Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Holt) found difficulty in appreciating the fact tliat there is a very great difference. For comparison let us .take a typical item such as wool. The wool-grower realizes as a net price for his product, the price ruling in London, less all costs incidental to transporting hi® goods there, insuring and selling them. Therefore, he receives something considerably less than the actual London price. Apparently, the Government intends to pay the Australian producer of the copper to be used in its munitions factories, not the London parity but the London price. If that producer were to sell his product in London, he would receive the London price less, of course, all the costs incidental to transportation and realization.; but, if he were to sell the copper to the Commonwealth Government, under the terms explained to this committee, be would receive more than the amount he would be paid if he exported his product to London, because he would get the London net price. Before the termination of this debate, the Government should indicate to honourable members that this state of affairs will not bo permitted to continue, not only in regard to copper, but also in regard to other products. I should like to receive an .assurance that the price to he paid by the Government for any raw material produced in Australia will not be more than London parity, or the export parity. It seems to me absolutely unthinkable that .the Commonwealth Government should be prepared to pay for copper or any other raw material used in the manufacture of munitions, actually more than the producer could secure by selling his product i u the markets of the world. I do not want to labour this point, but if it may be taken as an example, then only very unsatisfactory administration may be expected from the new Department of Supply and Development. In my second-reading speech I said that we would not expect a provision such as clause 5 to be embodied in an act. It is neither more nor less than a statement of policy, the proper place for which is the hustings. It is expected that when a policy is translated into be disappointed if the a bill for submission to Parliament it will be reduced to concrete termssomething that honourable members may understand, criticize, and pass judgment upon. The very nature of this debate demonstrates that the expression of policy embodied in the bill is something that cannot be explained, even by the Government, to this committee. The intention of the bill, as at present drafted, is something that cannot be understood by honourable members. I submit that it should not be left to private members to endeavour, by means of amendments, to carry out the task of drafting legislation. That is the function of the Government. will no doubt vote against the bill. intentions in that regard later. It is for the Government itself, and not for private members, to translate policy into concrete termswhich may be embodied in legislation. I appreciate the force of the arguments used against the amendments moved by the honourable member for member for Balaclava ( Mr White), and that foreshadowed by the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson). It is not to be expected that a private member, left to his own resources, could submit an amendment making watertight a proposal in connection with which the Government itself has been in default. I think that is very understandable. In preparing legislation a government has behind it vast resources, and the assistance of legal and technical advisers. Even at this late stage, the Government should face its responsibility in the matter. Before the committee is called upon to vote on this clause, it should either introduce into the bill a provision more acceptable to honourable members, or, alternatively, it should give a clearer exposition, through the medium of a responsible Minister, as to how this policy is to be administered. By indicating its acceptance of the amendment foreshadowed by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) the Government has already gone so far as to meet, in part, the wishes of some honourable members.

I consider that the passing of this measure would not automatically authorize the department to administer all of these matters, but that it would be necessary for the Governor General, under the terms of sub-clause 1, to direct that each or any of these matters should come within the scope of the department. Therefore it seems that, while the passing of this measure would authorize the new department to arrange, for instance, for the manufacture of aircraft, it would not be automatically authorized to proceed with the manufacture of aircraft. Before that could be done it would first be necessary for the Governor General, according to the provisions of sub-clause 1, to give a ""direction that the manufacture of aircraft should be one of the matters with which the department concern itself.

The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) and the honourable member amendments in an endeavour to give to the Government power to limit profits, but these amendments if adopted will not have the desired effect. We have only to study history to understand the extent to which an armament ring operates throughout the world, and to realize the tactics which it adopts to cause international unrest, to bribe governments, and to secure orders. It also makes loans available to governments so that they will be within the grip of a world-wide monopoly. Representatives of the armaments ring, in anticipation of making huge profits on the orders they hope to receive, are actually advising governments as to the policy they should adopt. The acceptance by the Government of the amendment foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition indicates that it also is concerned with the huge profits that have been made by manufacturers and is anxious to impose some restriction. the Government propose to limit profits? country controls many subsidiary companies, and when the parent company supplies raw material to its subsidiary companies the profits actually made can be ascertained only with great"" difficulty. The amendment proposed by the Acting Leader of the Opposition should assist the Government in that direction. The oil companies operating in Australia are conducting a huge monopoly, and when their profits are low the petrol used in their own vehicles is charged at a low price, and when profits increase a higher price is charged. That is done in order to evade a portion of the income tax they should pay. In view of the information at the Government's disposal concerning the tactics adopted by such companies, ii; should exercise the greatest care in dealing' with companies engaged in the production of munitions for defence purposes. workers at Port Kembla refused to load iron ore for Japan because they knew that it was to be used in the manufacture of arms and munitions. The' waterside workers at Townsville also objected to handling zinc concentrates for shipment overseas, but as their objection was overruled zinc concentrates needed urgently in Australia are still being shipped abroad. The honourable member engaged in the production of copper are getting a "" rake-off "", but I hope he did not include those miners known as ""gougers"". The Minister( Mr Casey) admitted last night that the bulk of the copper used in the manufacture of munitions is purchased from the Mount Lyell Company, another monopolistic concern, and that the price paid by the Government is approximately £60 a ton. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Frost) gave the price for copper during the last two years, and his figures are correct. We were also told by the Minister that the price which the Government pays for copper produced in Australia is based on London parity to which exchange and freight have to be added. The"" gougers,"" or those who mine copper oh a small scale, do not derive any advantage from their arduous work, because they are comHow does pelled to accept the price offered by speculators who get all the benefit.

The Minister for Supply and Development to-day read to the committee information as to how the authorities in England are controlling profits. I hope for the sake of the taxpayers, by whom I mean the workers, because the Government has raised indirect taxes to an abnormal height and thereby increased the cost of living, that this Government will never adopt the methods employed by the Chamberlain Government, for the simple reason that in January we learned that as the result of the re-armament programme in Great Britain 42 additional millionaires have been created. Again, during the September crisis there was a scandal in Britain over the supply of sandbags. Those two instances are sufficient to show the ineffectiveness of the methods adopted by the Chamberlain Government to restrict profits. The Assistant Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Holt) said that there Avas no actual necessity for the Government to bring doAvn this bill. Why was it brought down? It Avas brought down because the Government Avanted to have four Ministers for Defence, and to find jobs for highly-paid public serextension of industries for purposes of defence. vants Avho have lost their positions as the result of the throwing overboard of national insurance. The CHAIRM AN ( Mr Prowse.)The honourable gentleman has exhausted his time. [Quorum formed.] This is a most remarkable clause in a most remarkable bill. I have yet to learn that the bill is necessary.' As a matter of fact the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Casey) admitted yesterday that it was merely a courtesy measure. That statement, if it means anything, would indicate that the bill has been introduced as an apology for a graAe departure from general governr mental policy. The Government, which has had a complete monopoly of the manufacture of munitions, desires to depart very radically from that policy, and, in order to give some superficial importance to the event, has brought forward a measure the machinery clause of which is the one we are now discussing. This clause is the alpha and omega of the bill, yet a careful study of it discloses that, although the Government proposes to take"" unto itself powers which it already possesses, it contains the saving grace from the point of view of the Government that the whole of the powers that it proposes to take are subject to direction from the Governor General, Avhich in effect is direction from itself to itself. I have not yet heard any honourable gentleman opposite claim for instance that paragraph a is necessary. Paragraph a reads:The provision or supply of munitions. The Government is manufacturing munitions, and it could increase the supply of munitions to any extent that it desired. This bill is not necessary to give the Government that power. Paragraph b reads:_ The manufacture or assembly of aircraft or parts thereof by the Commonwealth or any authority of the Commonwealth. Does any honourable gentleman suggest that the Government has not already the power to manufacture or assemble aircraft? Paragraph c reads:Arrangements for the establishment or Can anybody argue that the Government has not that power already? The establishment or extension of industries for tlie purposes of defence is a natural corollary to increased defence activities, and it could be achieved without this bill. Paragraph d readsThe acquisition, maintenance and disposal of stocks of goods in connection with defence. Can anybody argue that the Government has not already the power to do that? Paragraph e contains the only power AvhichI suspect that the Government lacks. It reads:Arrangements for ascertaining costs and for the control and limitation of profits in relation to the production of munitions. I do not know that the Government has the power to do that at the moment, except through the customary system of tenders. If the Government invites tenders for'the supply of any material connected with the defence requirements of this country, it can reject the tender of any manufacturer who, in its opinion, is making",60,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5
338,Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [10.15],"undue profits. some doubt concerning the existence of legislative power to ascertain costs and to limit profits, I at least know that the Government may reject the tender of any firm suspected of profiteering. Consequently, I believe that it is not necessary to make the provision contained in paragraph e. Paragraph / provides forThe arrangement or co-ordination of( i ) surveys of Australian industrial, capacity and the preparation of plans to ensure the effective operation of Australian industry in time of war; and ( i i ) the investigation and development of Australian sources of supply of goods, which, in the opinion of the Governor General, are necessary for the economic security of the Commonwealth in time of war. The Commonwealth already possesses census powers, under which it undoubtedly has the right not only to inquire into the personal affairs of the people of the Commonwealth, but also closely to scrutinize any business which in its opinion may be necessary in wartime. Therefore, I consider that the provision in sub-paragraph (i ) is unnecessary. I further believe that the Government already has the power to make whatever survey it desires of the Australian sources of supplies which, in the opinion of the Governor General, are necessary for the economic security of the Commonwealth in time of war. That disposes of all of the provisions in sub-clause 1, which sets out the powers that the Government desires to obtain under, this legislation. I consider, therefore, that the bill is not necessary, and that it has been introduced probably as a medium for the dissemination of the war propaganda in which the Government has been indulging for two or three honourable member's time has expired. years. Let us assume, for the moment, that the -This afternoon the honourable member Government has none of these powers. for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) made a The bill will provide them, but why statement with respect to this clause with should the exercise of them be which I entirely agree. The honourable conditional upon a determination by gentleman said, in effect, that he had the Governor General-who , of course, grave doubts as to whether this committee acts on the advice of the Cabinet? Subwas the best authority to judge what is a clause 1 provides that the matters reasonable profit, and what is the best referred to in paragraphs a to / shall be basis for assessing that profit. Thus, whilst I have administered "" subject to the directions of the Governor General."" Consequently, the operation of these provisions is contingent upon such a direction being given. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) yesterday submitted an amendment, which he subsequently withdrew'in favour of an amendment by the honourable member for Martin( Mr McCall), which proposes to limit to 6 per cent, the rate of profit to be made on the manufacture of munitions. I do not know whether these honourable gentlemen seriously believe that the amendment would have any effect. I am inclined to think that they are indulging in the playful pastime of pulling their own legs; because I do not think it is. possible for the Government or for any accountant to determine what is a fair rate of profit, or to decide whether any of. the firms which have Government contracts are making 2 per cent., 3 per cent., 4 per cent., 5 per cent., or 6 per cent. We have had placed before us illuminating information in regard to the marketing of copper, which, in itself, ought to be ah indication to honourable members of the impossibility of discovering what is a fair rate of profit in the manufacture of munitions. Copper is produced in Australia. The average person would think that the price charged to the Government for munitions purposes would be a figure represented by the cost of mining, smelting and purifying the. product, plus a reasonable percentage of profit to the employer. Yet we discover that the Australian price is entirely artificial, being based on the ruling price in London, which includes the cost of transport from Australia to England, plus the cost of exchange, which at the moment is 25 per cent.

All this goes to show the truth of what the honourable member for Bourke said. The Government has announced the appointment of an honorary panel of accountants to advise it as to the best method of dealing with the matter. Some honourable members have expressed their approval of the personnel of the panel, yet those same honourable members have proposed to make the matter absolutely rigid byfixing a definite percentage of profit. It seems' to -me that if we are to have an advisory panel we should, before taking .action to fix a rigid formula, at least wait until we receive its advice. None of the amendments proposing to fix a definite percentage of profit can be regarded as satisfactory;""The amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) is in a different category, because it is general in its scope. Some doubt has been expressed as to whether it would be of any value. Sub-clause 2 permits the Governor General-o r in other words, the Government-to decide to what extent it shall administer paragraphs a to f. That would enable the Government to restrict or modify action under any of those paragraphs, but the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition will ensure that no such modification can take place in respect of the matters covered by paragraph e. In other words, no -provision for the limiting of profits will be modified by what appears in subclause 2. This seems to be sound common sense, and for that reason I propose to -support the amendment. : When I was interrupted I was discussing ,the. price of copper, a metal indispensable ment. They will be giving their services ""for. munitions. Though it is to a certain extent refined when 'acquired ,by, 'the munitions factories, it is 'stilL,' essentially a raw material. I point out to honourable members that it will be very difficult to control profits on manufactured goods when such flagrant regard to the supply of copper. The average Australian might assume that the cost of copper to the Australian Government, particularly for defence purposes, would be the cost of mining, smelting and refining it, ""plus a reasonable profit. We find, however, that even the Commonwealth Government has to pay the London ;price for the Australian copper which it buys in Australia. This includes freight on copper which never goes to London, plus exchange on the purchase price in sterling, in order to convert it to Australian currency.' All those charges -are added to what the Australian citizen would consider a fair price for a commodity produced in Australia. Therefore, when the Government is exploited in respect of this essential -raw materia], I should like to know what method it proposes to adopt to prevent excessive profit-making by manufacturers. . As a matter of fact, the -Government has not yet stated what it considers to be a fair rate of profit. The only indication we have had is the statement of the Minister regarding goods manufactured in defence annexes. The Government, in order to encourage private manufacturers to interest themselves in the manufacture of munitions, has offered to provide' them with the necessary machinery and buildings, to give them contracts, and to allow profits at the bond rate of interest. These annexe manufacturers will probably be on a good wicket. The work will be provided for thein,.and they will be allowed a fair rate of profit on all their undertakings. It is extremely difficult, however, to know How the Government proposes to control the profits of private manufacturers outside the annexe scheme. It has set up a panel of accountants to advise it . on' the matter; but the members of that panel will have no responsibility to the Governvoluntarily, and as they are all themselves in a large way of business, they will-be able to devote to government' work only such time as they are able to spare from their own business activities.",62,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5
341,: . Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [10.34],"Defence requirements are not by any means confined to shells and guns; they include practically everything from a needle to an anchor. The Government will have to buy foodstuffs, boots, uniforms and other items of accoutrement. So far, honourable members seem to have concerned themselves only with controlling the profits of those engaged in the manufacture of actual munitions of war, but it will be just as necessary to control the profits of those supplying every other kind of defence requirement. Those who, during the war, made fortunes out of the manufacture of munitions, have been justifiably condemned, but not so much has been said about those who made fortunes out of supplying to the various belligerent governments putrifying foodstuffs. Little has been said of the fortunes made by those who provided clothing and other necessaries for. the' soldiers during the Great War. The point I emphasize is that the supplies of raw materials, in which there might be exploitation of the Government in a time of emergency, cover such a wide range that it will be practically impossible, for the advisory panel of accountants, who are to give their time voluntarily and, therefore, will probably make a spare-time, instead of a full-time job of their work, to see that the Government gets a fair deal in the contracts it lets. In these circumstances the safeguards which the Government proposes to establish in order to prevent .exploitation are totally insufficient. Furthermore, the Government has not satisfied honourable members as to what it considers to be a fair rate of profit in respect of contracts apart from those to be 'let to the annexes. After all is said and done, the issue to-day is simply whether or not the Government should leave all of this work to private enterprise. Up-to-date, we have, happily, been able .to supply all of the requirements of'pur Military Forces, and, as I believe the possibility of invasion to be remote, -existing factories operating under government control should be able to supply .our probable defence requirements for many years to come. For this reason, I am totally opposed to this measure, particularly the provisions of this clause. Tn'ey arc unnecessary. Furthermore, the :: Government is not sincere in its attempt to limit profits in connection with these contracts. I repeat that it has not yet made a statement as to what it considers to be a fair rate of profit, whilst it has also failed to provide any definite machinery for the purpose of assessing costs and profits in the industries concerned. For these reasons, I shall support the amendments moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition. Whether it be workable or not, it will, at least, make it mandatory on the Government to do something which it now only proposes in a nebulous way to do. [Quorum formed.] regret the necessity for the introduction of this measure. It has originated mainly in the Government's desire to create a new department, but it is evidence of the war hysteria which is influencing the programme of the Government. The Government already possesses the powers which it is seeking under this measure, particularly in respect of the provision or supply of munitions and arrangements for. the establishment or extension of industries for purposes of defence. Wheni t was announced in the Governor General's speech that the Government proposed to establish these annexes, I pointed out the danger of such a policy, particularly at a time when the trend in every country is for governments to control the manufacture of armaments. Notwithstanding this fact, the Government now proposes to permit the manufacture of armaments by private enterprise. Speaking in relation to these annexes in November last in the debate on the budget, I stated that as the establishment of these annexes would involve private enterprise in considerable expenditure, a general clamour would arise on the part of the firms concerned for a continuity of orders. By way of interjection, the then Minister for Defence denied that this would be so. I should now like to know what safeguards the Government proposes to provide in order to prevent these private firms from seeking orders in foreign countries for the supply of war.materials. If they cannot be guaranteed a continuity of orders by this Government,",63,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5
342,Mr Sheehan (Oook) [10.45],"Iwhat is to prevent them from endeavouring to get such orders in other countries at a rate of profit much higher than the Government would allow to them? The Government should watch this aspect, because, despite their alleged patriotism, armament country; the only flag they recognize is the black emblem of the buccaneer. Local manufacturers of munitions will likewise be only too ready to accept any opportunity to secure orders overseas. To-day the British Government is making aircraft parts for Germany, despite the fact that the people in one country are being told that they may one day expect to be bombed out of existence by the air forces of the other. Kestrel engine, and the ArmstrongSiddeley Jaguar engines are being sold to the German air service, whilst British naval seaplanes are being built under licence in England on Heinkel patents. The Dutch Fokker factory sells the identical bomber to Germany that it had delivered to Czechoslovakia. facts show that private enterprise in this field is concerned only with profits. Whenever a nation is faced with a grave emergency there will always be found a gathering eers loudly proclaiming their patriotism, while at the same time going their game Fov instance, when materials were needed in Britain during the recent international crisis for the protection of the people from threatened air raids, these despicable and unconscionable profiteers were willing to make supplies available only at profits ranging up to 500 per cent. Pickaxes and trench tools, which prior to the recent crisis were selling at Is., suddenly jumped to 10s., whilst the price of spades and shovels needed for digging trenches rose from 2s 6d. to 13s. 6., and that of galvanized iron required for air raid shelters rose by 500 per cent. There was no shortage of these materials before the crisis, but when the workers of Great Britain commenced to dig trenches and construct air raid shelters for the protection of the masses, supplies could be obtained only at prices dictated by the profiteers. A scandalous example of this Mr Sheehan. ghoulish profiteering was providedi n England in connection with sandbags during the September crisis. Prior to the war scare, these were being sold at Id. apiece but the price suddenly jumped as high as lOd. Millions manufacturers know no of them were needed for the protection of the civilian population and property, but they could be* obtained by government and local government authorities only at exorbitant prices. The manufacturers did not hesitate to sandbag the community and take the highest profits they could get. The honourable informed the committee yesterday that Mr Neville Chamberlain, the Prime The Rolls Royce Minister of Great Britain, held 11,000 shares in Imperial Chemical Industries -Limited. These people are concerned mainly with profits, and they do not mind how the profits are obtained. Sir Basil Zaharo'ff became a multi-millionaire during the last war, and the firm of John Brown and Company Limited, of These England, which is to-day concerned mainly with the manufacture of munitions, made a profit of £466,000 during the war hysteria of 1937. With these examples before it, the Government of profiteering buccanshould make provision to manufacture all necessary munitions in government factories. It should not hardest in the dastardly allow any private annexes to operof plundering the people. ate. The Labour party believes that Australia should be self-contained, but it does not believe that war-mongerers should be permitted to make immense profits. "" [Quorum formed.] I have never had any enthusiasm for either the bill or the various amendments that have been foreshadowed; but the more I hear about the amendments the less I am attracted to them. Since the Government has agreed to accept the amendment foreshadowed by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), I feel certain that my suspicions are well founded. I do not think that the amendment can possibly achieve what is hoped of it. I have heard honourable gentlemen opposite criticize the profiteers, but if we judge them by their actions we must",64,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5

344,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [10.55],"conclude that they regard these individuals as the most honoured section of the community. I well remember that Mr Samuel Walder, a well known citizen of Sydney, became a wealthy man during the last war through supplying tents and other equipment to the Defence Department. jects ""flags"", and I would remind honourable members that most of the flags supplied, by Mr Walder came from Japan. That gentleman has taken a leading part in the activities of the United Australia party in New South Wales for many years, Yet, although he made exorbitant profits during the war, he was knighted on the recommendation of both the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New South Wales. How can honourable gentlemen opposite, who frown on the profiteers at one moment and bestow honours upon them at the next, expect to be regarded as sincere? They cannot, on the one hand, oppose the profiteers and, on the other, encourage them. The Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Casey) has shown dearly by his actions over a period of years that he is not antagonistic to profiteering. In 1934, when he was Treasurer, he was instrumental in postponing the operation of a bill, and tliat action had the effect of exempt-, ing from income tax an amount of almost £6,000,000 of accumulated profits which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company distributed to its shareholders in that year. huge amount was liable to income tax. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company will operate one of the annexes to be established for defence purposes. If we were to believe what some honourable gentlemen opposite say, Ave should regard the manufacturers of this country as being different from manufacturers of other countries. Actually, the main purpose of private manufacturers everywhere is to make the maximum profit possible. I have already challenged the sincerity of the Government's professed desire to limit profits. Every time the Minister for Supply and Development rises to speak he confirms my opinion that the Government is not in earnest. Consequently, I am convinced that the Labour party should oppose this bill lock, stock and barrel, and should not attempt to amend it in any way. This evening the Minister for Supply and Development has said that the Government proposes to follow the British practice in respect of the limitation of profits. That course is entirely unsatisAn honorahle gentleman interfactory to me. The honourable membeT for Cook( Mr Sheehan), in the admirable speech which he has just delivered, made it clear that . in the war scare of last September, certain manufacturers of Great Britain increased the price of their products by as much as 500 per cent. British experts were brought to this country to advise the Government; but as they have not been able to devise any means to prevent the exploitation of the general community in the United Kingdom, hoAv can we expect them to succeed here? The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) pointed out in his excellent speech that we should be concerned, not Avith the percentage of profit that capitalist manufacturers might make on government contracts,. but with the steps Avhich the GoA'ernment should take to ensure the general well-being of the working-class community which we represent. Many honourable gentlemen in this chamber evidently believe that this country is already at war. I do not think so. According to statements made in this chamber from time to time by Ministers, and other information that is available to us, the situation is much easier than it was some months ago. In these Not one penny of that circumstances, what is the need to rush this measure through Parliament? Are we always to be in a state of emergency? Is there to be no end of these critical times? Will the Minister, say when the crisis, or series of crises, is likely to end ? earth, except perhaps one or two in Europe, can answer that. latest information available, and it should be able to tell us something; but when we ask for information Ave are told that disclosure of it would not be in the public interest. Why is it in the interest of the public to withhold information ? If the public good is the only thing Avhich actuates the Government in withholding information, it is clear that the",65,Speaker Hon.

346,Mr Ward,"The Government has the Government has little faith in the people of this country. I am convinced that if the Australian people knew that their country was really in danger of attack, they would rally to its defence. So far, the Government has given no evidence that Australia is in imminent danger. We are asked to vest in the Government more extensive powers than have ever been given to a government in this country, and as an inducement swallow the pill we are told that, although industry is to be organized in order that it may make its maximum effort for the defence of Australia, profits will be limited. I wish to know how that end is to be accomplished, if , indeed, there is any real intention behind this promise. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) referred to copper supplies. Neither the Assistant Minister( Mr petition would be unconstitutional. That Holt) nor the Minister for Supply and Development satisfactorily We have been told of the prices of copper in various years, but will any honourable member deny that, since the war scares commenced, the prices of all the metals used in the manufacture of munitions have risen? To-day's London prices for such metals are much higher than they were a few years ago. Prices have been inflated by those who have taken advantage of the necessities of copper is required in Australia-where it is produced-the Government is asked to. pay, not the cost of production plus 4 per cent, or even 6 per cent., but world parity prices, irrespective of whether they are inflated or not. Because prices on the London market have been sky-rocketed, the Australian community is to be fleeced. We are asked to pay London prices plus exchange and freight for copper which was produced in this country and never left it.. Yet we are told that there is to be no profiteering in connection with munitions. I should like to know what the Government regards as profiteering. Minister for Supply and Development expressed the opinion that the Government has no constitutional powers to exercise control of prices If there is no constitutional power to contrpl prices, what is the use of this committee trying to tighten up the Mr Ward. machinery' in order to limit profits? I do not say that profit can be entirely eliminated from the manufacture of war equipment in ' existing circumstances. There is only one effective way to exercise control, and that is to manufacture the whole of the Commonwealth's requirements in workshops owned and controlled by the Government. The argument against that is that, in the event of an emergency, to us to the Government would have to construct extensive factories, and equip them with the latest machinery, only to find that the plant could not be used when hostilities had ceased, because the Government may not compete with private enterprise in manufacturing the requirements of'the nation in times of peace. The present Government, which is the champion of private enterprise, says that such comis so. The High Court in 1926 said so; ( Mr Casey) has yet but if the Government is sincerely answered his criticism. desirous of limiting profits, there is an easy way by which it can remove that obstruction and allow government workshops to do other work than that' connected with defence; it can ask the people so to amend the Constitution as to empower the Government to use its workshops for the manufacture, of the peace-time requirements of the community. There would be nothing. wrong with that. Are profits to be the. only governments. Moreover, when things to be sacrosanct in this country? The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) made it clear who make the sacrifices in any conflict between nations. The attitude of the United Australia party towards profiteering is well-known. Its members are not opposed to profiteering, because the profiteers are members of the same clubs and rub shoulders with them every day. They converse together, and generally they are agreed about the things that they discuss. Those gentlemen who made their millions out of the last war contribute to-day to the funds of the Government party. How can we The expect the friends of the profiteers to give effect to legislation to limit the profits of. their political supporters? In contmu'ation of what I have .already said' in' committee, conclusive evidence,"" if further'evidence is required, 'of the -",66,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Clause 5
347,Mr Brennan (Batman) [11.10],"lack, of sincerity on the pant of the Government in submitting .this measure is found in sub-clause 2 . wherein it is provided:The Governor General may from time to time determine the extent to which or the conditions upon which any of the matters specified in this section may be administered by the department. The Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) has moved an amendment, placing paragraph scope of this sub-clause to the extent that, not subject to the direction of the Governor General, but as an enactment of substantive law, one of the matters to be administered by this department;-the only one which must positively be so-is that paragraph e dealing with arrangements for ascertaining costs and the control and limitation of profits in relation to be created for the instruments which they the production of munitions. That is the only part of this clause which may withstand the changing whims of the members of the Government as to whether it should be law or not. ' To that extent I congratulate the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and I congratulate the Government on climbing down discreetly on a count of heads; but I point out that the whole of the remaining part of the clause will not stand as positive law at all, because at any moment the Government may at its own whim remove any of these matters from' the Department of Supply and Development. They may only be' part of the law according to the taste and convenience of the Government. The Governor General in Council may remove them, suspend them, or make any of them apply to certain classes of people for a limited length of time. I have never' heard before in all my experience of statute law that the Governor General -actuall y the Government-ma y repeal any section or sub-section at any time of his own sweet will without even the necessity for the passage of a regulation which at least would lie for a certain time on the table of. the House. With regard to this profiteering business, it has been stated that we rely implicitly on the honesty, the integrity, and above all the patriotism, of those gentlemen who, in annexes or Out of annexes 'are to supply munitions. A ll I can gay is that if we are to rely on them the calibre of the commercial gentlemen in big business in Australia must be .totally different from that of the members of a similar class in all other parts of the world. Why should they be so? Why should it be assumed that avaricious tendencies on the part of commercial men in Australia should be different from the grossly avaricious achievements of commercial men in other parts of the world who, once having tasted the blood of profit, have continued e outside the the blood-letting' to the extent of countless millions of pounds, and have, by reason of their lust for profits, not only charged the maximum in pounds, shillings and pence or their equivalent in the currency of foreign countries, but have also iactually and unashamedly promoted war and war scares so that demands may manufacture ? The book Iron, Blood and Profits, by George Seldes, which was quoted' ithe other night in an eloquent speech by the 'honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Green), contains some very striking observations upon the distinction which is drawn between a soldier, who, in the heat of battle, offers some little comfort or kindness to the enemy, and the profiteering armaments -maker who supplies munitions . to the enemy to be used against the people of his own country. In the very first chapter of his book, the author saysFor giving aid or comfort to the enemy in time of war the penalty is death. Both civilians and soldiers share this punishment. If an American or a British or a French soldier in Ho Man's Land had ever been caught giving a rifle or a grenade to a German, he would have been shot on the battle-field. But the allied armament makers who not only before the war, but during the war, gave rifles and grenades and the comfort of food to the enemy, received baronetcies and the ribbons of the Legion of Honour while making a profit of millions of dollars. Does the Minister deny that that is a typical historical example of what ha6 gone on for years past on the Continent, and that it was a feature of the Great War of 1914-18, during which we in Australia, serving no useful purpose to ourselves, sacrificed 60,000 of our precious manhood? Does he not know that the Thyssens, who in 1916 sold cannon bucklers to the Allies, via a Dutch agent of course, were found guilty when accused of treason, and that to-day Fritz Thyssen, chief supporter of Adolf Hitler, is dictator of the iron, coal, steel, and armaments district of Germany? Does the right honourable gentleman deny that the profiteers and financiers of Great Britain are now entering into business arrangements with these very Thyssens who are dictators of Hitler, the dictator? Does he know that the French, before the World War, sold hand grenades to Bulgaria, which within a few months killed allied soldiers? Our soldiers-m y own Australian brothers-were the men sacrificed to make profits for the armaments makers of Britain, France, Belgium and other countries. Does he know that the secret of the marvellous French gun, the Seventy-five, was taken to the Putiloff Works in Russia, where Krupp engineers worked by the side of British and French engineers? Does he know that the British firm of. Vickers helped arm tlie Turks, and that the Turks used British armaments almost exclusively in killing the Australian and New Zealand troops in the Dardanelles? armaments used by the Turks were almost entirely German. criticism against British manufacturers in particular-God forbid that I should. My attack is directed to financiers the world over. I am attempting to show that there is perfect camaraderie and loyalty in this financial ring. In the same chapter we readThe merchants of death, the Krupps, the Zaharoffs of our time, are for war. Numerous patriotic associations which they finance are for expansion, imperialism, colonization-by means of war. Like Mussolini, they believe in war. The only other quotation that I am able to make from this book in the time at my disposal refers to a speech by Mr Lloyd GeorgeOn 18th August, 1919, speaking in the House of Commons, Lloyd George, without disclosing how great a profit the armament-makers made during the world war, indicated the astronomical figure in his claim that he had been able to effect a saving of more than two billion dollars. He said, "" The eighteen pounder, when the ministry (of munitions), was started, cost 22s. 6d. a shell. A system of costing and investigation was introduced and national factories were set up whicli checked the prices, and a shell for which the war office, at the time the ministry was formed, cost 22s. Cd., was reduced to 126., and when you have 85,000,000 shells, that saved £35,000,000. Tliere was a reduction in the price of all other shells, and there was a reduction in the Lewis guns. When we took them in hand they cost £165, and we reduced them to £35 each. There was a saving of £40,000,000, and 'through the costing system and the checking of the national factories set up, before the end of the war there was a saving of £440,000,000."" That is an example of the profiteering which the taxpayer of Britain has to bear. A ll these things have a beginning, and I point to this Government as being the one that earns the dishonour of introducing, in Australia, this system which in other countries has been an incentive to blood-letting. In Australia, too, it will prove an inspiration to war. What can we do with gentlemen who, in this country, which, unthreatened, unchallenged, and having no enemies, is at peace with all the world, propose to enter into an alliance in Europe that will make us the defenders of a large number, if not the majority, of the little States of Europe, in respect of which we have no knowledge or responsibility? This Government will have to take the blame for starting this evil thing with all its evil consequences. believe that thoughtful citizens throughout Australia are far from satisfied that our defence preparations are proceeding as rapidly as we have been led to believe in press statements and in speeches made from time to time by responsible Ministers and others. Considering the matter in the light of what has been done in other countries,' I fear that our efforts up to the present time to provide effective defence in Australia must be regarded as rather futile, and if the so-called danger is real, our preparations should certainly be speeded up. If the bill before us will guarantee to the people that relief which they are seeking, then I hope that it will be appropriately amended and passed through its various stages with the utmost dispatch. Citizens generally have been greatly disillusioned with regard to the activities of the Defence Department in the provision of munitions and other necessary equipment.

350,Mr Wilson (Wimmera) [11.24],"I-to our alleged preparations for defence, :it was expected that a great dual of work would be available in the munition-making branches of the department, but the details recently supplied, in reply to -questions asked by honourable members in this chamber, show that, although there has been much talk, very little, comparatively speaking, has been achieved up to the present time. It cannot be denied that we have no -definite proof that Australia or the Empire is threatened by the potential -enemies about which we read in the press or are warned by responsible spokesmen of the Government. I challenge Ministers to deny that these so-called potential enemies have .shown great anxiety for friendly relations with this country, not merely in regard to trade, but also in many other respects. Australia should not be unduly exercised in mind about the forms of .government adopted in other countries, nor with respect to the activities of those countries in other parts of the world. I fear that we are again being asked to make sacrifices for the purpose of maintaining what is known as the balance of power. This balance has disturbed the civilized world for centuries, and many wars have been fought in order to adjust it to our liking; but, up to the present time, we have not succeeeded in achieving that result. Much has been said about the control of profits made by armaments manufacturers. I consider it almost impossible to control the profits made by them, and I believe that the people of Australia, who are fully conscious of this fact, are anxious that a change should be made. doubt that a majority of the people desire -the Government to provide for the complete nationalization of the manufacture of armaments and munitions, and in that way prevent private manufacturers from exploiting the people. The Minister and some of his supporters have said that it is impracticable to undertake the national manufacture of arms and equipment required for defence purposes, and that it is preferable to adopt the methods outlined by him and provided for in the bill. The Government, which believes that those now engaged in the production of ordinary commodities should in time of war produce defence requirements, should have the courage to face the position and give a lead to other nations by completely nationalizing the manufacture of arms. It is assumed that in an emergency those engaged in ordinary avocations in factories adjoining government annexes would be transferred to the production of munitions and equipment required for defence purposes, but if they were transferred production in the industries they left would decrease, and prices would rise. It would be preferable to utilize the services of thousands of unemployed young men who could receive technical training, and also the unemployed of riper years capable of receiving tuition, and prepare them for the work of providing our defence requirements. In that way we would not only be preparing the way for effective defence, but also giving economic security to a greater number of our people than under the system proposed, and without the danger of dislocating ordinary industry. That there is a world-wide ring interested in the production of arms and munitions cannot be denied. That ring has its affiliations in Australia. The remarks of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr ""White) concerning copper were illuminating, also the statement of the Minister( Mr Casey) that the Government is purchasing copper produced in Australia"" at London parity, to which freight and other charges have to be added. That principle is not applied to other primary products, particularly wheat and wool, in which I am more directly interested. These commodities There is not the slightest when purchased in Australia are paid for at the Australian prices, and not at London parity. I prefer the amendment moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eorde) to that moved by the honourable member for Martin made to limit profits to 6 per cent. Although the object is a worthy one, I believe that it is impracticable. I am pleased to learn that the Government has accepted the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition, and, in effect, is making a virtue out of necessity. I trust that as the",69,Speaker Hon.

If that were done there would be a better feeling among the nations, and we might, to some degree, be able to set an example to the other nations of the world. [Quorum formed.] tived.

The Minister pointed out that only one -of *he six conventions referred to concerned the Commonwealth Government -alone, namely, Hours of Work on Board Ship and Manning Convention (Wo. 57). Ratification of this convention in respect -of the CommonAvealth Government was registered with the League of Nations Secretariat on the 24th September, 1938. The remaining five conventions deal with intra-state as well as interstate shipping.

I am now awaiting replies from two of the States from which replies have not yet been received. Until the desired 'information is received, no further action with regard to the ratification, of the conventions in question oan be taken. So far as the Commonwealth Government itself is concerned, I iassure the honourable member that every consideration is being given to the possibility of securing for seamen under Commonwealth control, conditions corresponding with those laid down in the conventions, insofar as these conditions are not already enjoyed by such seamen. An exhaustive analysis of each convention has been made by 10th Commonwealth officers, and special regard was paid to the interests of seamen when the Seamen's Compensation Act 1938, and the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act 1938, wore being drafted. The conditions of Avork prescribed by the maritime conventions are also being kept under consideration in the preparation of comprehensive amendments to the Commonwealth Navigation Act. A detailed statement 'has been prepared, setting out 'in tabulated form, the present position under Commonwealth and State law in regard to matters covered by the maritime conventions.""
