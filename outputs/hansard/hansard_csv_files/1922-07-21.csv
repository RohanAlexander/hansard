26,Mr Austin Chapman,"On a point ofyou uotice of my intention to discuss a matter of very great importance. I have since been informed that another notice of an intention to move the adjournment of the House was contemplated a week ago. that the matter to which that notice refers is to be discussed in the interests of the black man, but I think the interests of the white man should come first. If priority in the consideration of such motions is to depend on physical capacity, it will be somewhat awkward for honourable members who do not possess the agility of some of the younger members of this Honse. It would appear that if there is competition for priority in the consideration of motions of this kind, it will be necessary for au honourable member to give his intimation to the Speaker at 6 o'clock in the morning; or something like that. I should like to ask you, sir, what steps I am to take 1 to safeguard my rights as a member of this House desiring to have a matter of great importance discussed? has the support of the House in maintaining its rules, the proper conduct of our debates and the business of the House will become impossible. members will not observe the rules, I must ask the majority to support the Speaker in endeavouring to secure fair play for everybody, and to insure for every honourable member a hearing free from interruption. A practice has grown up which is to be deprecated in the strongest possible way. several occasions, and yet no honourable member can rise to address the House or to ask a question without being met by a storm of interjections and loud conversations which make it impossible for the Speaker to hear what is being said, or for the honourable member who desires to address the House to make himself heard. I appeal once more to honourable members to cease from interruptions, and to allow the business of the House to be conducted in a decent, orderly, and seemly manner. ""With regard to the point of order raised be discussed in the ordinary way that proby the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman), there is very often a desire on the part of more than one honourable member to move the adjournment of the House on a particular day in order to discuss different matters. In view of the fact that no notice of an intention to move the adjournment of the House to call attention to an urgent public matter can be given in the ordinary way, the only rule for the guidance of the Speaker is to take intimations of a desire to submit such a motion in the order in which they are received by him. I received an intimation from the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) that he desired to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a particular matter, and some time later, at about 10.30 a.m., as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) has stated, I received an intimation from him that he also desired to move the adjournment of the House to call attention to a matter of urgent public importance. As only one motion of the kind can be discussed at the same isitting, I must naturally give priority to the intimation that first reached me. I do not see how I could proceed in any other manner, and that is in accordance with the practice which has hitherto been adopted. to ask you, sir, whether you -will take my notice of my intention to move the adjournment on a matter of urgeDt public If some honourable importance now, as being prior to any similar notice that might, for instance, reach you early on Wednesday next? must bear in mind that provision is made for formal motions for the adjournment of the House on the supposition that I have mentioned the matter on something of an urgent public nature has suddenly arisen which prevents notice of u motion for its consideration being given in the ordinary way. The only reason for moving the formal adjournment of the House to discuss a particular matter is .that it is assumed to be a matter of public importance which requires immediate consideration. If opportunity is afforded to give timely notice of a matter, no urgency in connection with it can be said to exist. It is only for the consideration of matters suddenly arising which caunot vision is made for the formal motion for the adjournment of the House; and there must be a sumcient number of honourable members of opinion that the matter proposed lo be discussed is of sufficient pub-",15,Adjournment Formal Medical Sebvices In Mandated Tebbitoeles

Honourable members holding that opinion are required to rise in their places, and they take the responsibility of affirraing that the matter proposed to be discussed is one of urgent public importance. you, sir, whether the matter which the honourable member for Hindmarsh proposes to discuss comes under that heading, in view of the fact that, if my memory serves me right, there was a controversy on the question between the honourable member and the Under-Secretary for External Affairs( Mr Marks) during whicli I believe the honourable member threatened to deal with the Prime Minister outside, or something of the kind. by the honourable member for Eden Monaro? them on, but prefer one at a time. ber for Eden-Monaro has asked me a question, and he should be prepared to hear me in silence. hard on mo when honourable members interject in this manner. disorderly, and I again appeal to honourable members to refrain from them. I hope that they will have some regard for the need for decorum in the conduct of our proceedings. I point out again to the honourable member for Eden Monaro that the responsibility of saying whether a matter proposed to be discussed is one of urgency or not does not rest with the Speaker. It is determined by a certain number of honourable members, provided for in the Standing Orders, rising in their places, and in that way indicating that, in their opinion, the matter proposed to be discussed is.of sumcient importance to justify the suspension of the ordinary business of the House to consider it. The responsibility in the matter rests with the House, and not on the Speaker. After the sensational disclosures of recent weeks, it will, perhaps, not come as a great surprise to the public mind of this continent to learn that the definite charges I havo made against the Government's administration of the Mandated Territories can be absolutely verified and confirmed in every detail. I have already given instances and places in regard to each charge, and now I come to the House to place them before the Prime Minister opportunity of proving whether they have any foundation or not. As a Commonwealth, we accepted from the League of Nations a Mandate for the promotion to the uttermost of the material and moral well-being, as well as the social progress, of the inhabitants of that portion of New Guinea which lies to the north of Papua and to the east of Dutch New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago and the German Solomon Islands, a Territory of approximately 92,000 square miles, with a population of 659 British people,' 1,240 Asiatics, 87 Japanese, 179 Malay,"", 102 half-castes, and between 350,000 and 400,000 natives. I have no desire to secure any personal advertisement or aggrandisement from the disclosures which I make. My only wish is to serve the best interests of the people of these Territories, and preserve the gorcl reputation of the Commonwealth. I do not profess is pretty to be an authority on all questions relating to the Mandated Territories; but, while I was there-it was six weeks from the time. I left Australia until I returned I endeavoured to concentrate upon matters affecting the health and welfare of the people there. It was not my desire to secure political material which might be used by my party against the Government; but when I saw circumstances which were not a credit to our administration, I felt justified in informing the public mind of Australia upon them. My charges fall under three headings-first , the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government for the inadequate aud insufficient medical services I found in the Territories; secondly, the inadequate staff; and thirdly, the insufficiency of drugs, surgical appliances, and accommodation. The administration of the Mandated Territories is very different from that of Papua. The latter Territory has local autonomy to some extent. It has its own Legislative Council and its own Executive Council. Thc Mandated Territories Administration is, however,",16,Adjournment Formal Medical Sebvices In Mandated Tebbitoeles

47,Mr Makin,"There is very little tostation; two more, at least, are necessary. The ifcw Guinea mainland, with 72,000 square miles and many natives, has only one medical officer, stationed at Madang, to deal with all the native problems. No better means of extending the civilizing of natives, and gaining thoir confidence, than by medical help, can be instituted. This report actually states that, in a territory comprising 72,000 square miles, there is only one medical officer, who is stationed at Madang. population? mate that. The population of the whole of the Mandated Territories is, approximately, between 350,000 and 400,000 natives. Many parts have not yet been explored by white men, so an accurate estimate cannot be formed. Here is another extract from Dr. Honman's reportThere is in some places only one medical assistant to attend to the native hospital and patrol the district . . . At present it is often reported that the station is left without will assist me to investigate further these any medical help for weeks while thc medical assistant is away on patrol. While we were at MadangI had the pleasure of the company of the honourable member for Wentworth, who, with myself, made an inspection of the European hospital, and also of the native hospital. The European institution was formerly a German hotel. The ravages of white ants are very plainly seen. It is a most uninviting building, and the date for its renovation is long overdue. Its furniture is falling to pieces. Its beds are dirty in appearance, but, what is more serious, the institution has but an incomplete surgical chest. Although there are two Army Medical Corps surgical baggages placed on the verandah outside, there is not a single instrument in them. The medical officer at Madang has to attend to the requirements of an area of over 72,000 square miles with an incomplete and inadequate surgical chest. There is no sterilizing plant in the European hospital; therefore, those who have to undergo operations take very serious risks. The remark was made to me by a resident of Madang, "" God help the person who goes there for an operation! "" I challenge the honourable 1 member for Wentworth to deny any of the statements that I am making regarding what he and I saw. Together we visited the native hospital, where we found, in an intensified form, the conditions we had seen in the European hospital. It was dirty in appearance, and long overdue for painting. In one corner was an old German sterilizer that could not be utilized, and there was no adequate provision for the storage of fresh water for the medical services. The circumstances existing there are very serious. The Prime Minister cannot say that there is would he the no foundation for these charges, because his Under-Secretary saw the conditions which I have described. For this most incomplete and unsatisfactory service the unfortunate inmates of the European hos-o pital at Madang are required to pay 35s. per day. money ? to the Administration, but I did not inquire in regard to that. I should be pleased, however, if the honourable member matters. We went also to Kaewieng, themain station on New Ireland, which has an area of 4,600 square miles. We found Dv. Jackson doing his best in difficult circumstances. The native ward was in such a condition that it should have been condemned long ago; it was a most uninviting and unsuitable building for the accommodation of any person in ill-health. Some attempt is being made to overcome this defect by the erection of small huts. This is an extract from the report of Dr. Jackson, which is countersigned by the Principal Medical Officer, Dr. HonmanSome parts of the Islands arc seriously affected by gonorrhoea, and it.nceds very carefiil examination. I have no doubt that this disease is one of the causes of sterility in this group. We are often handicapped very greatly by the lack of dressings and other surgical materials. At present we have only twelve new bandages on hand, and no likelihood of getting any more until the Mataram arrives. We have requisitioned for an adequate supply, but havo not received it, no doubt because it is not in stock. The bandages are rinsed, of course, and are washed, but such treatment wears them out very quickly. The unfortunate part of it is that we are often unable to attend to surgical conditions. . . . For one week my patients have not had anything but green bananas and tinned meat, because we had no taro or rice. There is a bountiful supply of fish in the bay which the hospital overlooks, but Dr. Jackson is unable to avail himself of this",18,Chapman Ma Y I Ask Mr Hughes So That He May Have The

In his report he seeks permission from the Administration to engage"" a native to dynamite fish so that he can vary the diet of the patients in the hospital. Another system that has been employed there is the training of native orderlies. This is a very commendable service; but what is the use of training these men unless they are supplied with the necessary drugs and equipment with which to put their knowledge into practice? Dr. Honmau saysAltogether this system of training natives is a great success, and has obvious possibilities. larity in the limbs. "" But it means a great increase in our drugs and dressings expenses, and the system will have to be greatly limited unless we can have more money to provide the necessary want The Administrator never refuses help if money is available, but it is not so, and progress is checked for want of it. . . . All the native hospitals want re-equipping, fresh instruments and laboratories being required in all. This is being gradually done. It is very gradually! The statements I have made this morning constitute a grave charge against the Government of neglecting and impoverishing the medical services of the Mandated Territories in such a way as to bring discredit upon the Commonwealth and its Administration. At another page Dr. Honman saysAs with native hospitals, so with European hospitals at out stations-the y barely exist, all nre ill-equipped, all furniture requires renewing, and accommodation provided for the staff. Buti t is a hopeless task without means to do this work so necessary for the welfare of the Europeans and staff during illness. Let me give honourable members some idea of the health conditions of these people. The climatic conditions in New Guinea are most unhealthy. I find this statement in the report that is to be submitted to the League of NationsAs a preliminary to an organized campaign against malaria and filaria, 833 men and 34 women were examined to ascertain to what degree the natives living in Babaul were infected with malaria, and to do this an examination was made to And out how many spleens were enlarged, and the figures show that there were 56.5 per cent, with spleens easily palpable. The examination of the women showed that they were more severely infected, as 81 per cent, showed much enlarged spleens. blame the Government for that. vernment for not providing the necessary facilities for the staff to minimize infection. This question affects no:* only the natives of the Mandated Territories, but also the European population. Dr. Honman informed me that 29 per cent, of the public servants iir the Mandated Territory were away from duty on account of malaria. But malaria is not the only illness from which the native population suffer. Thero is an affliction known as yaws, or ulcerated sores. This makes its appearance first in infancy, and if not eliminated from the system, reappears in later life, accompanied by certain physical disabilities, such as irreguExtension of time granted. Yaws is very prevalent among the natives, and for its treatment a certain supply of bandages and dressings are urgently required, aud yet Dr. Jackson, of Kaewieng, which is the only station in 4,600 square miles of territory, states, in his report, that he had only twelve new bandages available. 'ber knows that the success of the treatment made such a demand upon the supplies that they had run out. tion that shortages in such medical supplies cannot be excused, and proof of success demands the absolute necessity for adequate supplies being constantly held in stock. aible member is putting it in quite another way. way the honourable member for Wentworth desires me to put the case. I am merely stating what is a fact. I hope he will rise in his place to-day to give the House the .benefit of the information he! possesses, and express himself in the same terms as he employed when in the Mandated Territory, irrespective of whether the miserable political skin of his parliamentary chief is to be saved or not. I did not visit the Admiralty Island, but I gained some first-hand knowledge of the conditions existing there from a responsible medical officer, whose name I shall not give publicly, because I have some regard for his professional reputation and the reputaI do blame the Gotion of his assistant.

The doctor, after examining the patient, stated that amputation of the arm was necessary, but, as he was not equipped with the necessary surgical appliances, he made a request to the operatives at the wireless station for the use of a hack-saw for the operation. arise to-day in some of the more remote country districts in Australia. the Government for not having furnished these medical omcers with the necessary surgical equipment and other scientific appliances for the proper carrying out of their duties. ber referring to a medical officer whose name he said he would hot give?

The honourable member has made some charges against the Administration; and, as is quite natural, he has levelled them in such a way as to place on my shoulders the sole responsibility for anything and everything that,, in his opinion, falls short of perfecwhich appeared in the press The subtion. I hope that I have always shown myself to be one who realizes how far I fall short of perfection. I have never sought to arrest the stars in their courses, nor to bid the sun to stand still. I have not essayed to walk around the walls of another Jericho,-blowing a trumpet. But, as far as my imperfections permitted, I shall endeavour to answer the honourable out access to the f u l l official files. The honprable member said something at the conclusion of his speech to the effect that he did not wish to assist Germany in any way, in connection with the I trust 'the Prime subject-matter of his motion. I believe him; but I think what he has said will help them. The Germans have not giveu 1 up hope of getting these Territories back; and the honourable member, although he has acted, no doubt, with the best intentions, has supplied them with very useful pabulum. Let me now deal with thc honourable member's statement. He has not, so far as I know, said anything new. When he returned from New Guinea he made a statement to the press. My attention being drawn to his remarks, the substance was forwarded by myself to the Administrator. The radio message which I sent was as follows:Makin;M.P., makes serious chargos against Health Department Territory. States Europeans at outlying stations exposed great dangers by reason unsuitable hospital accommodation and inadequate medical supplies. Resident doctor, at Kaewieng, had complained being in possession only twelve bandages, and that patients, during one week, had lived on green bananas and tinned meat. At Manus, owing absence surgical instruments, man's arm amputated with engineer's hack-saw; patient died two hours afterwards.

Advise also whether any requisitions for supplies, appliances, other medical services not fulfilled when asked for. If so, give particulars. Advise also any other facts which may be helpful. This, then, summarizes the position: The honourable member went to Rabaul, and on his return made certain charges, stance of themI think it will be ad-",21,Chapman Ma Y I Ask Mr Hughes So That He May Have The
76,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime Minmitted that the telegram I have read was a fairly accurate summary-wa s sent in a radio message to the Administrator, who <was asked to report on the matter. A l though the honorahle gentleman has sought to make me personally responsible, every sensible man knows that I am dependent upon my omcers in the Territory, and cannot be personally aware of everything that is taking place 4,000 or 5,000 miles away. I did what was possible, however, and obtained information which I propose to lay /before the House. The Administrator, having had the case put fairly before him, replied as follows:Presume four principal out-stations those referred to. At none is there a properlyorganized hospital, nor has there ever been. At Kaewieng, hospital old building, somewhat dilapidated, but quite serviceable as a' temgross neglect, people were dying like flies, porary measure; effort made to secure better building unsuccessful.

As a matter of and with as good surroundings as obtainable as temporary hospital. Kieta, two beds in very comfortable building; stated men treated in own bungalows; this temporary measure until sale of Board properties, when hope buy suitable buildings. NowI come to the point that I want to emphasize and impress upon my honourable friend and my fellow citizens. The honourable gentleman has sought to make it appear that things are in a very bad way, but he need not have gone so far to find opportunity to point a moral and adorn a tale. He might have found conditions analogous to those which he has alleged exist in New Guinea perhaps in his own or in some other State, for it ill where I was 1,0.00 miles from a doctor, becomes us in Parliament to particularize in sueh matters. He could, for example, have quoted a case referred to in the press the other day, where a medical man -on e speaking with authority, a medical superintendent of a hospital-state d that a serious operation in one of the most populous States was performed by the light of a hurricane lamp. I do not know whether an engineer's hack saw was used, but things were very far short of being satisfactory. The hospital accommodation not very far away from where the honourable gentleman lives is very bad. But the honourable gentleman was silent on these things, which occurred within a stone's throw of where he stands-in the very centre of one of our most populous cities preferring to condemn the imperfections of hospital equipment in far distant and isolated regions in the Mandated Territories. He has sought to show that, owing to a paucity of bandages, to the dilapidation of the buildings, and to other things, matters are in a very bad state in New Guinea. The facts do not support his charges. Let me state them. In Kaewieng the attendance of patients in four months was: January, one; February, none; March, none; April, none. In Madangi t was, January, none; February, none; March, two; April, four. In Kietai t was, January, none; February, none; March, none; April, none. Those facts speak for themselves. The honourable gentleman has drawn a harrowing picture, seeking to convey an impression that, through our crawling on the verandahs with their fact, in four months, in the three districts, which cover some S0,000 square miles, there were only seven people who came for assistance, and, so far as I know, not ono of them died. This surely puts a somewhat different complexion on the matter. .The honourable gentleman, who poses as such a good Australian, has never been in Australia before. I mean that he has lived in great cities all his life, and has lately gone into the bush for the first time. Naturally, he was a little bit appalled at what he saw; but I can tell him that I have been in parts of Australia itself and where I should have looked upon a hack saw, if I had broken my arm and had found it necessary to have it amputated, as a veritable gift from the gods. I now return to the report of the Administrator, who saysEeference shortage bandages, Medical Officer radioed, 22nd May, ample supply. Further supply sent 8th June. Considering ample stores at Kaewieng, cannot see how patients should live on bananas and tinned meat. Am inquiring. Human 'beings have very curious and complex natures. In the midst of luxury they sometimes choose to live an ascetic life. God forbid that I should attempt to set myself up as a censor of morals, OT diet. If a man likes to eat green bananas and tinned meat, well, it is a free country -le t him do it. But they do so of their own free m i l , for the Administrator tells us there were ample supplies of good food. In reference to 'the case of amputation, the facts, in the words of the Administrator, are as follow:Reference case amputation; this occurred in March, 1921, before arrival of Honman or self. German at Tabat Island had leg crushed, fall tree. Took five days land on coast 70 miles from Kaewieng. Medical Oflicer went from Kaewieng and personally brought him in ; case hopeless, compound fracture, leg gangrened, .but at patient's request the Medical Officer amputated, using engineer's saw, which is quite suitable instrument in an emergency. According to certificate death due to acute infection, gangrene, and tetanus-nothin g to do with saw. That appears to be a complete alibi. I do not profess to understand the mysteries of medical science, and although I know tetanus to be very serious, it is not altogether without its good poiuts. If I were assured that a hack-saw would produce lock-jaw, I should be tempted to use it with freedom in this assembly. Extension of time granted. The report continuesGeneral equipment not complete except in KB haul, but is serviceable. Much requires to be done, which doing as funds permit. Honman states positively statement that request for bandages, dressings, or otlier essentials unduly cut down or delayed is untrue. Excessive demands of non-essentials, shortage of medical stores in the past make close scrutiny necessary, and more supervision and great economy urged on medical officers and others. Apparently expected attain at once standard Melbourne hospitals. Can only do this if largely subsidized. Honourable members must not forget that we are dealing with a barbaric country. The civil Administration is not eighteen months old, and it is only fair to give the responsible officers a chance. Many honourable members who have travelled through the back-blocks of this great continent know how difficult it is to convert a wilderness into a blooming garden within a few months. Many deem themselves fortunate if they can compass it in a life-time. The Administration is doing nil that is possible, and I venture to say that, as far as the three stations to which the honourable member has referred are concerned, the evidence shows quite clearly that the accommodation provided was sufficient for the number of patients who presented themselves. It is most emphatically untrue that the Government has limited the expenditure on Mr Bughes. medical supplies or hospital equipment. I saw Dr. Honman and the Administrator this year, and I told them that, whatever else they did, they must protect the health of the white and native population. I informed them that whatever money was necessary in that direction would be provided. I repeat that I agree entirely not only with the honourable member for Hindmarsh, but with other honourable members who say that in whatever direction we economize we should not economize in these things. Although the honorablo member has treated me rather unfairly by endeavouring to fasten the responsibility for any shortcomings upon me, I may , say that so soon as I read the statement of the honourable member I lost no time in ascertaining the facts. If the position was as stated, I would not allow the responsible officers to hold their positions for twenty-four hours; but surely the honourable member does not expect me to accept his unsupported statement and condemn the responsible officers without hearing them. I come now to some further facts which bear directly on the charges made by the honourable member. When Dr. Honman took office, he had to cope with an epidemic of small-pox. He and his staff vaccinated ho less than 30,000 persons. This surely does not look like neglecting the health of the natives. An epidemic of measles followed; Dr. Honman had to cope with this, which he did most successfully. He has also been attacking malaria, and he told me in February or MarchI am not quite sure of the month-that he had not lost one white man through malaria since he had assumed office. The honourable member waxed very eloquent about enlarged spleens. I am not a medical man, but there are some in this chamber who will tell you that the attempt to cope with malaria in an indigenous population suffering from enlarged spleens presents a very difficult problem. Malaria can be prevented; but if the staff were enlarged twenty-fold it could not reduce to normal the enlarged spleens of persons who have had malaria. The medical staff in the Mandated Territories is highly competent and sufficient in number. Under the Administrator there are six doctors and twenty-two orderlies, and in spite of what Dr. Campbell Brown has said, there is much better provision for the preservation of the health of natives and white population than existed under the German regime. Dr. Honman says that he has got on remarkably well with the hookworm representative, Dr. Lambert. Honourable members know that, in dealing with hookworm within the Oommonwealth, we have a chain of laboratories and stations, and are co-operating with the Rockefeller Institute. Dr. Lambert, who is mentioned in the report, is leaving the Territory, but Dr.. Honman has secured two of his ablest assistants. He reports that he has a laboratory which he says he believes is equal to any, and that within a few weeks' time he hopes to have the equipment necessary to make it up-to-date and capable of manufacturing their own vaccines and calf lymph. No one can say, in face of the Principal Medical Officer's report, that the staff is incompetent or insufficient in numbers or that the Principal Medical Officer has been denied what he has asked for. Dr. Honman states that the medical men appointed to his staff possess the highest credentials. I gave Dr. Honmanf u l l authority to get what he needed, and to pay what was necessary. Surely one could not do more. It is not easy to find highly qualified medical officers who will serve in such parts, and we are very fortunate in securing the services of men possessing high credentials. The Principal Medical Officer goes on to sayThe medicnl men appointed have the highest credentials, some possessing the diploma ot Public Health, some graduates in the School of Tropical -Medicine in London, some with public health experience not only in Australia, but also in England. Some have quarantine experience in Australia, and a l l of them honours men; and it is looked forward w i th confidence that these men w ill raise the prestige of _ thc medical services of the Territory of New Guinea to such a degree that the fact that they have been there w ill be evidence of their expert knowhas got the members of it to remain ledge, not only in tropical diseases, but in tbe administration of public health matters. _ In connection with this matter, it must be pointed out that Australia, with its crowded cities and its congested ports, has entirely different problems to face than New Guinea, with its three or fonr vessels a month, and its small European population-1,265-distribute d all over the Territory, or 349 in Rabaul. It is con„ sidered that its greatest want is continuity of service, and that this is insured by the present appointments, and it would be disastrous at the present time to interfere with this continuity. He points out that all these men must have long and frequent leave. I hope that the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page), and other medical men in the House, will speak to this question. We have done and are doing all that is possible to preserve the health of the population, white and native, in the Mandated Territory. I submit, as a layman, that we cannot deal with natives suffering from the chronic effects of malaria, such as enlarged spleen, to the extent that the honourable member for Hindmarsh seems to imagine. We are endeavouring to stamp out malaria and other tropical diseases, and I hope that we shall make New Guinea as clean as Panama, or cleaner. In a radiogram from the Administrator, dated Rabaul, 21st June, 1922, we have the statementDo not recommend provision, elaborate European hospitals, out-stations, in view of almost negligible average attendance. This would cost another £20,000 non-recurring, and £5,000 annually. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has done me an injustice. I am much concerned about the health of those in New Guinea, and have done everything to insure it. My desire is that this Territory, which the League of Nations has given us to govern, shall be governed so well that it shall be a pattern to other nations. Under the Mandate we are made the guardians of these primitive people. We are expected to show them the better way. It is expected of U3 that we shall look after their welfare. We are trying to do so; but Ave are not workers of miracles. We have done all that is possible in the circumstances. ""We have the best staff that could be obtained. It is with the utmost difficulty that we -can induce men to stay there, and it is a feather in Dr. Honman's cap that he has secured such an up-to-date staff as that in New Guinea to-day, and there. The evidence is abundantly clear that there is no lack of medical officers, and that Dr. Honman has said quite ' plainly to the Administrator that there are adequate supplies. If people have been living on improper diet it is not because of any failure on the part of the Government. There were ample stores at Kaewieng, and people there need not have . lived on the diet of green bananas and tinned meat to whicli. reference haa been made. Lastly, let me say that the Government have considered the whole matter, and that in view of the Administrator's report, we have made available £10,000 to put the health administration of New Guinea on the highest possible level. We have promptly met every request. We have given carte blanche to the Principal Medical Officer aud the Administrator to do whatever is necessary. Whatever they have asked for they have had, and on top of all that we have now made available a sum of £ 10,000. I hope that the honourable member will acquit me of being particeps criminis, even if there has been laxity, which I most emphatically deny. I am most anxious that the world at large shall not have reason to point the finger of scorn at our administration of the Territory, and since taking charge of the civil administration there I have given instructions' to the medical officer, who was, and is my friend, as well as to General Wisdom, that iu whatever direction they skimp and spare they are not to be sparing in regard to the health administration. I was very much concerned when the honourable member made his statement as to the situation in New Guinea, and I immediately sent a, radiogram to the Administrator. In reply I received the message I have read. Not being satisfied with what has beeu said, even by my own officials, I am making assurance doubly sure by placing funds at their disposal to put everything right. That being so no blame can rest on the Government. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (MT . Makin) is to be commended for bringing this matter before the House. I am pleased that he had the privilege of visiting New Guinea and obtaining first hand information of the conditions prevailing there. Such visits by members of Parliament are in the interests, not only of the Europeans settled in the Territory, but of the natives, who have no voice in its government, and who, as the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has pointed out, are, under the mandate conferred upon us, in the hands of the Commonwealth. The duty thus imposed upon the Commonwealth is all-important, and I am at a loss to understand why the Prime Minister should have said that in bringing this matter before the House the honourable member for Hindmarsh was not taking the best course possible to assist the natives. There was absolutely no ground for such a statement. The sole desire of the honourable member is that the treatment of the natives in the Mandated Territories shall be of the most huniaue character. We have heard all too often of the unfortunate condition of the natives of islands under the control of other nations where the people have no voice in their government. If there was ever a question that should be very carefully looked into, it is that of the conditions existing in the islands handed over to us by the League of Nations in order that we may safeguard the interests of the people there. The League of Nations, in giving the Commonwealth a mandate over New Guinea, had the fullest confidence that it would do its best for both the white and coloured population, and I believe that it will. Now that we have taken over control, every honourable member of this Parliament will endeavour to do the best for the people, and that is one reason why as many of us as possible should visit the Mandated Territories and so obtain first-hand information. I regret that so far I have ibeen unable to do so. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has given the House the benefit of the information secured by him while in New Guinea. Already his representations have been attended with good results. The Prime Minister has admitted that owing to the allegations made recently by the honourable member he at once got into touch with the authorities in New Guinea, and that action had been taken to improve the conditions of which complaint had been made. The right honourable gentleman says that the information he has received is that the statements made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh are not in accordance with the facts. I would point out, however, that while the honourable member referred to the white population, he pointed out that it comprised only something. like 600 souls, and that his chief concern was for the natives, who, * have no voice in the government of the Territory. In the circumstances, he felt",22,Chapman Ma Y I Ask Mr Hughes So That He May Have The
77,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [12.36],"it his duty to give special attention to their interests. The Prime Minister, in his reply, has endeavoured to camouflage the facts. The right honoraible gentleman said that in certain hospitals there had been only seven inmates over a period of four months. ever, to tell the House that those hospitals were for the treatment of the white, and not the coloured, population. Why do not the white people go to these hospitals? We have to remember that the white population is very small, and, perhaps, fortunately, some of the white people <ean secure better treatment in their own homes if they are ill . They will probably be sure of better facilities for nursing them in their own homes. The fact that £10,000 has been provided for additional appliances for medical purposes proves that the Prime Minister is himself convinced that to-day the appliances for carrying out medical treatment in this Mandated Territory are inadequate. patients were treated in four hospitals during a period of four months does not prove that there is nothing in the statement made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. We have to remember that there are between 300,000 and 400,000 natives in the Territory. These people must depend on the Government for protection and assistance in their hour of need, and it is to their interests that the honourable member for Hindmarsh specially directs our attention. In proof of the necessity for better facilities, let me quote from a report by Dr. J. H . S. Jackson, medical oflicer at Kaeweing. report? the Principal Medical Oflicer, Dr. Honman, and, referring to dressings, this officer saysWe have heen handicapped very greatly by lack of dressings and other surgical materials. At present we have only twelve new bandages, and no likelihood of getting any more until the League of Nationsi n having confidence Mataram arrives. We (have requisitioned' for an adequate supply, but have not received it, no doubt because dt is not in stock. The bandages are rinsed, of course, and washed out, but such treatment wears them out very quickly. Tlie unfortunate part of it is that we are often unable to attend to surgical conhonorable gentleman has quoted show that ditions. That is very different from the information which the Prime Minister has placed before us. It is a report by a medical oflicer on conditions as he found them, and they were very far from satisfactory. Every one admits that Dr. Honman is He forgot, howa very competent man, but I find that he has made a report in terms which, are very different from that quoted by the Prime Minister. report to which the honourable gentleman now refers? of this year, and I quote the following from it : All the native hospitals want re-equipping, fresh instruments and laboratories being required' in all. This ds being gradually done. One has been established at Manus, where a medical officer has just been sent to look after a big district with numerous islands right up to the equator. We may be referred to a few cases and The fact that only seven the treatment they received, but the fact remains that the reports I have quoted substantiate what has been said by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. Here is a still further reportAs with native hospitals, so with European hospitals at out-stations, they barely exist, are all ill-equipped, all furniture requires renewing, and accommodation provided for the staff. Buti t is a hopeless task without means to do this so necessary work, so necessary for the .welfare of the European and staff during illness. We have, had a report from the Principal Medical Oflicer quoted by the Prime Minister, and yet that officer admits the truth of every word the honourable member for Hindmarsh has uttered in describing thc whom did he condition of things existing in the Mandated Territory. The reports speak for themselves, and in the action which the honourable member for Hindmarsh has taken he is doing a good turn, not only to Europeans and natives in the islands, but ^ to the Commonwealth and to the civilized world. He is trying to bring about a condition of affairs which will justify the in our administration. The League will not have that confidence if we do not remedy the matters complained of. they are being remedied.",26,Chapman Ma Y I Ask Mr Hughes So That He May Have The

We are responsible for the proper administration of these islands. realized, that it is necessary that we should do the best we can in the interests of the people of these Mandated Territories, and I take it that honourable members are prepared to do all that is possible for them. Apparently, if some members of this House do not take the trouble to inquire into these things, officers on the spot may send in reports without obtaining much satisfaction. that these reports do not seem to. have been brought under the notice of the Government. member for Hindmarsh informs me that these reports were sent to the Principal Medical Officer of the Territory. If there has been delay in forwarding these reports to the Government the Administrator should be asked why the Government do not receive them earlier. The Government and Parliament should be kept fully posted with regard to everything that is going on up there. We should see that we carry out the trust reposed in us by the League of Nations in a satisfactory way. It is unfair to the honourable member for Hindmarsh to say that he is assisting the Germans. He is assisting British, people and the League of Nations by performing what is merely the obvious duty of any member of this Parliament visiting the islands and finding a condition of things that is not satisfactory. The honourable member should be congratulated rather than condemned for eliciting this information and placing it before the House, because it would appear that although these medical officers' reports are furnished to the Administrator they are not in the possession of the Government. The time taken up this morning has been well spent in ventilating this matter. No doubt it will be the means^ of insuring the prothe vision of proper facilities for safeguarding the health of the people of the Mandated Territories.

I can say from my own observations in the Mandated Territories and from the information I have at command in the Department of External Affairs that in no instance has a demand made by the medical authorities at Rabaul not been complied with. In fact, when the Principal Medical Officer, who was in Melbourne fl last year, asked for -certain doctors and orderlies, these were secured and sent away by the next steamer. It is admitted that there is a shortage of supplies, but that is because injections of 606 in the treatment of hookworm, and framboesia, or yaws, have proved so successful.

However, the Government are forwarding all the supplies necessary to overcome the shortage -bookworm , malaria, yaws, &c. A close The lack of instruments is also being met. The incident of the sawing off of an arm, about which the honourable member for Hindmarsh has said so much, would appear at first sight to be somewhat serious, but when this native, who had been using dynamite for the purpose of bringing up fish, blew off his hand at the wrist it was fourteen hours before Dr. Watch and Mr Weir, his assistant,1earncd of the incident. to the spot as quickly as possible, but the native had already been bleeding to death for fourteen hours. ligature, and before using the saw obtained from the wireless station, which, by the way, was thoroughly disinfected, they tried everything possible by means of hot fomentations, and so on, to save the man's life. Septicaemia, however, had set in right to the shoulder, and the arm had to be sawn off. The man died, not because of the operation, but through exhaustion after bleeding for fourteen hours. The Prime Minister has spoken about the man wbo fell off a tree, and asked for the use of a saw, but when our medical men go out from their stations they do not usually take all their operating instruments with them. They merely take what they may consider necessary. T have recommended to Cabinet, and the matter has been fully considered, the necessity for supplying all the deficiencies reported to me at Babaul. I take this opportunity of drawing attention to what our medical services have done in the Mandated Territories. They have done wonderful work. the Administration is being subjected would appear to me to be based on the misapprehension that we have had the mandate for twenty years instead of fourteen months. During the seven years of the military regime much work necessarily accumulated, which was a legacy to the civil authorities. Few can appreciate the extent of this legacy. The first difficulty we had was to get doctors with sufficient This has caused such a qualifications to go there. However, we overcame that difficulty by paying pretty fair salaries. Upon their arrival in the Territories the medical men at once began a close study of the various native diseases examination was at once made of over 1,800 native men and women, -which enabled them to arrive at certain statistics of help to them later on. A survey was also made of the question of malariacarrying mosquitoes, the investigation yielding identification of the mosquito in question. Mr Weir, the Bacteriologist, is now breeding an anti-malarial mosquito, from which he hopes to achieve The medical men got great results. An intensive campaign into the prevalent disease of hookworm has led to over 90,000 doses having been administered. On a recent patrol 1,100 Thoy applied a natives received treatment. In August, 1921, a serious outbreak of small-pox occurred in the isolated north-west portion of the Territory, placing a great strain on our resources. An expedition was organized, costing £5,000, the lymph supply alone costing £858. Over 30,000 natives were vaccinated. I ask honourable members who have been vaccinated in the 1 cleanly surroundings of one's own home or in an Australian hospital to realize the position up there in vaccinating 30,000 natives, practically all wild savages from the bush, with their inherent dislike to the white man's medicine. Framboesia, or yaws, which is very prevalent, and the cause of great mortality, especially among children, is being systematically dealt with, 5,000 injections having been given, with, in the majority of cases, good results. Tn the outstation of Manus. during the last twelve months, one of our medical men and his assistant treated 4,000 cases of various diseases and slight operations, 779 vaccinations, 879 hookworm'cases, and 1,180 spleen enlargement cases. At Madang, 5,000 various cases were treated in six weeks, in many instances necessitating a walk of over 70 miles along the coast. I ask honourable members to realize the climatic conditions under which our medical staff works in the Mandated Territories. When I was there, even in winter, the perspiration was running off my face in a stream. Our medical men have also to face what",28,Chapman Ma Y I Ask Mr Hughes So That He May Have The

Leave granted. cumstances over which I had no control whatsoever prevented the statement being presented to honourable members at an earlier date. before the House the balance-sheet and statement of ihe Commonwealth Government sugar control for the period of its inception on the 19th July, 1915, to the 30th June last. Before traversing the items mentioned in the balance-sheet, I may remind honourable members of the circumstances under which the Government initiated control of this commodity. During the period of the war the Government were faced with the obligation of providing for the sugar needs of the Commonwealth, and it became a question whether they could rely upon the private trading organizations that in the main controlled sugar, or whether in view of all the circumstances and of the necessity to preserve f u l l supplies for the nations during the-period of the war, the Government itself should not assume control. Like the Government of the United Kingdom, the Government of the Commonwealth decided to undertake control of sugar supplies during the period of the war, and has maintained that control up to the present. Government control commenced upon the 19th July, 1915. The first contract for the purchase of the Australian crop was for a period of two years, .1915-16 and 1916-17. For the first year the retail price of sugar was fixed at 3d. per lb., and for the second year Sid., while the wholesale price per ton during the first financial year was £25 10s., increased in January, 1916, during the second year. The second contract covered a period of three years, in the first of which, 1917-18, the retail price was 3^d., and the wholesale price £29 5s. per ton. In the second year of that period the retail and wholesale prices remained at the same level, but in the third year the retail price was increased, on the 25th March, 1920, to 6d. per lb., and the wholesale price to £49 per ton, a.t which it now stands. The Government not only undertook the acquisition of the Australian sugar supply, but also to provide for the whole of the requirements of the people. Therefore, the Government were obliged to make purchases overseas in order to make up the difference between the total of the Australian production and the total of Australian needs. On behalf of the Government I claim that the f u l l object was I desire now to place achieved with a minimum of disturbance to the industry, or any commercial undertakings associated with it.

122,Mr Rodgers,"I regret that cirjudgment in all its purchases, that it has given every branch of industry in anyway associated with the sugar production a fair deal, and also saved the nation a great deal of money. I propose to place before the House comparative figures of the control period in the United Kingdom and in the Oommonwealth, and I ask honourable members to bear with me while I make that comparison. It has been asserted that there has been some-measure of disturbance due' to the Oommonwealth control of our sugar supplies, but I contend that there has been no vital disturbance of any industry, and certainly no attempt to put square pegs in round, holes, those who were intrusted with the administration of the scheme being thoroughly conversant with the sugar industry in all its phases. The whole of the operations have been conducted at a minimum expenditure to the public, and I take the responsibility of asserting that results; and I ask honourable members to at the end of the control period the taxpayers of the Commonwealth will not be called upon to make up any ^deficiency, notwithstanding that the Commonwealth Government will have handled in round figures a turnover of £60,000,000. already had to pay. member for Franklin will permit me to proceed, I think I shall be able to persuade him that he is wrong, and that he might very well reverse some of his public statements on . this question. As the control period covers seven years' operations, and the figures are colossal, I ask the indulgence of the House while I make the statement. I shall present no figures in connection with tbe balance-sheet which have not been vouched for and audited. If I have to make any statements or furnish any figures other than those contained in the balance-sheet I will inform honourable members, but I shall be prepared to vouch for their accuracy. I repeat that they have been minutely examined by the Auditor-General, and by one of the leading private auditors in Melbourne, who has also placed his services at the disposal of the Commonwealth. I refer to Colonel Evans, who has carefully investigated the whole of the details covering the complete period. I ask honourable members to compare the sugar control period in Britain with that in Australia. The prices in the Mother Country during the term of control with which I shall be dealing in Australia, ranged, retail, from 3|d. to 14d. per lb. They covered, wholesale, a range between £26 10s. aud £160 per ton charged to manufacturers. InAustralia the retail price ranged from 3d. to 6d. per lb., and the wholesale price from £25 10s. to £49 per ton. The Imperial Government, after charging those prices, declared &loss in their period of control amounting in round figures, to £24,500,000; that was on top of those prices which varied as I have just indicated. I would refer honourable members to the report of the Royal Commission whioh dealt with sugar in Great Britain, in which document will be found all the facts and figures. I repeat that the sugar control period in this country should be judged upon the basis of final take into account, further, the fact that the Commonwealth Government had the definite obligation placed on their shoulders to provide the nation with sugar. Our prices ranged from 3d. to 6d. per lb.; but the maximum was not imposed until March, 1920. In all the circumstances, Australia has been well served by the sugar industry. The growers have remained undisturbed. The .organizations for manufacturing and refining have carried on as previously. There has been no interference with their business. Refining has been done at cost price, and with no profit, in Australia. As for the prices paid to the growers, compared with the prices charged all over the world, they are moderate and reasonable. There has been an attempt to set two classes of growers in conflict, namely, the sugar^growers and the fruit-growers. I would ask producers to remember that the sugar-growers were reasonably entitled to an improvement in their conditions, just as were the wool-growers, the wheat growers, butter producers, fruit-growers, and all other producers. It should not be forgotten that the cost of production rose considerably. This conflict of interests should be no longer continued, for the reason that the fruit-growers have been well served by the sugar industry during the period of control.

With regard to export, the fruit-growers have had concessions equivalent to £20 per ton on all manufactured goods exported. tember last. general; but I shall furnish details to support them. I desire my information to be accepted as an absolutely full and fair statement of the position. In justice to the sugar industry, honourable members should examine the definite facts and indisputable figures. It has been said that the sugar industry of Australia has been spoon-fed. There has been paid to the sugar-growers, in the way of bounty, a sum amounting to £3,899,541 since sugar was first grown in this country. There haa been levied upon sugar, by way of Excise duty, £6,59.1,S70. The contribution to revenue paid back in Excise over and above the sum of fhe bounty amounts to £2,692,329. that. out saying that sugar is consumed by the people. How else would it be consumed? But no one will say that, during the period of levy for Excise, the growers got too much for their cane, or that the retail prices were too high. Judged as a whole, the sugar industry has served Australia well. The nation has been fully supplied at a time when the rest of the world was being rationed. There is not the slightest doubt that the grower has not received an undue price for his cane. The refiner has received nothing for refining, except the cost. The manufacturers of raw sugar have not .been charged an undue amount; and, when one judges the whole of the facts calmly, in the light of officially-audited figures, one must concede that the sugar industry served Australia well during the war period."" That it was the definite obligation of the Government to control the industry during the war period is not challenged. It entered into the last contract in 1920, at a time when the world's markets were unsettled, and when it could not be said that the conditions of industry anywhere in the world were normal. As a matter of fact, conditions are not normal to-day. Will anybody say that that was a period when we ought to have relinquished control? I say it was not. Speaking for myself, personally, I can say that I am not a believer in Government control of business, but can any one challenge the statement that in June, 1920, when the current -contract was entered into, the world's markets were abnormal? The relative price of sugar in the world's markets was substantially higher than the price agreed to be paid to the Australian grower. I have carefully examined the figures,, and I have examined the criticisms. I am unable to find anywhere definite proof that any section associated with the sugar industry has had an undue reward. There has been a period of calm, of industrial contentment, during which the industry has progressed undisturbed. The area under cultivation has been increased; production has been increased; the machinery and organization of manufacture have been improved; and, broadly speaking, the conditions of the industry generally have been improved. Australia, as a whole, will not be a sufferer from the prosperity of this industry, which is helping in the development of Northern Australia in a way that no other industry could. If we were setting out to develop, hold, and people Australia, we would never get a better band of men for the purpose than the sugar-growers of the north, judged by whatever facts or circumstances one cares to apply. Those who have had most to do with sugar have said . the least in the way of criticism. It is significant that the Federal body which handles sugar daily-the Federal Retailers' Organization, which is meeting in the northern State at the present time-ha s passed a resolution stating that while they do not like Government control of the industry, they are satisfied that the Commonwealth Government is doing the right thing in the circumstances in controlling sugar at the present time. After all, the men whose daily life and business it is to handle sugar, who parcel it out in small quantities to members of the community who have been stirred up on",33,Agreement Balance Sheet To £29 5s I T Stood At That Figure

128,Mr Rodgers,"It should go with this question, are not likely to ask for a continuance of conditions that are a daily pinprick to them. They say that in all the circumstances Grovernment control of sugar during the period that it has been exercised was justified. Will anybody say that during the times we have just passed through the Commonwealth Government should have left the control of sugar in Australia entirely to the great organization that usually handles it. I have nothing to say against men who conduct their business on a high scientific standard like the future at all. I have been speaking the Colonial Sugar Befining Company. That company has rendered a great service to the sugar-growers of Australia. It has set up a great organization, and men have put their brains, intelligence, and money into it ; I say nothing in derogation of that great organization, but I say that the Government .would have been recreant to its duty during the war period and since had it exposed the nation to the danger that would have arisen if private organizations had been unable to finance, control, and acquire sugar. The conditions were such that they demanded, for the well-being of. the nation and the common weal, that the Government should assume f u ll responsibility for the control of sugar. I do not propose to go through the balance-sheet in detail to-day. give honourable members an opportunity to digest it. I think it is unreasonable for me to expect them even to follow me through a balance-sheet covering a period of seven years, and relating to operations involving an aggregate turnover of £59,602,574. The transactions are mauy, and the accounts are difficult and complicated. I ask members to accept this balance-sheet to-day as an interim aggregate balance sheet, and I promise the House and the country that all details in connection with the sugar accounts for the whole period of control will later be placed at the disof figures supplied on the certificate of posal of honoraible members and the public. It is not the practice of any private organization, whether bank, financial institution, or otherwise, to load a balance sheet with detail. gentlemen to look at the balance-sheets of any of the big organizations of this country; but I promise the House and the country, and I prefer that it should be so, since so much has been said about the industry, that the f u l l details shall be provided. Honourable members have the balance-sheet in front of them, and I invite their attention to the memorandum and certificate given by the Auditor General. marks in regard to control apply to the future as well as to the past? of the period of control for which I am presenting the balance-sheet. I am referring to and accounting for a period of control covering seven years. The figures relate to that period, and to that period only. We are now in the middle of a sugar season. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which knows all there is to know in Australia about sugar, fixes its balancing period, wisely I think, in March and September. By the end of September the bulk of the season's sugar will have been sold. It is unfortunate for the sugar account that the financial periods of the Commonwealth year are 30th June and 31st December; and it will not require any great strain of intellect on the part of honourable members to see how difficult and conflicting is the task of reconciling I shall the facts, figures, balance-sheets, stocks and details. This difference in the financial period of the company and the Commonwealth makes the audit very difficult, and the work of preparing accounts and adjustments very complicated. The Auditor-General, according to his certifiThe figures are colossal. cate, has examined the figures of the Millaquin Company and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the latter up to only the 31st December, 1921. The Commonwealth Government's figures are up to 30th June, 1922. Honourable members will note the reservations made by the Auditor-General regarding the accuracy the company's manager, which he has yet to verify, and in respect to which he gives a conditional certificate. Therefore, at the present time, it will be I invite honourable impossible for me to give the details that honourable members have asked me for, but I undertake that the details covering the whole of the sugar period shall be supplied.

' There is no weak point on which we, as a Government, object to give information, or in regard to which we are afraid of attack. We can claim that during the period under review the Australian people had the cheapest sugar in the world, and that the local manufacturer was protected in the home and oversea markets. Illustrative of this fact, I desire to give some interesting figures in connection with the export to the markets of the world of Australian jams, fruits, sauces and other such products. purposes of comparison, I will give the figures for the year prior to the war and the peak figures, as far as exports are concerned, during the war period, when Great Britain could not be served by other than her Dominions. In 1913 we exported 951,654 lbs. of condensed milk, and in the peak year of 1918-19 the quantity was increased to 25,604,000 lbs. In 1913 we exported 441,917 lbs. of confectionery, in 1918-19 1,692,058 lbs., in the following year 2,119,000 lbs., and last year 2,129,000 lbs., as against the pre-war qrrantity of 441,917 lbs. 1913 we exported 1,858,231 lbs. of jams and jellies, and in 1918-19 79,277,560 ibs. war, and practically every country was rationing supplies. manufacturer obtain the sugar? price in the world, and if they had not got it at a low rate the fruit would have remained in Australia. In 1913 we exported canned fruits valued at £1S,153, and in 1918-19 exports were valued at £474,767. These figures cannot be disputed, neither can our records be challenged, and I aek the primary producers of this country not to be led into conflict against one another, but to examine very carefully statements placed before them by certain interested sections of the community. I do not wish to go too much into detail at this juncture, as J intend to supply additional information in connection with the industry from time to time. I do not hold the view that the Government can control the sugar industry in times of peace better than it can be controlled by those engaged iu it . The total turnover for the period mentioned amounted to £59,602,574, and the entire cost to the Australian taxpayer, as represented by theexpenses incurred by the Sugar Control Board, is represented by the meagre sum of £5,727 13s. l d . gest that only about £70 per annum was spent on cables and telegrams? They spent that in Melbourne. period the work was handled by the Controller, under the Prime Minister, and For later by a Board under the Minister for Trade and Customs. The entire cost of control, as far as departmental charges are concerned, during the period mentioned was £5,727 13s. l d . ber for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) was Treasurer part of the time. puting it. that has to be made is for the cost of services rendered by officers, which cost"" In cannot be directly charged to sugar "" control. That was when the world was at tain that only £70 per year was spent on telegrams and cables? exactly as I have stated, and the figures are certified as being correct by the Auditor-General. The cost of the services of officers, which cannot be directly charged to sugar control, would not amount to more than £3,000. The details are as follows:-Salaries and expenses, £2,642 17s.; audit charges, £2,130 15s. I d . ; Sugar Council expenses, £458 5s. l i d . ; cables and telegrams, £490 5s. Id.; and legal fees, £5 10s. I repeat, in answer to the interjection by the honourable member for Balaclava, that the only additional charges to be debited are for services rendered by such officers as those I have mentioned. These figures are not approximate, but are accurate, and the only estimate is the amount of £3,000, which might be added, if the control were debited with the services of officers who are not wholly engaged in the work. The head of the Trade and Customs Department, the Acting Controller-General, is Chairman of the Sugar Board.

I have given definite instructions that details shall be prepared in full, and I undertake that the House shall be supplied with them. To examine every financial detail at this stage would render it impossible to discuss, as we should do, the broad principles involved. I invite honourable members to remember that there are two phases of the sugar control period. We must first of all have regard to the question of public policy during the period covered by the statement. I challenge any honourable member to say that he would have reversed the public policy adopted during the period to which these accounts relate, or to say that he would have substituted some other form of control for that adopted by us. We employed the scientists, the great business managers of the industry, and the existing organizations of distribution, so that neither the producer, the manufacturer, nor the business man was disturbed. The system adopted by us retained the old-time organization for distribution, and in my judgment it served the nation well. We have also to consider the question of public policy from the point of view of the commonweal during the period concerned, and the business aspect must likewise be taken into account. We submit this statement and balance sheet plus a promise to furnish the most minute details in regard to every transaction.

146,Mr Eodgers,"The honourable memI may say, in passing, that the Government were well advised. When the Australian sugar crop failed badly, and it became necessary for us to make purchases abroad-eve n in those years in respect of which it has been said that there was bungling and some scandalI submit that the figures show that the purchases made by Australia compare more than favourably with those made by Britain. We made purchases abroad below the prices paid on behalf of the United Kingdom, the Government of which was also acting under the best advice that it could obtain. The Commonwealth has been well served by its advisers, and its purchases, taken on the whole, have been satisfactory. During the period covered by this statequestion of that kind. Taking the whole ment of accounts, we purchased 1,530,391 tons of Australian-grown sugar at a cost of £36,325,332, or an average of £23 14s. 9d. per ton. Willi t be said that that was an undue price to pay the sugar growers of Australia, who satisfied our own household and industrial requirements, and, in addition, enabled us. during the same period to supply commodities to the battlefields of the world? We also purchased 466,787 tons of foreign sugar at a cost of £18,750,034, or an average of £40 3s. 4d. per ton. The total quantity purchased both locally and abroad was 1,997,178 tons, and the total cost £55,075,366, or an average price of £27 l is . 6d. per ton, raw landed cost at Australian refineries. That is the average cost throughout the whole control period. Now as to the purchases of foreign sugar. During the whole period these purchases totalled 466,787 tons, at a cost of £18,750,034, or an average cost of £40 3s. 4d. per ton. The figures for the two years 1919 and 1920 are available and are significant. They show how British purchases compare with Australian purchases in those years. The average cost oT foreign sugar purchased by Australia in the year 1920 was £59 19s. 5d., whilst the British purchases for the same period were made at an average cost of £67 8s. 6d., giving an advantage to the Australian consumer of £7 9s. l d . per ton. gentleman say whether the landed cost of busiuess for the reason that costs can foreign sugars which he has quoted includes the duty of £6 per ton ? period the Australian Government has given the Australian people the benefit of the duty. In the earlier stages the duty was charged, but subsequently the duty was rebated, and the Australian consumer received the benefit. 1919. sugar used in the first two years was imported ? will supply details later. It isimpossible for me at this stage to answer a period, I may inform honourable members that as compared with the wholesale prices of United Kingdom, there was an advantage to the Australian consumer from the lower prices of our sugar of approximately £27,000,000. Now with regard to the future price of sugar. Honourable members will observe from the balance-sheet I have supplied that £255,186 0s. 7d. is the debit of the profit and loss account as on 30th June. Allowing for interest and the cost of control up to 31st October next, and, on the other hand, following the customary practice and taking unsold stocks as set out in the balance-sheet at cost price, and allowing for their sale at prices current to-day, the Government are satisfied that by the end of October they will have completely wiped off the deficit. They will have so handled the sugar business that, taking home contract prices and oversea purchases, they will be in a position at the end of October next to say that it will be possible, by making necessary adjustments, to reduce the price of sugar to 5d. per lb. as from 1st November next. There is only one way in which the sugar control period can be fairly judged, and that is by covering the whole of the operations during that period. That is the practice adopted by every business man. He must average his purchases. No business man can continuously buy at prices that will always show a profit.",37,Agreement Balance Sheet To £29 5s I T Stood At That Figure

During the debate in the House of Representatives last week on Mr Brennan's amendment on the Address-in-Reply, exception was taken to your appointment as the seventh director. Mr Brennan, who was a member of thc Committee appointed by the Parliament to consider and report upon the proposed agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Amalgamated Wireless, contended that the intention of the Committee was that thc seventh member should not be a nominee of the company, nor one who had close connection with it.

The suggestion that I should now or hereafter accept a seat vacated by any a candidate for the seventh place on the This we 'absolutely deny. ment of Sir Thomas Hughes was made, I have I have said nothing of The honourable member has unto do eo, which was the proper course for might have been liable. I would indeed be a very poor custodian of the interests of tlie country if I prejudiced them by a statement on a matter which was to be decided in Court. I certainly did' not say that we were not bound. That is a point I left to be decided, if necessary, by the Court. I said that the Solicitor General, Sir Robert Garran, might express an opinion, but that I was not called upon to do so. There appears to be no doubt now that we shall be able to make such an appointment in collaboration with the company as will be satisfactory by appointing a man who' has had no previous connection with the company. A t this stage honourable members will not expect me to enter upon a laboured defence of the wireless agreement. I did not attempt to do so when the matter was before the House. Tho agreement has been made; the erection of the stations will be proceeded with. Observations on the merits of the scheme and the practical difficulties to be dealt with offered by any honourable member are very much by the way. Time alone will show whether they are right, or whether the Government and the Committee were right. Sir Thomas Hughes has done exactly what I expected; but what surprises me is that he did not do it earlier. He retired because he is a good Nationalist. Even in his letter he showed that, while he admitted that the Commonwealth was putting most of the money into the venture, his company claimed the right to dominate the new directorate. The Wireless Committee purposely withdrew the word "" independent"" so as to make it possible for any other man to be appointed, and, consequently, Sir Thomas Hughes was chosen. Hadi t not been for the discusggt rid of the Randwick Rifle Range. sion brought on here by members on this side, we would still have had Sir Thomas Hughes as chairman, spending Oommonwealth money, with a majority on the directorate. Minister took some action to change the position on the Board, we would, because he said he had never stated that the agreement was a legal one. I think it was; and if we had broken it, we would have been liable for damages. I am still dissatisfied with the Board of Directors, because the Commonwealth Government should have direct representation either from the Government themselves or from the Government (Service. The present directors are all in the same business; and it is in their interests to see that they are first all the time. No matter what arrangements are made, the interests of those who were in the Amalgamated Company will be paramount. The position has not been made satisfactory, even by the withdrawal of Sir Thomas Hughes. I cannot allow to pass without challenge fhe statement in the letter of Sir Thomas Hughes to the eflect that his company never conceded thc point that the Commonwealth should have a controlling voice on the directorate. Mr Fisk, who appeared before the Wireless Committee as the representative of the company, did concede that point, definitely and distinctly, in deference to the unanimous expression of the Committee, that there should be an independent chairman. That was the very point first settled by the Committee; and it was understood from beginning to end that the seventh director should be absolutely unconnected either with the company or the Government. If the question is to be gone into again, I protest against Mr Consett Stephen being appointed as arbitrator. Our representatives on the Committee should take care that the man who appointed Sir Thomas Hughes does not get an opportunity to make another appointment. I should like to know if the Defence Department has come to any decision to whether we can obtain a title for the land. have an opportunity to discuss the matter before anything is finalized. last few words of the letter of Sir Thomas Hughes are that he will hand in his resignation. It is very much like a vaudeville aet. He is going to resign, and he will then be re-appointed.

Now tiie Government have Allard. He is their man. They also have Stinson and Vicars. If they had desired to deliberately place the entire domination of the wireless scheme in the hands of Mr Fisk, who is now in London, they could not have done it more effectively than they have by their actions up to the present. And now this proposed retirement is merely a burlesque kind of business. He will retire and then the directors will re-assemble and re-appoint him to the position. But, I repeat, that does not matter much. The Commonwealth is to subscribe the majority of .the capital invested in this underof this project. That should be the policy taking; and in ordinary circumstances, and in an ordinary business, whether it be a bank, a brewery, or a druggist shop, the partner who puts the greater part of the capital into the business has every financial and moral right to the majority of the representation on the directorate. exercise it . the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) if he would put £10,000 into a business with a total capital of £19,000, and be content with a minority of the representation. son) -Order!

WhatI am protesting against is a dummy kind of re-shuffling, by which Sir Thomas Hughes will be reinstated in the directorate in another way and will be re-elected chairman. The whole procedure is a sham and a fraud, and I guarantee that the Prime Minister does not believe in it. He believes that the Commonwealth should have supreme control of wireless in this country; but that control is being given, not to the nation which has put the majority of the capital into the business, but to a little gang in Australia and the German Jewsi n London. We should not allow the resignation of Sir Thomas Hughes to be a cover for his reinstatement on the directorate. The Government should say that, in no circumstances, even with the united approval of the Commonwealth's own representatives on the Board, should Sir Thomas Hughes be replaced upon that Board under the pretence that he is an independent chairman. The Government can lay down clearly and definitely the policy that no man. who is connected with the wireless' company, and linked up with the Marconi interests, can be allowed to take a seat as the seventh member of the directorate and chairman of the Government. of the Government.

His letter is in the form of a demand upon the Government. I think I express the opinion of the majority of right-thinking people when I say that we should uot allow any man who is associated with the commercial life of Sydney, or any other capita], to be chairman' of that directorate. The Oommonwealth should also withdraw Mr Allard as one of its ..representatives on the Board. He has no' right to be there. He was appointed, not by the arbitrator, but by the Government; but his presence on the Board is as much a danger to the community as is that of Sir Thomas Hughes. He, too, is closely associated with the Wireless Company, because he is a member of a firm that holds 11,000 shares in Amalgamated Wireless Limited. I am very sorry that this matter has been brought forward on the motion for the adjournment, because the discussion . is necessarily curtailed. The letter of Sir Thomas Hughes reveals that the Amalgamated Wireless Company, by' hook or crook, will control .this project. The company is defying the Government. If another man is appointed as arbitrator to decide who shall be the seventh director, he will do just as Mr Consett Stephen did. If he does not nominate Sir Thomas Hughes he will nominate an equally good barrackera man, who though he may not appear on the shareholders' list, will do exactly as the company wishes. The public life of this country is being degraded by assent to this agreement, and I protest strongly against it. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.2 p.m. [29]",42,Rifle Eanoe
