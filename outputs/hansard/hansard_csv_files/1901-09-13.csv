Ask The Minister For Defence","whether I am to gather from his answer to my question asked yesterday, that he will call for a report from Captain Creswell with reference to naval defence ? tend ray reply to convey that I would call upon Captain Creswell for a report, but that I would be very glad to receive one from him if he had anything to communicate. There seems to be a little difficulty about calling upon any officer for a report at the present time. We already have the views of His Excellency the Admiral, arid if anything further is to be done, we had much better obtain a report from a committee than from an individual officer. A t the same time. I shall be very glad to receive the views of any officers of the naval forces if they desire to communicate them. Minister for Trade and Customs whether there is any truth in the rumor that it is his intention to remove the Customs officers from Albury to Wodonga; and, if so, whether he will reconsider the matter with a view to allowing the officers to remain at Albury1 whatever in the rumour, and there never was -the facts are exactly the reverse. Sir LANGDONBONYTHON I would ask the Treasurer whether in the first list of public works to be constructed out of loan moneys he will include the extension of telegraphic communication to Tarcoola? proposed public works has to be prepared by the Minister of Home Affairs, and all I have to do is to see whether I can provide sufficient money for the purpose of carrying out the works. Personally, I can assure my honourable friend that I think this is a work which, if possible, should be carried out, and I shall be very glad to have ft talk with the Minister of Home Affairs and the Postmaster-General with a view to arriving at executed at an early date.

I have also been informed that what are known as wineries do not always buy grapes, but in some instances purchase the wine or must which the vignerons themsel ves express. If it is reasonable to grant a licence to wineries that buy grapes, it will be equally fair to grant licences to those wineries by which the product of the grapes is purchased. I , therefore, suggest that the definition should read""Winery"" means an establishment where annually 100 tons of grapes are purchased and treated for making wine, or where 4,000 gallons of wine or must are purchased for treatment. I mention 4,000 gallons, because as far as I can ascertain that would be about the 14 Q The legislation in conproduct of wine from 20 acres of vinej-ard. I am told that, roughly speaking, about 20 lbs. of grapes are required to produce a gallon of wine, but the yield varies very much. It is stated that the average yield in Corowa and Albury is from 150 to 200 gallons per acre, whereas in my district the yields are never below 200 gallons, and they sometimes go up to 600 and to even 800 gallons per acre. The yield, of course, depends upon the season and the soil, and the class of grape ; but taking a fair average, I think 4,000 gallons would about represent the yield of 20 acres of vines, and 200 tons of grapes would be relatively very much more than this quantity of must. The winery in the district I represent purchases 600 tons of grapes annually, so that the proposed amendment does not in any way affect it. Minister to consider whether even 100 tons would not be too much in some cases. Where a new district has been planted with vines, and the people cannot afford to erect vignerons' stills themselves, they may desire to have a winery between them, because at the initiatory stage they have only a small quantity of either must or grapes to deal with. The Minister would do well to define u winery as an ; establishment where wine is made from grapes or must, and which is proclaimed as such. The proclamation would be sufficient, because it would be in the hands of the Minister to prevent undue advantage being taken of the clause. ought to be arbitrary; there ought to be some minimum. grapes mean in an ordinary way 100 acres of vines in New South Wales, where, I am assured, there has been frequently during bad years a ton or less to the .acre. The provision would act very harshly in newlyplanted districts. Minister for Trade and Customs) -The desire is to provide what is reasonable under the circumstances ; but we do not wish to see the multiplication of a number of small stills, which are troublesome to the Customs from a revenue point of view, and do not add to the character and reputation of our wines and spirits.

Mr .KINGSTON I have made the closest inquiry, and I am informed in a written report that absolutely nothing, of the kind obtains in any of the States. tion of spirits is, in Victoria, part of the officer's duty, but if he is taken away to supervise the fortification of wines his time is paid for by the applicant. head officer of the department told me that no charge whatever is made. a week ago in Victoria, where a vigneron, whose name and vineyard I could mention, desired to use eight gallons of spirits for the fortification of wine, and he was asked to pay about £ 8 in fees. received says that in none of the States are the services of an officer charged for in connection with tbe distilling of spirits. drawn between the supervision of the distillation of spirits and the supervision of the fortification of wine. to say that when an officer is engaged in supervising the fortification of wine with spirits belonging to the vigneron, no charge is made, but to check the increase of stills in Victoria, the late Commissioner of Trade and Customs-and there has been no alteration made since the 1st January, 1901-allowe d vignerons who have no stills to obtain spirits free of duty-whic h I think is utterly illegal-to fortify their wine, and when an officer is employed, his expenses are paid by the vigneron at the rate of £ 1 a clay, and railway fares. So far as this Bil l is concerned, not a penny is paid by distillers of one character or the other, or by and that a proviso should be added that vignerons for tbe attendance of officers in connection with either the distillation of their own spirits, or the use of their spirits in fortifying. But when vignerons are permitted to get spirits free of duty elsewhere for fortifyin g their wines they are chargedI do not know by what authority a certain fee. vision in the whole of the States is £25,000 per annum, and that is a matter of considerable importance. Mr ""WATSON -That includes tobacco, and a great number of other things. amusing that in connection with tobacco, there is a charge of some description made. Why tobacco should be dealt with in one way, and spirits in another, is a little difficult to discover. This point, however, can be discussed on the Excise Bill, which will be introduced shortly. The cost of supervision in connection with excise is-Ne w South Wales £5,353, Victoria £6,479 , Queensland £S, 141, South Australia £2,216, Tasmania £490, and Western Australia £1,2S9. Theses figures should induce us to consider whether the system is right, and whether we should encourage the multiplication of small stills. I do not think there is any inclination on the part of the committee to give such encouragement, seeing the bad effect it has on the character of our wines and spirits, and how troublesome it is so far as the collection of revenue is concerned. wine-growing is a new occupation, and if the minimum be more than 50 tons, the industry will be shut out altogether. to shut the Western Australian grower out. This is a question of what is a fair thing to do under the circumstances. I believe that 200 tons was the limit originally suggested by the honourable member for Echuca. been asked to suggest that it be 100 tons. not a very extraordinary quantity of grapes, and if preference isgiven, as is not unusual, to local distillers, there is an additional loss to be contemplated. I did not quite catch the suggestion of the honourable member for Bland. that the definition should stop with a declaration of the class of the establishment, no establishment should be considered a winery until so proclaimed by the Minister. be hardly fair to either the grower or the Minister. might be occupied in considering applicaThe cost of supertions, but at the same time a minimum of 200 tons, or even 100 toiis, might operate",15,Distillation Bil L

Western Australia presents an instance in which the provision as now drafted might operate harshly. growing is entirely a new industry in Western Australia, where I do not think there is a public still, but where there are a number of growers with not more than from 2 to 5 acres each. ought to be allowed to combine and have a co-operative s t ill ; and if a minimum of 50 tons were allowed, it would be an encouragement to the industry in Western Australia, where very fine grapes are grown. desirable to have the minimum fixed in the Bill. tion by regulation ? raised by the honourable member for Bland can be easily met by other provisions in the Bill, giving power to combine to obtain a still. Further, spirit for fortifying purposes can be obtained from any locality where there is a distillery. If the minimum of grapes or must is fixed as high as 200 tons, even large companies may be debarred from taking advantage of the Bill because they merely approximate to the minimum, and are thus unable to obtain a licence for a still. of must to the ton of grapes t quantity, according to the season. 14 Q 2 ton. is considerably more than that, and in other localities considerably less; the soil and climatic conditions have a very appreciable effect. I would suggest that if the minimum is reached by the purchase of grapes and wine there should be the opportunity to obtain a licence. In the Rutherglen district, where there are a considerable number of vinethe Bill allow yards, ranging from 10 to 20 acres, the Winery Company might buy 150 tons of grapes and between 3,000 gallons and 4,000 gallons of wine, neither of which would be the minimum. As to the charge for theservices of officers, I have it on unquestionable authority that where the owner of a vineyard-still licence has distilled spirit, that spirit is under tbe key of the Customs officer, and if the spirit is desired for fortifying purposes the officer has to be paid for supervising the operation, although no charge is made for the attendance of an officer during the process of distilling. No complaint has ever been made about the charge for the attendance of the officer during the process of fortification, because supervision must be exercised, and those who require it fire willing to pay for it . Surely such growers the proportion of wine that can be obtained from a ton of grapes is, roughly, 100 gallons. I think we might define a winery as an establishment where annually a certain quantity of wine is made either from grapes or must. That will meet the case whether people are dealing with wine or must, or both together, if we take power to prescribe a reduced quantity, we shall do the best we can to fix a fair thing.

On behalf of the honourable and effects produced by wine spirit and potato learned member, I now move That the words "" nor with any spirit but pure iu this matter, as it is no part of our wine spirit"" be added to the clause. This is in accordance with the law at present in force in some of the States, and will, I think, commend itself to the common sense of honourable members. If we are to allow our wine to be fortified with spirit distilled from rye, maize, beet-root refuse, Or potatoes, the character of the wine will be entirely altered, and we shall not be able to achieve that high reputation for the products of our vineyards which it should be our aim to secure. I notice that in the Age yesterday reference was made to the provision in the Victorian Adulteration Act---that only wine spirit should be used for the fortification of wine, and to the fact that it has attracted favorable attention in the wine-growing countries of the continent, where a movement is on foot for passing similar legislation. In this morning's Age a letter appears, written by Mr Andrew Rowan, one of the leading wine merchants of Victoria, who refers very strongly to this question of fortification of wines. He says :I trust that Mr Kiugston will not permit any Australian to fortify his wine with potato spirit, or any spirit except that made from wine. In my opinion there are two cogent reasons why he should insist upon the use of pure grape spirit. 1. Because spirit made from any substance other than the grape will be more or less out of harmony with the wine, and therefore can never produce a first-class port or sherry-the thing aimed at 03' fortifiers. 2. By compelling the use of wine spirit only yon force vignerons who have quantities of ""off wine"" to distil it, and thus clear the market of rubbish which would otherwise be ""faked"" up with a cheap potato spirit and offered to the world as Australian wine. In a vide a market for bud wine. Permit the use of Minister might agree to the principle which is sought to be affirmed, because the amendment appears to go in the right direction. It would aid the industry generally if some protect the wine-makers against injury by spirit, bub I think we ought not to interfere business to favour one set of distillers",18,Distillation Bil L

M c LEAN (Gippsland) I hope the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, will waive his objection to the amendment. I can assure him that before the Victorian Legislature adopted the provisions of the Adulteration Act they made ful l inquiries, and satisfied themselves that it was highly desirable to prohibit the use of all except grape spirit for the fortification of wine. If we are submitting our wines as the pure juice of the grape we should not permit them to be fortified with anything but pure grape spirit. The advocates of spirits made from other products pressed their claims upon us very strongly at the time the Victorian Adulteration Act was pjassed, but a close investigation convinced us that it would be an utter mistake to use any spirit for fortifying winss except spirit made from the same materials. I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment, for I am sure it will improve the Bill. before us previously I promised to obtain all the information upon the subject possible ---n the short time at my disposal, and I iiave done so. I would remind honourable members that we have already provided that no spirit shall be used for the purpose of fortifying wines unless it is approved by the excise officer, and is of a certain strength, and the question is whether we ought to go any further, and say as regards the man who produces spirits from wine, ""We will help you,"" and as regards the man who produces spirits from other materials, "" We will prevent you from using your spirits for this purpose."" In effect we should be protecting the wine-grower and injuring those who produce spirits other than grape spirit. The letter quoted by the honourable member for Echuca was written by a gentleman who no doubt knows what he is talking about, and the effect of what he says is that if we do what is now suggested, we shall preserve for the wine-makers and merchants aiiiarket for their "" of f "" wines, and at the same time prevent some one else from having a market for spirit which, however pure it may be, is termed "" rubbish."" This question is largely one of health, and ought not to be dealt with by us, because it is a matter for the States to consider. We have done what we considered to Potato spirit is a pure be necessary, and I think that we have already gone far enough. W ill any honourable member say that it is impossible to use other spirit-it may be spirit made from maltfor fortifying wines without injury ? out damaging the wine. much experience in the making of wine as some honourable members, but can we not leave it to those who know all about it , and who possess common sense, not to use a spirit which will injure their product. I called for a report from the .comptroller of Customs, who writes as follows :There has been mention made that spirits for fortifying purposes should be made from wine or lees of wine only. The reasons assigned why wine spirits only should be used for fortifying wines are-(1 ) That the spirit so made will assimilate more readily with the wine. (2) That it will be the means of keeping up the price of wine fit only for distillation. (3) That the poor wines will not be put upon the market, if other means for their disposal are available, and one way is provided if wine spirit only is to be used for fortifying purposes. (4) That it is a kind of protection to the vigneron, as it debars other spirit being used. (5) That limiting the spirit to wine spirit will be no detriment to the smaller classes of vignerons, but large holders will feel the shoe pinch when wines cannot be obtained at a cheap rate for distilling. MrA . McLEAN -The last is a ""gallery"" paragraph. departmental idea altogether. man who understands perfectly what he is talking about. better man in the service, I admit. say :Should other spirit be used I have heard vignerons say that spirits highly rectified and purified do just as well for fortifying purposes as spirits made from wine or lees of wine. Dr. Bell, Principal of the Inland Revenue Laboratory in London, gave most valuable evidence before a select committee on British and foreign spirits. In answer to question .1002, he replied"" If the spirit is highly purified it makes no difference of what material it has been made."" Answer to question 1065 also has a most important bearing. Questions 1262 to 1268 bear on potato spirits, and answers by Mr Samuels, Principal of the Customs laboratory, are to the point at issue. Dr. Bell at question 1065 gives the following evidence :But do I understand you to say that that brandy, if treated and purified, can, notwithstanding its origin from potatoes, be just as good",19,Distillation Bil L

Stephens, but, with u desire to encourage the growth of the grape, we limit the use to grape spirit only. What is our first duty in this connection? Revenue. Dr. Wollaston agrees with Mr Stephens from the revenue and health points of view, but he wants to protect the wine producer at the expense of others who can, to the same extent, satisfy those conditions. There is no getting away from the fact that the amendment is proposed in the interests of protection of a certain kind. Honourable members know what my views are in reference to protection generally. MrA . McLEAN ter run off the rails on this occasion. rails, but, when it comes to a question of protecting one industry at the expense of another, the two local industries being equally entitled to protection, I hesitate. I am reminded that I did not quote the opinion of the Western Australian collector, which is shortly expressed-wit h that judicial smack we all admire-in the words "" I concur,"" written upon the opinion of the acting collector of Western Australia, who misinterpreted the point, and did not 7iotice the emphasis on the word ""only."" saysLocal Act provides colonial wine spirit may be used on payment of sixpence per gallon by manufacturers, of two shillings sixpence on imported spirit. I see no objection to wine spirit being used under proper supervision. Then from New South Wales we have the opinion of Mr Baxter, who writes :In my opinion wine spirit only should be used to fortify wine. By the use of other spirits, such as the product of grain, pulse, potatoes, or molasses, a foreign element would be introduced to the detriment of the purity of the wine, the protection of which is, I presume, one of the objects of the proposed Distillation Act. Mr Kemp, of Brisbane, says :Cannot see any objection ; think it desirable wine spirit only be used fortifying wine. Mr Scammell, wires :See no good reason why any properly rectified strong spirit, not less than 00 over proof, should not be used. trouble. of Launceston, wires :No objection to insertion in Bill to use wine That is all the information which is available now, and I think honourable members will say I have spared no pains in collecting it. The question is-Have we gone far enough, or shall we now by the present proposal give protection to wine-producing -which is as strongly represented in the State from which I come as in any Stateat the expense of another industry which is equally entitled to protection, and which is able to comply with all requirements of tlie Customs Act as regards revenue, and iilso with all conditions as to the health of the people 1 W h y does the MinisMinister says that the amendment is a protective proposal; and so it is. I presume all legislation is intended to protect the best interests of the people; but the Minister goes further, and says that the amendment is intended to protect the wine-grower. In my opinion the amendment does the very reverse, because I believe a very large number of wine-growers would like to be allowed to use any kind of spirit. experience, that one of the largest growers requested permission from the Customs He department to use some spirit made in a distillery; but the permission was not granted. In my opinion we have to consider the protection of the consumer, not only in Australia, but in other parts of the world. This is not a fiscal, matter at all, but one which affects the reputation and character of a product of Australia. We have at present a great deal to contend with in securing a market for our wines. It is admitted that the quality of Australian wines is such that at no distant date they will occupy a very high position in the regard of wine drinkers in every part of the globe. earned without a provision of the kind proposed. known that we allow potato spirit to be used for the purposes of fortification, we strike a blow at the industry we are endeavouring to assist.

He has endeavoured to collect information regarding this matter, and I think we are indebted to him for the amount of information laid before us. But the greater part of that information is undoubtedly in favour of the amendment; indeed, there do not seem to be two opinions about the matter. Are we going to allow a limited number of vignerons in one of the States, who desire to take advantage of an opportunity presented to them, to fortif y their wines with a spirit which is well known to be impure and to have deleterious effects upon the human system 1 I am astonished at the attitude of some honourable members who arrogate to themselves the function of looking after the health and well-being of the community. These members call themselves democrats, and yet they are prepared to allow a dishonest vigneron to mix with his wine an impure spirit which will undermine the health of the community, and fill our hospitals and lunatic asylums. to the very opposite effect. opinions expressed depends on the manner in which the question was put to the authorities. committee will commit a great wrong if they do not support the amendment-if tliey allow vignerons to use a spirit which no authority will say is a pure spirit, but which all authorities the world over designate as the very worse kind of spirit that can go into consumption. every other sort of spirit, however wholesome, is excluded in favour of wine spirit. opposition to this amendment comes. I have had put into my hands a list of amendments approved by distillers, who met in Adelaide, and who specially requested that potatoes should be added as a material from which spirit might be distilled. large as that of the wine-growers. but we are here to legislate for the whole community and not for a mere section, and we have to look at the effects of legislation. the first consideration. But he has failed I am not here on behalf of the vignerons of ""Victoria or any other place, but I am speaking on behalf of that great mass of the community who are wine drinkers. made in South Australia as in Victoria. it is the geographical origin of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, which makes him take his present stand, or whether it is because he has a strong feeling in favour of this particular spirit. I am only endeavouring to give the committee the results of my knowledge of the spirit distilled from potatoes, and I desire to assure honourable members that it is the most pernicious and impure spirit made, with the exception, perhaps, of wood spirit, which has such an awful effect on the human system. I referred the other day to a quantity of so-called whisky that had been made from potato spirit on the continent of Europe, and had been shipped to the west coast of Africa at 6|-d. a bottle, labelled, and with straw envelopes. That will give an idea of the commercial value of this spirit. It shows that it is so cheap that it is probably very nasty as well. Indeed, an analysis has proved that it is nasty. Its use has been a bad thing for the community. To uphold the reputation of Australian wines it seems to me essential that the process of fortification shall be conducted under such conditions as will insure the addition of only pure spirit. The Minister apparently places great reliance upon the fact that a vigneron, for the sake of his own business, will not add inferior spirit to his wines. But the Minister must recognise howfallacious that argument is. All wines do not bear upon the bottles the names of the persons who manufacture them. Under such a provision as this, certain wines would be fortified with impure spirit, and the vigneron would thus be able without identification to get rid of a lot of inferior stock which otherwise he might not be able to dispose of. the Minister will weigh carefully the report of the experts who have dealt with this matter. If he does so, he will find that the weight of evidence is in favour of the fortiI dare say that is so, fication of wines by the addition of spirits distilled from grapes.

109,Mr Kennedy (Moira),"I hope thatbeyond the things which concern us. not be interfered with by the adoption of this amendment, I do not see how any objection can be taken to it. The Minister urges that it is beyond our province to deal with it, but I would remind him that it is only by a law of the Commonwealth that supervision can be exercised over vignerons using spirit for the purposes of fortification. Consequently, it comes well within the purview of this Parliament to deal with the matter in this Bill. It is the only opportunity we shall have of introducing a uniformity of practice. States can say that wines which are fortified witli certain spirits shall not be sold within tlieir borders, but all that the vignerons would have to do then would be to -send those wines elsewhere. I think that Mr cessfully competes with the whole world in Scammell struck the point at issue when he spoke of the strength of the spirit .used for the fortification of wine. If one uses spirit other than grape spirit for the fortification of wine, one must have it very highly rectified-u p to 50 per oent. over proof, and in the case of potato spirit 60 per cent, over proof. When wine is fortified with spirit of that strength distilled from potatoes, the harshness and flavour of the spirit is imparted to the wine. In fortifying wine with from grapes it is not necessary to have it rectified to that strength, and, therefore, the flavour of the grape is not eliminated from the spirit. Consequently, there are not the bad effects from spirit distilled from wine that result from spirit distilled from potatoes. spirit as well as bad spirit of any other sort. that by the use of spirit distilled from wine there is not the danger of that harshness being imparted to the wine winch results from the use of other spirits. To my mind there can be no reasonable objection urged to the amendment. It does not affect the fiscal issue in the slightest degree. quotation which the Minister made from the collector of inland revenue is not questioned at all. It is admitted that we can get absolutely pure spirit, but we must have it of a very high strength. The progress of this debate discloses the weakness of the position taken up by some to go honourable members, who affirm that this Parliament ought to legislate to prevent the As the revenue will use of certain spirits in the fortification of our wines. The practice of the fortification of wine from grape spirit prevails only iu one State. It seems idle for us to set ourselves up as judges upon this question. Surely we can leave the matter as to what spirit shall be used for the purpose of fortifying our wines to the manufacturers themselves. Does the. honourable member for Echuca tell me that those who are engaged in that business in South Australia do not understand it? If , as asserted, the use of the purest potato spirit imparts a harshness Of course the to wine will they not know that ? Will they deliberately destroy their wines for the sake of using potato spirit? South Australia produces wine chiefly for export in competition with the whole world, and succertain wines. fortified with potato spirit ? merely wish to point out that the manufacturers themselves know perfectly well what effect potato spirit will have upon their wines. But why should not pure potato spirit be used in the fortification of wines ? A t 60 per cent, over proof one gets as near to purity as it is possible to get. spirit distilled Because the use of potato spirit imparts a certain amount of harshness to wine is this Parliament to say that the practice of using that spirit shall be discontinued? What is the reason advanced in support of such a proposal ? Simply that some growers who fortif y their wines with grape spirit desire to have a monopoly. This is absolutely an attempt on the part of one class of producers to damage the wines of another set of producers in another State. It has not been shown by anybody that potato spirit is injurious in the form in which it is used. The honourable member for Laanecoorie said that certain whisky which is made on tbe Continent from potato spirit produces very bad effects. The But I would point out that bad stuff can be made from most things. It is not our business to bar the use of certain material which is being used in tbe trade, and which has not been shown to have had any deleterious results. This State has complete power to say that wine which is fortified by potato spirit shall not be consumed in Victoria, and thus the health of Victorians",23,Distillation Bil L

For that reason I hope the committee will not pass the amendment. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHABN (Melbourne) -There Scriptures that refers to certain swine which were driven by spirits into the sea, and I am under the impression that tbe spirits in that case must have been potato spirits, or that the swine were suffering from the effects of eating potatoes. This is not really a question as to whether potato spirit shall be used for the fortification of wines, but as to whether any spirit other than that produced from grapes shall be employed. I have had some experience in connection with an endeavour to foster the wine industry by placing our wines upon the London market, and I know that the great difficulty in connection with Australian wines arises from their want of regular quality. Inasmuch as we have provided under the Victorian law that nothing but spirit distilled from grapes shall be used for wine fortification, I think it would be extremely unfair, after all the money we have spent in placing our wines before the British public, if it became known that Australian vignerons were permitted to use any other than grape spirit in the fortiThen Dr. Bell, C.B., F.R.S., at question fication of their wines. This is a very much more important matter than some honourable members seems to think, and I hope the Minister will see his way to agree to the Amendment. Mr MicCAY (Corinella) -The first objection raised to this amendment-and to my astonislunentitis approved by the Minister -is that the amendment would go beyond the j urisdiction of the Commonwealth. I do not wish to discuss this point at any length, because I admit frankly that it is distinctly <m arguable one ; but, if I were asked for an opinion oft-hand, I should say that the clause itself falls within the same category as the amendment, and is of doubtful efficacy. If we are entitled to say what the alcoholic strength of the spirit shall be, we surety have a right to say what ingredients the spirits shall be made from, and there cannot be any objection raised against the amendment which could not be urged with equal force against the clause. The second objection to the amendment is that clause 57 already provides that no spirit shall be used for the fortification of wines unless it is approved by the officer, and is of a certain strength. I have a very high opinion of the Customs officers, but I do not regard them as such angelic beings as tlie Minister seems to think they are. Very often the Customs officers and is a passage in the the consuming public do not look at things from the same point of view, and I think that if we are going to make wine we should have it made and placed on the market in the very best possible way. I have been looking through the evidence given before tbe select committee of the House of Commons on British and foreign spirits, and I have found some interesting facts bearing upon the comparative merits of the different kinds of spirits. A witness who gave a great deal of evidence was .D. P. Williams, a collector and surveyor, at Dundee, who had had 28 years' experience in the Customs department. A t question 7 9 he is askedDo you think it matters what the ingredients are that are used in distillation ?-Decidedly it matters, because some of the other constituents go over. The pure alcohol is almost impossible to get without some other ingredient-it is very difficult; even the German spirit is not pure alcohol: the strongest I have ever seen is. I think, a little over 70 over proof. I have seen 70 or 71 perhaps. Pure alcohol is 75. 975 is askedIs it not the general impression that brandy acts more prejudicially upon the nerves than other spirits '' I think the result of the investigation of the British Commission or of the evidence that the French Commission received was this : That taking the wine spirit, the spirit obtained from the wine, which would be a genuine brandy, the ingredients in that were less deleterious than in those obtained from spirit derived from grain.

There is no denying the fuct that this is an attack on South Australian wines, and it is no use endeavouring to disguise that attack as anxiety for the public health. member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, was speaking, the honourable member for Echuca interjected about one State only using this potato spirit. But whether or not that spirit be used in South Australia, the best wine in the Commonwealth is there produced. there is not so much spirit used there. South Australia are the best judges of what is good for their wine, and in the market of the world their product is accepted as against Victorian wine. Under these circumstances, it is a shame, by way of innuendo, to attempt to damage the wines produced in South Australia. I resent that attack very strongly, and shall vote against the amendment, which is neither more nor less than an attempt to get an advantage over South Australia in the wine market. a Victorian nor a South Australian, I hope that what I have to say will be regarded as concerned chiefly with the development of what promises to be an important industry in Australia in the future. Even in this Distillation Bill we have to consider matters of this kind, and if this clause, as has been indicated by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, deals with matters which concern the wine industry outside Customs interests, I do not see why .we cannot logically include the amendment of the honourable member for Echuca. The whole question seems to me to be simply what is the best spirit with which to for t i fy the wines. This is not so much a question of purity, because we have been told, and I believe it is correct, that alcohol, so far as ordinary consumption is concerned, is never absolutely pure. I believe there is great point in the interjection of the honourable member for Robertson a few moments ago, that South Australian wines have acquired their reputation in the markets of the world largely because of the fact that they are natural wines, unfortified to any considerable extent. There can be little doubt that the product of the grape as distilled is the natural spirit with which to fortify wines. We have heard a great deal about the question of the purity of alcohol, but this argument of purity is about one of the most extraordinary I have heard in connection with this subject. Every distilled product carries with it characteristics of the material from which it is made, and though we hear statements to the effect that an absolutely pure spirit is quite wholesome, the evidence of experts and of medical men is that the spirit which goes into consumption is never quite pure. We know that in some of tbe distilleries of this Commonwealth, spirit is extracted from various materials, and then coloured and flavoured to represent whisky, brandy, or rum, as the case may be. But will any honourable member seriously contend that these whiskies, brandies, or rums are the genuine article? Should any one go to Scotland and ask a Scotch distiller why he does not adojst the same simple method, he would say, without hesitation, that if he did so, he would spoil his whisky-that it would not be whisky at all. What the distiller of Scotch whisky tries to do is to get as many by-products as he can from his malt, in order to give the necessary",27,Distillation Bil L

If the spirit be purified, one spirit is quite as good as another for the purpose of fortifying wine. grape spirit it makes very little difference whether the wine is matured or not. The spirit will mature in the wine just as well as out of it. for using spirit in wine is that the wine has not been sufficiently clarified, racked off, or worked to make it wholesome. By fortifying it with spirit, the vigneron is able to place his wine upon the market in an immature condition. The honourable member for Echuca says that the reason for using spirit is that the wine will not keep whilst it is in course of transit through the Red Sea. That is not so. Australian wines contain a higher percentage of spirit than those of Continental countries. A short time ago I called in at the South Australian depot in London, where South Australian wines were being racked off, clarified, and blended for the purpose of placing them upon the market. I wines command respect in London because they are sound and"" mature. If we mature our wines here, we do not require to fortif y them to the extent indicated by some honourable members who have preceded me. I found that in London Australian wines were at a discount because a very large firm in the East End had been importing large quantities of wine from Spain and elsewhere, and placing them upon the market as Australian wines. All over London one will see it placarded that "" Australian wines are sold here."" I was informed by the cellarman of the firm I have referred to that they imported very little Australian wine. A t Coblentz, on the Rhine, I found that they were shipping to London a class of wine which was being sold as Australian wine. It was made from the skins of grapes, glucose, grape water, and fortified with raw spirit. That is just the class of wine that is being sold in Victoria to-day. I consider that the Minister has spoilt the Bill by reducing to five acres the area which a man is required to have under vine cultivation before he is entitled to use a still. It has been said that South Australian wines are not better than Victorian wines. I claim to be a wine drinker, and I say, without hesitation, that the best wine sold in New South Wales is South Australian wine. No man who cares about giving a sound wine to his friends would use any other. But South Australia hitherto has had men in the business who understood it . I might instance the late Sir Robert Ross and Mr Hardy, who have made a study of the question of how to produce a pure wine. Pure wine can The reason only be obtained by prohibiting the use of pot stills altogether. Now that we have permitted the use of the pot still under this Bill we shall not secure a pure wine. The proposal of the Government is a much sounder one than that of the honourable member for Echuca, because the officer in charge has to approve of the spirit to be used. That provision affords some measure of protection. is just one question that I desire to bring before the committee before a vote is taken. I have here a book by Dr. Mitchell, which gives the constituents of the various alcohols. The lowest in carbon contents is methyl ic alcohol, which is obtained from wood, and is comwas given to understand that those monly known as wood spirit. Then we have ethylic or common alcohol, which contains two atoms of carbon to six parts of hydrogen and one of oxygen. Amylic alcohol contains five parts of carbon to twelve of hydrogen and one of oxygen. Methylic, ethylic, propylic, and butylic alcohols mix very readily with water, but amylic and hexylic are utterly insoluble in water. We know that fusel oil will not mix with water, and that it is really potato spirit. Lauder Brunton, who is, I suppose, the greatest living authority we have upon therapeutics, gave evidence some time ago before the select committee on British and foreign spirits. He was asked :For instance, supposing a man drinks good wine or bad wine of the same name, all the results experimentally upon his own body may be very different?-""Very different indeed,"" he replied, ""and it is a general conclusion obtained from unrecorded, no doubt, but still very numerous experiments, that good wine is much less injurious than bad wine ; that a man may take a consider able amount of wine, provided that it be good, without any very bad effect upon him either at the time or afterwards ; whereas a very small quantity of bad wine may cause in many people a most",29,Distillation Bil L

The next question put to the witness wasIn addition to the investigation of the effect of the by-products, such as the higher alcohols, you suggested that there might be another investigation also as to the alkaloids formed by the putrefaction of the materials in fermentation VI would point out that alkaloids are very frequently the active principles of various vegetable substances, and in most cases they are deadly poisons. LauderBrunlon's answer wasYes; and I think it is just possible that the presence of these alkaloids, due to the use of bad materials, may account for some of the prejudice against so-called silent spirit ; that if silent spirit prescribed is obtained by using a decayed or putrifying maize, or rice, or potatoes, you have got a much greater likelihood of some of those alkaloids being present in it. This applies to the wholeof those spirits which honourable members urge should be allowed to be used in the fortification of wines. There is a vast difference between the spirit produced from the grape and that produced from potatoes. The same constituents result, but in relatively different quantities. In the pure grape spirit obtained from the grape there are two atoms of carbon to six of hydrogen and one of oxygen, but in the spirit obtained from potatoes there is a different proportion altogether, although the constituents are the same. Buti t is not these constituents that we need fear so much, although honourable members will see that if we vary the relation of carbon to oxygen we shall get carbonic acid, which is a deadly poison. But I am speaking chiefly of the by-products, which are not got rid of by distillation up to 35 per cent, over proof. take years to mature. that the amendment will be carried,' and that the reputation and character of our Australian wines will thereby be preserved. I am merely desirous of protecting the public and the consumers of wine, and in their interests this amendment is absolutely necessary. MrA . McLEAN (Gippsland) I agree that the less spirit used in the fortification of wine the better. allow wine to mature with age. But as this Bill expressly provides for the fortifying of wine, it should be our object to minimize the evil that is done by the use of spirits at all. . That can only be accomplished by prescribing that the very 14 K best spirits shall be used. The point relied on by the opponents of the amendment is that the spirits to be used have to be approved by the officer. Now, if the Bill itself did not prescribe any limit of strength in regard to the spirits to be used, the opinion of the officer might be worth something. But the officer will be guided by the BiU, and as the Bill prescribes that spirit of 30 degrees above proof may be used, is it likely that he will condemn any spirit which complies with the standard fixed 1 Pure spirit is 75 degrees over proof, and if we use a spirit of the minimum strength by the Bill, we know that the difference between that and 75 degrees over proof must be made up of foreign matter. It appears to me that there should not be two opinions upon the subject. The by-product of the grape comes from the same material as that from which the wine itself is made. Thererefore, it cannot be regarded as a foreign substance, whilst the by-product from any other material is certainty a foreign substance. The Minister must be convinced that the adoption of the amendment will secure a better article than will the Bill as it stands at present. better than Victorian wine. MrA . M c LEAN I am not at all sure that in fortifying their wines the South Australians use potato spirit. Because they are not prohibited by law from using the best material, it does not follow that they do not use the best. question now before the committee is one of great importance to the health of the people of the Commonwealth, and I agree with honourable members who have expressed tbe view that we should aim at giving the public the very purest wines we possibly can. The maintenance of the purity of our Australian wines has engaged attention in the past, and we should not do anything by legislation that would have the effect of jeopardizing the reputation of our products It is preferable to in the eyes of local consumers, or of those outside the Commonwealth. Two or three years ago I visited Mr Thomas Hardy's cellars in Adelaide, and tasted wines which were, perhaps, equal to any wines in the world, and which I was told were not in any degree fortified.

Solomon (Fremantle),"Th ethat when wines have to he sent long distances, it may he necessary at times to fortify them, but there should be no necessity for adding spirits to the great bulk of our wines. I should be very sorry to see anything but pure grape spirit used for fortification purposes, and I certainly favour the amendment before the committee. ing feature in connection with this discussion has been the extent of the knowledge exhibited by the temperance members of this House as to the constituents of wines, and the relative effects of different kinds of spirits. The facts that have been brought out by the honourable member for Laanecoorie and others as to the soul destroying elements contained in the liquors offered for public consumption leads one to wonder that there are any people left at all to elect members to this House. We have had presented to us all the materials necessary for a most powerful attack upon the liquor trade, and I hope that some of the information elicited will have a salutary effect upon the habits of the people. There seems to be a disposition in connection with every machinery B ill which is brought forward to attempt to graft certain fads upon it, and it appears to me that tlie amendment now proposed has a very strong fiscal flavour. So far as we desire to protect the public health, I think we may safely rely upon the Minister to take all necessary precautions to insure that liquor of low and deleterious quality is not allowed to go into consumption. I am not much concerned as to whether one wine-maker receives assistance through being able to use silent spirit as against another who uses grape spirit, but 1 think that if we are to have a national beverage such as wine, we should have it placed before the people in as pure a form as possible, and without fortification to a greater extent than may be necessary. I believe that the process of artifically maturing wine, by means of adding spirit, is one which must have injurious effects upon the health of the people, and I hope the Minister will do everything he possibly can to protect them in this regard. the observations of the honourable member is distillation from good potatoes. Apart for Laanecoorie, to the effect that, with refrom that, seeing that the whole scope of the gard to the reports placed before the House, Bill is to give facilities to vignerons for the value to be attached to them would all the fortification of their wines with wine depend upon the way in which the matter spirit, why should wp go further than was put before the officers who furnished that and say that in no case shall spirit the reports. I may say that I obtained this information as a Minister seeking reliable informationfi'om hisofficers, and without any endeavour to colour the reports. member's remarks referred to the English reports. cept that explanation, as I know that the honourable member for Laanecoorie would not willingly suggest that I had acted unfairly in the matter. The reports from the officers of my department were called for in these termsI wisli reports from officers in all tlie States, as to whether or not they see any objection to provision being made in the Distillation Bill, that .wine spirit only should be used for fortifying wine. I do not think the matter could have been put more fairly than that, seeing that my minute was perfectly free from any indication of the Ministerial view on the subject. The point is, that an attempt is being made to provide that, under no circumstances, shall any but wine spirit be used forfortifying wines. So far as vignerons and vignerons' licences are concerned, special facilities are granted for the fortification of wine, and it -' is highly improbable that recourse will be had by vignerons to any other spirit than that produced from wine in more cases than one in a hundred. Expressing my own opinion as a private individual, I may say frankly that if I were to drink wine I should like to think that I was drinking wine fortified with good wine spirit, and not with those spirits which have been, I think improperly, called impure. It is not, however, altogether a question as to the nature of the spirit, but as to the way in which it is produced. Bad spirit can be made out of good wine, just as good spirit may be made out of bad potatoes. It is not contemplated that grape spirit will always be distilled from good wine, but in most cases from wine that is "" of f colour,"" and that would otherwise have to be wasted. And, in the natural order of things, it seems to me that distillation from bad wine is I was sorry to hear not more likely to produce good spirit than",31,Distillation Bil L

153,Mr Kingston,"I am content to acother than wine spirit be used for fortification. I do not think we ought to interfere unnecessarily in the interests of one section of tlie community or another. The test of the necessity for action seems to depend upon the question whether it is required in the interests of the community as a whole, and in connection with this we have the eloquent fact that in South Australia, where there is no limit as to the kind of spirit to be used for the purposes of fortification, the wines are of a high character. We therefore have a notable instance in South Australia, that it is absolutely unnecessary to provide that wine shall be fortified with grape spirit only. I think we may fairly leave this matter to the good sense of those who are interested in the wine industry. No one is interested in using bad stuff when good stuff is equally obtainable, and seeing that the large discretion given to wine-makers has been exercised with advantage in South Australia, why should we say now that wine-makers shall not use their own judgment, but that they must have recourse to grape spirit so that a market may be found for wines that are ""off,"" to the advantage of those who have such wines, and to the disadvantage of all others concerned. The honourable member for Echuca made some reference to the fact that ""Victorian distillers had produced a certain quantity of wine spirit, and I think his intention was to glorify the action of the Victorian distillers, but when we examine the returns we find that nine out of ten gallons of the spirit produced in Victoria is not wine spirit. though. member know what he is seeking to do?

No more than 3,436 gallons. argument in the least. small quantity of wine spirit was produced. 14 R 2 What becomes of the balance? How much of it goes into consumption, and is taken neat ? People are allowed to dilute it with a little water, but to put it into wine is to be forbidden for all time. To adopt legislation of this character is altogether unjustifiable, if it be held that such spirit is good for direct consumption. this was a general scheme for the purpose of preventing the consumption of spirits, and that after having prohibited the use of spirits generally for the purpose of fortifying wine, we were going further, and intended to stop all consumption, I could understand the position. But to say that spirits made from barley malt, barley, wheat, maize, rye and molasses are fit for human consumption, and, at the same time, are impure and improper for the purpose of fortifying wine, is to contend an absurdity. If such spirit is already used for general purposes under the law, how is it possible to suggest on the ground of public health that it must not be mixed with wine. It may be a matter of taste; but the only point on which we have a right to legislate in the direction suggested, is on the ground of public health. It is not, however, a question of public health, as is shown by the general allowance of the consumption of such spirit, and to legislate in the limited sense proposed, is .an unjustifiable course to which I hope the committee will not consent. Minister seems to draw the conclusion that because I and those who think with me It is not potato spirit, would refuse to allow every kind of spirit to be added to wine for the purpose of fortification, we object altogether to the distillation of spirits. The Minister has no warrant for that assumption. When spirit is made and sold as spirit, there is a chance for the consumer, but when spirit is added to wine, and the latter is sold as pure wine, then the consumer has no protection It is not whatever. These impiu-e spirits are allowed to masquerade under a different name. They are sold as pure wine, and numbers of people consume them, believing them to be such. I think I have demonstrated to every fair-minded man that there is a probability, almost a certainty, that in the manufacture of materials which require, and which often are accompanied by, putrefying action, certain poisonous products are",32,Distillation Bil L

I had two amendments in this clause to submit to the committee, but in consideration I have decided not to submit one of them.

I have tlie same objection to that rule that I had previously. It places the local distillers at a disvantage as compared with foreign distillers. It may be argued that we should impose the same conditions on foreign distillers, but even though this were done our local distillers would carry on the whole of their operations under the close supervision of the officers of the Commonwealth, whilst foreign distillers would not be subject to any such oversight, and we might have all sorts of liquor introduced here from other countries without having any absolute guarantee against its impurity. agree very much with what the honourable imperial or reputed quart bottles, or flasks, the member for Melbourne Ports has put forbottles in each case to be of uniform size. ward, but it is very surprising how careful I would suggest that we should omit the the honourable member becomes when anywords"" and must be packed in cases conthing affecting the local manufacturer crops taining one or more dozen imperial or reup, and how very regardless he is with puted quart bottles or flasks."" respect to the imported article. but the honourable member ought to be just to all parties, and I would point out that vents even the delivery of spirits in loose he supported a proposal in another Bil l bottles, and it seems ridiculous to provide under which we prohibited the importation that a manufacturer who has to make of a certain article, whilst we allowed it to deliveries all round the city shall first put be manufactured within the Commonwealth. his goods into a case in the same way as if I admit that quite unnecessary restrictions they had to be conveyed to another country are provided for in this measure, and these or over a railway. rules were carried the other night in their present form, because, having taken it upon to harass business people by imposing unourselves to place certain restrictions upon necessary restrictions.

When the Minister was asked why this rule was required, he said that it was necessary in order that the public might know the truth. We desire the public to know what they are getting, and only those who desire that the public should have an inferior article should support the amendment. I admit that we cannot make this provision apply to goods from outside, but we shall have an opportunity of subjecting them to similar conditions when the Tariff comes under consideration. If we do not succeed in applying the same conditions to the imported spirits, the Minister has power under clause 80 to vary the rules laid down in the schedule, so as to insure that the local distiller shall not be placed at any disadvantage am in favour of the principle that is sought to be applied by the rule as it stands, and if the same conditions could be applied to imported spirits, I would support it. If the Minister can assure the committee that he will see that the local distiller has fair play, I think we may be satisfied to allow the rule to stand. would be impossible to apply quite the same conditions to imported liquors as to those locally produced, because we shall have no opportunity of exercising supervision over the distillation of the spirits sent here from abroad. The foreign manufacturer might put any lie he liked upon the cases, and we should have no possible chance of checking him. fully in accord with those honourable members who desire to preserve the purity of whatever the public consume, but after consideration of the rule which was amended the other night, I have come to the conclusion that it in no way protects the public, because the mere fact of stating the materials from which spirits may be made affords no guarantee that those spirits are fit for human consumption. There is no such provision as regards imported spirits, and it is very doubtful whether any stipulaI take it that there is tions would be effective, except so far as they might be applied by the different States under their health laws. The case might be met by inserting the words "" and if so prescribed "" after the word "" direct."" That would enable the Minister to act as he might think just towards local distillers according to the provisions that may be made under the Tariff Bill with regard to imported spirits.

Bill reported with further amendments. Minister for Trade and Customs) I move That this Bill be now read a second time. I propose to take advantage of the short time that remains for the' j5urpo.se of briefly explaining a Bill relating to excise. The Bill deals more ptirticularly, so far as excise on a special article is concerned, with excise on tobacco, but it contains a number of clauses of general application which are required in connection with excise, and some of which are familiar, I am sure, to honourable members in other Bills which have lately gone through the House. The scope and object of the B ill is to lay down rules which will apply to the regulation of excise matters generally. Honourable members will notice that the Bill is divided into fourteen parts, the first of which deals with interpretation, and contains the usual provisions. The second part consists of provisions as to administration, and these are based generally on provisions which are to be found in the Customs Bill. The Excise department will be administered by the Minister of State who administers the Customs, and the Comptroller-General will have the chief control of excise throughout the Commonwealth. It is also declarer , that all officers of Customs shall be officers of excise, and all officers of excise shall be officers of Customs. Part III . refers to proto be kept by the manufacturer, and reguducers and dealers, and declares that no person shall produce material, or deal in material, unless he is registered as a producer or dealer. The bare statement of a proposition of this sort, unless further explained, may be somewhat alarming. But the Bill does not apply to ordinary cases of production and dealing, but simply to the production material, "" material "" being defined in the interpretation clause as including all ""material used in the manufacture of excisable goods, and declared by proclamation to be material within the meaning of the Act."" T h a t is practically "" Manufacture "" and "" manufacturer "" are similarly declared to be respectively all processes in the manufacture of excisable goods, and all persons licensed under the Bill to manufacture excisable goods, so that, with respect to the word ""material,"" no one need be the slightest degree alarmed. An ordinary person, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, will not be in the slightest degree interfered w it h ; but it is highly necessary, so far as excisable goods are concerned, that the authorities should have knowledge where these goods are produced, and where they are dealt with, so that there may be some check. That check is effected by securing the registration of those persons engaged in the particular pursuits ; and by the registration certain obligations are cast on them. They are not required to pay any fee for registration, because all the authorities desire to know is the whereabouts of those who cany on those businesses. They are to make returns and give information when desired; and I take it that provisions of this character are necessary, and that the powers can well be exercised without interfering unnecessarily with business'liberty. Then, as regards the licensing of manufacturers of excisable articles, that is dealt with in Part IV . Clause 32 provides that licences to manufacture may be granted by the collector without limitation or subject to any specified limitation. The licensee is bound by the terms of his licence, and there are proper provisions for the saving of State licences until these are replaced under the provisions of this Bill. Security has to be given to the collector for compliance with the Bill, and a licence-fee has 1 to be paid as prescribed. PartV . contains the usual provisions in regard to the supervision of factories, and provides for books lations for factories generally. Part VI . provides what has to be done by the manufacturer in connection with the payment of duty, and the removal of excisable goods from factories and excise control. In Part VII . there are special provisions relating to tobacco, which, of course, it is necessary to include, and which are based mainly and dealing in excisable on existing provisions. In Part VIII . honourable members will find drawback",37,Distillation Bil L
198,The Chairman,,38,Excise Bill Second Reading
199,Mr Kingston (South A US T R A L I A,"provided for. Honourable members will remember we spent a good deal of time in discussing the question of drawback on tlie Customs Bill. That Bill could not provide for drawback on excise duty, because it was a Bill dealing simply with customs matters. In this Bill, however, we have introduced provisions which are practically the adaptation of the customs clauses to excise duty. Clause 72, for instance, declares that drawbacks of excise duty may be allowed on exportation in respect of excisable goods "" in such cases, to such amount, and in such manner as may be prescribed."" Clause 73 makes the provision required by the special circumstances of Western Australia, and the remaining clauses are based on, and almost literally follow, the customs provisions on a similar subject. officers, and relates to their protection. Here, of course, are to be found provisions for the protection of officers pending parliamentary confirmation of action necessary on account of Tariff alteration, similar to elaborating and adapting in the Customs Bill. sions, and Part XL refers to excise prosecutions, and deals with these on the same lines as are followed in the Customs Bill. Part XII . provides for disputes as to duty, and Part XLII . for the settlement of cases by the Minister. Part XIV . deals with miscellaneous matters, amongst others that of prowling for the adjustment of rights, between the parties on a Tariff alteration affecting goods subject to excise. This is done on the same lines as those on which we provided for the adjustment of rights in connection with goods subject to customs duty. given, and in the schedule there are forms and special regulations relating to tobacco. These are the simple heads of the Bill, and I think they are all that is necessary I should deal with at the present time. Granted, as we must grant, that a Bill of this sort is requisite, the simple point remains as to what its precise terms shall be, and that, it seems to the Government, is a matter more fitted for consideration in committee. The sooner we address ourselves to the consideration of the clauses, and complete this, the last of the Bills which Ought to be passed, for obvious' reasons, at the earliest possible moment, the better it will be. I hope that the consideration of this measure will be facilitated by the fact that all of us are familiar with the subject of customs and excise from the experience we have gained this session. The provisions, or most of them, are those with which we are familiar, and which are here adapted to a certain purpose. ThisB i ll will dispose of the question of regulations for the Tariff excise, and will enable the question of excise generally, in relation to any particular article, to be more conveniently dealt with at any moment we desire. think it would be better to postpone the consideration of the second reading of this Bill. I did not receive a copy of the measure until two or three minutes ago. Judging from the remarks of the Minister, Part IX . gives certain powers to the measure is an extensive one, and there may be principles involved in it . It would be only fair for honourable members to have an opportunity to see what the Bill contains, and also to address the House on the question. those we spent some time in We have no desire in any way to obstruct business. discussion of the question to proceed unless the honourable member is prepared to debate the second reading. there is a degree of fairness in the request of the honourable member which I cheerfully acknowledge.

I wish to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs a question in reference to a paragraph which appeared in one of the Melbourne daily papers yesterday, to the effect that the State Government of Victoria, with the consent of. the Federal Government, had resumed the payment of bounties. A long account was given of the various bounties referred to.

Minister for Trade and Customs) -Of course there is no objection to giving the House every information available on the subject. The honourable member's question is somewhat in the nature of a. surprise ; I have not yet had time to consider the matter, and there was not much time for the Attorney-General to communicate with in reference to it this morning. The authority to deal with bounties has passed over to the Commonwealth. That control implies that the consent of the Federal authority is requisite to the payment of bounties by the States. The terms of the Constitution are such that the light of continuance of certain bounties is preserved. The matter of those bounties was brought under my notice, and the consent which was given was to the payment by the State of bounties which it seemed to me were lawfully required to be paid. 1 will look into the matter further, with the object of giving fuller information to the honourable member. to ask the Attorney-General to indicate the order in which business will be dealt with wish to on Wednesdav next.

The imminence of the Tariff discussion, tlie important Bills now before the House, and the addition of one or two others within the next week or so, will occupy all the sittings which the most energetic member is prepared to attend.. The consideration of these motions will require to remain over till that pressure is glad, in what may be called the spare time. I should like to know of the House, to give an opportunity for the discussion of such matters as those brought forward by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, who, on more than one occasion, has gracefully conceded the time which might have been claimed by him for the transaction of public business. The honourable member for Coolgardie will be treated in the same manner. With the consent of my colleague, the Minister of Defence, I shall be glad to lay upon the table the report of the Military Pay Committee. As to the order of business, I may state that on Wednesday next, we shall despatch the Service and Execution of Process Bill to another place. The Distillation B ill merely needs the formal report, and the Customs Bill has been returned to us with a few amendments. them will, I. think, require to be brought under the attention of this Chamber.
