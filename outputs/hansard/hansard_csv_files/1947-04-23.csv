I visited the Cambridge aerodrome for the purpose of inspecting the area, and on my return to Victoria, I asked the Department of Civil Aviation to expedite its consideration of this project. The aerodrome at Cambridge is efficient for the kind of aircraft that we have there, but if the programme of further development is to be undertaken, the decision will be conveyed immediately to the Government of-Tasmania to enable it to proceed with its own programme of road construction, which would be affected by the decision of my department. Prime Minister, in his capacity as Treasurer, a number of questions with respect to Commonwealth expenditure upon education and assistance to the States for educational purposes. What is the total Commonwealth expenditure on education ? How much of this is for reconstruction training of the university type? How much of this is for reconstruction training of the. technical type? How much has been spent by the Commonwealth on buildings and equipment at the University of Western Australia? What is the grant to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research?What is the amount of research grants other than tu the Council for. Scientific and Industrial Research? What is the amount of assistance to students other than reconstruction trainees? What is the amount of loan programmes approved by the Australian Loan Council for the States, and can th* States use this money, or any part of it, for an educational building programme? ber has set me rather a hard task, but the answers to some of his questions come to my mind readily enough because of discussions upon education that have taken place in the Australian Loan Council. Commonwealth grants to the States for education now amount to about £15,700,000. About £4,000,000 is being spent on reconstruction training in universities, and something over £9,000,000 on reconstruction technical education. The amount on the Estimates this year for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is approximately £1,200,000. As for the University of Western Australia, a total of £160,000 has been .made available for equipment and capital expenditure, but I cannot remember the amount for each item. For research work by students other than ex-servicemen Commonwealth expenditure amounts to about £230,000. The loan programmes for the States cover many items besides education, the total amount this year being £32,750,000. A considerable part of that is placed on .the Estimates for education, but is subject to certain arrangements between the Commonwealth Oo-ordinator-General of Works and the State works co-ordinators. I shall prepare a complete answer tp the honourable, member's questions.giving the exact, figures. FOOD FOR BRITAIN . the Prime Minister a. question relating to the surrender of meat coupons with the object of making more meat available for export to Great Britain, I may mention that I received a brief letter yesterday from MrJ G. Plater, of Grafton, in which he said, ""Please find enclosed my moat coupons and see that Mr Chifley forwards that much extra meat to the starving people of Great Britain "". Mr Plater enclosed the whole of his meat coupons up to the end of December. I ask the Prime Minister what arrangements have been made to co-ordinate the activities of departments to facilitate the surrender of meat coupons, such as the Rationing Commission and the Department of Commerce and Agriculture which handles supplies, and whether the right honourable gentleman will make a statement dealing with this matter ? I also wish to know whether, as suggested in letters which I have received, facilities could be provided for the receiving' of coupons in locked boxes at the",12,Civil A Vtamok Transrausxraiia Antcines^ Cambridgj Aerodrome

With respect to the assurance sought that meat, in, respect of which coupons are surrendered, will be forwarded to Great Britain, it must be ' obvious that as coupons are made available to cover the requirements of the Australian people, therefore, when coupons are defaced, destroyed or surrendered, an equivalent amount of meat is thereby.made available for export to Great Britain.

If not, how many are still outside Australia ? Were any of these women released from the terms of their agreements and permitted to stay abroad? who went abroad to serve with the American and Netherlands a-rmies were issued with passports endorsed only for the countries in which they were serving. They were not given general passports because we had no desire to export oar young women to fill clerical positions in -any allied army. We were prepared to give this temporary assistance to our allies, but the conditions laid down were that the women had to come back to Australia after the expiration of a certain time. We have extended the period from time to time in order to help the Americans and the Dutch. Those who are still serving with the Netherlands army are expected to return soon. Many of them have already done so. We have told the Americans that they must terminate the appointments of the various groups as from a date commencing, I believe, in August next. Those in the last of these groups should be hack in Australia by February next. When these people return to Australia they will be at liberty to apply for passports to any country in the world the same as any other person. We are not making it convenient for people who went abroad to serve with foreign armies to obtain passports to go anywhere they choose. In a few instances we have not insisted upon' the return of these young women because they have married abroad and therefore are entitled to clearance passports, as are other persons so circumstanced.

W ill the right honourable gentleman also consider diverting some portion of the -surcharge on petr ol, which amounts to approximately £2,000,000 annually to shire councils so that country roads may be repaired and maintained? financial assistance from tlie Commonwealth to the States, and to some degree to local governing bodies, for the construction and maintenance of roads has been introduced by the Minister for Transport. In addition to the main grant to the States, the bill makes provision for £1,000,000 per annum to be made available to the States for a period of three years for the assistance of shires, municipalities and other local governing bodies on conditions which I understand have yet to be finally determined, but which will generally provide for the construction and maintenance of developmental roads in sparsely settled areas, and in some cases, for the purchase of road-making machinery.. After the expiration of that period the proposal will be reviewed. I see no prospect of anything further being done at this stage.

The Government, because it is terrified of the power of these people, has taken no action against the organization referred to in the report of the Canadian Royal Commission on Espionage as "" The Agent of a Foreign Power "".

63,Mr Abbott,"in proportion to their membership the right list of the chief Communist operatives in t.u sen'd delegations to Australian Labour party the branch. They'areconferences. 'He frankly stated that Communist-controlled unions arc iinvited hy the Australian'Labour -party to become members of its organization and to send delegates to branch meetings and -meetings of district cotmcils. I do not propose to indulge in generalities in order to show exactly what is happening. I shall choose a .particular branch of the Australian Labour party, and show .what 'happened in it'during a period of three years. The branch that I choose is the Katoomba branch in the Macquarie federal electorate, which is represented by the Prime Minister( Mr Mr BruGe Millis, Australian Labour Chifley). I have chosen it because, up to ;i little over a month ago, one of the . the most -active Communist in the Ausdominant branches in the electorate of the .Prime Minister was Communist-controlled. It was deregistered on the '7th March' last, not because it had in its ranks n large number 'of Communists, who held most of the executive positions in it, hut because it had criticized actions which the Prime Minister had taken. The New South Wales State secretary of the Australian 'Labour party, Mr J. Stewart, M.L.C., said that the branch had been deregistered because it had caused friction and was in .an unsatisfactory state. The Prime Minister must have known for more than two years that this branch was under Communist control; nevertheless, lie was content to represent it, to owe his .selection in part to it, and to be elected by its 'help to represent the Macquarie electorate in the Commonwealth Parliament. It is a severe commentary indeed on tlie Commonwealth Labour Govern-nient and the Australian Labour party that they were prepared to allow this, the largest branch of the Australian Labour party in the Prime Minister's electorate, to remain for so long under Communist domination. In 1946, the approximate membership of this branch was 291, and although the number of Communists in it was not known the percentage was probably not more than 10 per cent. Yet those Communists completely controlled the election of officers ,and delegates, and the selection of Labour candidates for municipal elections. I intend to give a Dr. E. P. Dark, the last Australian Labour party president of the branch. Although he may not be an acknowledged Communist, he is closely linked with the party underground, and is of the same type as Dr. Alan Nunn May, according to the report of a Canadian royal commission an ardent but secret Communist. His wife, Mrs. Eleanor Dark, the novelist, also an underground worker -for the Communists. Mr Davidson, ex-Australian Labour party minute secretary, who conducts -a-money-lending business in Katoomba. ' party conference delegate, in many ways tralian Labour party. He was at one time a mercer in Katoomba, but now conducts a boarding house, ""Wykehurst"". 'Phat is the address of other Australian Labour party members. Mr Millis appears to control the local Communist funds. Mrs..Millis, his wife, also is a Com-, m.unist. Mr Andrew Levings, who at one time ha'd a furniture shop at Katoomba, but has since left that town "" for -health .reasons"". He is one of the strange figures in the set-up. I am informed that while he was at Katoomba the president of .the Australian Communist party, Mr L. L. Sharkey, was a frequent visitor at his house, and that the other Communists would gather there, presumably to receive Mr Sharkey's instructions. Mr Frank Murray, who took over Mr Levings' shop. Mr Small, a piano tuner, who resigned from the Australian Labour party some time ago to become presi-dent of the local branch of the Communist party. Mrs. Small, his wife, 'who also resigned from the Australian Labour party and is now openly a member of the Communist party. Mr Peter Carroll, who left the Australian Labour party and openly joined the Communist party a few months ago. He is a truck driver. Mr Apthorpe, who left the Australian Labour party a few months ago and now is in charge of the Communist library at Katoomba. Mrs. Apthorpe, branch secretary, who left the Australian Labour ""party at the same time as her husband. Mr Hal Pratt, a teacher at the Katoomba High School, and an expresident of the Australian Labour party branch. Heis a secret Communist who maintained his Australian Labour party membership to the end. Miss Beth Armstrong, another high school teacher. Mr Toakley, a radio engineer. Mrs. Toakley, his wife, one of the .Australian Labour party nominees for the municipal elections in Katoomba in 3944. Mrs. Kilner, mother of Mrs. Toakley. Mrs. Butterfield, widow of the ex-secretary of the Australian Labour party and a very strong under-cover Communist. This list is not complete, but it shows* that these active Communists dominated this largest branch of the Australian Labour party in the Prime Minister's electorate and were able to secure most of the executive positions in it I come now to the story of the 1944. municipal elections at Katoomba. The branch decided to run an Australian Labour party "" ticket "". -Order! The Chair' has been very generous in having allowed the honourable member to establish a case. He must be aware that he is departing considerably from the motion, which relates to "" the danger of Communist influence upon the Government and the Commonwealth Public Service, including the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research "". The honourable gentleman has been speaking for ten minutes, and in that time. I have not heard any mention of the matters that are referred to in the'motion. If he continues along such lines, he will have to resume his seat. that Mr Ormonde had shown that the on the ground that the Federated Clerks policy of the Government is influenced by what occurs in the unions, and in fhc branches of the Australian Labour party. I was also showing that this Communist controlled branch dominated the Labour organization in the Nepean electorate, and that it must have an influence in shaping the policy of the Commonwealth Government. The only other point that I make is that the Government took no action, although it knew what was happening, because the Prime Minister's organizer, Mr Walford, had resigned two years previously as a protest against the domination of this branch by Communists. I merely wish to add that, right up to the '7th March, this branch was dominated by Communists. minute ago, I told the honourable gentleman that he was out of order. bring to the notice of the Parliament relates to the influence of the Communists, and the attacks that they are making, on organizations in the Commonwealth Public Service. Last year, approximately 4,000 income tax officers were transferred from State positions to permanent positions in the Commonwealth Public Service. Those officers were eligible for enrolment' in Commonwealth Public Service organizations. At first, they thought of forming a union of their own, but were advised that, as there were existing organizations, such action would not be legal and they would probably' not be able to achieve their aim. They decided to join the existing organization. About that time-it was after July, 1946-the Commonwealth Temporary Clerks Association, which is affiliated with the Eederated Clerks Union, found that its strength in the Commonwealth Public Service was declining rapidly owing to the discharge of large numbers of temporary employees who were no longer required because of the ending of the war. The Eederated Clerks Union then decided to enrol the transferred permanent officers in their union. Accordingly, they approached representatives of the transferred officers and suggested that a Taxation Branch of the union should be established. The proposal met with considerable opposi-",19,Communism Formal Motio N For Adjournment

68,Mr Abbott,"The next point that .1Union was controlled by Communists. Ballots were taken in most of the States as to the advisability of joining the Federated Clerks Union.; but only in Queensland was there'an affirmative vote. Despite the fact that the majority of officers were opposed to it , the union took steps' to form a Taxation Branch. A good deal of propaganda was indulged in , and much organizing took place. The union denied that it was Communist controlled. The result was the formation of a Taxation Branch of the Federated Clerks Union, which is now functioning. The union is now attempting to extend its influence into other branches of the Commonwealth Public Service. representatives have approached officers associated with the Postmaster-General's De partmen t, T rans-Australia A i rlines, the Repatriation Department, the Department of Labour and National Service, the Department of A i r , the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, and other government bodies. In the organization of this movement the principal figure in New South Wales is Mr J. R. Hughes, secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the Federated Clerks Union and a leading member of the central committee of the Communist party in that State. The Public Service Association protested against infiltration by Communists, and Mr Langker, appointed to the Public Service Board and was previously general secretary of the Clerical Association and is, I understand, a qualified legal practitioner, expressed the opinion that the Federated Clerks Union could not legally enrol permanent public servants as members. Mr Langker has since made a complete reversal; he now says that it is not competent for the Public Service Board to question the right, of the Federated Clerks Union to enrol Commonwealth public servants. The existing bodies have appealed to the Prime Minister to protect them from this Communist-controlled organization, but up to the present the right honourable gentleman has not taken any action. One would have thought that the Public Service Board would have waited u n t i l either the Arbitration Court or the Public Service Arbitrator had made a decision as to whether a Communist-controlled body was entitled to enrol permanent public servants as members, but so great is the influence of the Communist, party on the present Government, and on Labour organizations generally, that the Government is afraid to oppose communism. I wish now to refer to the appointment of Mr Arthu r William Rudkin to a position in the Council for Scientific and In dustrial Research. In June, 1940, Mr. Rudkin was arrested in Western Australia and later he was sentenced to four months' imprisonment for publishing information which might have been of advantage to an enemy. It was stated in the court that information which he published was Its military information of great value, and was to be conveyed to Mr J. B . Miles, the general secretary of the Australian Communist party, who was to be asked to pass it on to the Communist party of Great Britain. It was revealed that Mr. Miles was in communication with the Commintern in Vienna. It w ill be remembered that, at, that time the Soviet was an ally of Germany because of the "" pact of blood "" signed by Ribbentrop and Molotov. I do not believe in hounding any man merely because he has altered his opinions during the years, but recent writings by Mr Rudkin show that he stall holds Communist views. On page 15 of the October, 1946, issue of Focus, who was recently in an article entitled "" Atomic Crossroad Mr Rudkin wroteNaturally, politicians as dumb as Truman Commonwealth Public Service and Bevin are dumib enough to t r y to use compulsion on scientists, and in an attempt to terrorize them, have imposed heavy gaol sentences on two leading physicists, Dr. Alan Nunn May and Dr. Charles Boyer, for carrying on tlie perfectly normal scientific activity of discussing their work with fellow-scientists of a nation to which Mr Churchill, when Prime Minister, pledged all possible scientific and technical assistance . . . Scientists, in short, are getting tired of churning out discoveries to be used by brass hats, crooked politicians, and mud-brained profiteers for their anti-social ends. When Mr Rudkin wrote that he must have known that Dr. AlanN u n n May had been sentenced to penal servitude for betraying vital war secrets to the Soviet Embassy at Ottawa. He had handed an enriched sample of uranium 235 to the Soviet military attache's representative, Lieutenant Angelov. The sample was regarded as of such great value that Motinov, the assistant military attache, immediately left for Moscow with it . In .September, .1946, Mr Rudkin again published an . article in Focus in which he stated' The only industrial countries one can safely say are not able to produce atomic bombs ' are Britain and Canada, which have introduced 60 much restrictive legislation to preserve the secret they haven't got (Truman accepted all the help he could get from tlie British Empire scientists, but was very careful not to let them into any of the engineering secrets) that they have brought atomic research practically to a standstill in their own territories. able member's time has expired.

It contains these wordsThe danger of Communist influence upon the Government and the Commonwealth Public Service, including the staff of the CSouncil for Scientific and Industrial Research. The honourable member has failed to substantiate his charges, or to give any serious character to the motion which he has submitted'. His first point, was that there is -a danger of Communist influence within the Australian ' Labour party. What did he say in support of that charge? He said' that one Labour league in New .South Wales has members who are, not Communists, but near Communists. In New South Wales alone S.

He does not say that any member of that league is a Communist, M.cEweu, J. but he gives -alist of names of persons Menzies, K.

69,Mr Speaker,Order! The honor,23,Ayjbs
70,Motion (By Mr Mcewen ) Put,"direct eonilict with the policy, platform and constitution ot the Australian Labour party. Membership of the Australian Labour party is attainable 'by every person who supports its 'principles arid 'policy, and who is not a member of any political party, or any subsidiary body connected therewith. It is by membership of the Australian Labour, party alone that a united front can be presented by the workers of -the Commonwealth towards the forces of war and Fascism' and reaction generally. Tliat policy is accepted in every State, and is binding through the Commonwealth conference. It is unfitting that the honourable member for New England should make charges such as we have heard to-day, and thenfail to support ;tliem. What he has said is untrue of the Labour party and.its executive, and -it. is certainly untrue of the Government, the policy of which was accurately stated by Mr Curtin, and has been applied faithfull y by this Government. I was unable to follow the honourable member's argument about the Commonwealth Public'Service. He suggested that the Government was in some way to blame because the Public Service unions organized themselves in a certain way. I know that recently there was a trek to Canberra, of a large number of public servants organized in a provocative way, their purpose being to pursuade the Government to interfere with the process of iu-bitratvion in the Public Service. The Prime Minister refused to see the deputation, and in a pamphlet which was published afterwards he was attacked for having stood loyal to the unions, including the very council to which the honourable member for New England referred. The Prime Minister stood firmly against that attempt by pressure of numbers to affect the judgment of the Public Service Board and the Public Service Arbitrator. All the thanks he receives now is the suggestion by the honourable member for New England that in some way he is -encouraging Communism. He did the very .reverse. Those are the facts. The third matter raised by the honourable member for New England was in relation to employment in the Commonwealth Public Service. That aspect w ill be dealt with by the Ministerf or Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman), who is in charge of the Councilf or Scientific and Industrial Research. However, there are 90,0.00 employees in the service of the Commonwealth, and of that number the honourable member cited one, and only one, employee in support of his arguments-today. Obviously, in Australia, where the Communist party is not an unlawful .association, it w ill have a number of members. Its membership was reported four yeans ago to be 28,000, and since then it has -fallen to .20,000. The probability is tftoart in .all walks of life, not excluding the Commaonwealth Public Service, there will be persons who are in sympathy w i th the Communist party and vote for its candidates, and may even be members of the party. I do not know exactly what policy the honourable member for New England would adopt in this matter. I -know that at the last general elections the Australian Country party, through its leader, the right ionorable member for Darling Downs .( Mr Fadden), .said that if returned to. office it would re-introduce the method of deportation in dealing w i th members of the Communist party. I do not know whether he seriously considered the fact that such action would be of doubtful validity, having regard to the decision of the High. Courti n the deportation case some years ago. I also recall that the leader of the Australian Country party or some members of that p a r t y I do not know whether they included"" :the lionorable member for New England-advocate d 'the banning of the -Communist party which, I suppose, means that membeuship of it shall be illegal and that every one associated with it shall be guilty of a criminal offence. That, I suppose, was the objective of that proposal. Under the Commonwealth's wartime powers, regulations were passed in 1940 declaring the Communist party an . illegal body; but it must not be assumed that anything like that could he done now. However, even the regulations under which the Communist party was banned were subsequently held by the High Court to be invalid. That action was not in relation to the Communist -party, but that party was .covered by the regulations dealt with by the court. It is important to .see exactly what policy the honourable member for New England would adopt. He has a reputation for -liberal views on this matter, and I do -not know whether he would enforce the proposals which I have endeavoured, briefly, to analyse. Those proposals could not be accepted by any democratic government in this country. We told the people at the last general elections that if there were cases of advocacy of violence, prosecutions would have to be made; but I know of no single case of advocacy of violence by any one associated with the Communist party. I am not defending any member of the Communist party in any way, but the honourable member for New England raised this matter recently in relation to security. He was entitled to do so, and his action on that occasion may produce good results so far as. security is concerned. His proposition to-day, however, is different. Taking, it to its logical conclusion, it is difficult to see where he would stop. The attitude of the Communist party towards tlie Government is' illustrated by a sample of the propaganda which that party directs against the Government. In this pamphlet, which was issued by the Communist party, is reproduced a large photograph"" of the Prime Minister which is headed by the caption, "" Wanted Envelopes"". That is a shocking and disgraceful thing, but it shows the Communist party's intense hatred of the Government. There are two extreme views on this matter. First, we have the view of the Communists which the Government repudiates, and in relation to which it adheres to the declaration made by the late Mr Curtin which I have already cited, and the action taken by the Katoomba branch of the Australian Labour party, against persons merely suspected of being members of the Communist Secondly, the Communist party tends to bring into existence trends which are of the opposite character, that is, of a Fascist character. Honourable members need only study the advertisements published in the Melbourne press in relation to communism to .realize, that unless great care is taken there may arise in this country some sort of movement of the character of the "" New Guard "", which would advocate the use of violence and be a danger to the whole polity of this country. the Government has advocated, and has carried into action, the democratic proDr. Evatt. cesses evidenced by the Parliament of this country, to respect democratic rights and to guard the security of the country; and in any case of advocacy of violence appropriate action would immediately be taken. I submit^ therefore, that the honourable member has not shown that any Communist influence is exerted upon the Government. In fact, there is not. There is no influence whatever exerted by the Communist party upon the Government. In some respects, that matter has been dealt with in previous debates. I deny that allegation. The honourable member has not produced evidence in support of it, or any evidence.of any influence by Communists upon . the Public Service. Although there are 90,000 persons employed in the service of the Commonwealth, he cited only one case of a Commonwealth employee being a Communist; and even that case was unconvincing.

I am sorry that the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) was not given the usual courtesy of an extension of time when he was submitting his motion, I am also sorry that the honourable members opposite expended a good deal of time by interjecting because, after all, this is a subject of some importance whether ono agrees, or not, with what a particular honourable member may say. The first thing I draw attention to is that no honourable member opposite ever seems to take party. the trouble to ascertain what the Communist party really is.. The Attorney General (Dr. Evatt) has seen fit to evade that aspect, which is the very nub of the problem. The Communist party is a revolutionary party. Some people call it a political party. They say, "" It is just another political party""; and that is the basis of their approach to it. desire to interrupt the honourable member's speech, but I must remind him that Between those two extreme views, a dissertation on what the Communist party is has no relation to the subject matter of this debate, which relates to the",23,Ayjbs

72,. Mr Speaker,"Order! I do notinfluence of that party upon the Government and the Commonwealth Public Service, including the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research can only understand these matters by understanding the technique adopted by an organization such as the Communist party, which proposes to establish not only a dictatorship but also a small oligarchy, first by the propagation of class war in particular, which has so permeated the Labour movement to Australia's great disadvantage, and by making the Australian democratic system unworkable as the result of strikes and other interferences ; and secondly, by controlling key industries and institutions in Australia and permeating government departments with key men and Communist cell's. The technique is well known; we read about it in books and see it in action in many spheres. Every honourable member is well aware of what the Communist seeks to achieve and what his methods are. When the State is sufficiently weakened by this technique the next step is for the Communist to take over,.by force if necessary. The Communists of Australia undoubtedly intend to use force and to clamp a dictatorship upon this country from which we may never recover. It is also true that the Communist party of Australia is a branch of the Russian .movement. That is made manifest by the spy trials in Canada and the countless pieces of evidence published in reports, one of the latest being the report issued by the House of Representatives Committee of Inquiry in the United States of America. It is said by honourable members opposite as Avell as by "" parlour pinks "" and by fellow travellers that Communism is a humanitarian movement and not a revolutionary movement at all. The fact one should face is that in Australia, as elsewhere] the Communist organization is tough, hard and ruthless and seeks to "" collar"" the government of this country. Its strength is not to be measured, as the Attorney General suggests, merely by the votes its candidates secure at elections. It doe's not submit many candidates for election; its members generally vote for the Labour candidates, but when candidates from both parties contest a seat they exchange preferences. That was done at the last Commonwealth elections and it will be done at the forthcoming New South Wales State elections. It is sheer humhug to claim that there is no association between the Communist party and the Australian Labour party when preferences are exchanged in that way. / candidates oppose the honourable gentleman as they do the Labour candidates? that I am such an important person that I must never be opposed. I have no doubt the same rule applies to the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), as they do not oppose him either. Communist candidates do not go into electorates where they have no chance of success. Where it thinks it has no chance the party submits only token candidates. opponent in Kooyong, and by direction of Communist head-quarters his second preference votes went to the Labour party candidate. associated. If one looks at the Sydney telephone directory one finds that in Sydney, whilst there are only five or six telephone numbers for the Australian Labour party, there are sixteen for the local Communist organization and its affiliated clubs. All the Communist party's propaganda and literature discloses this affiliation. Honourable members interjecting, members must cease interjecting. opposite may not like these facts, and they express their displike for them by constant interjections. But facts cannot beevaded in that way. Having regard to the avowed objectives of the Communist party in Australia, let us look at how itsofficials are employed. Who are the people in control of the big key industries of Australia? We know that the Eederated Iron workers Association of Australia is dominated by Mr Thornton, that Mr Healy is federal secretary, and that Mr Roach is a prominent member of the Waterside Workers Federation.

It is obvious from this list of avowed Communists that the Communist party has achieved its objective of obtaining control of the key industries of Australia. The organization is obviously growing in importance in Australia and'its. members are rapidly, infiltrating Government instrumentalities,' as has been indicated by tKe honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott). During the debate on the Stevedoring Industry Bill honourable members on this side of the House proposed an amendment designed to exclude any known Communists from appointment to public positions of various kinds but it was not accepted'. why the amendment was rejected. opposite obviously could, not reject their friends. able member for Parramatta may not refer to a debate of the current session.

The case he has submitted this morning is such a poor one that it scarcely needs any reply from the. Government. Insofar as. the motion related to the alleged influence of the Communist party on the Government, tlie Attorney-General has shown that the Government is not in any way subject to such influence; that the Australian Labour movement repudiates the Communist party-and' will' not tolerate within, its ranks anyone who is a member of that party. The Government has stood firmly by the principleheld by the Australian Labour movement that any reforms must be made by constitutional means. Wc repudiate any attempt to bring about, reforms by revolutionary means. That is the main distinction. between the philosophy of the Australian Labour party and that of the Communist party. If there be any association between theCommunisi party and any other political party in Australia it is between the Oomm-;..nists One wonders and the anti-Labour parties rather than the Australian Labour party.

However, I shall not waste any more time on that aspect of the matter. I come now to the appointment of Mr A. W. Rudkin, an alleged member of the Communist party, to the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. the Government, the Public Service, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, are being influenced by the appointment of Communists, but the only evidence that the honourable member for New England gave in substantiation of that charge was that, one individual who. was a Communist had been appointed to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the total staff of which is 2,600. ments to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research are, made on the recommendation of the executive committee. It is true that appointments must be approved by the Minister in charge of the. Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, but obviously it would be impossible for the Minister to ascertain the policonstitutional authority for such action. tical affiliations of all the individuals appointed to this big organization. The appointment, of Mr Rudkin was recommended by the executive committee in January, 1945. On that date the members of the executive committee were Sir David Rivett, Dr. Richardson, Dr. Clunies Ross and Dr. White. Will any honourable member opposite suggest that any one of these distinguished gentlemen is associated with the Communist party? The fact is that appointments are made with due regard to the qualifications and merits of the individuals concerned. The committee is not concerned with the political opinions of prospective appointees. Its only object is to appoint the individual best qualified to do a job. As I have said, the appointment of Mr Rudkin was made on the recommendation of the executive committee. recommend Mr Mountjoy? to the executive committee itself are the prerogative of the Minister. That is an entirely different matter. ' When the hon J orable member for New England asked a question about Mr Rud kin's appointment, it was alleged, and subsequently found to be true, that Mr Rudkin had been convicted in Western Australia in .1.940 for an offence under the National Security Regulations. The truth is that at that time, there was a feeling approachI t is alleged that ing hysteria amongst certain members of the community because of the inadequate measures taken in regard to air raid precautions within Australia. Undoubtedly there were many cases at that time in which individuals were wrongfully convicted under the National Security Regulations. There was another case in Western Australia where an individual was convicted and sentenced to six months imprisonment because he had a copy of a Communist newspaper in his possession. The Communist party at that time was a banned organization. Although the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) now says that he does not believe in banning the Communist party, his Government did in fact ban that organization in 1940. Since then, the High Court has ruled that the Communist party was banned illegally because there was no I do not know whether the executive committee of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was aware when it recommended Mr Rudkin. that he had been imprisoned in Western Australia, but in the circumstances, it might have been quite entitled to disregard that fact",27,Ayjbs

[12.25] -We have before us one of the most important bills, which I suppose, could be produced to the Parliament by any government. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) came to light last night with a list of 54 amendments. It is not the first time he has brought down a bill and found the need to amend it, extensively before the second-reading debate has been concluded, b u t ' I think this is the most important occasion. In those 54 amend.. .. ... 36 ments we have some remarkable changes .. .. .. 20 of fron t on the part of the Attorney General. Accompanying the amendments is a memorandum explaining them. 16 According to the memorandum, in amendment No. 3, be is going'to define the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court.

95,Mr Speaker,Order! The Minis,29,Evatt
96,Motion (By Mr Scully ) Put,,29,Evatt
97,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"states that certain things are made clear and in Nos. 38 and 39 that it is desirable that the section should apply in a certain way. In No. 40 he extends the operation of a proposed new section to all employees, not merely to children. That is a sort of juvenile section. In No. 42 he breaks a proposed new section into three, in order, in his own words, to make something else clear. In No. 50 he provides for better co-ordination. In No. 51 it is thought that one of the duties ought to be altered. In No. 52 he brings the bill into accord with the existing practice. In nine instances in this memorandum he -starts off by saying that the amendment is designed to make certain things clear. I say that the amendments are so far-reaching, deep-seated and wide that the proper thing for the Attorney General to do is to withdraw the bill and recast it. Never in my parliamentary career of 20 years have I known of a government bringing down a major measure of this sort, and, before the second reading debate has been concluded, introducing a host of amendments. will remember a similar experience in respect of the Be-Establishment and Employment Bill. remember that. I said that this was not the first instance of this having been done; but it is the worse that I have known the Attorney-General to be guilty of.' We are becoming accustomed to the spectacle of what is believed to be one of the great legal minds in the Common-' wealth drafting legislation of this kind, introducing it in the Parliament with his imprimatur, saying over tie air, in the press and in the House, ""Look at the result of my labour. Here contained in a few printed sheets are the fruits of months and perhaps years of careful study of the industrial laws of the Commonwealth "", and then, before the debate on the second reading ends, coming to light with 54 amendments, some of them of a -major character. If that is the attitude of the Attorney-General on matters like this, what reliance can we place on his second-reading speech? The proper thing for him to do is to withdraw this bill, have it redrafted and reprinted and then come down and make another second-reading speech based on the new terms incorporated in the bill. I do not think this bill will achieve much. I do not think we are going to get much in the way of industrial peace as the result of the passage of this legislation, because I do not think the will to industrial peace resides in the direction and control of trade unionism today. Those of us who were not alive 50 years ago, or were too young to realize, share with the rest as the result of our reading a knowledge of the industrial conditions that then existed. That scene has been completely changed, but, after reading a lot of the remarks of alleged trade union leaders, one would think that the ideas which applied in industry 50 or 100 years ago had been unaltered by the passage of time 'or the intervention of governments. In the old days, we had rampant industrialism, but to-day we have a form of trade unionism which is just as rampant as the unbridled and irresponsible industrialism of 100 years ago. Modern industrial unionism is absolutely sectional in its outlook. In many instances, it is anti-social in its operations. It is militant, and it is party political in a very vigorous, and even offensive, form. Its partisanship is offensive even from the point of view of many of its members. It exists for the enforcement of certain political views upon its own members, many of whom are forced to belong to unions. Under a system of compulsory unionism, we have a state of affairs in which, in certain circumstances, if a man is not a union member he is denied the right to work in a particular avocation. That is absolutely contrary to the ideals of democratic government or of full employment. Democratic government is a subject about which the Attorney-General speaks very frequently without ever going to the trouble of defining it. I am not sure that the right honourable gentleman has a definition of the term. I should be interested to hear him if he would take even five minutes to tell us, in a few concise phrases, just what he does mean by the term ""democratic government"", which he used earlier to-day in another debate. Study his",29,Evatt
98,Mr Fadden,The honourable member,30,Evatt
99,Mr Archie Cameron,"I dostatements though I may-and I hear most of themI am not able to say to myself, "" Well, the Minister's views on democratic government are so and so and such and such"". I have mentioned the anti-social attitude of many trade unions. WhatI have to say on this subject will not be popularly received in certain quarters, but it must be said to the unions before very long. Many trade unions to-day are prepared to cut off power, gas, light and transport services and to hold up supplies of sugar, meat, bread and other commodities, according to their whims and the dictates of the sectional policies that they pursue. Such institutions ought to be under government control, and they ought to be dealt with just as carefully and as vigorously as any trust or combine would have been dealt with by the Labour party 30 years ago, had it possessed the power to do so. I refer now to the political aspects and activities of modern trade unionism. Because a man happens to belong to a 'certain trade union, it does not follow that his political views necessarily must be those of the Labour party, or of the Communist party for that matter. I think that it would be an excellent thing for trade unionism at large if the unions became merely industrial organizations and were prohibited from taking any part in the support of any political organization. That would be a first-class improvement. were originally. To-day I know from personal experience that many trade union members have no more faith than I have in the Australian Labour party and its policy. Nevertheless, they are obliged, virtually by law and by the facts of the situation, to subscribe to the funds of this political party in which they have no faith at all. One of the great . works that the Attorney General could do would be to devote himself to a study of trade unionism as related to democratic government, assuming that he is able to make up his mind about what lie means when he talks of "" democratic government"". I am sure that he would be prepared, after mature deliberation and fair consideration, to agree that a person should not be obliged to give financial support to any political party merely because he happens to earn his daily bread in a certain way. obliged to do that. All sorts of political opinions are represented in the unions. orable member need not think that, because I come from a farm, I am altogether innocent. There is a fairly large concentration of secondary industries in my electorate, including cement works, agricultural' implement factories, woollen mills, paper, mills and saw mills, as well as railways. I know many of the men who work in those places and I know what their political views are. This is a question which the Australian Labour party must face in the very near future, -whether it wants to or not. One of the grievances frequently expressed by Government supporters is that, because the Communists have taken control of certain trade unions, the Australian Labour party has been politically weakened. We have heard such complaints in this chamber time after time. If control of a anion by the Communists weakens the political Labour party, them it stands to reason that, if Communist infiltration had not taken place, that union would be supporting the Labour party, not the Liberal party or the Australian Countryparty. We are all greatly disturbed by the great degree and variety of chaos in the public life of the community due to the . strikes which are continually taking place. I cannot, see anything in this hill which gives me any hope that such strikes will be more infrequent or of shorter duration after the measure becomes law. The whole of the bill merely represents a concession to the extreme left wing of the trade union'movement. It has very little, relationship to the needs and requirements of the community at large. After it becomes law, we shall merely have chaos by conciliation instead of chaos by strikes. In order to prove that statement, I need only refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James). That vociferous gentleman was proud to declare to this Parliament-and we must -take his words at their face value-that",30,Evatt
100,Mr White,That is how the unions,31,Evatt
101,' Mr Archie Cameron,Yes.,31,Evatt
102,Mr Williams,Unionists are not,31,Evatt
103,Mr Archie Cameron,"The honno man would be permitted to be a conciliation commissioner unless he had virtually been chosen by the unions. He said that, if a commissioner did not do what the trade unions expected him to do, there would be no alternative but to remove him from office. In other words, unless these commissioners are selected by the trade unions, or are content to remain willingly subservient to the policy of the trade unions and to have a complete disregard for the rights of the community at large, they will not remain in office. That is a direct and complete negation of everything -for which arbitration and conciliation stand. If we arc to have conciliation with a view to preventing disputes, instead of arbitration with a view to settling disputes after they have occurred, it stands to reason that the conciliation commissioners must take into account every point that will affect the life of the community. We live in a very complex civilization, and at a stage of the world's history when any one industry may throw out of gear the wihole of industrial and civilized life. For instance, the coal-miners, if they wish to go on strike, are entitled to hold up the whole country to very great, inconvenience, extremely serious losses, and, perhaps, even to ransom. They are permitted to say, "" We will not work under the Arbitration Court award"", which is the law of the country. In other, words, they may say, "" We will defy the law of the country"", and at the same time they may declare, "" No other citizen shall be allowed to obey the law of the country "". That is the crux of the matter. I willingly concede the right, of a person to say, "" I disagree entirely with the Arbitration Court's award. It is no good to me, and I am not prepared to work under it "" . That man, in any democratic community, as I understand the meaning of "" democracy "", should have the right to say, "" This award, these hours of labour, these conditions of employment, and these wages do not suit me, and, therefore, I am not prepared to continue with the -job "". That man is entitled to seek other employment. But I do not concede the right to any section of the community to say. "" We are not satisfied with this award, we refuse to work under it, and, in addition, we are not prepared to allow any other person to work under it "" . That is one of the most undemocratic and anti-social actions that could be ta.ken by any body of men. Yet that action is taken day after day by unions, often, I am satisfied, with the support and the connivance, and, in many instances, I think, at the instigation, of men who are in the dual position of leaders of trade unions and Ministers of the Crown, sometimes in the Commonwealth and sometimes in. the State spheres. The Attorney-General .should be one of the legally-minded men in this chamber. As a. former member of the High Court Bench, he should have a very great respect for the law. He should ensure that the law is respected and obeyed. If the Government encourages or permits a condition of affairs in which men are allowed either individually or in the mass to disregard and defy the law, this disobedience will extend to branches of the law other than industrial law. It is only a small step from one to the other. This state of affairs has existed for a long time. We are living in a period which, in my opinion, is the worse in the history of the Commonwealth for industrial strikes. I admit quite frankly that I was one of those who in 1940-41 considered that, in certain circumstances, the Labour party in office might be able to obtain from organized industrial labour in war-time a degree of obedience which might not be conceded to a government formed by the parties which now constitute the Opposition. In that, I have to admit, I was wrong. The Labour party was not able to get any better production, any improvement of discipline, or any superior industrial leadership because of its political views than were the governments led by the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and the leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden). Industrial labour appeared to take the stand that it at last had friends at court and might be able to browbeat and perhaps blackmail them into doing things for them that they were not prepared to ask of another government. In other words, industrial labour thought that it might get, and I believe that it did get, from the Labour Government, certain terms and conditions that it did not have the hardihood to submit to a government composed of the parties which now constitute the Opposition in this Parliament. Out of that, we have witnessed a steady development and increase of the downright arrogance of some trade union leaders who have come here .repeatedly and issued virtual ultimatums to the Prime Minister of the day in his own office. Yet they were not shown the door! accepted, if not as friends, then perhaps as masters who came to collect the rent or to see whether the Parliament was functioning properly. From that, it was only a small step to the introduction of this bill. Silting suspended from, 12.k5 to 2.15 p.m. the suspension of the sitting I said that we the brink of the precipice, never quite did not know whether the amendments before us were the result of certain investaining his grip on the ground. Although tigations by the Attorney-General or whether pressure had been brought to bear on the Government. I believe that our, arbitration law is due for a thorough overhaul, but, it does -not get it in this measure. One of the most wicked things in the community to-day is the differentiaremarks on industrial arbitration until tion in rates of pay as between people who are members of unions and associations and those who are not. For an illustration of that we do not have to go outside Parliament House. If men are members of certain service organizations they get certain rates o.f pay, travelling allowgreat deal of extraneous matter has been ances, and so forth, but if they are not they receive less remuneration and smaller travelling allowances, although they may be doing identically the same work. I think that is a shameful proceeding. I think that if the Arbitration Court is to be of any benefit to this community the time has come when it should be treated differently from the ordinary courts. Its functions are not legal in the ordinary sense; its object is the promotion of peace in industry, and its entire efforts should be directed to that end. Therefore, the old practice of a complaint being made to tlie Arbitration Court by certain bodies with an application for a certain award should cease. The Arbitration Court should make an award for an entire industry covering everybody in the industry, so that all will be bound by, and entitled to the benefits of, it, whether addressed themselves to this question, is they happen to be members of trade unions or not. The principle under which the King's subjects are divided into two elements introduces one of the worse examples of class distinction which we could possibly have in the coni^ munity. That principle is unjustifiable, outmoded and indefensible. The arbitration machinery will have to be overhauled to remedy these grave defects, but They seemed to have been the present Government is too reactionary and conservative in outlook to indulge in anything like that.' The Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward), who now appears to be getting ready to reply on behalf of the Government, is one of the worse reactionaries on the Government side. .

Most members of the Opposition have availed themselves of this opportunity to vent their spleen and antagonism on the organized workers of this country. I do not know whether the honourable member who has just resumed his seat himself recognizes the fact, but he has often 'advocated fascist methods in dealing with trade unions in this country. It was the Fascists wbo first introduced the idea of government-controlled trade unions, and that is what the honourable member has sugge'sted this afternoon.

105,Mr Ward (East Sydney,"Ministe rOpposition ( Mr Menzies) has admitted that there is need for reform in regard to our arbitration machinery. He admitted that the present system was not the best that could be devised. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), when he was Minister for Labour and National Service, convened a conference which was presided over by Sir George Booby, then Chief Judge.of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, to consider means to streamline our arbitration machinery. Therefore it is quite evident that most members of this chamber recognize the great need for improvement in our system of arbitration. The objections of tlie Leader of the Opposition to the present measure were, first, that it was going to destroy the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court, secondly, that Labour governments would appoint conciliation commissioners not because of their particular qualifications for the positions but because of their political affiliations, and, thirdly, he complained that there was no provision for appeal against decisions of the conciliation commissioners, and finally he said that there would be no unanimity in their judgments. With regard to the last criticism, one of the amendmentscirculated is evidently designed to overcome, that difficulty. The amendment provides for the appointment of a chief conciliation commissioner with a view to securing some degree of unanimity in the awards of the commissioners' awards. Several members of the -Opposition said-and the Leader of the Opposition repeated several times in his speech-that they are not opposed to sinei's provided the right men. are appointed-meanin g no doubt that as long as the Opposition parties can secure the appointment of individuals who are prejudiced and biased against the organized workers of this country they have no objection. In support of his argument the Leader of the Opposition quoted as an example of the danger of appointing as commissioners men qualified only by practical experience in industry paragraph 7r. ,of the report of Mr believe that the anti-Labour parties give Justice Davidson who conducted an inquiry into the coal-mining industry, which readsHowever honest a .person may be he cannot Latham was appointed to his present avoid a bias in favour of .the workers position in order to create a vacancy in amongst whom his life has been spent. tice Davidson's comment, is it not equally obvious that men who have had long association with employers' organizations, chambers of .manufactures and commerce and, in some cases, direct political association with anti-Labour forces would have a prejudice even though in some cases it may be unconsciously against the workers of this country? I sincerely hope that those appointed to these positions will be men who have had practical experience in industry and association with workers' organizations, men with a sympathetic approach to the problems of the workers. Honourable members opposite have impliedly suggested that men who have been associated with anti-Labour movements and who hold anti-Labour views forget their preconceived bias and become completely impartial the moment they are appointed to judicial positions. I should like to mention merely one or two of such appointments in this connection. The present Acting Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court, Judge DrakeBrockman, was for many years an anti-Labour senator in this Parliament. I have gone to the trouble of examining some of the speeches he delivered in the .Parliament and I could not find anything in them to suggest that he was in any way unbiased or impartial. The late Judge Dethridge was president of an employers' federation, and had not demonstrated any .impartiality in his consideration of the claims of workers, prior to his elevation to the bench. Then there is Sir John Latham, the present Chief Justice of the High Court. When I first, entered this Parliament, Sir John Latham was a member of one of the anti-Labour parties. I consider that there has been no more vicious or prejudiced anti-Labour advocate in this Parliament than was the present occupant of the Chief Justiceship ' of the High Court. The mere manner in which he secured elevation to that position would, in my opinion, lead many people to very great weight to a person's associations and opinions when they are filling such important positions. Sir John this Parliament, so that the present",33,Evatt

I recall that Sir John Latham on one occasion, as a member of this Parliament, saidTlie independence of the judiciary is essential to the preservation of our national and individual liberties', and it is upon the independence of the judiciary that the just and non-political interpretation and just administration of the law depend. The juc'^es, when they are appointed, take an oath to administer the law without fear, favour or affection. I say that I agree that the acceptance by a Cabinet of political direction regarding appointments to the' judiciary is unsound and strikes vitally at the authority of the court.

Meanwhile, the peradvised the whilst the percentage for rent has inIn the crease. It would appear that, according to functions, be tied to the principle upon which it was should he left exmuch the productivity of industry may have sinGe increased. Thef u l l Arbitration Court itself has expressed the opinion that some of the matters which it is to-day called upon to determine ought to be determined by the Parliament. I believe that that point was niade.by the Leader of the Opposition. E have discovered that the late Sir George Beeby, in the course of an inquiry in respect of the basic wage, saidWe have clone tlie lieat we can in the circumstances tu find the minimum standard for the community. But we have no rules to show what share of total production should go in wages, in profits, and public services. Doubtless, the court considered that it was seriously embarrassed and restricted in its approach to this problem by the fact that it had had no guidance from the Parliament. The very basis upon which the wages of workers in industry are determined has been altered by anti-Labour governments. Higgins, in the Harvester judgment in 1907, saidThe provision for fair and reasonable treatment is obviously designed for the benefit of the employees in the industry; and it must be meant to secure for them something which they cannot get by the ordinary system of bargaining with employers. The standard must, therefore, be something else, and I cannot think of any other standard appropriate than the normal n«eds for each employee, regarded as a human being, living'in a civilized country. That principle has been departed from Arbitration Court judges based their decihonorable gentleman to tell the House of sions on the requirements of existence in a any instances in which dividends and civilized community, an anti-Labour goprofits have been closely examined by the vernment changed the law and made court, or of any attempt to decide whether decent existence dependent upon the capaan industry could afford to pay them.

Therefore, fact is that the courts have invariably whether or not industry can afford to pay accepted evidence submitted by employers is a matter to which the court should that the industry could not afford to pay devote its attention; and, in the past, the higher wages.

Would any one argue to-day that a radio set is not a necessity in every home ? Honourable members opposite may say that more cannot be.taken out of indust r y than is put into it . I have heard -that argument many times. Those who advance it say that wages must have some relation to the capacity of the industry to pay. But when the court is determining such -matters, why is it that only the wages of the workers are determined on that basis? The' workers in The late Mr Justice an industry receive a portion of the value of its production in the form of salaries and wages.

Mil illustration to support my argument iiappened in connection with the Bellambi Coal Company. That company had a capital of £225,000 in 190S. B y 1930 its shareholders had capital amounting to £520,000 returned' to them. That is to say, they received in return practically original capital. ""When the company was £130,000, and its reserves were stated to be £118,000. Eor a number of years that company paiddividends as high at 17-J per cent., notwithstanding that practically twice its original capital had been returned to the shareholders. Some of the gentlemen now occupying high judicial positions revealed their attitude towards the workers prior to their elevation to such high offices. The present Chief Justice of the H i g h Court, Sir John Latham, when referring to the Premiers plan, said in this ParliamentI accept the necessity for the reduction of governmental expenditure proposed in the hill. I do so under each of the headings mentioned, salaries, wages and pensions, including the maternity allowance which, although not a pension, is an allied payment, and also invalid and old-age and war pensions. These payments were fixed on a prosperity basis, and we cannot afford to keep them up in the present difficult -time. My objection is that when the occasion is considered opportune, the people who believe that expenditure should be reduced always commence at the bottom by suggesting that budgets balanced not by a reduction of dividends and profits payable to the wealthy section of the community but by making a direct a ttack on the wages of the workers. The Leader of the Opposition also complained that there was not sufficient provision in this legislation to discipline the workers, whilst the honourable member for Fawkner placed in the same category men who had committed breaches of the industrial law and those who offended against the criminal laws of the country. honourable member's statement -was that passed workers should be classified and dealt, with as criminals. That -is the unsympaAs thetic approach of members of the Opposition to this problem. I draw attention to what I shall now deal with the charge that workers frequently defy the orders of the court. They are not the only section of the community to do so, nor are they the only persons dissatisfied with decisions of the court. penalties existed for breaches of the law reconstructed"" its capital was' should apply equally to all offenders. who was regarded as a fair-minded, member of the Bench of the Arbitration Court, gave to the builders' labourers a working week of 44 hours. Later he gavea 44-hour working week to the miners at BrokenH ill and to the timber workers.. The employers became alarmed, and Higgins must be curbed. As they were not able to remove h i m fro m thebench they arranged to have the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration 'Act amended to make it necessary for the F u l l Court, to deal with such mattersas the fixing of standard hours. That action shows that even when a judge of the court is prepared to adopt a sympathetic attitude towards the claims of the workers in industry anti-Labour forces are prepared to go to any lengths to prevent him from continuing to give decisions not acceptable to them. I shall again refer to the period covered by the Premiers plan. The Commonwealth Arbitratio n Court had to deal with should be a claim for a reduction of the basic wageBy some peculiar reasoning, the 'courtdecided that an all-round 10 per cent, reduction of wages should be applied notwithstanding that the basic wage was the minimum fixed by the court itself. When the workers attempted to have the wage restored -at a. later stage they .were not completely successful.

Most of the workers at that time were not much concerned, because they believed that it would apply only on works which were initiated for the alleviation of unemployment. the Minister to declare any work to be a relief work, and once that was done he had authority to determine what wages and industrial conditions should apply. The anti-Labour Government in New South ""Wales extended this principle beyond what could be regarded as unemployment relief works. For instance, the Metropolitan ""Water Sewerage and Drainage Board persuaded the M in ister to declare one of its normal undertakings a relief work, and when the workers received their wages the following week they received relief rates only, not -award rates. The union took the case before Mr Prybr, the industrial magistrate, who found in favour of the workers. However, the employers appealed to the Pull Court, which declared, that the Minister had authority to declare any work a relief work. If that Government had remained long enough in office all government and semi-government undertakings in New South ""Wales would have been operating under relief conditions, not as the result of an order of the court, but on the order of the government itself. In 1927, Mr Justice Piddington conducted an investigation of the basic wage, and he recommended a substantial increase. However, the workers did not obtain the increase. judge issued his determination setting forth what he regarded as a f a ir and reasonable wage, there was a storm of protest from employers organizations, which declared that the payment of the higher wage would cost so many more millions of pounds, and that industry would crash under the burden. The workers are the only section of the community who have ever had their awards determined on the basis of the ability of industry to pay. I now propose to quote certain statements made by anti-Labour members in this Parliament which make clear their attitude towards any suggestion that the workers should receivef a i r treatment. A former member for Gippsland, Mr Paterson, who was a member of the Australian Country party, said that it would be necessary to have many of the harassing restrictions on the employment of labour set aside, and to allow employer and employee to make their own arrangements. Everybody knows However, the act empowered what would happen to the workers during a period when unemployment was prevalent under a system of that kind. In March, 1932, Mr Thorby, who was an Australian Country pary candidate at the last election, saidRather must wo as a Parliament and a nation provide employment in reproductive avenues where labour can be economically and profitably ueed, and endeavour to increase the exportable production of the country. It would be desirable to remove many of the legislative restrictions placed upon those engaged in rural industries. We all know that maiiy primary producers refrain from employing outside labour because of those restrictions, so that production is either diminished or the maximum result is not obtained from their holdings. It may be necessary for our governments to agree temporarily to suspend the operations of legislation such as the Hut Accommodation Act. the Workers' Compensation Act, the Child Endowment Taxation Act, and the Rural Workers' award. According to him, all forms of protection which have been granted to the workers by Labour Governments were to be swept aside. able member for Balaclava ( Mr White), speaking on the 17th of March, 1932. declared-and I quote from Hansard. page 1275. . Immediately the It would be better if the basic wage provision of the industrial awards did not operate until . the workers reached the age of 23 or 25. At the same time the frills of Arbitration awards might be laid aside.

The bulk of extraneous payments should be wiped out. He now criticizes this Government because it wishes to amend arbitration legislation so as to make a more realistic approach to the problems of the workers.

But, at least, we propose to appoint, conciliation commissioners who will he practical niGn. On the admission of the Leader of the Opposition, they will be able to go right to the root of industrial problems, and because of their knowledge of industry do much to maintain industrial peace.

The workers of this country do not want bias; they want only justice. They have not received justice in the past. One thing which the Government accomplishes under this measure, and upon which I compliment those responsible for drafting the bill, is the decision to establish a Bureau of Research and Statistics which will enable the conciliation commissioners to be armed.with all the information which has been accumulated over many years.

Much has been said during the debate in respect of the intentions of the Government in this matter. I make it clear that it has been, and still is, the policy of the Labour party to prevent and settle industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration. I am firmly convinced that this bill to amend the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, a statute which has already been amended on fifteen previous occasions, will give to the workers and the community in general something for which they have been asking for a number of years. Australia to-day is far more highly industrialized than ever before. tion of this country has progressed to a stage which would not normally have been tries have created new problems.

In that industry I have witnessed the trials and tribulations that have confronted the .workers from time to time. It employs the greatest number of workers engaged in any single industry in South Australia. I have before me a list of the awards governing more than 233 classifications of workers and fixing no fewer than 34 differing rates of -pay in that industry alone. When we consider the implications of figures of this kind we must visualize the necessity for a closer view of the anomalies that must crop up in an industry governed in such a way. Claims have been made during this debate that no unwarrantable delays have occurred in proceedings before the Arbitration Court. Honourable members on this side of the House knowfull well that the greatest factor agitating and irritating the minds of the workers is the long delays that take place between the presentation of a case and the issue of the final judgment of the court.

Thus, for more than two years the workers in the industry concerned waited for the judgment with what patience they could muster. The' workers in that industry stood solidly behind the principle of conciliation and arbitration and were made the victims of circumstances. Workers in other industries who took direct action to gain their ends were given precedence over those who allowed the law to take its course. I trust that as the result of the appointment of the fifteen conciliation commissioners that anomaly will be obviated. The conciliation commissioners will have a great responsibility to the whole community. I have no doubt that men selected for appointment will be possessed of the qualifications necessary to carry out their task. I know of one gentleman who is atpresent acting as a conciliation commissioner in South Australia who is spoken of most highly by every industrial organization in that State. I am convinced that in the Australian community there are other men of equal ability. Fear has been expressed by honourable members opposite that the G<.ernment may appoint to these posts staunch supporters of long standing in the Labour movement who may not be capable of giving unbiased judgments. It is my belief that in the trade union movementare to be found many men eminently capable of filling these positions with disa half in the eastern States. If the court has tinction. Over a. long period the union of which I am a member paid large sums of money in obtaining legal advice as to the best methods of presenting its claims to the Arbitration Court. After reviewing the position, the union made it possible for its secretary to become its court advocate. In that role he was most successful in having the claims of the organization met. That gentleman is now a member of the Senate. Some time before this bill was brought before this chamber it was stated frankly by captains of industry and by industrial officers attached to important industries in South Australia that more round-table talks and less legalism in industrial matters would go a long way towards the prevention of industrial disputes. I do not regard .all employers as hostile to the principles for which we on. this side of the House so assiduously strive. I have in my own electorate employers who share with their employees the profits of their enterprise. Many of these employers have expressed a keen desire for an extension of the system of round-table conferences as a rapid means of ironing out industrial differences. I recollect an occasion when, in the course of an inspection of an industry generally, a judge of the Arbitration Court paid a visit to the undertaking in which I was employed. I could not help feeling that that, gentleman did not have sufficient time at his disposal to survey the industry fully, but was required to rush through it. That, is a difficulty that will be overcome by the appointment of conciliation commissioners under this legislation. 1 am confident that the speeding up of hearings that will result from these appointments will ensure to industry, generally a far greater measure of peace than exists to-day. I was interested to watch closely the course of the case that came before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in South Australia recently, involving a claim by transport workers in respect of penalty rates for week-end work. The following newspaper report refers to the court's decision:Only the f u l l Arbitration Court can clarify the Saturday rates question. A t present' i.t appears that railway and tramway employees in South Australia are to get only time and a quarter for Saturday work, againet time and actually created this serious anomaly it should at least say why. The reason for the court's decision was obvious. In New South Wales and Victoria, where Labour Governments are in office, the claims of transport workers in regard to week-end work were not opposed, but in South Australia, where the Playford anti-Labour Government is in office, the claims were opposed. The interview ' of th§ South Australian Premier with the Acting Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court was an amazing incident. It was followed by the announcement that if the employees refrained from striking and the conciliation commissioner recommended the payment in .South Australia of the same rates as were awarded to employees in Victoria and New South Wales, the South Australian Government would urge I he commissioner to grant this concession. Apparently the Premier of South Australia believed that he had a right to approach the Acting Chief Judge in regard to this case. But what would have -been the reaction of the press of Australia if the secretaries of the unions covering the transport industries had sought a private conference with the Acting Chief Judge? It would have proclaimed that the court had given way to pressure by the unions. On this occasion, however, we were told under great headlines of Mr Playford's dramatic appeal to avert a strike of transport workers. before have I seen such a glaring case of an individual setting up. a straw doll merely to knock it over. It is not strange that, in the Spates where the claims of the transport workers were not opposed by the governments concerned, they were granted, whereas in the State where they were opposed, they were refused. As one who only four years ago worked side by side with industrial workers in this country, I say without hesitation that Labour still adheres to its traditional policy of conciliation and arbitration. tralia to-day there exists a state of affairs' which honourable members opposite said could never exist, namely, full employment. When a community is fortunate enough to enjoy full employment, many people are apt to forget the benefits that have accrued to them as the result of conciliation and arbitration. concerned about this matter. should unemployment return to this land -it will not return so long as Labour occupies the treasury bench-there will again be a full realization of what the workers owe to conciliation and arbitration. If they are obliged to go cap in hand to the employer, with the Arbitralion Court dispensed with, their position will be disastrous. Abolition of arbitration is, I believe, the objective of the 'Communist party of Australia. party is alined equally with the Liberal party and the Australian Country party against the Labour party. I know that, because I was opposed at the last general elections by a Communist, and Communists stood against Labour men at the last genera] elections in South Australia. I hope that when this bill becomes law it Mr Sheehy. .will be given a fair trial and that the workers and their leaders will realize that the Government has adopted a measure by which it considers that the court can give to them a speedier hearing of their claims in the order in which they are lodged. I hope, too, that the trade union movement will allow to_ unionists the right of hearing claims in order of lodgement. As one who has worked under the present 'arbitration system, I consider this a. splendid attempt by the Labour Government to.give to the .people of this country what must be given to the people of all countries-the right of every Never section of the community to receive justice. I congratulate the Attorney General and the Minister for Labour andNational Service on their having prepared this bill. The responsibility devolves upon the conciliation commissioners and the industrial organizations to make die ^legislation effective. and Minister for External Affairs) [3.27] -in reply-The debate on the second reading has occupied a fair amount of time and I wish to make my In Ausremarks in reply as brief as possible. Still, the bill is of such importance that, it may help to clear up some of the difficulties of honourable members if certain points made in criticism of the bill are dealt with. First, despite acute differences on certain points, there seems to me to be a substantial agreement I am most -in the House. It is agreed, for instance, However, that the present arbitration system does require a complete overhaul. It is also agreed that .more expedition and fewer formalities in the hearing of cases are required. The differences of opinion are mainly concerned about not ends but means. The. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), in his analysis of the problem, put the view that the improvevent should lie rather along the line of enlarging the judicial element of the That present system, but, later in his speech, he frankly conceded that it might have been better if from the first it had been realized that industrial arbitration is not strictly a judicial matter at all but rafher & matter of the exercise of administrative discretion and therefore not peculiarly appropriate for the exercise of the judicial power of the ' Commonwealth. It",41,Evatt

That is why we propose to appoint more conciliation commissioners and to give to them greater powers and functions. Of course, there is the other point of view on which there is an acute difference of opinion, that is, the suggestion that the punitive and coercive or disciplinary provisions of the hill should be extended. The Government's view of that has been stated quite frankly. mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition in his speech were contained in substance in the legislation that existed before the Scullin Government's amending legislation of 1930 was introduced. At that time there was a Labour majority in this House and an anti-Labour majority in the Senate, and, practically by agreement, for there had to be agreement, because the two Houses were differently constituted, the penal sanctions of the character referred to by the Leader of the Opposition were omitted. For many .years thereafter, although anti-Labour governments ruled in this Parliament, they were never reinstated. The Leader of the Opposition made those proposals at the last general elections and the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) refused to accept them. I submit that it is a f a ir conclusion that the people are not in favour of restoring those penal sanctions. The Government's proposals rest on the or a bush fire extinguished, before it passesimportant differences between the ordia State boundary, so may a. two-State dispute nary judicial functions of courts and the be "" prevented"" from existing as a two-Statefunctions required for successful conciliadispute. tion and arbitration. I do not think that That is why, in the bill, we amplify prethe main difference has been sufficiently vention of disputes, to include; as the appreciated in some of the speeches. Leader of the Opposition rightly pointed: In 1918 Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr out, a situation, likely to give rise to a. Justice Rich made that difference the dispute. He quite rightly observed too ground of their decisions They pointed that that might increase the matters to be out that when parties went to courts of dealt with. It gives the conciliation comlaw for rights they asked the courts to missioner jurisdiction to deal with -a> enforce existing rights. They had a matter before it has crystallized as a disclaim for damages for a breach of pute. Althoughi t w ill increase the numcontract or a tort and they asked bers of matters which have to be confor da-mages. The law existed' before, sidered, that should in the. long run they went to the court. In the A r b i prevent disputes from materializing or tration 'Court they asked the court not to crystallizing. declare rights but to make rights, to give now rights. So the function of the A r b i tration Court is rather administrative and legislative than judicial. I think too expressed that there is this important difference; once we recognize that the Arbitration Court has quasi-legislative functions, we have, I think, to realize increasingly that the industrial situation is dynamic, never static, and that the court, in settling each, individual dispute, has to take a long range view. Mr Justice Higgins emphasized from the first that there should bea gradual improvement and strengthening of the livin g standard of the workers in industry. Again, the courts, unlikeThe proposals the Arbitration Court, cannot deal with, the matter until their jurisdiction is invoked. This bill is based on the theory that the court or a conciliation, commissioner should act before the situation: develops into an acute industrial disputeSo the main function of a good portion, of this bill is the provision of machinery to prevent disputes, arbitration being held, in reserve if the dispute develops. I quote from a famous judgment ,of Mr. Justice Higgins dealing with preventivelogislationAs disease may be dealt with by way or prevention as well as by way of cure, so a dispute may be dealt, with by way of prevention as well as by the way of settlement. t assume that the evil to be cured-o r prevented -is a dispute which extends in fact into morethan one State. It is only those disputes with which the Australian Parliament is concerned hecontinuedBut just as n disease may' be stamped out, NowI shall deal w i th a point that has been emphasized throughout the debate, namely, the criticism of those honorable members who want'to preserve the right of appeal to the court from a decision of a conciliation commissioner. proposal cuts across the scope of the bill. of the conciliation commissioners under this bill subject to appeals to the court, that would cause far greater delay than occurs under the present system. The essential point is that, under the bill, the conciliation commissioners will deal with two broad matters-margins, -conditions of work in an industry-the court having exclusive jurisdiction over the matters of standard hours, the basic wage and other matters. What is the position under the present Commonwealth law? The Pull Court, determines any alUvration of standard hours or of the basic wage. In any given industrial dispute, the matters at issue can be divided into four categories, namely, standard hours, the basic wage, margins and the -classifications in relation to margins, and conditions within an industry. broadly, are the matters dealt with in any .award of the court. At present, a single judge deals with margins and with conditions within an industry, leaving the -other two basic matters to the full court. There is no appeal from a single judge to the Full Court. All that this bill provides in relation to margins and conditions of labour is that the jurisdiction -of a single judge shall be vested in a conciliation commissioner. Moreover, under the present law, there -are many cases in which the functions of judges of the court and cou-ciliation. commissioners overlap. -court and the commissioners split up the work to be performed, and the way in which the machinery works causes many -delays. Under the law-as it, stands, the court refers matters to conciliation commissioners, sometimes to be heard and determined and sometimes to be reported upon to tlie court. If a conciliation commissioner hears and determines a matter -and makes an award, that award is subject to an .appeal to three judges under certain conditions. If he merely reports back to the court-a single judge in that event-the accept the report or hear the whole matter. This system gives rise to delays. I emphasize that these delays are due to Dr. Evatt. the system and are not the responsibility of individual persons. ThatI shall give only two illustrations of such delays. A little more than a year If we should make decisions ago, the court referred to a conciliation commissioner for report only a dispute between the Shipwrights' Union and an employer. It arose from the alleged suspension or dismissal of certain persons concerned in the management of the union. The conciliation commissioner and made a report, to a judge suggesting certain terms of settlement. The judge refused to accept the report, and there was no further hearing of the matter at that stage. The dispute dragged on for a considerable timeI think it was twelve months-befor e the matter had to be taken up again by ""a conciliation commissioner. It was then settled on almost exactly the same terms as the commissioner had originally recommended. Under the system that we now propose to introduce, the commissioner would not have been a mere reporting authority but Those, would have been authorized to determine the dispute, and he could have dealt with the .matter within a few days. Mr BE ALH -The right honourable gentleman will agree that that was an unusual case. honourable member a little later. Eirst, I shall give another illustration of the delay that occurs under the present system. In June, 1941, there was a dispute involving pit timber workers in and around Newcastle. It was notified to the court, under the industrial peace regulations The and was immediately referred by the judge to a conciliation commissioner for investigation and report. The commissioner reported on the 25th June, 1941, eleven days later, and the judge made an interim award but referred the matter to another conciliation commissioner for further investigation. After further hearings the matter was eventually referred by the judge to a conciliation commissioner, not for a report, but for hearing and determination. That was on the 16th December, 1942. The commissioner'made his award on.the 21st Decemcourt must either ber, five days later, and on the 6th January, 1943, the employers gave notice of appeal to the Full Court. The appeal was heard in January, 1943, and the final",43,Evatt
120,Dr. Evatt,"I shall reply to thejudgment was given by the Full Court on the 2nd February, 1943. Thus, the commissioner's functions were invoked in two ways-first , merely to report, and / secondly, to make an order settling the dispute. When an order was made, it was subject to appeal. The appeal in this case resulted in a. final decision being given nearly twenty months after proceedings had commenced, following two references for investigation to conciliation commissioners, one determination by a judge, one determination by a conciliation commissioner, and, eventually, an appeal to the Full Court. That does not describe the normal working of the system, but there have been many similar instances of delay. These delays are not due to anything more than the machinery provided in the statute. In referring to the statute, I do not speak of the industrial peace regulations which were introduced by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) as a .member of the Menzies Government, and which simplified a great deal of the court's procedure. Acurious fact is that under the statute, tlie ponrt must have cognizance of a dispute and a commissioner may act in such a dispute only at the direction and under the authority of the court. Having acted, he may either report to the court or decide the matter. If he decides the matter, his decision is subject to an appeal to the Full Court. Irritating delays and disappointments are inevitable under that procedure, no matter how promptly each individual step may be taken by the person concerned. The system provides opportunities for passing a matter to and fro between the court and a commissioner. This bill not only permits but also reC|i.iircs a conciliation commissioner, on his own responsibility, to take every possible, step, as soon as he becomes aware of a situation that might breed a dispute, to get to the source of the trouble. He will be able to give a decision on all matters that come within his jurisdiction. For that reason we do not want, and it would be wrong, to have an appeal from the decisions of a commissioner to the Full Court. The bill will merely replace the jurisdiction of a single judge of the court in relation to margins and conditions with the. jurisdiction of a conciliation commissioner. The Full Court will retain jurisdiction over standard hours and the basic wage. Since the bill was introduced in this House, because of its importance, members of the Government, particularly the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) and myself, have considered suggestions that have been made for its further improvement. Some of the suggestions emanated from honourable members during this debate; others were by men outside the House, including judges of the Commonwealth and State arbitration courts, conciliation commissioners, industrial inspectors, and people practising in and acquainted with this very difficult jurisdiction. We have considered all the suggestions very carefully, and have applied to them only one test: Will the adoption of any proposal help to carry out the general purposes of the bill, namely, the expeditious and effective working of the new machinery? It is for that reason that numerous amendments, with a full explanation of their purpose, have been circulated among honourable members. A perusal of them will show that, apart from three or four matters which were referred to during the second-reading debate, such as the appointment of the chief conciliation commissioner, these amendments are for the purpose of clarification, and to improve procedure and machinery. The debate has revealed the necessity for closer co-ordination of the work of the conciliation commissioners, and one of the functions of the chief commissioner, under one of the proposed. amendments, will be to organize and distribute the work among his colleagues. That, in turn, will make for uniformity of approach among the conciliation commissioners. In addition, conferences between the Chief Judge and the conciliation commissioners will be called three times a year. The original intention was that they should be held half-yearly. Those conferences will be particularly necessary in the early stages. The bill provides that the chief conciliation commissioner shall report annually to the Parliament on the operation of the act. All the amendments should assist in meeting at least some of the possible difficulties to which honourable members have referred in this debate."" The bill, in its present form, reproduces the provisions of the existing law, with some amendments directed mainly at giving to the court power to initiate proceedings in relation to discipline. That should be done. In my opinion, this should not be a matter of political responsibility. The supreme body should be the court itself. honourable gentleman also retain that power as Attorney-General? ber for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) will refer to the existing act, he will find that the Government has no power, except in connection with the basic wage and standard hours, to intervene in the court. ney-General take the necessary power? is removed from initiation by a political officer, who is also a legal officer, the better it will be for the working, of desire now to. correct a statement by the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), who said that the bill overrides the provisions of the Re-establishment and Employment Ac-t, which give preference to ex-servicemen in obtaining employment. The opposite is the truth. The honourable member for Richmond was the victim of a double error. First, section 24 of the Re-establishment and Employment Act has express overriding po.wers. Sub-section 1 of section 24 applies to all Commonwealth laws and industrial awards, whether they were made before or after the passing of the act. . Then, again, the provisions in relation to preference apply to the exclusion of every other similar provision in any law of the Commonwealth or a territory of the Commonwealth, or any industrial award, order, or determination whether made before or after^the section came into force. stance of sub-section 2 of section 24 of the lie-establishment and Employment Act. will agree that by subsequent legislation, such as the Stevedoring Industry Act, that position could be altered. provisions together, I contend that the preference provision in the Re-establishment and Employment Act will not be overridden by this legislation. Secondly, the first schedule of the bill provides that the existing provisions safeguarding ex-servicemen shall be retained and extended to ex-servicemen of World War II . I refer honourable members to section 107 in the memorandum which reproduces the proposed act as it will appear when the amendments proposed by the bill have been incorporated. It readsNothing in any award or order made under this Act or in any agreement relating to industrial matters, shall operate to prevent the employment of a person who is required to be engaged in employment under section twenty-seven of the Ke-cstablishment and Employment Act 1945. It amends provisions o.f the existing Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act in order to give the benefits of the provisions in the existing law to those our industrial machinery. I entitled to benefits under the Re-establishmeht and Employment Act. Consequently, a double protection is afforded, first, in the Re-establishment and Employment Act in its proper interpretation, applying, as it does, to awards made .after the act came into force, and secondly, in this bill. That brings me to the last point that I desire to make. All honourable members .will agree that this is the crux of the bill. Nearly everything will depend upon the suitability of the conciliation commissioners who will be appointed. The qualifications are not merely formal, technical or professional. As honourable members have pointed out, they require an experience of industrial problems, the capacity for judging those employed in industry and bringing them together, a sense of fair play and justice, and a grasp of what is practicable. The Government will search for men possessing those qualifications for appointment as conciliation commissioners. To one remark by the Leader of the OppoI am giving the subsition, the Government is entitled to t;ake the strongest exception.

The Leader of the Opposition replied, "" No, it is not the judicial positions. These are not judicial positions "". Theref ore, I turn to the appointments which the Curtin and Chifley Governments made to the positions of conciliation commissioners. One of the positions has MurrayM . 'Stewartf o r many years.

Not -only those two gentlemen, but all the conciliation commissioners have done their work w it h exceptional ability and impartiality. It has been assumed too readily that there are to be fifteen vacancies to be filled with new appointees. That is hardly likely to be the position. Without elaborating the matter any further at the moment, I point out that the present commissioners w ill be eligible f<»r appointment, and I know of .none I.53]' against whom the slightest complaint has been made. The Government realizes that the success of this plan depends very largely on the success of the individual commissioners. They, must be persons who w ill make the system work, and to a great degree the future of industry w ill depend upon them. What an opportunity they w ill have, by reason of their ability and their knowledge of particular industries, to further industrial peace and to extend the sense of social justice.

But they also include some major matters, which will come before the committee for discussion for the first time, 'because they were not originally in the bill and have now been introduced as supplements to it. In these circumstances, it seems to me a most extraordinary limitation of the rights of private members, and particularly of the minority in this House, that it should be 1 found necessary at this stage of the sessional period-, in relation to a bill of this kind, to declare the -matter one of urgency and to act accordingly, whereas -le t us face up to it-quit e plainly, nothing that the Government has done or has failed to do in the last twelve months has ever before given the impression that it considered that any industrial problem in Australia was urgent. another attempt by the Government to curtail debate in this House by applying the "" guillotine''. If there is one act for which the Government has become notorious, it is the act of curtailing debate in Government has, I believe, a recordor a near record majority in the Parliament, yet it is constantly employing the force of its numerical superiority, not merely to carry the legislative proposals that are brought before the Parliament, but also to prevent the depleted ranks of the Opposition from debating the issues that those proposals involve. There seems to be no issue which cannot be made the victim of the ""gag"", or some other action, by the Government. able gentleman is not entitled to discuss the general subject of the ""gag"". The question is, whether the proposed allotment of time is adequate. nent to the use of the "" gag "". I am submitting that the proposed allotment of time is not adequate, and that no allotment would be adequate which prevented members of the Opposition from giving full expression to their views on legislation which would have such far-reaching effects upon the whole of the economic life of Australia as will this so-called arbitration measure. The proposal that honourable members on this side of .the House shall be denied the opportunity to debate some of the principles which it is intended shall now belatedly be incorporated in the bill, is indefensible. The measure itself, apparently, is so involved that the whole array of legal talent in the Attorney-General's Department, not to mention that of tlie right honourable gentleman himself, has been unable, until the last month, to discover that it -had no fewer than 54 deficiencies. If the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) and his officers can now find in the measure deficiencies which require 54 amendments, after they have had months, if not years, to consider the necessity for some alteration of the arbitration machinery of this country, then there certainly can be no justification for arguing that many deficiencies do not still remain in the measure, not to mention many injustices which could be revealed only by a full debate by honourable members on this side of the House. I put it to the Government, not in any expectation of its acceptance of my views, but for the purposes of record, that it will not enhance this Parliament. The what remains of its prestige by using its numbers constantly to prevent full debate in this Parliament. I realize that debates here do not alter the substance of the legislation introduced by the Government, because once proposals to be submitted to. the Parliament have been accepted by caucus any further discussion is academic, and the Parliament becomes merely a debating society. Nevertheless the Opposition intends to employ whatever opportunities are left to it to reveal to the people of Australia not only the deficiencies and injustices of the Government's proposals but also the constant use by the Government of every device sanctioned by the Standing Orders to prevent the Opposition from debating matters in this chamber. The time allotted is entirely inadequate. Indeed, any. schedule designed to curtail debate would be inadequate. I enter an emphatic protest against the proposal before us.

How has it become urgent ? .1 recall that not long after the session commenced in November, 1946, a bill to amend the existing arbitration legislation was forecast. Indeed, many members expected that it would be introduced .and dealt -with before the end of that year. Apparently, the legislation was not urgent then, but now, after nearly four months of 1947 have passed, it suddenly becomes urgent. No Minister or supporter of the Government, can say that -the Opposition has adopted obstructive tactics in debating the measure so far. Honourable members generally have dealt with the bill seriously 'as, indeed, its importance to the economic life of Australia demands. Although .many speakers on both sides of the House have emphasized that the proposals before us constitute a radical departure from existing arbitration practice the Parliament is expected to treat it as a matter of urgency, reasons have been advanced for declaring the bill to be an urgent measure. Among other things, the bill provides for the appointment of conciliation commissioners, but can it be shown that anywhere in the Commonwealth industrial disputes await settlement because no suitable officer, whether a judge of the court or a conciliation commissioner, is available to deal with them? Of course not. Eor several months the metal trades dispute has dislocated industry and there have been stop-work meetings of various kinds. Yesterday work on the waterfront was held up because of a. stop-work meeting of tally clerks. ber's remarks have nothing to do with the allotment of time which is the subject before the Chair. already declared the bill to hean urgent measure and, therefore,-the question of urgency does not now arise. A schedule allotting certain times for dealing with various portions of the measure is before the House, and I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the schedule. Mr Holt. M>r. BOLT -It is extremely difficult for 'honourable members to say, at 'this stage, how adequate the times stated in the schedule will be to deal with a large number of amendments. is the question before the Chair. the Government to say that he has considered the proposed amendments one by one, and understands their effect on the various clauses of the bill which they seek to amend. Yet the Parliament is asked to accept a limitation upon its right to discuss those amendments thoroughly. It may be that some of the amendments are of a machinery character, but others may he of major importance. I repeat that at this Stage no Minister or honourable member can say whether the times shown in the schedule will be adequate to enable a full discussion to take place. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) has given notice of 54 proposed amendments to a bill which the Government has had under consideration for months. Opposition members desire to submit other amendments, which they regard as vital. notwithstanding that no We on this side believe that the bill, is bad in principle, but we are prepared to submit amendments which will improve it. However, I expect that the procedure adopted in connection with the Re-establishment and Employment Bill and banking legislation will be followed on this occasion, and that little or no opportunity will be given to the Opposition to submit amendments. The only amendments which will have a chance of being agreed to will be those submitted by the Minister; and they will be rushed through without proper consideration being given to them.

In the light of statements by the AttorneyGener&l and many Government supporters that the arbitration system has broken .down, the bill demands careful consideration of every .clause.

147,Mr Archie Cameron,"A littlecould profitably spend six to seven hours discussing some of the major Government amendments, and it is possible that the Government would then be so impressed with the Opposition's arguments that it would agree to three or four additional amendments. I protest .most vigorously against the Government's proposal to curtail the time for consideration of the hill in committee. I am not concerned with absent friends overseas', as is the honourable member for' Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), but I protest most emphatically against the limiting of the time for consideration of this bill in committee. I have made a rough calculation of the time which will be availa rule, in order to obtain an intelligible able to honourable members, and it will be all too short; that is, unless we continue sitting until 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock in the morning, a practice which I deprecate. I have observed that during late sittings the debating strength and brain power of honourable member? on both sides of the House is at a low ebb. It is necessary that honourable members should be alert when considering a bill in committee, not half asleep as they are during late sittings. If we begin the consideration 6f this bill in committee at 4.30 p.m. to-day, and the House adjourns at 11.15 p.m., the actual sitting time will be four and threequarter hours, allowing for the suspension for dinner. To-morrow, Friday, the time available will be two and a half hours as we are to rise at 3 p.m. and question time must be considered. On Tuesday next, the actual sitting time will be approximately six hours, and only on Wednesday will there he a full working day of eight and a quarter hours, the time for this debate terminating at 30.45 p.m. Thus, the actual time available for considering the bill in committee will be less than 24 hours altogether. The Government itself has circulated 54 proposed amendments, and if the Opposition moves their share, there will be less than one quarter of an hour for the consideration of each amendment. Under the Standing Orders, every honourable member is permitted two fifteen-minute periods to speak on each clause, or amendment to a clause. Therefore, what chance will honourable members have to exercise 'their right under tbe proposed time schedule? Only one fifteen-minute speech could be made on each amendment, and it would not even be possible to hear a speaker from each side of the House. I protest against this ridiculous time limit. It is not right that a democratic institution like this Parliament should agree to a proposal for the restriction of debate on important legislation. seems that this Parliament is becoming less and less a deliberative assembly. Under Labour governments, the practice is that a bill is thrown on the table, the Minister mumbles a few words, or reads them, and we must turn to the press, as summary of what, the 'bill is about. In the case of major bills it has become the practice for the Minister in charge to declare that no amendments will be accepted, meaningthat no amendments will be accepted from the Opposition. Such announcements have been made by both the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman). In other words, what the Minister says is, "" Tinmatter has been decided in caucus. Our masters, the representatives of the militant unions, have been here, so what you say does not matter."" We were told that no amendments to this bill would be accepted, but now a small volume of them has been brought down by the Government itself. Indeed, when I saw this sheaf of amendments I thought it was a new bill. The amendments appear to be just so much mumbo-jumbo. I am sure that no one understands what they are all about except, perhaps, the Parliamentary Draftsman. Now it is proposed to stifle debate in committee. Perhaps it does not matter much. It is certain that this measure will not prevent industrial disputes. The Opposition might, perhaps, have fought a delaying action on the bill, and that is why the Government proposes to limit debate. The Government, fearful that it will not be able to get this piece of class legislation through, has introduced the "" guillotine "". Well, the writing is on the wall.

The time proposed to be allotted for further consideration of the bill is, I repeat, totally inadequate. honourable members opposite are prepared to waste time as they are now doing honourable members on this side of the House will be prepared to accommodate them. Earlier to-day the time of the House was wasted debating a ridiculous adjournment motion moved by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott). submit, Mr Speaker, that any motion which you considered worthy of being debated by the House could not have been ridiculous. I consider a motion to be ridiculous; I merely rule whether a motion proposed is, or is not, in order. ence that the House does its best work when a time limit is placed upon debates. If honourable members opposite are genuinely anxious to give of their best in considering this bill, they will marshal their points beforehand and, in the time proposed to be allotted, will have adequate opportunity to put them forward.

The chief objects of this Act are(/*} to constitute a Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration having exclusive jurisdiction in matters of law arising under this Act and limited jurisdiction in relation to industrial disputes; and the Opposition) [4.51] I move That, in proposed new section two, paragraph (/), the words ""exclusive jurisdiction in matters of law arising under this Act and limited "" be loft out. The effect of the amendment is that paragraph / would then read(/) to constitute a Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration having jurisdiction in relation to industrial disputes; and 'Phe words already in the bill are designed to set a limitation on the function of the court in favour of the power of the conciliation commissioners. I have presented the amendment in this form not because this is the operative part of the b ill but because I do not desire to move a series of amendments which w ill lead to repetition of argument. If the principle is not accepted propose to come back to it later. The point I raise is this: Should the A r b i tration Court, as a court, be confined, as it is to be under this bill, to the determination of certain questions of law, which may or may not be submitted to it by the conciliation commissioners, and to the four matters that we have discussed a ' great deal during the second-reading dehate, namely, basic wage, standard hours, minimum female rates and annual leave? A t the present time the court, through its various judges, has complete jurisdiction to deal with all industrial disputes which f a l l within the Constitution and the act and of which it obtains cognizance under the machinery set up by the act. has already been said in the course of the The second-reading debate, I merely say that the judges should not be excluded from what are called general arbitrations, and that failin g the acceptance of that argument they should certainly not be excluded from exercising the power of appeal from the conciliation commissikmers. Let me take these two things in their order. I have stated that in my view the most effective way of overcoming any delays that exist in this jurisdiction would have been to appoint more judges. The Government has rejected that view and has said that the effective way is to l i m it the authority of the judges and to appoint more conciliation commissioners. That is a neat issue which we need not debate any further. The appointment of conciliation commissioners and the conferrin g upon them of exclusive authority -that is to say, authority exclusive of the judges on ordinary matters of industrial arbitration-wil l in my opinion mean that we shall have very little concerted action. We shall probably have their view of common principles and we shall certainly not avoid the creation of a host of anomalies-and the creation of anomalies as between industry and industry, between group, and group, and even between individual >and individual, as the whole of our industrial history shows, is one of the most f r u it f u l causes of industrial discontent. It is only a few weeks since we discussed the^ Stevedoring IndustryB ill , which was designed to establish for the stevedoring industry a body that was to act primarily at this stage I do not as an industrial tribunal. When Judge Foster inquired into the waterfront industry it was put to h i m by the unions concerned that he should recommend a tribunal of which the chairman would not be a judge but a conciliation commissioner. Judge Foster refused to make -such a recommendation, and the Government, I thought, had taken a rather similar view because, as honourable members w ill recall, section 6 of the Stevedoring Industry Act states that the chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission shall be a judge of ' t h e Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, or a conciliation commissioner appointed under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. So, on that occasion, only a few Without repeating what weeks ago, the Government said, in effect,",55,Pairs
166,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Leade r of that the question whether the chairman should he a'judge or a conciliation commissioner would be left open; but now, it seems to have veered right round, because it is saying, "" This arbitral jurisdiction is not to be exercised by a judge, except in relation to certain matters "". In the Stevedoring Industry Commission Act, standard hours and the basic wage, the two great matters that arc reserved to the court under the present bill, were also reserved to the court. The Stevedoring Industry Commission had to deal with industrial matters other than those two great things, while the Government reserved the choice of a judge or a conciliaas the interpretation of some agreement tion commissioner as chairman. But in this bill, the conciliation commissioner occupies the field, and the judge goes out. brought some pressure to bear on the Government. with that question now. I am merely pointing out, as I believe I should, that there is something here that calls f oi an explanation; that there has been a perceptible change of approach to this problem. Whilst that is not a question of great moment-so fai» as I am concerned tlie Government is entitled to change its mind on these matters-ther e is at least an inconsistency in public policy that deserves some attention. So much, for giving power direct to the judges to act as arbitrators. The second aspect of the matter is whether the judges should be excluded from .appellate powers except on matters of law, or, to put it in another way, whether, if the court"" is not to have what I have called original jurisdiction over industrial matters, it should exercise appellate jurisdiction over industrial matters. Should one be able to take an important determination by a conciliation commissioner, affecting perhaps the whole of a vast and important industry, to the Arbitration Court on . appeal ? Many honourable members will feel that one should be able to take such a matter to the. Arbitration Court and to determine whether or not it is right. It is necessary to have a glance at the power that these conciliation commissioners will exercise. A conciliation commissioner will deal with the whole problem that comes before him. A dispute having been brought before him, he will say first of all, "" HaveI . jurisdiction to deal with this? "" The bill clearly contemplates that he will determine that question as a preliminary. That is partly a question of fact, and as all our industrial history of the last 30 or 40 years shows, it is also, on occasions,. an extremely difficult question of law. Having answered that question in the affirmative, he will proceed to deal with the dispute. In doing so, he will consider not only all the questions of fact involved, but also all the questions of law involved. Questions of law such that has been made or the bearing of some State or Commonwealth law on what should be done are involved in many .disputes. The conciliation commissioner may if he wishes decide each of these three matters -the question of jurisdiction, the question of fact and the question of lawin his own fashion, and at his own sweet will and then make his award. There can be no appeal. If he feels that he would like the assistance of the Arbitration Court on the question of jurisdiction he may refer that matter to the court Similarly, a question of law may be referred to the court but, of course, he can not send a question of fact to the court unless it also involves a question of jurisdiction. The point is that unless the conciliation commissioner chooses to consult the court in that fashion, he will be the final arbitrator on these matters. tion commissioner need' not accept the court's view. been circulated dealing with that point, which was raised by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) and by myself. My opinion is that it will meet the objection to which we drew attention. The point I am making is that, a conciliation commissioner cannot be compelled to send these matters to the Arbitration Court. That is an enormous jurisdiction. I emphasize to honourable members that a man who is empowered to determine first that he has jurisdiction to deal with a dispute in relation to an industry that has say 30,000, 40,000, or",56,Pairs

The Attorney-General in his reply to the second-reading debate said with great force-and my own opinion is to the same effect-that if we were to have a universal appeal from industrial decisions, we might find our appellate tribunal completely cluttered up. That is why I began by saying that the real remedy for the present state of affairs was to appoint more judges and to let them exercise the functions of adjudication, because then we would have individuals, fully armed both in law and in facts, deciding these matters, working closely together, regularly associated in the Full Court, and working on a general body of principles and so preventing anomalies from arising. There are one or two other aspects that I have noted, but as they will arise on a later amendment, I shall not refer to them now. 1 have explained the real purpose of the amendment that I have moved. I have moved it at this stage because in this clause is to be found the first reference to the matter, and it is convenient to have the question debated ndw, once and for all. The clause does raise sufficiently the question whether the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration should be confined to jurisdiction in certain matters of law arising, and to its limited function in, relation to the few matters referred to, or whether it should have a general jurisdiction, both legal and arbitral, in relation to all matters that arise under the act. That is why I have moved the amendment in its present form. and Minister for External Affairs) [ 5.4] I shall not occupy much of the time of the committee on this matter because the point that has been raised by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr delays. I illustrated that in my speech Menzies) occupied the attention of the House to a substantial degree during the second-reading debate. But I should like to say just a few words about it. The Leader of the Opposition's purpose in moving this amendment indicates two things. The first is that the remedy for delay or any improvement of the arbitration machinery should be by an increase of the number of judges rather than the appointment of conciliation commissioners with the powers that this bill confers. The second is that, in any event, assuming that conciliation commissioners are to have jurisdiction over margins and conditions in industry, there should be an appeal. I think that would bring about delays even far greater than occur under the present system, because to-day all matters of margins and conditions go to a single judge, not to the three judges. The Full Court deals with the basic wage and standard hours. There is no appeal to the Full Court from & single judge on those matters. There may be a reference, but the practice is that the decision of the single judge completes the matter. The bill allows'jurisdiction to be exercised in the same way by a conciliation commissioner, so I submit that once we assume the plan of the bill the argument for an appeal is extremely weak. An appeal would increase delay to an incalculable degree. So the real purpose of tlie amendment is to indicate formally the preference of the Opposition for an increase of the number of judges with jurisdiction conferred on them as under the present act. What the Leader of the Opposition said about the Stevedoring Industry Act is correct. We have reserved the power to appoint either a judge or a commissioner, chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. Judge Foster recommends a judge and, as I told honourable members during the debate on that legislation, the Government intends to appoint a judge, if that can be done, and-1 am confident that it can be. This proposal is not a departurein policy or inconsistent with the. proposal' for the stevedoring industry. The conciliation commissioner system already exists. We have eight or nine conciliation commissioners exercising jurisdiction, but exercising it in a way that by the very nature of the system, causes m reply to the secoridrreading debate.",57,Pairs
171,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Attorney-Genera lThe judge asks a conciliation commissioner to report on a matter. The report goes to the. judge. He may or may not 1 accept the report. He may hear the matter himself or subsequently decide to remit it to the commissioner for hearing and decision-the e hearings. After that itmay be brought to the Full Court.. I do not wish to repeat the broad difference of our approach. It is not as though the judges will not continue to perform important functions under the act. They will perform the full functions of the determination of standard hours, the minimum wage, and annual leave and will have jurisdiction on all questions of law referred to them by the conciliation commissioners' and on questions whether there is-an industrial dispute so that ths conciliation commissioner may exercise jurisdiction. We have not made it manda toii-y for the commissioner to refer those matters to the judges because, in practice, if animportant, point arises, reference will be made. If we made it mandatory in every case delays would be interminable. I think the Leader of the Opposition has stated ' clearly from tholegal point of view and. from the point of view of his party the differences of approach. It is a matter of opinion as to which would make for greater efficiency:. I repeat that everything, will depend upon tlie qualifications of the commissioners-appointed to exercisethis important: jurisdiction.. If-they are of the quality which characterizes the present commissioners' I believe that; the new procedure will make for more speedin arbitration. -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr justice perpetrated on either the employer Menzies) has raised an important point and the explanation made by the Attorney-General (Br. Evatt) does not take away one iota of the force of his remarks. Indeed, the mere fact that the Attorney General has agreed with the submission of the Leader, of the Opposition that the Government intends, notwithstanding the power under the StevedoringIndustry Act to appoint a layman or a judge as chairman of the' Stevedoring Industry Commission, toappoint a judge is an admission that thepointsmade by the Leader „of the Opposition are strongin fact and substance. The Attorney General 'has the opportunity to give effect in this bill to; the principle that he intends to give effect under the Stevedoring Imdustry Act. He 'has said,, in effect, "" We recognize that a lay chairman, of a commission of that type will not be able to determine points of fact and law conjointly, and, .therefore-, we will not take the risk of appointing a layman,, because thei Stevedoring Industry Commission is too important and valuable a 'body, and we. propose to appoint as chairman a judge, who will be able to consider points of. law as well as fact"". The Attorney-General has given added point to the submission of the Leader of the Opposition Dealing with the points made by the. Leader of the Opposition about the right of appeal, the Attorney-GeneEal said, "" We do not think anappeal is. necessary, because it may delay decisions that may be made by the conciliation commissioners "",,but what, he did. not say was that the: present-day conciliation commissioners; have not the powers that are proposed, to. be given to the commissioners to be appointed under, these amendments. Under this legislation a conciliation commissioner is to be all powerful in his own sphere. It is proposed that the-conciliation commissioner.; will be given control of certain sections of industry. Will' a conciliation commissioner be empowered; in theevent of adispute; to considerall the ramifications of sectionalized employment in one industry? If he is,, questions of law must be involved, 'and, when they are and he failsto make a reference to theArbitration Court, because of thepossibilityof d'elay, hetakes the rislfc and may makean unjust, decision-, notwithstanding the inor theemployees; and therewill be no 1 appeal. That consideration must underlie the decision of the Attorney-General on the chairmanship of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. The possibility of an injustice being'dbne by lay chairmen has prompted him> to sa-y; "" An injustice, must not be allowed to. be done to a militant union^ because it. will take power into its own hands ,, as. it has done"". 1 Therefore, he: has deaided not to take a risk in this regard, and willappoint a judgewho-will be able to make his decisionsimmedSiaitely, knowing the law, and",58,Pairs

However,, he will deal with other unions', the members of which aire equally as important as the waterside workers , though perhaps not so militant; 1 by appointing as conciliation commissioners men who are untrained in law and have no experience of its operation, instances, may also lack experience of industry. We know how this Government has made public appointments in the past, and we fear that it will give these rich political plums to its friends. Therefore, there is a danger that the conciliation commissioners will have a partisan outlook and will give decisions that favour the unions. Of course, if the appointments were made by a government of another political colour, they might have a tendency to lean towards the employers. In view of the risk of injustices occurring in this way, there should be a right of appeal from decisions of the conciliation commissioners. Other unions may not be so militant as the Waterside Workers Federation, but they are untitled to have the same treatment as that organization. The proposed amendment, is sound, and it is in-conformity with other proposals that have been accepted by the Attorney-General. I cannot understand why he refuses to make the practice in this regard uniform throughout the industrial system. -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr This amendment has two objects. First, Menzies) submitted his amendment in a very helpful manner in a.n endeavour to secure uniformity of practice in the field of arbitration. He pointed out the inconsistency between the provision in the clause now before the committee and the provision contained in the recently passed Stevedoring Industry Bill, and I was amazed at the Attorney-'-General's reply to him. The Minister said that the chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission would he an industrial authority which differed from a conciliation commissioner appointed under this bill. The chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission will have the same powers as will be vested in conciliation commissioners appointed under this measure, and he may be either a judge of the Arbitration Court or .a conciliation commissioner. The Minister's refusal to agree to the amendment reveals a complete change of attitude. He has said that delays may be caused if matters of law have to be referred to a judge. However, as the bill stands', it will be possible for the fifteen commissioners, being without legal training, to givefifteendifferent and who, in some interpretations of one law. That will only make' confusion worse confounded. There will be no law a.t all if eachconciliation commissioner is able to give his own interpretation of the law. The conciliation -commissioners should be obliged to submit questions of law to the Arbitration Courti f any of the bodies appearing before' them, desire that such action be taken. This would ensure consistent interpretations of the law by judges of the court. The Attorney-General has already assured us that he will alter the original provision that a conciliation commissioner need not accept a decision of the court regarding the interpretation of the law . He would do himself, and the 7 Government, a good service by also accepting the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition.

The Arbitration Court will act as an appeal court, for instance, from a magistrate who might make an order for payment of wages or in .connection with some class of award. Secondly, the amendment defines the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court so as not to include any matter as to which the High Court has original, as distinct from appellate, jurisdiction under the Constitution.

The first Yes . It is a matter of is that in which "" industrial dispute"" means. . . a dispute (including a threatened, impending or probable dispute) as to industrial matters which extends beyond the limits of any one State. The second includes. . . a situation which is likely to give rise to a dispute as to industrial matters which so extends. This is not a' mere matter of words. The power which this Parliament exercises is a power to make laws with respect to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. The definition in the. original act was a "" threatened, impending or probable dispute "". The idea was that a condition of affairs might arise indicating an interstate flare-up, such as a group of men on strike in one State, and demands being made in another State, which might give rise to difficulties, and that at some point of time the Arbitration Court, subject to correction by the H i g h Court, might say, "" Th is has all the earmarks of a threatened, impending or probable interstate dispute of an industrial kind, and, therefore, we .can deal with it "" .

178,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Leade r ofgo through all the stages that produce an interstate dispute. Let us treat' it in the early stages"". But, however much I approve of that method, it does not fit very easily into the structure of the constitutional power. The constitutional power is to deal with industrial disputes, and if the definition of ""industrial dispute"" includes the earliest stages of matters which exist in only one State and which might grow, .and conciliation commissioners deal with them, prohibition proceedings might be taken successfully in the High Court, because the matter is beyond the constitutional power of the Commonwealth. In that event, industrial arbitration, so far. from being assisted, will receive a setback. Many workers will say, "" This is a trap. We have observed this act. ' Industrial matters' has a very wide definition, and, therefore, we requested a conciliation commissioner to proceed to a factory in New South Wales or Victoria. He exercised his jurisdiction, and now we find that it is all wiped out by a legal decision "". That legal decision cannot be avoided by any provision that we insert in this bill, because it is a legal decision which will depend, not upon an act of Parliament, but upon the Con'stitution. That is a great difficulty. Having matters of that kind in mind, I , on behalf of my colleagues on this side of the chamber, made a certain observation during the debate on the Constitution Alteration (Social Services) Bill last year. Honourable members will recall that we were ""then discussing a proposal to extend very greatly the industrial power of the Commonwealth Parliament. I had been ""making a speech in which I attached importance to preserving conciliation and arbitration. Without recapitulating the subject unduly, I remind the committee that the great controversy at that moment was whether the Parliament should have power to deal with these industrial matters by direct enactment, or whetherit should be required to deal with them through the conciliation and arbitration machinery. When referring to that speech for the purpose of verifying my own words, I found that, in the course of the discussion as reported in Hansard of tbe 3rd April, 1946, page 905, 1 saidIf the Government had desired to preserve arbitration, but to get rid of technicalities in the arbitration jurisdiction, and to pave the way for the most flexible and simple machinery, surely its right course would have been, not to write in this new power, but to amend paragraph (xxxv.), so that it would read "" conciliation and arbitration for the settlement of the terms and conditions of employment in industry "". In one hit, all jurisdictional difficulties would disappear. I remind honourable members of that, because I believe that it is completely true. Had that proposal been accepted, the argument which I have just been advancing would be irrelevant, because we would then be able to give to "" industrial matters"" any definition we liked, and proceed to deal with localized industrial troubles, so long as we dealt with them through conciliation and arbitration and not by direct parliamentary provision. I have not risen for the purpose of moving an amendment, because I am reluctant to take any step which might suggest even to somebody who wanted to. misunderstand me that I believe that the powers of the court should -be confined to full-fledged industrial disputes. Nobody who has had experience of these matters will say for a moment that the only price of peace in industry should be a first-class preliminary war in industry. That always seemed to me to be a mutual contradiction. Therefore, a reasonably wide interpretation of "" industrial matters "" is good. I rose really to offer the warning that this definition is so wide that it may easily include a number of matters which come into conflict with the Constitution. If it does, we shall have trouble, bitterness, disappointment and misunderstanding. All that is a very good reason why full provision should be made in this bill for the exercise of authority by the judges upon matters of this kind, which they are so much more fitted to understand and deal with than the conciliation commissioners possibly can be. and Minister for External Affairs) [5.33] -This variation involves one of the most important principles of the bill. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) correctly pointed out that bad the constitutional power of the Commonwealth been extended in a certain way, our present difficulties would have been greatly reduced. But even under the",61,Pairs
179,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Attorney-Genera lexisting power, this Parliament may makelaws with respect to conciliation, and arbitration for the prevention of disputes extendingbeyond the limits of any one State. The new statutory provision, which we propose, is based upon the prin-r ciple that the court or the appointed arbitrator may deal, by conciliation or arbitration, with a situation bef ore it has crystallized into an industrial dispute. I shall read a brief extract from a judgment of the late Mr Justice Higgins, in which he illustrated the kind of matter to which this clause is addressedAsI said during, the argument, Serbia and Bulgaria may be massing troops on each side of a river, preparing for battleas to the divipass muster before the High Court when sion of. Macedonia -ther e may even be a battle -althoug h as yet neither State has made a definite demand. There may be two nations arming against each other, jealous, suspicious, bitter and abusive: there may be no definite matter in dispute between them; and yet a stray spark may at any. moment produce an explosion. In industrial matters, as well as in other evils, prevention is better than cure; and an arbitrator can often do good service by bringing the parties together to discuss an agreement if they are standing apartand preparing for a strike; by even getting them to formulate their precise demands, and to reduce the hostility to precise issues; by hringing them out of the region of hot antagonism into the region of cold reason. There is nothing either impracticable or absurd in the intervention of an impartial arbiter before discontent has taken shape in definite demands, before growling has turned into biting. If A is complaining that his wages are too low, without saying, what they should be, it may be that the matter is as yet too indefinite to amount to a "" dispute "" ; but what is absurd or impracticable in the court taking cognizance of the threatened dispute, trying to. get the parties to come to an amicable agreement, and, if they will not, arbitrating? Industrial discontent might occur in some establishment or industry in one State only. At that stage, it cannot be said that there is an impending interstate dispute; the Opposition) [5..40], -In some ""ways but that disprate might be of such a there is very little, difference between, the character that, if allowed to spread, it views of the Attorney-General (Dr. will develop into an interstate dispute.

Now. the Attorney General .agrees that the second part of this definition is designed to cut short a threatened or impending or probable dispute. AllI d.o is to offer a warning that if it can influence a threatened, impending or probable dispute its -own authority is "" impending, threatened or probable"". As the Attorney-General recollects from one of the many legal battles in which we had the pleasure of opposing one another, namely, the Caledonian Collieries case on the northern New South Wales coalfields, the High Court by an overwhelming majorityMr Justice Isaacs dia-sen ting-hel d that there was not an interstate dispute threatening, impending or probable in a matter in which practically all the men' were out on the northern coalfields of New South Wales. There had been a sympathy stoppage in Queensland and a sympathy strike at Wonthaggi in Victoria. Eliminating theminor issues, those .were the three chief matters for determination. The High Court acceded to argument presented to them by very distinguished counsel to the effect that this was not a. threatened, impending or probable industrial dispute within the terms of the Constitution. I mention that to honourable members opposite because although at first sight it may appear to them to be absurd, it' is not absurd. It has the clear authority of a number of judges of the High Court. If we intend to go beyond the limits imposed and exercise this admirable jurisdiction, to "" get in ea r l y "" in the settlement of industrial disputes, there will be a lot of decisions successfully challenged in the courts. The .right honourable member for Yarra decision that is given under the powers ( Mr ScuTlin) says: "" You are no worse that will be exercised according to this off if you fail, and much better off if you interpretation. succeed "". With infinite deference to that honourable gentleman I do not agree with that.

I hope that the objection to this clause will not be pressed. been moved. years when attempts have been made to alter the arbitration law, our opponents have declared that the present law is sufficient to meet all needs. Honourable members opposite have stronglyopposed the giving of full powers to this Parliament. I consider that sooner or later this question will have to be faced by one party or the other. If parties to a dispute go before a conciliation commissioner and his decision is set aside by tlie High Court the whole question will arise for determination by this Parliament: But even if that be the intention of the employers and of those who have contended .that no alteration is necessary in order to give a reasonable interpretation of what should be done under the act, T cannot* see tliat we shall face all. those dangers. In reply to the fear expressed by the Leader of the Opposition that our second state will be worse than our first, I can only say that if we are not giving to conciliation commissioners or the court under this legislation the power to meet the position, the act will have to be further amended.

He has said that if a dispute arose in a factory or some other place, and a conciliation commissioner, in an attempt to prevent it from spreading, gave a decision which, upon heing challenged, presumably by the employers, was held by the High Court to be not valid, the bitterness thus caused might make the second position worse than the first. I challenge that argument. I have said by way of interjection that if any bitterness arose among employees because what they strove to obtain legitimately from a conciliation commissioner was held to be invalid, that would be no greater than what would inevitably ensue if their grievances were not considered in tlie first place. ""With a facetious quip, the of whose decisions have been changed by right honourable gentleman sought to turn that argument aside; he said that, he did not accept the old proverb, "" 'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all"". I counter that by saying. ""'Tis betterto have tried and failed than never to have tried at all "". That is what this Government is doing. There is a good deal of experimentation in the whole of this legislation. Surely honourable members opposite know that we are passing through a period of industrial unrest which warrants any legitimate experiment in an attempt to meet the situation. What position is contemplated by this .measure? We have had experience of disputes which, one would imagine, could have been settled at the beginning by the exercise of common sense. I do not contemplate a just settlement being disputed. Probably a settlement could be reached by agreement which would not be possible without the early intervention of a conciliation commissioner. If a dispute is allowed to develop until it assumes interstate dimensions, bitterness will be caused which it will be hard to eradicate. The right honourable gentleman cited an example, and I assumed from his comment that he was the legal advocate for the side which the High Court upheld. one "". was a distinguished one. occasion of saying something in my own favour. Very few people will say it for me. with the right honourable gentleman for having done that. But I point out that it is not a matter for wonder that there is bitterness in the minds and hearts of many bodies of working men when, having a legitimate grievance, they find themselves thwarted at every turn by legal hair-splitting, even by the High Court itself. The experience down the years has shown that the decisions of the High Court are not infallible, and have not always been upheld by subsequent decisions of the same tribunal. The interpretation of our Constitution has been entrusted' to fallible men who have been known to make mistakes, and many their successors. SoI would say to the committee, ""Do not turn aside this very laudable aim to achieve this extended interpretation, but rather let us go as far as is possible towards providing for the prevention of industrial disputes"". If it be a gamble,as the Leader of the Opposition has said, the better course is to take that risk, because I do not believe that the second position would be worse than the first. It is much better to try to extinguish a fire when it is confined to the kitchen, than to wait until every room in the house is ablaze.

I point out that this experiment is not a novel one, and that no allegation of lack of sympathy, or implication to that effect, can be levelled against the Leader of the Opposition; because, when we were in office, we embodied this kind of provision in our Industrial Peace Regulations.

We seek to remove any technicalities which would prevent a conciliation commissioner or the court from giving a fair, prompt and impartial decision upon matters which managements and men genuinely desire shall be determined. Whilst1 believe that there are criticisms which could be directed against both elements in the disputes that have occurred in the past, my experience in recent years has been that there has been much less tendency to raise technical objections when matters have been placed before industrial tribunals for adjudication. The parties now' genuinely desire a settlement, and endeavour to ensure that no technicalities shall impede them.

The proposed ' set-up would emphasize the separate nature of the two classes of officers, instead of bringing them together so that each may learn something from the other.

221,Mr Hol.t..R,"That is so; I am notunionists and should be men sympathetic towards the Labour point of view. Just a few minutes ago, when the Attorney General was asked how the number of fifteen commissioners was decided upon, the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) said that it was fixed "" upon advice received "". When we pressed for a more particular answer the Attorney-General said half jokingly that the number was fixed upon advice "" from very high quarters"". My impression was that the trade unions had recommended that that number of commissioners be appointed. mind, it is also the state of mind of a great many people outside the Parliament. If the worse evils which we have predicted as likely to occur under this scheme are to be avoided, men chosen for these positions must be men who command the respect of the employers and the employees and the public as well. They must he men who the public can feel will give just decisions and will not be affectedby any past bitterness, or controversy, in the industrial field. Another aspect of this matter is that we are told, broadly speaking, that the existing commissioners will continue their functions, and that additional appointments are to be made. How much nearer will the Government be to its objective, which is to overcome delays, when under this scheme it proposes to take out of this particular sphere ""of industrialarbitration the present judges, Chief Judge Piper, Acting Chief Judge Drake-Brockman, Judge Kelly, Judge Sugerman and Judge Poster? Under the bill they are to be relieved of the job of dealing with disputes arising from time to time. Their activities are to be confined to appeals on matters of law referred to them by the conciliation commissioners, and to certain reserved matters of a limited number set out in the bill. If those five judges are taken out, and only six or seven additional commissioners are to be appointed, the Government will not advance much farther its claim that there have been delays which will be obviated by the appointment of a few more conciliation commissioners. My view, which is supported by those who have had experience in industrial arbitration; is that this talk of delays in dealing with disputes is exaggerated. It may take a long time to deal with important industrial principles, such as the 40-hour week or a revision of the basic wage. Quite clearly, detailed evidence is required on those matters, because they vitally affect the economic life of the Commonwealth. But so far as the general class of industrial disputes is concerned, I do not know of any that could not have been settled almost out of hand had the parties desired an early settlement. Under the industrial peace regulations, any body of employers, or any trade union, could approach the registrar of the court and refer to a matter in dispute and have it heard the next day. conciliation commissioner will be able to make a new award in less time than it now takes the court to do so. Indeed, the legal training of judges is directed towards eliminating irrelevancies, and matters which are not necessary so far as judgments are concerned. Far from removing delays by the appointment of men who have not had that training, 1 suggest, that if. they are going to deal with awards and the revision of awards, they will be required to take just as much time over such matters as does a judge. The primary virtue of the conciliation system as we knew it was that officers existed whose function it was to get to a dispute, bring the parties together and, if there were room for conciliation, to help them reach agreement. But time and again it was found that after a conference had been held, such officers were not able to bring about a settlement and,, thereupon, they referred the dispute to the court, although, in some instances, the officer himself was empowered to make an award. If these additional appointments are to be made at a time when the functions of the existing judges are to be reduced by reason of the fact that they will not now be called upon to determine day-to-day disputes, I fail to see what has been gained by this legislation, which, we are told, is designed to eliminate delays.

225,Mr Holt,"I do not imagine that aGovernment, through any pressure whatever, appoints as conciliation commissioners men who have not the necessary training, experience, judgment and capacity to deal with these matters, it will bring into disrepute and public condemnation the arbitration system which has been the bulwark of this country's economic progress. I make a last appeal to the Government that such pressures as may be applied be ignored and that it select men for appointment as conciliation commissioners who it feels can be relied upon to give fair, just and impartial decisions. Minister and Treasurer) [8.20] -The appointment of conciliation commissioners is undoubtedly the fundamental principle in this bill. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), and the honourable member for Barker( Mr upon the type of men selected will depend Archie Cameron) by interjection, asked how the number of commissioners proposed to be appointed had been arrived at. The number selected is merely approximate; it may be found in practice that additional appointments will have to be made. The number decided upon was .determined not as the result of discussions with trade unions, or other outside bodies, but after discussions between the Evatt), and the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway), and myself, with those responsible for the working of the system. A rb itration Con rt ? want it to be inferred that the judges are in -any way committed to the number the Government has in mind. They are the only people with whom we have discussed this aspect-of the bill. In advising the Government they had the advantage of their expert knowledge .of the spread of awards. At first the Attorney-General and I thought that twelve might possibly be sufficient; but upon examination we realized that, not only would it be necessary to allocate conciliation commissioners to different branches of industry, but that it would also be desirable to have one or two who could be free in an emergency to deal with any particular matter that arose outside the general industrial field. In considering the allotment of commissioners regard was paid to the fact that the bulk of their work would be carried out in New South Wales and Victoria and, to some degree, in South Australia. It was thought that in either Western Australia or Tasmania there would probably not be sufficient work to occupy fully the time of one commissioner, and that one would be sufficient for Queensland. There was a feeling that at least two fairly versatile commissioners capable of handling a variety of cases should be at the disposal of the Chief Judge. I mention this, not with a view to committing any member of the Arbitration Court to any ideas the Government may have about this subject, ,but merely to show that we sought advice in every quarter upon all aspects of the proposal. We realize that its success or failure, and we are fully alive to the difficulties that will confront us in making a wise choice. I had a great deal of experience in the Arbitration Court in New South Wales in years gone by when I had an opportunity to appear both with and before .men who were brilliant lawyers of very high academic qualifications. I can recall how we used to argue the pros and cons of the Attorney-General (Dr. appropriate time to make an approach to the court and very often it depended upon the state of the liver of the presiding judge. In saying that, 1 have no desire to reflect upon the absolute honesty of the men I have in mind. That has been the experience of industrial advocates in a number of States. Men, even of the calibre of the late "" M i c k "" Connington-wh o was appointed by the present right honourable member for Notfth Sydney( Mr Hughes) to a very high position -a t times found the greatest difficulty in getting civility and courtesy from the Bench unless, as I have said, the presiding judge's liver was in good condition. It may be possible to get men with brilliant records and of high qualifications to accept these posts, but there is an intangible quality possessed only by a few men which enables them not only to hold the scales of justice evenly but also to convince others that justice has been done.

228,Mr Chifley,"Yes; but I do notoften give a decision which from the r judicial and logical viewpoint is completely sound, 'but the manner in which he gives it, and the way 'in which he conducts the case creates a feeling of antagonism among those who have appeared before him. The selection of a judge of the Arbitration Court .or a conciliation commissioner is.therefore one of the most difficult tasks that any .government has to face. I pay a tribute to the manner in which the honourable member for Fawkner handled his task when, as a Minister, he had charge -of industrial matters. The honourable gentleman showed great understanding and tolerance in his dealing with both the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) and myself when we approached him on matters .of industrial concern in which we were interested. High qualifications for appointment as a conciliation commissioner does not necessarily connote deep legal knowledge. As to impartiality, whatever advantage some people might hope to gain by appointing a man favorable to the interests they represent is bound ultimately to be lost. Conciliation commissioners are to be appointed and remain in office until they attain the age of 65 years. A conciliation commissioner who .shows partiality towards one side to-day may be intolerant towards that side at other times. The outstanding qualifications required by conciliation commissioners are capacity, firmness and -ability to adjudicate upon the facts fairly in the interest of not only the employer and employee but also the community generally. The history of arbitration is one of endless argument and strenuous endeavour year after year to wring concessions from the Arbitration Court. I could cite -numerous instances that have occurred in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and the arbitration courts of the States where employers have argued that certain things could not possibly be donej that certain concessions were absolutely impracticable and beyond reason, yet years afterwards, when we persuaded the judges that they could, in fact, be done it was found not only that they could be done but also that they could be done without difficulty. The present Minister ford) could cite numerous examples of Mr Chifley. that in connection with matters uporii which -he, in ea-rlier years, made representations to -the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. 'One of the great difficulties is that very few -employers ta'ke a practical interest in arbitration, court proceedings; they remain aloof-and. empl'oy paid advocates to whom successmeans giving absolutely nothing away, nomatter what the justice of the case may be. The honourable -member for Fawkner referred to the selection as conciliation, commissioners of men who have had 'experience in a particular industry. that. that one can lay down a Mack and whiterule on the matter. .Some industries arevery complicated. Take for instance the metal trades -group. As the honourable member for Fawkner knows, it was the-arduous work in connection with those industries that contributed largely to the early death of Judge O'Mara, who was faced with a. task that was far too much for any one man. The same may he said of the work of other Arbitration CouTt judges. Their work is of a most difficult nature, and because of the pressure, they are often unable to give adequate thought to the many problems with which they are called upon to deal expeditiously. Arbitration work involves not only complex economic factors but also human factors. Any man who is selected for appointment as a conciliation commissioner under this measure will require a wide general knowledge if he is to be called upon to deal with a variety of undertaMngs. It is not possible in the time available to me .now to define at length the qualities that will be required, but I know that it takes many years for a judge of the Arbitration -Court or a conciliation commissioner to become familiar with complex industries such as those in the metal trades group, the cloth-. -ing trade industry, and public utilities like the railways. He has to acquire a knowledge of the jargon used in these industries and of an infinite variety of other individual characteristics before he can absorb quickly the facts of a case without placing upon-counsel the burden of giving detailed explanations.

231,Mr Chiflex,"No. I do not say.'he. can do this he is at a great disadvantage. Despite what the honourable member for Fawkner has said, there is much to be said, in favour of having arbitration matters relating to a particular in-dustry handled by an individual who has bad am opportunity to'gain some knowledge of thatindustry, but there may be -other men of greater capabilities and more suitable for the job who have not had anything to do with the industry at .all. Tbe Government appreciates fully the responsibility that, rests upon its -shoulders' in regard to the selection of the certain number of conciliation comright type of men for this work. I do. not. aigree that the Arbitration. Court judges, who in the past have been very -much overworked, cannot be more usefully -employed within the arbitration system. They will have an opportunity to devote much more thought to^ industrial problems, and. for that reason their services will be of even more value than they are to-day. It is impossible to say off-hand from what particular class in the community the conciliation commissioners will be drawn. It is. a question' of selecting men of high ability, complete honesty and understanding, aptitude, and capacity for absorbing facts. The selection of such men will not he an easy task. It might be simple enough to find men who appeared to have these qualities, but experience might show that a mistake had been made. There is something of a gamble in the selection of a man to fill any position in life. Some men develop unsuspected talents, or are found to be particularly adaptable to . certain work. Evidence of that is to be found 'in this chamber. right honourable ' gentleman's' time has expired. I have listened with great interest to the remarks of the Prime Minister( Mr ground that it has already covered, buildChifley) and of the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), but I am afraid that the fears in the minds of every person, who is likely to be affected by decisions of the proposed conciliation commissioners; have not been allayed by anything that these right honourable gentlemen, have said. Rather will those fears be aggravated, by the observations of the Prime Minister, who has said,, in effect, "" ""We know we are embarking on a new venture. This is an experiment. We intend to appoint laymen to make awards and to prescribe conditions in variousindustries. We hope that the appointees will be able to do the job, but. we are not sure that this will be so "". If that statement will not create a feeling of misgiving in the minds of tbe people who will be affected by this measure, I cannot imagine what would. We are now discussing the most important clause in the bill. The Government proposes to appoint . a missioners. When the bill was first introduced honourable members opposite acclaimed, it as perfect; but even before the second-reading, debate had been completed, we had placed before us a printed list of 54 Government amendments. Thaanendment proposed to clause S now under discussion provides that the Governor General may appoint a conciliation commissioner to be tlie-chief conciliation commissioner. That provision was not in the original measure. Honourable members will recall that one of the conditions laid down in the bill originally was that there should be a conference of conciliation commissi oners, at least once every six months. Apparently there was to be a. sort of "" old boys' re-union "", at which the conciliation commissioners would swap reminiscences. What could, such conferences' possibly do to maintain close relations between the various branches of industry? Apparently since the bill was first introduced the Attorney-General has seen the light. First, lie has realized that no provision has been made for somebody to tell the conciliation commissioners what their work is to be. The Secondly, it is thought, apparently, that a six-monthly interval between conferences would he too long, and so the period has been reduced to four months. We find the Government going over and over the ing up this gigantic experiment which will be carried out at high cost to the industrialists, and without bringing, to the employees any appreciable measure of comfort. The Prime Minister has acknowledged the fact that the selection of the conciliation commissioners will be one of theprimary difficulties. I cannot conceive of any layman, apart from a",71,Pairs
232,The Chairman.:,Order!,72,Pairs
233,"Mr Harrison (""Wentworth) [S.35].","former employee or employer in a particular industry, having sufficient knowledge to control that industry. He would not have the training that a judge of the Arbitration Court has in the taking and valuing of evidence, and in the consideration of the. many points of law that must arise. The Prime Minister said, almost in agreement with that, "" But there will come a time when this man, who may have had bias in his early days, will have tolerance. judiced may be so prejudiced that heOnly experience will teach h i m "" . But what is to happen to industry in the meantime? We are to have fifteen conciliation commissioners, perhaps some from most, from the ranks of union secretaries and standing labouring angle who will, as the Prime Minister says, have bias in their early days. What will happen until that bias has .been overcome by common sense, cold logic and reasoning, if it is ever overcome by them? We know, of course that the Government has the happy knack, under pressure, of directing conciliation commissioners, as it has directed the chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, Mr D. V. Morrison, and all others associated with commissions appointed by it. Directions from the Government have resulted in the resignation of even judges. The resignation, of Judge de Baun from the chairmanship of the Maritime Industry Commission is an instance. Under this legislation, the conciliation sioners will be appointed from one side or the other of the industrial field. Otherremember that Mr Healy, an avowed wise, the Government will have to appoint laymen without knowledge of industry who will have to gain that knowledge, as Judge O'Mara had to gain it, at the sacrifice of his health and ultimately his life, because it took many years for him, despite his great capacity and his ability to bring to bear on the matters before him n trained legal mind and a knowledge of evidence and points of law, to gain the knowledge that was necessary for him adequately to discharge his duty as a judge of the Arbitration Court. We are told that the conciliation commissioners are to be laymen without knowledge of the law. Perhaps they will have no knowledge of industry. Mr Harrison. decisions, which may be made in ignorance or with a possible desire to do away with injustice in wages and industrial'conditions, there is to be no appeal. They may or may not go to the Arbitration Court for a ruling on a point of law. They have that discretion. Can honourable members imagine anything moreGilbertian than that? A man who, the Prime Minister admits, may ' be prewill not brook a ruling on a point of law, but will go ahead and possibly create an injustice from which therewill be no appeal. It is true that this is the employing side, but a gigantic experiment. It is equally truethat a conciliation commissioner may beadvocates, men with undera superman and may not be subject to the of industry from the same liverish conditions that the Prime Minister spoke about as being associated, with justices of the High Court. superman with no liver complaint, but I venture to say that he will suffer many headaches before he will overcome all the intolerable disabilities that must beassociated with a job such as his will be. We have experienced the methods employed by this Government in appointing people to special positions. I do not desire to speak in terms of political jobbery, but I am greatly concerned at the possibility of one of our Communist comrades being appointed as. a conciliation commissioner. The honourable member commisfor Griffith( Mr Conelan) laughs at at that, prospect, but does he not Communist, was and is a member of the Stevedoring Industry Commission and had the temerity to submit to the Government the draft of a bill dealing with the stevedoring industry the details of which it closely followed in the drafting of the Stevedoring Industry Bill itself? I have no doubt that when this bill becomes law and the serried ranks of the trade unionists realize that there are fifteen beautiful plums to be picked, pressure will be brought, to bear on the Attorney General and the Prime Minister in the making of the appointments. That pressure will possibly be greater than they can bear. I know what they are likely to go From .their through. I know the representations that",72,Pairs
234,Mr Chifley,Not the High Court.,73,Pairs
235,Mr Harrison,"Yes, he may be a.are likely to be made to them. I know where they will come from . I know the .arguments that are likely to be advanced -by Communist-controlled unions to ensure that men acceptable to them shall be -appointed as conciliation commissioners in the industries with which they are concerned. When appointments are made under those conditions, what is likely to -happen to industry while the peculiar bias that the Prime Minister spoke of is being overcome by cold logic and reasoning? W ill industry be able to stand the -period in which the conciliation commissioner will be learning to overcome his prejudice? Industry is under such an-extraordinary strain that it cannot bear one more stress. Yet, we have the Prime Minister rising and saying, "" We realize the difficulties in appointments of this character and how difficult it will be to appoint men perfectly honest and with the necessary experience and knowledge to do the j o b . "" There is one way in which to overcome the difficulty. If the Government insists on laymen-and I am opposed to them-the Prime Minister can give the duty of making the appointments to the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court, who w ill be able to select men with at least some grounding in legal matters, with a knowledge of how to take, .sift and apply evidence, and acquainted with industrial matters in a broad way, if they have not a complete, clear and specific knowledge of the industries that they are called upon to investigate. If the Government is not prepared to do that there is another course for it, to follow. 1 know that the Government will not accept the first course, because I know that it intends to use the weight, of numbers against amendments, or even suggestions, from this side. The Prime Minister even declared, before the Attorney-General's 54 amendments were circulated, that no amendments would be accepted. If the Government intends to rush forward with this experiment, which will possibly cost industry a decade of development, let it give the Chief Judge the right to appoint laymen to the jobs and the opportunity of calling them together in order to keep in close touch with all matters associated w it h the making of awards in the different industries. Otherwise what is likely to happen? We 1563 shall have fifteen conciliation commissioners operating in a multiplicity of industries without cohesion and with no knowledge of the interests of the outside consumers and no knowledge on the bearing'on the national economy that will be had by the awards that, they make as laws unto themselves. Can the Government not see that each union will use each conciliation commissioner as a stepping-stone to higher wages and better conditions that industry will not be able to afford? The more one looks at it the more one realizes that this gigantic experiment is an experiment that the country cannot afford. . The speech that we have just heard was, I think, one of 'the most malicious examples of distortion that has been put up in this chamber for some time. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr. Harrison) endeavoured to convince us that the appointments to be made by the Government w ill be bad because they will be appointments of conciliation commissioners, not of judges as many honourable members opposite have advocated. The logical implication of his argument was that, if the Government appointed judges, the appointments, would be good. I direct attention particularly to the honourable member's suggestion that laymen should not be associated with arbitration courts, or any courts dealing with industries. In Western Australia, for many years the Arbitration Court has consisted of a lay president, a representative of the employers, and a representative of the employees. The position of Mr Healy, who is a Communist, in the Stevedoring In dustry Commission, to which the honourable .member for Wentworth referred, is not that of a presiding judge or even that of a conciliation commissioner. Mr. Healy is the elected representative of the Waterside Workers Federation, and occupies his position by the same right as does the representative of the employers on the commission. The neutral chairman of the commission, Mr. Morrison, has been commended by honourable members opposite as being a man worthy of respect. It is a curious fact that honourable members opposite say that all conciliation commissioners who have been appointed in the past have been worthy of respect, but that those who",73,Pairs
236,Mr Beazley* (Fremantle) [8.50],"will, be appointed in the future, will not be worthy .of respect. . If this Government is incapable of appointing competent conciliation commissioners, it must be equally .incapable-of .appointing competent Arbitration Court judges. .Therefore, that .argument is not necessarily directed, against the principle of appointing .conciliation commissioners. The 'question of appointing laymen who should have an expert knowledge of industry is important. Honourable members opposite have stressed the need -for the presence of lawyers in the Arbitration Court and on the Arbitration Court Bench. The whole aim of the. arbitration system in Western Australia, which has been much more successful than the systems in other States, is to exclude lawyers from the court and have an atmosphere of complete informality in its deliberations: On one occasion, in a timber workers' case, the Arbitration Court met in the forests in the south-western area of Western Australia. Lawyers are admitted to that court only in special .circumstances and with the consent of the parties to a dispute. That principle is applied not ouly in the Arbitration Court of Western Australia but also in the Public Service of that State. A law recently passed by the State Government which was defeated at the elections a few weeks ago departed from that principle in relation to appeals against promotions in the Public Service, and it led to grave dissatisfaction with the legal quibbling which immediately arose in what previously had been a court of equity. Honourable *.membexs opposite have stressed the need for confidence in the conciliation commissioners. I agree with them. There is also .a need for confidence in Arbitration Court judges. A Chief Judge of theArbitration Court, when presiding over a coal-miners' dispute, .stated that he would not know a coal mine if he fell into one. I presume that that was a perfectly honest statement; but it would not commend the Chief -Judge to the coal-miners as a person who should have authority to determine a dispute in the coal-mining industry. that judge to be appointed to the presidency -of the tribunal. Be fair to him. . Mr Beazley. fair .to the judge. I merely stated that, if he said, that .he would not -know a .coal mine if he fell into one, he was not. inspiring confidence among the miners, who desired to have somebody, who would, understand' their industry. That is only a statement of .fact. If the Opposition insists that every person, who presides in these industrial courts-should be a lawyer,,, trained as a barrister, it will be saying,, 'in .effect, that there should .be a predisposition in the Arbitration Court. Arbitration Court judges, .are not called upon to decide points of law. The quotation which the Attorney-General made from a statement by the late Mr Justice Higgins,. that the -ordinary court of law determines law as it is, whereas an arbitration court makes industrial law, overthrows entirely the argument that lawyers are needed in arbitration court's. Is it a legal matter todetermine what is a fair wage in an industry ? Is it necessary for a man to have been trained in criminal law in order torn alee .such a determination? Proceedings in an arbitration court are not in the realm of civil law. The decision of what is a fair return to the employees in an. industry is not a legal decision at all. It is strange that although honourable members opposite attack the principle of appointing laymen to arbitration tribunals, they admit that all-of the laymen who have been appointed as conciliation commissioners have done their work well. In Western Australia, where arbitration 'has been much less legalistic and informal than it is in the other States, the lay ""appointees to the court have been successful. Another"" red herring "" drawn across -the trail by the honourable member for Wentworth was his statement that fifteen conciliation commissioners making awards in different industries will make awards differing from one another. That is exactly what -happens under the existing system. Eor example, the Arbitration Court-of Western Australia made a determination dm 1938 fixing a basic wage that wais 6s. 'or 7s. a week higher than that which applied in the eastern States.

Nothing could be plainer common sense. The speech of the honourable member for Wentworth, with its bogies of political appointees and the .argument that laymen are incapable of making fair awards, although he admits that existing lay authorities have made good .awards, was just to darken counsel. urn sorry that the 'honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) should have indulged in such exaggerations as to say that the speech of the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) was "" a malicious attempt at distortion"". The honourable member tried to make up in vehemence of speech what he seemed to lack in knowledge of recent political history. Considering recent appointments made by ' the Government-for instance, those of Mr Frost and Mr Breen, defeated Labour politicians, as trade commissioners to Ceylon and Egypt respectivelyI say that we have good reason to have doubts about the appointment of the proposed fifteen conciliation commissioners. The clause now before the committee is a most important part of the bill. I know that the Government, having a strong majority will pass this clause in spite 'of our objections, so that what we have to say about it will not matter. Nevertheless, I want the Attorney-General to listen to a proposal that I shall make. He may be able to clear our minds on this point. Under this provision, fifteen, conciliation commissioners will be appointed to decide whether we shall have industrial peace or shall continue to have industrial chaos. I agree with. .the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) that the conciliation commissioners .should be men of integrity, and should display impartiality in making their .determinations. .Such men will be difficult to find, but I have no .doubt that -they can be found. In my opinion, the judges of .the Arbitration Court should select them. The reputation of our judiciary is excellent. Regardless of the political beliefs of the various governments which appointed them, the judges are .above reproach. If they were made responsible for appointing the conciliation commissioners, the Opposition would be satisfied, the workers would be happier, and the employers would be relieved to know that impartiality would be displayed in the making of awards. If the -choice of conciliation commissioners is to be .determined by caucus or Cabinet, some of .the appointments might be unwise, and that would give rise to -considerable difficulties. Honourable members know the pressure that can he brought .to bear upon Cabinet. Frequently, we see in the galleries men whose names are notorious throughout Australia-the leaders of the -great militant unions who are causing havoc in Victoria to-day. If some of these men should be appointed conciliation commissioners, great misery and unemployment will occur in Australia. It is useless for honourable members opposite to say that politics will not enter into the choice 'of these commissioners. The Communists are more than a political party. The honourable member for Fremantle knows that as well as any one else. Communists are revolutionaries. They do not owe allegiance to Australia, and their contesting seats at Commonwealth and State elections is purely incidental. If , perchance, one of them were made a conciliation commissioner in a key industry, he could bring disaster upon tliis country. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) is well aware of what occurred in Canada recently. The oath of allegiance does not mean anything to a Communist, and a member of the Canadian Parliament, who was a Communist, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for having betrayed official secrets to Russian spies.

Mr ""WHITE I rise to order. Is it not possible that if an error were made in the a ppointment orable member for Wimmera is addressing the Chair.' member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) said that it had been suggested that the present Government was incapable of making satisfactory public appointments, and that is the real point at issue. aremany technicalities surrounding it but the real point, as is agreed by honourable members on both sidesof the chamber, is whether the right men will be appointed. The Government was refused this power by the people and it is seeking tc obtain it in another way. A review of recent appointments made by the Government lends colour to thesuggestion that was voiced by the honourable member for Fremantle. However, I want to be fair and not look only at one side to the judge to deal practically with a. serious exclusion of the other. The Prime Minister expressed a reasonable view, and one which I support with certain reservations, when he remarked thati f the Government, in making these appointments-, selected men who were rank unionists or Communists the harm they would do would wreck the scheme altogether. Of course that is true. On the ocher hand, we know that these eommissir-ners are to be appointed for a very long period. However; it is idle to say any more; the Government has decided what it will do and, sinee it has the numbers, any amendments which the Opposition puts-'forward will he disregarded. But I would not be a conscientious representative of a primary producing constituency if I did not regisfixed, by the award' and they realized that ter my most strong protest against these proposals. honourable member for Wimmera( Mr at the fact that some of its members were Turnbull) said, that he was. very worried about primary producers; but since he made very little reference to theactual clause I think his remarks may beentirely disregarded. There seems to be a great deal of fear-largel y simulated, I suggest-that politically affiliated laymen will be appointed to these positions. Honourable members opposite may have guilty consciences in regard to. appointments which their governments have' made. The names of quite a number of their appointees were mentioned to-night. Naturally, they are worried, believing that this Government may adopt their policy of appointing individuals of the same political pursnasion. I am just an ordinary layman, one of the great number that will be affected, by this measure. I propose to say something of legal men, but I do not do so disrespectfully. Because a man has legal qualificaThere tions it does not mean that he also has practical ability. I am not criticizing the value of sound legal knowledge, because it, undoubtedly, has its worth. But, if we are dealing with practical matters,, legal men are sometimes as incapable as babes in the wood. It is for that reason that the Government contends that the appointment of men experienced in industry, in preference to legal men, as conciliation commissioners is justified. I cam give an example of the failure of a dispute-in the pastoral industry in the 1920's. The gentleman concerned was a learned judge of the Arbitration Court. The pastoralists concerned were, represented at the arbitration proceedings by legal men,, but the shearers, the other parties to the proceedings, were represented by laymen like the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson). The award ultimately made by. the learned judge astounded the graziers as much as it did the shearers. It reduced the shearers' rate by 10s. a hundred sheep shorn. The pastoralists themselves got a tremendous shock, because they knew that men would not come from Victoria or Tasmania to New South Wales to shear at the rate they would be without labour at shearing time. The graziers themselves have a union-and no oneblames them for that -and their association became concerned not observing; the new a-ward.

Had representatives of the pastoralists and the shearers conferred together in the first place they would undoubtedly have reached a more practicable decision than did the judge. I am not reflecting on the judiciary. But the members of the judiciary are only human beings and, as the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) said, they may be influenced by the state of their livers. Half the trouble that occurs in industry could be settled before it reaches the stage at which it requires a decision by a judicial body. The Opposition need not fear; there are members of the Government who are just as competent in selecting the right men for the positions that will have to be filled as is the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr that the stars were consulted or the numHolt). I am sure that great benefit will accrue from this legislation. [9.21] -Whil e the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) was addressing the committee, I asked out of pure curiosity how the number fifteen in relation to conciliation commissioners had been arrived at. Immediately, there was a duet from the ministerial table, the Attorney General singing from his seat and the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) from his. I suspect that their songs were not quite in tune, because not very long afterwards there was a cantata from the other side of the chamber. Whenever there is some doubt as to how the ministerial ship is steering, the Prime Minister takes his place at the table and engages in a dialogue, cantata or duet with one or two of his Ministers. The statement that we had from the right honourable gentleman while seated was that the number fifteen had been arrived at by resorting, not-as ' I suggest-to divination, astrology, or something of the kind, but to advice. Later, the Prime Minister was good enough to rise to his feet. He then told us that the number had been arrived at by resorting to advice from the Attorney-General, the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr one was perhaps not more than half a Holloway), and I think he mentioned -on e or two other Ministers. I thought that the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully) might have been called in to act as an impartial chairman, but he was not. Seeing that the numL'54] ber is fifteen, I thought that perhaps the whole of the Ministry had played a game of crib, a card game in which I do not indulge, but in the playing of which,. I have noticed, the number fifteen enters into the calculations of the players very many times. Possibly, therefore, the remarks of the honourable member for shearing, had quite another implication; my friends opposite may have been out on one of their favourite pastimes for a week-end, and may have indulged in a friendly game of crib. So far as the debate has progressed, we have not been informed as to how the number fifteen was arrived at. Therefore, I may be just as right as anybody else if I say ber was taken out of a hat. In either peace or war, if a government department wants to employ a certain number of people there is generally justification for it. To begin with, we have a certain number of Ministers; the number is limited by the Ministers of State Act. not said that' they are justified. One of these days the limit may be raised. Then, the number of members of Parliament is limited by the Constitution. We limit every year the number of persons on the civil establishment, and in departments of State. In the armed forces, we have establishments, complements and so on, in order -that we shall not have more men than are required. There is some reason for every one of these limitations. That reason has been tbought out, and it can be explained and justified. The Prime Minister and the Attorney General are the two chief artists in the Government cantata. Both of them have made contributions to-night, yet we are still in the dark. We have had only one ray of daylight. Rather should I say that we have had two rays, although ray.

He further .said that if these men, having been appointed, did not carry out the will and the wish of those who had appointed themI may not have given his exact words, but they conright honourable gentleman; and no doubt vey the sense of what he said-in other words, if as conciliation commissioners their verdict does not go to the side from which they come, he hoped that they would be recalled. As the clause is drafted, I do not see any method by which they could be recalled. I ask the Attorney-General to tell me whether any one of these conciliation commissioners can be removed by an address of both Houses of the Parliament in the bill. a lawyer, and have sought a little free advice. For once in my life, I have been given it. That gives us some little hope. It may also give more hope to the honourable member for Hunter, who now will have a clear idea, if he did not have one before, of the means whereby these men may be removed from office if they do not give the verdict expected of them by the' side from which they have come. The whole basis on which this clause has been built is unsound. Some of us suspiciously minded people-Oppositio n members always have to be-considere d that there was something not quite right about it. The honourable member for Robertson sharpened those suspicions somewhat, and after the honourable member for Hunter had given his advice there was no longer any doubt in our minds. A few minutes ago, the debate turned on the question whether a Communist could be appointed. It was also suggested that only lawyers should be appointed. I have no doubt that, in the ranks of the legal fraternity in Australia, one or two Communists may be found. But the objective of the Communist party is the complete destruction of the arbitration system. I believe that the Attorney General has signified his knowledge of that, by the way in which he has nodded his head. Therefore, it would be a very easy matter for the right honourable gentleman to incorporate in this bill, if he were so minded, another amendment to provide simply that no person who had been or was reputed to have been a Communist could be appointed as a conciliation commissioner. That would be the fifty-fifth amendment, put forward by the the Opposition will submit one or two more. The whole system which this bill will give effect to -when put into operation is one which causes the Opposition to have the gravest misgivings. It must cause every person who has any regard for peace and stability in the industries of the Commonwealth of Australia also to have the gravest misgivings. This is one of the biggest experiments which any government has ever undertaken. I am not. one who says that a man could not fill one of these positions unless he happened to be a trained lawyer. But I do say that the appointees, from whatever walks of life they may be drawn, will have to be men of tried balance and a good deal of moral courage. They will have to be able to stand up to a lot of pressure; and, as things have gone in the industrial world in the not far distant past, they will have to bear a lot of political and public ridicule and abuse from some of those who do not like the decisions that they give. These men are not found as easily as gooseberries can be found in spring time. They will have to be selected with care. I am glad that there is one method by which they can be removed from office if unsatisfactory. I should be interested to know why the Attorney-General proposes that they may retain office after attaining the age of 65 years, because I was under the impression that he held the opinion that justices of the High Court and other judges should not, remain in office after reaching that age.

There are other questions which I could ask, but I know that, unlike Echo, we should not get an answer to them. contribution to the debate by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) has not been helpful, as it consisted chiefly of satire in relation to conciliation commissioners. The honourable gentleman fears that Communists may be appointed to such positions. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr in industry. That is something which no White) is so obsessed by his views on communism that when he goes home at night he looks under the bed, as he did when staying at the Hotel Kurrajong. When he saw a red quilt on the floor he was so convinced that it was a Communist that he left quickly. Since then he has resided at another hotel. The honourable member for Barker fears that men will be appointed as conciliation commissioners but will not be approached to settle disputes. When the coal-miners were illegally locked out, and no action was taken against those who locked them out, Sir Henry Gullett, a non-Labour member of this House, asked why they did not approach the Arbitration Court. -He said that anti-Labour governments expected the court to carry out the wishes of the Government. When the parties now in opposition were in power, it was their practice to appoint their political friends to judicial positions. That was probably due to the influence of members of the legal fraternity on non-Labour parties. One thing can be said in favour of the legal fraternity, and that is that lawyers are strong unionists. The only way to streamline arbitration is by the appointment as conciliation commissioners of men with practical experience in industry, who know how to get straight to the heart of a dispute. Lawyers, unfortunately, are concerned more with filling their pockets than with settling disputes. As the honourable member for Barker has said, this legislation is in the nature of an experiment. In my opinion, the time is overdue for experiments in the realm of industrial relations. After 40. years of industrial turmoil, i l is right that we should experiment. Already we have had some experience of conciliation commissioners who have rendered excellent service to the community. I have in mind Mr Blakeley, a former member for Darling, who has served under successive governments with distinction, Mr Findlay, and others. In my secondwho made 63S decisions in industrial disputes in a year-a n average of more than two for every working day of the year. Mr Connell works day and night, including Sundays, in order to promote peace member of the legal fraternity would do. Honourable members opposite complain of unrest in the coal-mining industry, but I assure them that there would be more trouble if Mr Connell were not there. He was appointed, not by a Labour government, but by -the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), when he was a Minister in a non-Labour government. Men like Mr Connell are frequently able to nip disputes in the bud because they are so acquainted with conditions in industry that they can get right to the root of the trouble. Many potential disputes have been settled because of the sound judgment of such men. During the debate the honourable member for Fawkner interjected that the coalminers had asked for Acting Chief Judge Drake-Brockman of the Arbitration Court to be appointed. I doubt the accuracy of that statement. I think that the honourable member meant that certain craft unions had asked for his appointment. Acting Chief Judge DrakeBrockman made an award for craft unions in respect of holiday pay retrospective to the 6th December, 1946, whereas the decision of Mr Gallagher, of the Joint Coal Board, was that it should date from the 1st April, 1947. the secretary of the miners' federation have asked for the appointment of Acting Chief Judge Drake-Brockman.",81,Pairs

274,Mr Ryan (Flinders) [9.48],"Inamely, that the coal tribunal has functioned well with the appointments made by the government which we on this side of the chamber supported. However, we are apprehensive of the kind of appointments that will be made by this Government. We know that hot so long ago it made appointments which were not as suitable as they might have been. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) underlined some of our objections to this clause when he. spoke of the difficulty of finding suitable persons for appointment as commissioners. He drew on his own experience when he said that at least one of their attributes should be a good liver. I agree. It is a desirable attribute of any human being, not least of honourable members; but other attributes are necessary in those who will hold important positions as conciliation commissioners. In addition to a good liver they should also have a good brain. They should have a character beyond reproach. In addition -and this is a point which will be appreciated by the Attorney-General (Dr. 'Evatt-the y should be, in a sense, diplomats. No one can settle a dispute unless he possesses some of the qualities a diplomat is supposed to possess, but rarely does. Therefore, it will be difficult to find men possessing the necessary qualifications for these positions. That is . has been whether the Government should why we suggest that appointees should be drawn from the legal profession, the floor average of which' is above that of other professions, although its ceiling average may not be higher than that of other professions. My next point is that the conciliation commissioners are to be clothed with dictatorial powers. appeal from any of their decisions; and, far worse from my point of view, they are to be appointed for life. It will be practically impossible to displace them. The Attorney-General explained that they could be removed by a vote of both Houses of the Parliament; but so far as I know, no official, or judge, has been removed from his position in that way. Apparently, a person would have to reveal himself as a moron before Parliament would take steps to remove him from office. Dealing with our argument that anomalies are likely to arise from decisions of fifteen conciliation commissioners the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) said that anomalies now arose with respect to decisions of the present judges. He cited the case of a judge in Fremantle giving an award which was inconsistent with awards governing the same industry in the eastern States. However, judges of the Arbitration Court frequently confer among themselves, and as trained men they endeavour to apply the same principles of. law in arriving at their decisions. At all events, if anomalies now arise with respect to the decisions of only five judges, how much more likely is it that numerous anomalies will arise in respect of the decisions of fifteen conciliation commissioners who will have no legal training? One of our main objections to the clause is that even on matters of principle the decisions of so many untrained commissioners will give rise to numerous anomalies. No doubt the Attorney-General is familiar with the phrase, quot homines, tot sententiae"" as many men, so many minds"". That saying can be aptly applied in this instance. I intend to vote against the proposal of the Government. -The crux of the debate on this matter appoint as conciliation commissioners men with legal training, or, what honourable members opposite term, laymen. Honourable members opposite are doubtful about the ability of laymen to carry out the functions of these offices. I am rather disquieted by their expressions of distrust of the Government in the making of important appointments. I believe There can be no that these posts are so important that no government, regardless of its party political affiliations, would yield for one moment to pressure that might be brought to bear upon it to appoint to them anyone who was not capable of filling them. I am certain that the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) or the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) would not appoint to these positions men who were not capable of carryingout the duties involved. I fail to comprehend the reasoning of honourable members opposite when they contend that the Government will inevitably appoint men",83,Pairs
275,Mr Thompson (Hindmarsh) [9.55].,"who have heen connected with the trade union movement. Indeed, such arguments lead me to suspect that governments which honourable members opposite supported followed that principle in the making of important appointments, and, accordingly, selected for important posts persons whose cause was pushed hy party political organizations associated with those governments. Are the Opposition's chickens now coming home to roost? Apparently honourable members opposite are judging the Government by their own standards. However, I point out to them that in relation to appointments made by this Government since it assumed office, the trade union movement as a whole has protested that too many of the appointees have been persons who hav3 no sympathy with the Labour'movement. That complaint has been made frequently by the trade unions. Therefore, there is no ground for the fear expressed by honourable members opposite that the Government will merely appoint trade unionists as conciliation commissioners. The proposition put forward by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr value, but in the settlement of a pending White) that the Government must ensure' that no Communist is appointed as a conciliation commissioner shows that he underrates the intelligence of the Government. The allegations that the' Labour party is affiliated with the Communists, and that its members exchange preferences with Communist candidates at elections, is grossly untrue. At the last elections three candidates submitted themselves to the electors in my electorate-I , as a Labour man, a Liberal and a Communist, and the "" How-tovote "" cards issued on my behalf advised the people to give me their first preferappeared to regard brains as the highest ence, their second preference to the Liberal candidate and their third preference to the Communist. nothing to do with the clause. bers opposite, who have themselves departed, widely from the clause, are the first to ridicule others and attempt to halt their speeches. I say to them that when they strike me on .the cheek I shall"" not turn the other cheek, but shall return blow for blow. My experience of industrial matters is not theoretical, but. practical. Many honourable members opposite appear to found their views on industrial relations upon what they read in newspapers opposed to the cause of Labour. Many of them speak as though their politics and thoughts in respect of industrial matters spring not from their knowledge of the subject but from what newspapers fear the Government may do. I propose now to deal with the question as to whether suitable conciliation commissioners cannot be obtained from other than professional sources. does the honourable member refer? bers opposite have suggested that they should be drawn from tbe legal profession, contending that a legal training is necessary to equip a man to undertake such a task. My experience is that industrial disputes are not settled by members of the legal profession. Eor the purpose of laying down rules of procedure, the advice and guidance of a lawyer is often of great' or existing dispute members of the legal profession cannot be compared with a layman familiar with industry and the conditions of labour. I point out that no limitation has been imposed by the clause upon the selection of members of the legal profession as conciliation commissioners. In making its selections the Government will realize, how much the future welfare of this country and the industrial peace and harmony of its. people depend upon the apppintment to these important posts of men of the right type. The honourable member for Balaclava ,(M>White) qualification in an applicant for an appointment of this kind. I remind the honourable member that some of the most, brainy men we have ever known have'been men who, apart from an intimate knowledge of some particular subject, are absolute loons.

Merely because a man has not had a university education,he is not necessarily uneducated or without brains.

Honourable members may rest assured that the Government will appoint men of high qualifications and ability to carry out this important task. I appeal to honourable members opposite to reconsider their attitude to this proposal. I have always supported the system of conciliation and arbitration, notwithstanding that in the past it has not always operated satisfactorily to the workers. I have always urged the workers not to discard it and take direct action, but to work for its improvement. That is what the Government is trying to achieve in the clause now before us. In my second reading speech I mentioned-a big industrial dispute that took place in South Australia some years ago, and caused untold misery to hundreds of workers and their families in my . electorate. Both employers and employees had been working under a system which had been in operation for a number of years, but, because of an order made by the Arbitration Court changing that system, the men went on strike and suffered greatly as the result. The honourable member's time has expired. it not been for the remarks of the honor[ should not have taken part in the discussion of this clause. This clause is the very core of this piece of legislation, and it behoves somebody to make some comments on behalf of the primary producers in relation to it. The honourable member for ""Wannon claimed that the clause will not affect primary producers. Any man, irrespective of what his politics may be, who says that industrial peace does not affect the primary producers, does not know what he is talking about. How can the primary producer be expected to carry on when transport strikes are an almost every-day occurrence? Obviously he is vitally concerned in these matters. What would be the plight of the people of Melbourne to-day if the railways were to cease to carry food to that city. They would very soon realize how necessary it is that industrial peace should be maintained so that the man on the land may be kept in production. I was pleased to hear support from the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) for my remarks last night. I maintain that there is no necessity to have members of the legal profession in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. I have had some personal experience of the work of that court. The real need is for men who have a thorough understanding of industry; men who are tolerant and are prepared to make full and honest investigations of whatever disputes may be in progress or pending. The appointment of such men would put this country well on the road to industrial peace. going to do. have been expressed by honourable members opposite. There is no .uniformity in their views. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), for instance, has said that it is not the intention of the Government to appoint union secretaries as conciliation commissioners; but the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), Lazzarini), and the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Williams) have admitted quite frankly that in their opinion union representatives only are the men that are required. I admit that this measure is a grand experiment and one for which there has been a need for many years. I commend the Government for its action in bringing this bill forward. the bill. I am merely opposing the ideas of some .honourable members opposite who would have all the conciliation commissioners appointed from one section of industry.

That has happened before. I realize that there is no hope of preventing the passage of this measure in the form desired by the Government. Steam-roller tactics will be used to.force it through, but as this clause is the very core of the legislation, I implore whoever will be responsible for the appointment of the conciliation commissioners to ignore altogether any pressure that may be brought to bear upon them by any section of industry. This legislation will be on our statute-book for years. The conciliation commissioners will hold office until they reach the age of 65 years, and an immeasurable amount of harm may be done to industry generally and to the workers by the appointment of the wrong men. I sincerely trust that we shall be able to commend the Government for having divorced political considerations from the appointment of these conciliation commissioners, just as the parties now on this side of the chamber, while holding office, refrained from making political appointments. Mrs. BLACKBURN (Bourke) [10.15]. -Honorabl e members opposite have spoken of the risk that they allege will be taken if men who are not members of the legal profession are appointed as conciliation commissioners. Why should we not make experiments? Only by experimenting can we progress. The establishment of the Arbitration Court itself was a great experiment. Speaking of the ""gradual development of standards and practices "" in the solution of actual problems in concilation and arbitration,. Mr Justice Higgins saidI had to learn the business with no book of instructions, no teacher other thanexperience, no kindly light except from tlie Pole Star of justice. What that distinguished gentleman was able to do then surely can be done now Star of justice. Mr O'CONNOR (West Sydney) [10.17] -When the second reading of this measure was being debated, the commissioners. Certain Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) was criticized by the Opposition for his alleged unwillingness to accept amendments or to permit any modification of the Government's original proposals. Since then, we have had submitted to us a list of 54 amendments; but the Attorney-General is now being accused of weakness. Surely, in submitting those amendments, the right honourable gentleman has indicated his willingness, not only to modify the original provisions, but also to accept worthwhile suggestions for the improvement of the measure. In the discussion of the clause now before the Committee, we have heard from honourable members opposite a continuance of the theme that has characterized their case against the bill. The debate has taken on the characteristic form of lawyer versus layman. With the exception of the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Holt), honourable members opposite have failed to qualify their suspicion. They claim that the mere fact a layman may be appointed as a conciliation commissioner will render all the appointments suspect. Why, I am at a loss to know.' Yet we are informed that mere membership of the legal profession automatically removes people from the suspicion that attaches in the minds of honourable gentlemen opposite to laymen. I repeat I do not know why. I leave it to those who have advanced that theme to justify it. The provision for appointment of laymen should have the commendation of all. We are dealing with a form of the national life that has been in existence for 40 years. We have in our midst men who have participated in its development who have not had the opportunity or advantage of going through the university, but who, I say with deference to every one, regardless of their being bereft of an LL.B. degree, can stand up in any company and claim that they have contributed as much to the development of conciliation and arbitration as those in the possession of that degree. Why the appointment of men as conciliation commissioners should be challenged merely because they are not members of the legal fraternity is beyond comprehension. Why members of the legal profession should be exempt from suspicion, if there be suspicion, is something that members of the Opposition cannot explain. Many men without the advantage of a university education have devoted their lifetime to the development of the arbitration system as we know it. With their qualifications and experience they will continue to play a part in the development of the system if they should be appointed as conciliation commissioners. I hope I shall not base my comments on this clause on mere suspicion. We have something much sounder than that on which to base arguments against the proposals contained in this clause. We have heard a great deal about the deficiencies of the present arbitration system. The two main complaints are that not enough emphasis is placed on conciliation, as distinct from arbitration, and that there, is too much delay in the present system. I believe that they are the only two justition commissioners. They are conciliafications advanced for the appointment of these commissioners. I think it is worthwhile in considering whether commissioners should be appointed to analyse the results of arbitration in the last few years. The honourable member would not be in order, in"" doing so. He must confine himself to the appointment of the commissioners. accept your ruling, Mr Chairman; but it is difficult to determine whether we should ' appoint conciliation commissioners if we are not allowed to discuss our experience of conciliation commissioners and the objectives hoped for from the appointment of a new body of conciliation commissioners. We have to be guided in our decision by experience. This provision divides the arbitration system and adds new watertight compartments.. Our experience of the conciliation commissioner system has not been altogether happy. Experience of industrial arbitration has varied from time to time and State to State. Conciliation commissioners, without the powers now proposed for them, have not been satisfactory in New South Wales, but in South Australia the arbitration system has worked extraordinarily satisfactorily in all circumstances. In other words, in South Australia in 1945-46 we lost through industrial disputes only 220 days for every 1000 workers. Chair cannot allow the honourable member to proceed to a general discussion. That speech could have been made on the second reading, but it cannot be made in committee. The honourable member must confine himself to the clause and the amendment. : if the title given to the people to be appointed, namely, conciliation commissioners, clearly denned and limited their powers, I should have no objection to their appointment, but these commissioners will not be only conciliation commissioners, because they will be commissioners with wide arbitral powers, and, consequently, it is misleading for the Attorney-General to designate them in. the bill and the amendments as conciliation and arbitration commissioners and the powers they are to exercise go far beyond the limits of conciliation. It is well for us at this stage to direct attention to that, because, once they are appointed, as we know from the statements of the the Government and those who support them that the commissioners will not be confined to conciliation, but will enter the field of arbitration in its widest sense. It is extraordinary that the Attorney General, after having given time and consideration to and received advice about the bill, should have had to come down with this huge body of amendments before it had passed the second reading.

289,Mr Mcbride,"I hasten to say thatmake confusion more confounded, because we were told in the Attorney General's second-reading speech that the allocation of the duties of the commissioners would bea matter for the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court, but he has now shifted his ground and wants the committee to agree to the appointment of a chief conciliation commissioner who, to all intents and purposes, will exercise the powers that the Attorney-General told us were to be exercised by the Chief Judge. We are not at all aware of the effect that this bill will have on arbitration, because we have not the faintest idea of what form it will take, not only when it leaves this chamber but also when it passes through the Senate. This great experiment, as it has been described, is an experiment made against all our experience in the last two or three years of this kind of arbitration. If the Attorney-General had analysed the results of the various authorities created to assist to distribute functions over a wider field than before the war under the system that he is trying to perpetuate and greatly increase the scope of, I am sure that he would not have brought down the bill in its present form -We had conciliation commissioners during the war and, under the National Security Regulations, their authority was extended until they had certain arbitral powers, which they could exercise subject to the approval of a judge of the Arbitration Court. Now, they are to be given even greater arbitral powers, and they will be"" competent to decide for themselves how those powers shall be used. Neither the Attorney General nor any ' other Minister has cited an example of the effective working of this system since it has been in operation. The fact that we are now experiencing industrial trouble to a greater degree than at any time during the war period indicates the lack of efficiency of the system. That fact is convincing evidence that this method of dividing the arbitration system into watertight compartments has not been successful. The proposed appointments of a chief conciliation commissioner and of fifteen other conciliation commissioners should we endeavour to solve this probwill perpetuate a system which, particularly during the last two years, has failed of all, that we should not employ lawyers. utterly to bring about industrial peace. The Opposition is entitled to cite the facts which T have stated as reasons why the Attorney-General should not press the amendment now before the committee, or any clauses of the bill to which it will' apply, so that the powers of the commissioners will not be extended beyond the scope of conciliation into the field of arbitration. I am sure that, if the Attorney-General were prepared to limit their powers to conciliation, he would have the support of every member of the Opposition. Such a decision would show that the right honourable gentleman is prepared to profit by the experiences of the not far distant past. WhilstI am not opposed to the appointment of conciliation commissioners, as such, or to an increased conciliation effort in industrial disputes, I am strongly opposed to th^ appointment of commissioners with powers such as are proposed in the bill. [10.33] -We have arrived at the stage at which this skeleton of a hill, which will eventually become an act, must be clothed with its meat, which is the most important part of the measure. I refer to the appointment of its personnel. As I have frequently stated in this chamber, the human element is the factor that counts in making an act of Parliament effective. Naturally, we are suspicious of the Government's intentions regarding the appointment of conciliation commissioners, because of recent appointments which it has made and of which we have been very critical. The Government did not cull applicants for those appointments as it should have done. In other words, it did not appoint the men best qualified for the positions which had to be filled. We have an important problem to solve in dealing with this bill. To my mind, the subject of conciliation and arbitration i.= very closely linked with the art of living. If I had sufficient time at my disposal, I should extend my theme a little, and deliver a lecture on town planning. However, I merely remind honourable member? that we have a very important problem to solve in the industrial field and that all Australians are aware of that fact. How lem? Some honourable members say, first I admit that there is a surfeit of lawyers",88,Chairman Order The Attorney General And Other Members Of
290,Mr Mcbride.,,89,Chairman Order The Attorney General And Other Members Of
291,Mr Blain (Northern Territory),"in this chamber and a paucity of other professional men. However, I was delighted to hear the exchange of views that took place to-day between our two leading legal men, the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies). I ask honourable members who criticize lawyers what we should do in the absence of such eminent gentlemen. There is only one way in which we can solve the industrial problem with which we are faced. Eirst, we must obtain the facts of the situation. Then we must analyse those facts-and nobody can be better fitted for that task than men who have had sound legal training. Having' analysed the facts, we must synthesize-that is, build up our solution. Next comes the problem of rounding off the jagged edges of the structure, which might be described as a sphere which has been divided into facets,' until we have a well-rounded figure. Of course, no sphere can be made perfect by human hands, but we can do our best. Having completed our structure, we must ensure that the right men are appointed to carry out the provisions of the bill. We must cull all applicants mercilessly. En order to explain my .point more clearly, I refer to an article written by a British post office surveyor, which I read about eight years ago in the Parliamentary Library in a copy of the Public Administration Journal. British post office surveyors are highly qualified men. I assume that their status is equivalent to that of our own very highly qualified postal inspectors who, in my estimation, rank higher than bank inspectors. honourable member should return to the subject before the committee, namely, the proposed conciliation commissioners. Mr Chairman. I am pointing out how these commissioners should be mercilessly culled by the Government. I am drawing an analogy by referring to a statement in an article written by an eminent British authority. He stated that there was a conflict between administrators and technical and practical men. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr honourable member to relate his remarks Thompson) has said that professional men should not be appointed as conciliation commissioners, but that practical men should be selected. The author of the article to which I have referred stated that no man should be appointed to an administrative post unless he was familiar with the tools which he would be required to use or give decisions on. It is desirable that he should have studied some technical subject sufficiently to know when a thing is proved. He would be fighting against odds unless he had the requisite professional training. This is a fact, whether he had studied the solution of abstruse problems of astronomy , or mathematics, or the science of botany. Without technical knowledge and ability, a man is unfitted to deal with 'a technical subject. The Government should appoint highly qualified technical men to act as conciliation commissioners. I hope that it will not repeat the foolish mistakes which it made in recent public appointments. There is a wider, aspect of this matter which has not yet been discussed. I have not heard any honourable member refer to the appointment of conciliation commissioners in the northern areas of Australia. What does a man in Perth or Bridgetown know of conditions in Broome? What does a man in Sydney know of conditions in Cairns and Townsville ? Even more important, what would'any of them know of the tropical conditions'in Darwin, under which men have to work? I have heard a good deal of criticism of workers in the northern areas,and some of it was justified, but I point out that a considerable volume of scientific data on the subject was collected by doctors not only before World -War II . but also during that conflict. They Order! The created artificial conditions in the holds of ships in order to study the effects of humidity, and to ascertain how many hours a. man could work efficiently under such conditions in Darwin, Cairns or Broome. But those matters have not been discussed this evening. I have heard a good deal of criticism-som e of it justified-of waterside workers in Darwin, but axemen and others who have worked for me in camps to the clause. * a conciliation commissioner, whose duties",89,Chairman Order The Attorney General And Other Members Of

The Attorney-General assured honourable members that the conciliation commissioners will not have power to determine hours of labour, but undoubtedly they will be asked to advise the judges of the Arbitration Court on this matter. In my opinion, it will be foolish to create fifteen conciliation commissioners. I am always suspicious of a proposal to vest authority in one man, because he may prove to be a martinet. I prefer the appointment of five committees of three men. Before a final decision is made, the Attorney-General should seriously consider this suggestion, and, in particular, ensure that the northern areas shall be served by a conciliation commissioner -who is familiar with tropical conditions. Br. EVATT (Barton-Attorney-Genera l and 'Minister for External Affairs) [10.43] -The discussion on this clause has covered a wide field Some honourable members have described this provision as representing the core of the bill. In my reply, I shall not attempt to repeat the arguments that were advanced on behalf of the ^Government for the adoption of this principle. which honourable members are most interested is the qualifications that should be possessed by a conciliation commissioner. As the honourable member for ciliation commissioner who is appointed under this legislation.will not be merely a commissioner of conciliation. He will have important arbitral functions. appointees be known as conciliation commissioners? to-day, these officials are described as conciliation commissioners, and they exercise, under certain safeguards and protections, arbitral functions. not provided in this bill. ( Mr Chifley) gave to the committee a positive assurance regarding the qualifications which would be sought in the' conciliation commissioners. The right honourable gentleman did not give' any specific undertaking regarding the distribution of the conciliation commissioners on the basis of their knowledge of local conditions in various parts of Australia. . The honourable member for Barker( Mr Aichie Cameron) completely failed to understand what the Prime Minister and I stated. ""We both said that, in fixing the number of conciliation commissioners at fifteen, we had consulted, not fellow Ministers, but judges of the Arbitration Court. I do not know how the honourable member misunderstood that perfectly clear statement. the same time. described it as a cantata, but it was in perfect unison and probably monotonous, because we both said the same thing, and it was correct. The fifteen commissioners might prove to be too small in number, having regard to the enormous expense of dispute and dislocation in industry in any part of Australia or its territories. This provision simply deals with the appointment of a chief conciliation commissioner in order that he may allocate the work among the conciliation commissioners. That will not affect the other The crucial point in provision which gives to the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court the right to assign commissioners to various industries. I am not attempting to repeat the general argument in favour of the bill, which the House accepted by granting the second reading, but I submit that the plan, if properly carried out, is dependent upon the personnel who will administer it.. "" What e'er is best administered is best"", and it will be very difficult to get the right men for these positions.

How can the Government appoint people to administer the arbitration system who do not believe in. arbitration? I might give a long list of groups of people who would not be .appointed as conciliation commissioners. In this discussion, reference has been made to the suitability of members of the legal profession as conciliation commissioners. I disagree entirely with many of the remarks which some speakers have made on this subject. For more than twenty years, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and I have had experience of the system of industrial arbitration in Commonwealth, and State spheres. The man who, through a long study not merely of books but of the industry itself, became pre-eminent as an authority on the metal trades was Judge O'Mara. He did not begin with .a profound knowledge of the industry, but subsequently any person who had a problem in connection with the metal tice Higgins, Mr Justice Piddington and -Chief pioneers of this system, were lawyers. Various men with legal training have ""been imbued with ideals of social justice. But having said that, that does not ex-clude well qualified people who have not got the particular legal qualifications. We have agreed as a committee that certain men whose names have been mentioned, Messrs. Mooney, Morrison and Rowlands, and others who have been out.standingly successful in. carrying out the functions of conciliation commissioners .are fitted for appointments. The mere possession of a legal qualification w ill not make the individual concerned a success-, f u l arbitrator any more than the absence -of such a qualification disqualifies him fro m being a successful arbitrator. the result this clause does not debar lawyers, or even judges, from filling these positions and should not if they are quali.fied in other respects to discharge the duties. In the list of applicants for appointment w ill be found a very large number of individuals who have already have had considerable experience of the the Attorneyadministration of industrial arbitration in the States, and I have every confidence that the panel when finally appointed w ill T h a t has been said be one which the people of Australia w ill accept.

The intention of the bill, broadly speaking, is to place conciliation commissioners in the same position in relation to the F u l l Arbitration Court as that of a single judge in relation to the F u l l A r b i tration Court under the existing law. A t present a single judge may make an award relating to standard hours and the basic wage, but he is debarred from altering the standard hours or the basic wage. The amendment preserves that position. the Opposition) [11.14] I should like to be clearer on this point than I now am. The proposed new section contains' the words. . . make an order or award in relation tola) the standard hours of work in an industry; I agree that the proposal to substitute the word. "" altering "" for the words "" in relation to "" brings the proposed new section into line with the existing act, but I am not altogether happy about the word "" altering "". Let us suppose that a conciliation commissioner is dealing w i th a dispute and that some one says that the standard hours ought to be 40 or 44 a week. then hears argument and decides that the standard hours ought to be 44 a week. In that event, he has, in reality, made a decision in respect of standard, hours, although he has not altered them. He could, in fact, hear argument, but he would not exceed his jurisdiction unless' he gave a decision in favour of a shorter working week. We ought to be clear as to how the different authorities w ill work. It is true that at present there is the F u l l Court and single judges, but they are all judges, and they sit either in f u l l court or as single judges. Now we are to have conciliation commissioners, and distinct from them the F u l l Court of judges in the Arbitration Court. What w ill the F u l l Court do? How w ill the matter of standard hours, the basic wage, or annual leave come before it? We can only assume that, in some mysterious fashion, these matters w ill be referred to the F u l l Court by some one, and that the F u l l Court w ill come to a conclusion that the standard hours of work shall be, let us say, 42 hours. It w i ll be seen that I have adopted a middle course for the sake of argument, and to avoid confusion. W ill the conciliation commissioner then be bound automatically to apply that decision? Let us suppose that a special case is put up that, in a particular industry or class of work, the hours ought to be more or less. It may be that in a particularly strenuous industry it w ill be suggested that the standard hours should be 36, or even 32, a week. W ill the F u l l Court determine that matter, and, if so, w ill the conciliation commissioner merely have to say that no argument can arise as the standard hours that have already been fixed ? In my opinion, it would be better to use the word "" determining"". The determining of standard hours or the basic wage is a matter entirely outside the jurisdiction of a conciliation commissioner. A man might hear a lot of argument and say that the standard hours should be 40 a week. If that decision agreed w i th the decision of the F u l l Courti t would not be a violation of this provision, but otherwise it would be a violation. If we are to ask three judges to determine the four important matters referred to in proposed new section 16 it should be made clear that those matters are not to be debated before a conciliation The conciliation commissioner commissioner. They w ill be determined by the judges. If they are not to be debated, the conciliation commissioner ought not have the power to determine them, even though his determination is in line w i th the decision of the F u l l Court.

Proposed new section 28 gives the court jurisdiction to make an order or award determining the standard hours of work in an industry. If the provision remains as originally proposed, a conciliation commissioner dealing with an application before him in respect of an industry in which the question of standard hours is included, and which is therefore part of a dispute, could not do anything in the matter if there were no claim to have standard hours in that industry altered.

Indeed, Mr Hasluck has for some considerable time past expressed a desire to relinquish his employment in the department i:i order to free himself to carry out important work which he had previously undertaken to perform in connection with the writing of portion of the official history of the war. It is on personal grounds that Mr Hasluck's resignation was tendered late in February last, and an arrangement has been made for accepting the resignation and for Mr Hasluck's taking leave before completing his work in the Australian Mission in New York. In acknowledging completion of arrangements for winding up his work at the United Nations' Head-quarters, Mr Hasluck addressed the-Minister for External Affairs as follows:"" I should like to take this opportunity of expressing .my continued admiration and respect for your achievements in developing Australian foreign policy. It was an honour and a privilege to be associated even in a small way with applying tliat policy in the establishment and growth of the United Nations and, as an Australian. 1 feel proud of what has been done by you personally and under your instructions in helping to build the new organization on a basis of principle. While I was moved to resign from the department for reasons given in previous communications, my interest in the advancement of the purposes of the Charter is unchanged and I beg you to accept -my best wishes for the further success of your own and the department's labours to that end "".
