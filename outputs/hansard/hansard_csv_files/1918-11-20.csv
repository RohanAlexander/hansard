I understand that he has received two reports from the Director, which I have no doubt he will lay before the House. have been handed to me by the D i r e c to r of Q u a r a n t in e, and I s u b m it t h e m for the in for m a t i o n of honourable members:The Comptroller-General. W it h reference to complaints in the daily press amongst the passengers on the steamer Atua, concerning conditions at the Quarantine Station, Sydney, the following facts have been ascertained on inquiry:2. The principal complaint is the condition of the rooms in which the passengers were accommodated. There was a very heavy strain on the resources of the Station during last week, several big passenger vessels following eacholher in quick succession. Although the rooms were cleaned out by the stewards of the vessel which was .just completing its period of quarantine, it was impossible for the staff, available to absolutely insure the degree of cleanliness which is required under routine conditions, without subjecting the passengers to further delay on the vessel in harbour. This course of detaining the passengers on the steamer was adopted in all the other vessels, giving sufficient time to have the quarters cleaned; but, in the case of the Atua, the disease was so virulent, and spreading so ; rapidly, that it was imperative to land the patients and all contacts at the earliest possible moment. The risk of retaining them on the ship was greater than the inconvenience caused by occupying rooms not superficially clean. 3. Some difficulty has been experienced during last week in Sydney, owing in the first place to the very great difficulty in getting reliable medical staff on account of the shortage of doctors, and on account of the jubilations in .Sydney, it was impossible to get temporary assistance of other kinds. The infection risk and the fear of contracting the disease was also a material faefpr in contributing to this difficulty. 4. The statement as.to the distinctly ill persons visiting others ia quite inaccurate. There is a regular inspection of all persons, and any once removed. I ask t h e Act in g P r i m e 5. The electric light is turned off at -10.15 p.m., as the Regulations prescribe that lights shall be out on a Quarantine Station about 10.30 p.m. Some Regulation of this kind is absolutely essential to the maintenance of reasonable order on the Station. 6. In the telephone rooms, there is kept a bowl of solution and a cloth, so that any perA s I promised the honson can clean the receivers. It would be quite impossible to have sufficient staff to clean the receiver after each person has used it . 7. The-statement that there is no laundry is quite inaccurate, as there is a .steam laundry capable of handling large quantities of material. 8. Ice is not supplied to passengers under any circumstances, as there does not seem to be any necessity for doing so. 9. The food complaint is not given in sufficient detail to be quite understood, and there The f o l l o w in g reports haa_ been no complaint received in respect of patients in hospital. All catering for the passengers, other than those in hospital, is carried out .by the ship's company-the Purser being responsible. 10. In the case of the Atua, one unavoidable factor did contribute to initial confusion? The Chief Steward came ashore in accordance w i th the usual practice, and allotted the rooms for the passengers. Before the passengers were landed, however, the Chief Steward himself went down w it h a severe attack of influenza, and has since died. A t the time of the steward's removal, the landing was in progress, and the confusion arose owing to passengers seizing the best rooms, and a re-allotment having to be forcibly instituted in order to provide the best accommodation for ladies and families. J. H. L. CUMPSTON, Director of Quarantine. 19th November, 1918. The Comptroller-General. It w ill also be of interest in connection with Mr West's statements to state the following:Fourteen ships . have been dealt with in quarantine in Sydney, with a total personnel of approximately 3,500 within the last fortnight. 2. The infection has been kept within such limits that no persons have been infected beyond those presumably infected before the application of the prescribed measures. 3. F u l l preparations and accommodation w ill have been made, and f u l l staff available, before the arrival of the troopships from New Zealand. 4. The staff at Sydney has necessarily been working at high pressure, and should be given f u l l credit for the fact that all infection has been .kept under control, and the entry of the disease into ' Australia so far absolutely prevented.

Minister) [3.48] I very much regret that the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler) has seen fit to submit this motion, not because he is not entitled to his opinion, or merely, because that opinion differs very substantially from my own, but because the honourable member is committing the same fault as he alleges against the Prime Minister. I have naturally read very carefully all the cablesand comments that have appeared in the Australian press relating to the Prime Minister's utterances! I think I know them as well as the honourable member himself does, and I hold that it is quite unfair to judge the Prime Minister's utterances by cables hastily thrown out over the wire and torn from tlieir context. If the honourable member will look up the cables that appeared on 14th November in the morning and evening newspapers of Australia that have different cable services, he will see that the very speech on which he has laid so much stress, containing the statement that ""Australia will get nothing at all for her sacrifices,"" is differently reported in diffree lance in this House, shall I say, feels ferent newspapers. come over the different cable services, they todians of the highest interests of Ausdiffer widely in their phraseology and interpretation. The honourable member is really judging the Prime Minister's utterances by what has appeared in the cable and news columns of the daily papers. ThatI am not prepared to do. I admit with him at once that his comments, and the speeches of the Prime Minister, raise extremely important and delicate questionsThey may from some aspects be said to affect the attitude of Great Britain towards the Dominions, and may affect, to some extent, the sentiment and bond of Empire, if improperly handled here or there. Our wisest course is to find out exactly what has occurred, and the causes of the occurrences before we judge them: I am not going by one word or one inunfair flection of voice to comment upon the Prime Minister's utterances. I am, and have been, for almost a week in cable communication with him with the object of endeavouring to ascertain for the information of the Government all that has taken place ih Great Britain in order that the views of the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy, who is next in seniority, as well as their colleagues remaining in Australia, may be co-ordinated. It is impossible to do this in a few days, and I deprecate any rash endeavour to stir up the House or the country before the position is truly understood. A t the proper time-whe n the Government consider that they are in possession of full information as to the circumstancesthey will tell the House what they think of tlie conditions in the Mother Country. And they will do so, I trust, with true regard to the magnitude and variety of the interests affected. But while the honourable member as an individual member of this House is entirely free to express his opinions concerning a man he has never liked tagonism to the Prime Minister. that. While the honourable member, as a at perfect liberty to pronounce upon the utterances of the Prime Minister as cabled, the Government are not in that position, and we, for the time being, are the custralia. I shall go no further except to say that my honourable friend ( Mr Fowler) may believe in his conscience that he is unbiased-and I know what a Scotchman's conscience is elastic of consciences. While the honourable member for Perth thoroughly believes that he is quite free to discuss in an impersonal way the utterances of the Prime Minister, I do not believe that he is. In my opinion, the honourable member's mind is so rigidly and inflexibly bent upon criticism of the Prime Minister,'that he cannot be fair to him. to him.",29,Accommodation At Statements Made I N Great Britain By Mr

In this cable message the Prime Minister is -reported to have saidI t was an unquestionable fact that the Dominions were not being consulted by the Imperial Government in regard to foreign affairs as they expected, and had the right to expect. That is a sentiment to which expression has been given in this House, but while a private member may, if he chooses, talk in this way, the wisdom of such utterances on the part of the Prime Minister is seriously open to question. To my amazement, and no doubt to the amazement of Ministerial supporters, we find the Ministerf o r the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) also taking exception to the manner of the British Government's explanation. He is reported to have said that it was merely a statement in the press; that it was unsigned, and he concluded hy saying that "" the Allies seemed in a great hurry to bind themselves to the greatest of all our enemies.""

All matters affecting the relations T e l l us w h y , yoiir between the British Government and the Commonwealth Government are settled, by Mr Hughes and British Ministers, without Sir Joseph Cook being consulted.

That statement was published on the 18th September, covering the period mentioned by the newspaper correspondent. mation. ister in that Ministerial statement saidThe Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy are still in Britain. Their work at the War Cabinet and the Empire Conference has been of the utmost consequence to the future of the Commonwealth. They are at present endeavouring £6' remove the great and increasing difficulties surrounding the sale and shipment of our products, upon which so much depends for the preservation of our prosperity. A t the time those words were used the two gentlemen were not meeting. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) believed they were; but I venture to say that the Age correspondent, if put on oath, would be able to swear truth f u l l y that the description he gives of the relations between the two Ministers, in the period covered, is absolutely correct. I do .not think it will be suggested against myselfthat, in my few remarks I am actuated in the remotest degree by ill-feteling towards .the Prijme Minister( Mr Hughes). That honourable gentleman is the Leader of the Nationalist party, and he is a man for whom I have great regard and very cordial feeling. A t the same time. I reserve the right to differ if I think proper, from anything he may say or do, and to-day I intend to adopted by him . I hope that this attitude is characteristic, at all events, of members of the party.on this side-^-that they feel at the fullest liberty in this connection. I admit the difficulty of the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) under all the circumstances. I do-not see how it would have been possible for him to give any other reply than that he has given. The honourable gentleman said, from 'his stand-point, that we have a right to have the f u l l context of the speeches referred to before we can f a i r l y judge. of course, is a sound principle to "" follow; but the statements a have been repeated on several occasions, and some have been replied to by British Ministers. If I understand these statements at all, they amount to a deliberate charge against British Ministers of be-, traying Australian interests; and I . for It wasbased on my inforone, am not prepared to think that such a thing is possible. British Ministers in their replies have said that, so far, they have, practically, fixed only the military and naval conditions for the cessation of -hostilities. In consultation with the leaders of the A r m y and the Navy they have fixed the terms of the armistice; in other words, they have, no doubt, accepted the advice of those leaders. That is a matter in which the representatives of the British Empire, as an Empire,-consulted w i th its Allies; and the terms were ultimately fixed. Theni t is said that at the Versailles Conference the fourteen points of President Wilson were discussed, and the answer by British Ministers to that is that nothing that was done at that Conference was inconsistent w i th what was understood and agreed to by the Imperial War Cabinet, of which the PrimeM in -iser ( Mr Hughes) was a"" member. Further, B r it is h Ministers give us tlie ( broad general assurance that Australian interests were protected at the Imperial War Cabinet, and that those interests have not -since been prejudiced by the -underStanding arrived at at Versailles. I cannot overlook the fact-and neither should the House overlook it-that the PrimeM in ister ( Mr Hughes) is singular in the attitude he has taken up.. Were Dominion protest against certain methods interests to be prejudiced in the slightest degree by what has been done by British Ministers, there would be a universal public protest on the part of the Dominion representatives; but, on the contrary, as we heard from the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), who quoted from a speech by a representative of the 'South African Government."" That gentleman, soeakinar with knowledge and responsibilitv. gives a f i r m and definite assurance that Dominion interests are f u l l y and completely conserved.

I was talking a moment ago about representatives of other Dominions. So far as the 'German colonies are concerned, we"" have a definite statement, repeated times out of number, by , Mr Massey .and Sir Joseph Ward, .as representing New Zealand, that under no circumstances would they be parties to their return to iGermany. 'Those gentlemen have .registered their fixed determination in this regard. Would they remain silent if New .Zealand interests were imperilled'? I am sure they would not. They clearly .must have satisfactory assurances from the British Government. Moreover, we have the public utterances of leading members of the Imperial Government, Mr Walter long and Mr Balfour, who have assured us that these colonies shall not' be returned, to Germany. Bonar Law. am justified in adding even the Imperial Prime Minister. It has been suggested by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) that the fourteen points of President Wilson, which were considered at the Versailles, Conference, will prejudice us in regard to -these colonies. If that really is the honortherefore able to quote. able gentleman's suggestion or definite statement, I am not prepared to accept it . Unfortunately, I have not the fourteen -points before me; and while I admit at once that I have no great admiration for -them-thoug h that is beside the present question-the fact remains that most of them deal with the restoration of territory seized by our enemies. Those fourteen points' were issued on the8th January this .year, and 'President Wilson is careful now to say that they are subsertion again, in the second part, .of the mitted as a basis, together with modificawords, "" so far as possible."" tions and terms set forth in various other speeches made by him in the meantime. However, for the most ""part, as I say, these fourteen points 'deal with territory seized from our Allies by the enemy. When we come 'to the two points to The British Government and which definite exception is taken, I submit that they do not bear the construction which has been placed upon them by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). Even within those fourteen points, were they to form a basis for peace discussion the most 'elastic powers are given, and particularly is that so with regard to the former .Possessions of Germany. It is perfectly clear that not one word of President Wilson's fourteen points justifies the suggestion that the Allies are bound 'to return the German colonies : to Germany. As to the other point which has been referred to, it is suggested that, if it is possible-thos e are the words ""which occur to my mind-fisca l barriers should be removed and equality of trade established. Mr WA,T!E -"".S o far as possible."" the words used, .and this (point, I think, had some reference to the Paris Conference resolutions.

This point is really a mere pious abstract statement of an ideal that should beaimed at, and there is nothing in it which can be suggested as likely to prejudice the interests of Australia. ' A pamphlet containing the fourteen points has just been handed to me, and T am The point referred to readsThe' ""removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among 'all nations consenting to the 'Peace, and associating themselves for its maintenance.

If it were necessary to do anything at all in this regard, Mr Hughes has established himself in such a position of influence that his representations privately to British Ministers, or in conference with British M'inisterSj would have secured the most fijim and definite assurances in connection withi those matters in regard tor which he felt: the remotest degree of uncertainty.

B r it a in as, perhaps, any other member in this House, but I do not f orget that, , not once, or twice, but. right, along the line in the development of British Colonial Possessions, Imperial statesmen have Blundered. I do not forget that had it not been for their blunders, the war would not have been fought so successfully I shall not detain by Germany for so long. I . do not forget that if British statesmen had not given Heligoland to Germany the history of the war would have been different. I do not forget, also, that if they had not repudiated the action, of an Australian statesman when he took possession pf New Guinea, the question of handing German New Guinea back to ' Germany would not now have arisen. And so, while I have the utmost respect for the present leaders of the British people, I ask that the same confidence be. reposed in those who are representing Australia in England, at all events until we have something more definite than that which the honourable member for Perth has placed before, the.

204,Mr Hector Lamond ( I L L A WA R R A ),"us believe, Sir Joseph. Cook and the Prime Minister were not getting on too -well together in England, and that they had not had opportunities of seeing each other, the fact that Sir Joseph Cook is taking action in support of the Prime Minister's remarks is the strongest proof we could have that there is something more than the cables have told us behind the attitude of the Prime Minister. I should say also to those -who suggest that the Prime Minister is merely taking up this attitude because of some personal advantage which might accrue to him, that his path to honours and distinctions would probably lie more in the direction of agreeing, than in disagreeing, with the Government of Great ""Britain at the present time. From the purely personal point of view, he would escape very much hard work. :and much of the mud that is thrown about in .political conflicts, if he simply acquiesced in what the British Government have done, instead of .defending Australia a t a time when, perhaps., Australia needs defending. this reason, also, I am inclined to think that the Prime Minister has not entered upon .this course of action without very good reason. The honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) suggests that he could have gained what he is asking for by a private conference. sort of thing. the Prime Minister could be depended upon to exhaust all the opportunities afforded by private conferences before he 'came out in public to make his quarrel with the British Government. the cables, he said the matters had not been discussed. ment referred to the Imperial War Cabinet, but the honourable member for Kooyong suggested that the Prime Minister cculd"" get what he wanted by a private conference with the Imperial Government. Anybody who knows . Mr Hughes can hardly assume that he did not use that method before he resorted to the more public one of expressing publicly, his disapproval of the action that has been taken. The position he has [293]2 adopted in England is not the easiest for .himself. He has to fight, as Australia w ill have to fight at the Peace table I have never had any illusions in regard to the difficult' position of Australia after' 'thewar. When honourable members opposite prevented the Prime Minister from being in England at a most critical time to assist in the solution -of problems that most affect us, I maintained, 'as I stall maintain, that Australia bas a special interest in the peace settlement which is not -common to the other Dominions, or to Great Britain herself, and that for that reason TV,O' have -the 'greater :need of effective representation and persistent and unflagging presentation of our claims. -The fact that we have in England at the present time two of the leading members of the M in is t ry is one on which Australia should be congratulated.

As I have fought Mr Hughes for over twelve years, honourable members may think that I shall allow personal animosities to tinge my remarks, hut I intend to let the past rest. AllI shall do in that regard is to challenge any honourable member opposite to go through Hansard and disprove any statement of mine reported there. Attention should be drawn to the matters which the honourable member for Perth has papers for drawing attention to them, because the two great questions of Tariff Protection and the payment of an indemnity have been left in abeyance by Mr Hughes. Some time ago I showed the Cabinet, as I showed him, that Japan could not possibly object to our passing a Tariffi f we copied the Japanese Tariff. Imitation, it is said, is the sincerest form of flattery, and Japan, which has done its duty as an Ally, would not object to our imitating its example. Our manufactures, which have been saved by the protection afforded by the difficulty of sending ships here, will die if they are not properly protected. America, with its tremendous facilities for building vessels, will soon remove that natural protection, and ships will shortly be steaming towards our ports in hundreds. I maintain, therefore, that the Government have shown that they lack prescience in not taking action to pass a Tariff long ago. If they are afraid of offending a country that has been a splendid ally to us, then let them adopt the Japanese Tariff. I asked Mr Hughes time and time again, and I also asked him through other honourable members, to face the question of an indemnity by Germany, over twjo and a half years ago.

The question of an indemnity must be considered, and it is of no use for Mr. Hughes to say that he was not aware of its importance. The following letter was sent to him by a member of the legal profession, whom the Bulletin regards as possessing one of the best legal minds in Australia34 Queen-street, Melbourne, 28th March, 1918. Dear Mr Hughes, 1. Hasi t occurred to you that no business man would think of going away on a mission to England without ascertaining from his principals what their instructions were, what he was to ask for, and what he was to do, and what were the minimum terms that could be or should be accepted in relation to any claim? 2. No business man would send any agent, no matter who he was, or how able he was, with a blank sheet of. paper. Nor would any business man accept such a mission. 3. It would be a reflection on the intelligence of both the principals and the agent instead of being a compliment to the agent. 4. The question of the rights of Australia are too serious to be left in the air. If you were to go to England and come back with an announcement you had not made certain claims, you, of course, could reasonably claim that your principals had not thought it worthwhile to define them, since either they did not know what they wanted, or could not make up their minds. You could thus escape lia1 bility, or freedom from criticism. 5. It is clear that if you go to London to maintain Australia's demand that no German Colonies shall be returned to Germany, you are face to face with a dilemma. The Senate has affirmed this demand, but the House'of Representatives have either thought it unimportant, or object to this, since they had not acted. 6. Surely you will obtain a unanimous resor lution of both Houses of Parliament, otherwise you will be met with the obvious criticism that you have no authority to represent Australia on this subject. 7. Australia has not yet spoken. Similarly, what does Australia want for the blood and treasure she has poured out in defence of Australian, as well as British, liberty. 8. Has Australia the right to be repaid the £400,000,000, Australia's cost of the war, apart from the huge future expenditure on account of pensions, repatriation, and settlement of soldiers on land?

Having reference to the statement oj the Assistant Minister for Defence (see Hansard, p. 7108, 24th October) that an Australian officer cannot appeal to the Governor General aS the King's Representative-for rodress of a grievance, is it not a fact that a British officer can appeal to the King for redress of a grievance ? 2. Why is an Australian officer rot allowed to' appeal for redress of a grievance to the Governor General as the King's Representative? orable member's questions are as follow :1. A British officer who * thinks himself wronged may submit his case to the Army Council, who are required to make a report to His Majesty thereon. A British officer cannot address his complaint to His Majesty directly, but must address it to the Army Council. When on active service an Australian officer may submit his complaint through the Military Board to the Governor General, but not otherwise. 2. The Regulations confer on the Military Board the right to deal with complaints, but give no right to an officer in Australia to complain to the Governor General. Ministerf o r the Navy, upon noticeWhether the Minister can give the House th"" following information:1. The quantity of coastal shipping release! for overseas war purposes? 2. The chief reasons for the' retention of those vessels on the coastal trade and the class of special freight carried by them having immediate relation to war effort? honourable member's questions are as follow:1. 48.7 per cent, of the Australian coastal shipping has been released for overseas war purposes. 2. The effect of withdrawing the balance' of the coastal shipping would be:(a) to cut off maintenance and distribution of food supplies. Steamers at present engaged in oversea trading and which depend upon replenishing their bunkers at various Australian coaling ports, would require to shut out thousands of tons of cargo. (&) The supplies of ironstone from Hiimmocky Hill and limestone from Tasmania, required by the Broken Hill Proprietary Works in Newcastle, amounting to approximately 300,00ft tons per annum, would be immediately cut off, and these works would close. (e) The bulk of the sugar crop from Queensland would be lost, as it could not be transported. [d) The copper, lead, and zinc mines producing metals urgently wanted by the Allies would cease operations. (e) The output of the coal mines in Newcastle would be materially reduced. ' ( f ) Gas and electric light works requiring New South Wales coal in various States would be unable to obtain supplies. (g) The majority of the various industries and manufactories throughout the Commonwealth depending on coal, gas, and electricity for their power would close down. (h) Workers throughout Australia depending on wharf or other allied work would be thrown out of employment. (t) State railways in Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia would require to materially reduce their services owing to inability to obtain coal supplies. . (/) The cost of living would increase throughout the various States. DR.

MAIL CONTRACTS. question asked me in the House recently .by the honourable member for Cowper( Mr John Thomson) relative to preference to returned soldiers in connection with mail contracts, I am in receipt of the following reply from the Comptroller of the Department of Repatriation:I have to advise that, following upon the determination of the Commonwealth Government to give preference of employment to returned soldiers, the Postmaster-General's Department issued instructions that, in calling for tenders for mail 'contracts, a returned soldier holding a good discharge should be allowed to indicate the fact that he was a returned soldier by endorsing it upon' his application. It was the practice, however, that where the amount of a tender submitted by a retiring contractor was not more than 5 per cent, higher than that of the lowest tender, a -renewal of the contract should be approved. The Postmaster-General's Department has now intimated that this 5 per cent, preference does not operate against a returned soldier, and that only the actual tender prices are taken into consideration. vember, the honourable member for Mel' Now that thewar is ended, will the Defence Department remit the terrible, punishments and who are the only race amongst those fights for such treatment?

The honourable member has referred to men in his electorate who have travelled long distances in order to record their votes. people with such enthusiasm; but the fact is that there are many people who are not prepared -to go even 10 miles to vote. MT. FENTON -Should we cater for them ? are many persons who are genuinely unable to get to a polling booth, and we should offer improved facilities for them, to exercise the franchise. Having regard to the rigid safeguards which are provided, I hope the amendment will be accepted. -The Bill, as.it left this Chamber, made ample provision for those who were unable to vote on account of illness. This amendment will make it easier than is necessary for able-bodied people to record their votes without going to a polling booth. The Minister would be wise if he were to adhere to the 15 miles minimum. I quite agree with the view which has been iexpressed by the honourable member for Maranoa. Of course, we all recognise that we have never had presiding over our Electoral Department a Minister possessed of a greater desire to deal justly with all political parties than is the Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr constituency. But I was very much surGlynn). Buti t is necessary for us to clip the wings of the smart people who are anxious to take advantage of the provision which we are now considering. The request we are making to the Minister to adhere to the distance originally set out in this clause is absolutely a reasonable one. We have already provided that, the inmates of ouir hospitals shall be free from the attentions of political canvassers, and in view of the fact that provision has already been made under which sick and infirm persons will be able to record their votes, why should we provide facilities for able-bodied electors to vote by post? Provision has also heen made in this Bill for absent voting. But that vote has to be recorded iw the presence of a deputy returning officer and his poll clerk, and, consequently, it is surrounded with reasonable safeguards. As electors are at liberty to vote outside the subdivision for which they are enrolled, why should we further encourage the system of postal voting, especially in view of the abuses which have been as I would that there were more sociated with it in the past? cities have much greater facilities for voting than have country electors. absent on polling day from his own subdivision he isentitled to vote as 'an absent voter. away from his own division. now proposed that if an elector be more than 10 miles distant from a polling booth on polling day he shall have the right to vote by post. I ask the Minister to disagree with the Senate's amendment. toral Registrar having been abolished, it seems only fair that we should shorten the distance. ter like this, 15 miles represents a very fair compromise. No argument has been advanced why the Committee should alter the decision at which it previously arrived. well understand the honourable member for Maribyrnong arguing as he did, because the postal voting provisions of this Bill will not affect a single elector in his prised at the attitude taken up by the honourable member for Maranoa.

I do not think it is right that our farmers should be compelled to suspend their labours and practically to down tools in order that they may attend a polling booth for the purpose of recording their votes. They can vote by post equally well.

The honourable member who has just resumed his seat sought to justify this amendment on the ground that we ought to provide country electors with greater facilities to record their votes. But while the honourable member professes to be anxious to do that, in reality he seeks to deprive them of such facilities, inasmuch as they are to be prevented from recording tlieir votes before an electoral regismission has investigated this matter since trar prior to polling day.

310,Mr Atkinson,"But this is anotheragainst postal voting. The honourable, member stated that the Electoral Commission had found nothing serious in the operation of postal voting. I,will quote one reference, which was endorsed unanimously by members of that Commission. We felt that the position was serious enough for us to place the following words on record as a recommendation to the Government:The electoral law should not be forged as a party weapon, but should aim at making it possible for every elector to record his vote. Apparently, about 77,000 electors were unable to vote at the election in consequence of the abolition of postal-voting facilities, many of whom would be the .mothers of our people,. fulfilling the noblest duties of life, and would have a keener personal interest in-the government' of the country than many who recorded votes. We, therefore, suggest the amendment of the Act to provide for postal voting prior to the day of election, with Sufficient statutory safeguards. I do not think that the evils of which I have spoken will be so strongly marked under the present measure. I am confident that the electoral officers will do their duty, and will not permit any injustice if they have the power to stop it ; but the limit of 15 miles is little enough. I have trudged thigh deep in mud to give ray vote at a certain election, and I occupied seven hours in walking 11 miles. ber could not expect women to do that. there are few people resident 15 miles from a polling booth who could not secure a l if t in a vehicle on election day. honourable member for Calare( Mr vote. To-day, however, the boot is on Pigott), in asking that the limit should be 10 miles instead of 15, furnished a Strong argument why the clause should remain as it was originally. He. said that there were men engaged in harvesting,, and he asked whether employers should be put to trouble and inconvenience through those men leaving their work to go into a township to vote, when they could, vote by post if it were provided that the limit be 10 miles. I know something about influence having been brought to bear on employees by employers. The honourable member for Calare said that such things-if they ever happened-oc curred years ago, and would not be repeated now. But they do occur now, and at every opportunity. I urge the Minister( Mr Glynn) to leave the Bill as he introduced-it. There is a by-election pending; and if , in the light of experience, if is found that the law requires amendment with respect to postal voting, it will be easy for the Government to make the limit 10 miles instead of 15. But I again ask why there should be all this haste with regard to this Electoral Bill? I think an answer is to be found in the fact that we happened to shoot a "" swan."" In Queensland, there have been occurrences which might well be described as political atrocities. Influence was brought tp bear upon employees by employers. I may say that, ever since I have had a vote in Australia, I have done as I wished, whether my boss liked it or not. as you wished. always prepared to give a fair thing to my boss. I would never undertake day work where I could get piece-work. There is no employer for whom I have ever worked who would not take me back now, provided 1 was of the same age and capabilities as when he employed me. If a man on a station has a wife and four or five children, there are more than"" fifty ways by which an employer could tell that man how and for whom he should record his vote; and, often enough, in order to keep a roof over the heads of his family, a man would practically sell his the other foot. We do not do what the boss tells us. in Queensland. He does what we tell him. . iSo far as the merits of 10 miles as against 15 miles are concerned, I would be satisfied to do away with all limitations. Then all parties would be able to Start from scratch; and, if it comes to manipulating voting at an election, I would be prepared to give any man all he wanted. What we desire is a square go.

The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) has pointed out that, on the occasion of a general election, more postal votes were cast in respect of a .subdivision running from Spring-street to Elizabeth Street; and from Bourke-street .to Victoriastreet than were polled in the whole of Western Australia. postal voting system .has been abused. the honourable member's own party were unable to show ihe Electoral 'Commission that' it had been abused before. for Melbourne denies that -statement. he sign our report? that it is mentioned in the report of the Commission that the number of postal votes recorded in respect of a small 'subdivision of the electorate of Melbourne was equal to the total postal votes cast for Western Australia, and that, on the occasion of 'two different elections, there were more postal votes in Telation to that one subdivision than were cast for the whole State of Tasmania. Again, in the electorate of Kooyong, the postal votes -recorded were eight times as many as those recorded for the neighbouring electorate of Yarra. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mav Foster) says that no abuse of the postal voting .system was briought under :the notice of the Electoral Commission. Isi t not well known that when the system was previously in force, domestic .servants were practically compelled to vote by post, so that their employers might know how they were voting? that effect were made, but every witness before the Electoral Commission said -that he did not know of one specific case of the kind. -the difference between the postal votes -recorded in these two electorates is to be accounted for by the fact that a great -number pf the women electors of Kooyong were prevented from going to the polling booth because, they were performing the -highest function of womanhood. The birth rate' for Kooyong is far below that of Richmond, which is in my electorate.

I cannot see what danger could arise from the acceptance of the Senate's amendment as it stands. the case of a blind elector in a blind institution or in hospital. As provided for under the Bill, the doctor of the institution might be the authorized witness, but how is the blind elector to know how the doctor has marked his ballot-paper unless he has some witness present to see what the doctor does ? It must be remembered that the blind elector cannot question the vote, and there is security in having a third person present when the vote of a blind person is recorded. The Minister, as a lawyer, will know that if three persons are charged with a crime, there is a chance that one of the three may "" blow the gaff.""

It has been my rule through life to look after the interests of the under-dog, becauso I believe that "" Boodle"" can always look after himself, or can get others to look after him, as witness what occurred in connection with the discussion on the Land Tax Bill. I appeal to the Minister to insert the words suggested by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor). put a limitation upon the elector which because one can readily conceive that it might not be agreeable to him. call his wife as a witness.

Blind persons usually go to a polling booth accompanied by a relative or intimate friend, and I think that when voting by post they should have the right to select the' persons who are to witness the marking of their postal ballot-papers by the authorized witnesses. already have selected the authorized witness. Honourable members wish to give him asecond security. He will already have selected the best man he can find in the authorized witness. ness may be any one of the persons provided for in this Bill. I can scarcely conceive that any' one would be so evilminded as to cheat a blind person Out of his vote, but the witness called upon to .witness the marking of the blind elector's ballot-paper, under this provision, might be a political opponent of the elector. I It does not matter whether the think that the blind elector should have the right to select the person who is to witness the marking of his ballot-paper for him. As there are not so many blind people in the Commonwealth, surely it is not too much to ask that they be allowed to choose their own witnesses. No doubt, for the most part, blind persons are accompanied by their friends to the polling booth, and it is a .fair -thing that their friends should be their witnesses.

That would help our Senate candidates, because it would get people to the poll. One of the reasons why I want compulsory voting put in this Bill is that the more people go to the poll the better. Not only was the Bill rushed through here, but in another place, in order, as they thought, to penalize the party that have a right to criticise their measures, the Government said, "" We will make you sit up all night, and will not allow the sitting to be suspended for supper, or even for breakfast""a thing that has never been done in this Chamber. The Government with their majority were determined to nse the Standing Orders to put a Bill of 220 clauses through Committee at one sitting for the purpose of obtaining a miserable party advantage. Nothing like it has ever been seen in the history of this Parliament before. It will rank with the Ready incident, where a' man was induced to walk out of Parliament allegedly sick. The rules and procedure of Parliament have been prostituted for the purpose of obtaining a' party advantage ; the guillotine was used to fix a time in which the Bill must pass, and all the forms of Parliament were employed to prevent members from expressing their opinions on it. All this was done to put through a measure that should be above party. Many honourable members opposite have admitted that the Bill has been passed simply for the purpose of the Coraneamite election. What, is the reason of that? It is because one gentleman who intended to nominate gave notice to the National party that he would stand whether he was pre-selected or not. He is standing now.

They will be officials, with the The whole history of this imprimatur of Government appointment, justices of the peace, wardens of mining fields, and others who can be relied on to see that effect is given to the voting provisions of the Bill. Such persons may not be as abundant in the Maranoa division as in large centres of population, but able there for every' blind person who wishes to vote. The blind elector may select of this class -the man . in whose honesty he believes. The honourable member for Maranoa desires that another person should be selected as a check on the authorized witness; that, although the blind elector can make his choice among the class of persons selected as authorized witnesses because they hold positions for which honesty is a necessary qualification, he must be compelled to select another man as well to watch the person in whose honesty he believes.

Thus, we shall not have inflicted upon us by the Ministerial Bolsheviks-, cries such as we heard last night in objection ""to the payment by them of their fair share of taxation. Their attitude was, ""Tax any'one except us."" Honourable members who spoke upon this measure last. evening quoted a number of figures regarding the incidence of the land tax. They insisted that it would Tuin the coun-. try, and would compel residents of the country to come into the towns. One honourable member referred to inhabitants of the city as parasites. They are no more parasites than country residents. Such a remark is on a par with that made by the honourable"" member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Archibald), who spoke of persons living in the country as vagabonds who had to go from place to place to sell their labour. I will say for the honourable member for Hindmarsh, however, that he was the only honourable member on the other side who spoke in support of the Government in their proposal that the provisions of this Bill should apply to all years subsequent to the present financial term. Practically all -other honourable members opposite admitted that, although bhey objected to the measure, they would ' vote for it,but that it would have to be remembered that. they did so only in view of the extraordinary circumstances. I have a greater admiration for the six honourable members on the Ministerial side who voted .against the Bill, conscientiously believing that they were doing the best for their constituents, than I have for those who opposed it and yet voted for it. According to Knibbs, there are, among the 5,000,000 residents of Australia, only 718,000 land-holders. Those -figures, upon analysis, show that persons owning less than £200 worth of land represent one-twelfth of the total population, and they hold only one-fifteenth of the land o'fAustralia. At the other end of the scale there are about 78,000 holders of land or estates ranging in value between £1,000 and £3,000, and Mr Tudor. between £3,000 and £5,000, and from £5,000 upwards.

Accordingly as people enjoy the privileges of the community they get income, and on that income they should be taxed. The other two classes of land-tax payers are the leaseholders and the freeholders.' It has been very well argued, and, amongst others, most ably by the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page), that, in taxing leaseholders, we are taxing people who have no direct beneficial interest in the landj we are taxing a State instrumentality in the shape of property specially reserved to the Crown. Surely it can be little satisfaction to a member of this Parliament to impose a tax on a State instrumentality, particularly when tlie tenure of the land is insecure, and -it is in the back-blocks where the conditions of life are very disagreeable. I come now tp another class of payers of land tax, and they are the owners of freehold land of a greater unimproved value than £5,000. The effect of economic conditions, especially in 'States like Victoria, that are highly developed, has been that all the rich lands have already been closely settled. If we follow the incidence of this taxation, we shall find that country versus city, because I know that it does not apply to rich lands which are now mostly held in small areas under conditions of close settlement. quired no Act of Parliament to. settle the Tower Hill country, which is the most closely settled country in Australia, from the rural point of view! Economic conditions, such as the richness of the soil, the climate, accessibility to markets, and all such conditions, weighed in the case of that country, as they do to a greater or less degree in every part of the Commonwealth. of value that finds its own level This land tax in its incidence affects mainly large holdings that are not accessible to railways or close to good markets, and are in districts which do not afford facilities for settlement in small areas. There are some exceptions; but, for the most part, the tax is applied to cheap land held in large holdings mainly for pastoral purposes, and which, with Australia's population to-day, cannot readily be nut to >a. hisher use. Mr Rodgers. I am in sympathy with any natural law, supported, if necessary, by State assistance, that has the effect of bringing all land suitable. for agriculture under the plough. OUTflocksand herds are -rested on natural conditions.. I agree that in the past this system has been responsible for great wastage; but this is due to the fact that Australia is a broad continent;' we have comparatively cheap"" land, and a small population. We rest our flocks and herds almost entirely upon natural conditions; but in America the stock of the country is chiefly sustained by agricultural effort. We are not so far advanced.

Very often a man may have suffered a loss, but owing to the fact that at the time of the re-assessment he is possessed of a certain number of stock, he is called upon to pay an increased rental. I have not known of a single case in which the rent of a leasehold has been reduced. ! As I was saying, I am staggered at the prospect of a man who holds £327,000 worth of land having to pay only 68 per' -cent, in land tax. When the honourable member for Denison tells the workers of Tasmania about this man, they will say, ""You man has paid quite enough, and should not be called upon to pay more.

W it h all due respect to the preachings of great economists-man y of them are merely theorists-whe n their theories are put into practice we find something wrong some-where.

I hope that the B ill will go through. very fine sentiment. some one at last is taking an interest in the man on the land. Some very near and dear .friends of mine have.recently been lost in. a bush fire at Barcaldine, where I spent my boyhood. They are small graziers, but circumstances which arose during the war put a few pounds in their way. Many men in that district are. in the same position, but at first they were struggling carriers and station hands, who had saved a l it t le money, and with assistance from the pastoralists managed to stock their holdings. Those are -the men whose interests I seek to serve. They are the men who have pioneered our hack country, and made it possible for us to move about in an easy manner, and the big establishments in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne to carry on their operations. I do not wish to p it the city against the country. bush that has for me a charm that no city ever had, and as long as I live my thoughts w ill revert, to the happy days I have spent in the back country. When one has lived in the bush, the town has very little attraction for h i m . On many occasions, I have gone to Brisbane, in tending to spend a month's holiday there, but after fou r or five days I have packed up my swag and returned to the country. Of course Australia must have manufactures, and I . hope some day to see the Commonwealth self-contained. But, as many honourable members on the Governare right, Mr Smith. That ment side have said, the one thing we must not do is to frighten capital away Thef r o m the country. Capital is very shy, and soon baulks. We never hear nowadays the old cry of the Conservatives about driving capital out of the country, because the whole world is being turned upside down. The primary industries, more than any others, require nursing.

No matter on which side of the House we sit, we are all imbued with the idea of doing the best we can for Australia. I urge the Government to be careful of what they do to the primary industries. It will not be long before price fixing and all the coddling and spoon feeding will cease, and our primary products will have to compete in tlie markets of the world. Australian exports,, whether of minerals, meat, grain, butter, or flour, compare more than favourably with those from other countries. "" As long as we give the man on the land a fair show, I am satisfied that he will come out on top. earth have to put up with more inconveniences than nave the men who are developing the rural areas.. In conclusion I wish to relate to honourable members the misfortune of a friend of mine. One night, he retired to bed a wealthy man. The next day, he was as poor as on the day when he first settled in the district. A bush fire had devastated his land, killed his stock, and caused the death of one of his sons. How do honourable members propose to get over these hard facts by their theories? Actual experiences are what honourable members must study. Instead of talking about what they intend to do for the man on the land, let them do something. It is my ambition to see a good yeomanry established in Australia. They are the backbone of ""every country; they have been so in England, and they arc already so in Australia. Do not smother them with taxation and bad laws. Surely Australia is 'big enough? for all of us to live in.

But the probate statistics prove that no pastoralist or farmer dies without leaving a very large sum of money behind him.

I interjected that he was an absolute liar, and I was called to order and compelled to apologize. . Johnson) I ask the honourable member to withdraw that statement. The fact that he previously withdrew an unparliamentary expression does not justify him in repeating it. The honourable member must not make references of that kind. No men on the face of God's, but, of course, I know I must withdraw it. I have always contended that the Government have failed to tax the wealth of this country for war purposes in the way that they should have taxed it . Australia's share in the terrible struggle which has been waged in Europe has been paid for out of loan funds. Only the other evening the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) pointed out that our system of taxation is wrong, and that at the present time we are raising insufficient, revenue to meet our expenditure by at .least £7,000,000 annually. To-night the honourable member for -Denison endeavoured to show that the rich men of the^ community are bearing the sreater portion of the taxation to which our people are being subiected. Doubtless his idea was to get his statements circulated through the medium of Hansard for propaganda purposes In replv to him, I need only point out that in 1915-16 the amount contributed in land tax to the State of New South Wales amounted only *to £3,100: the amount contributed by Victoria was £352 052; that of Queensland was £247.044: that of South Australia, £154,4.83; that of Western A""ptralia, £47.715; and that of Tasmania, £82,436.

The representative of Flinders( Mr Bruce), though a new member, has begun to see the dangerous pass towards which our finances are drifting.
