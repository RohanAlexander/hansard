Minister Representing The Minister For Repatriation Whether It Is Correct, As Stated By The South Australian Minister For Repatriation, That Tho Responsibility For The Difference Of Opinion Between The Governments Of South Australia And'the Commonwealth In Regard To The Building Of War Service Homes In That State Rests Entirely With The Federal Government,. And That The Statement By Senator E. D. Millen, That On The Occasion Of The Recent Conference, The South Australian Min","ister said that he was going to discuss the matter with Cabinet for the purpose of arranging to carry on the work, was charge of shipbuilding yet made anv arcontrary to fact I [210] Repatriation (Senator Millen) was proposing to proceed in the ordinary way with the. building of War Service Homes in South Australia, as in the other States, through the Commonwealth Bank, but representations were made to him by the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Blundell) and the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster)of honourable members of the Opposition, who had also something to say on the subject. that the Minister considered the representations made to him by various honourable' members, who pointed out that the South Australian Government had been doing effective work under its local housing scheme. As the result of these representations, he practically withdrew the operations of the Oommonwealth Bank in that State, so far as the building of War Service Homes was concerned, and permitted the State Government to continue its own housing scheme on behalf of the-Commonwealth. At the recent Conference, however, it was suggested by the South Australian Minister for Repatriation that the time had arrived when a new financial basis should be arranged as between the respective Governments. In consequence of what 1 might describe as t^ie indefinite understanding existing between the two Ministers, the Commonwealth Minister for Repatriation was awaiting concrete proposals from the South Australian Minister. These have not yet come to hand, and in the interval the South Australian Minister has announced that he does not propose to proceed further with the building of soldiers' homes. The entire responsibility, therefore, now rests with the Commonwealth Minister for Repatriation. This he, and the Government as a whole, accepts. We shall proceed at once to build soldiers' homos in South Australia on the basis adopted in all the other States. rangement with the New South Wales",19,Setup

Originally -the New South Wales Government made an offer to build what arc known as our 12,800-toD ships at something like £34 per ton. I accepted that offer, and subsequently notified the House of that decision. The New South Wales Government, however, failed to sign the necessary papers and specifications. At a considerably later date, they submitted a fresh offer to. build these vessels at a cost of £51 2s. 6d. per ton. At that time we were negotiating with the different trade organizations carrying on operations in connection with shipbuilding, and it was . decided 1>y the Commonwealth Government that nothing further should be done until an agreement had been arrived at with those organizations as to the new terms stipulated by us in regard to continuity of work, piece-work, and dilution. Until that agreement has been arrived at, the negotiations with the New South Wales Government will remain in abeyance. I have made it very clear, however, to the representatives of New South Wales that before I shall he prepared to accept an offer from the State Government to build these vessels for us at anything like the price quoted by them, the whole matter must be submitted to the House for approval. seeds of the wheat-growers of the Commonwealth, and the necessity to at once make provision for the harvesting of their drops, I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether, in order to relieve the present situation, the Government are in a -position to make a statement as to the payment of the guarantee of Bs. per bushel ? honourable friend to a rather lengthy statement on the subject which I made in the House on Thursday last. 'Since then the position has not changed. hope to be able, quite shortly, to make a statement of the nature to which the honourable member has referred. I explained on Thursday last that, to a very large extent, the amount that would be paid depended upon the financial position in which the Commonwealth found itself, and that that in turn dopended upon forward sales, one of which we hoped would shortly be made. That one of itself was of such importance, I said, that it would materially affect the situation. I hope to be able, quite shortly, to make a statement which will fix the date und the amount of the payment to be made. I shall fix the minimum amount, und the question as to how much more shall te paid will depend entirely upon what progress we make with the forward sales, and also upon what arrangements of a financial character wo can make to enable us to do what the farmers desire.

However, I would like to say that, so far, I 'have been able to cancel £3,500,000 worth of notes within the last five or six weeks.

This meant they were getting more sugar than they needed for home requirements, with the result that to-day they were exporting jams. He was not complaining about the exportaobject to such a state of affairs, seeing that his factory could not obtain sufficient sugar to been warned that if they used any sugar for export jams its supplies of the commodity morning's would be stopped. Are the facts as stated in that paragraph; and, if so, do the Government propose to do anything to meet the situation? position is not as stated in the newspaper extract read by the honourable member. Our object is, as f a r as possible, to meet the requirements of the various traders who deal in sugar, and give to each his f a i r quota. As I have explained to the House over and over again, owing to industrial troubles that have cropped up, and the difficulty that has been experienced in refining sugar, we are not in a position to give to everybody the f u l l amount required. sugaT? ister suggests, the home consumer can, to a very large extent, replace refined sugar with brown sugar; but I understand that the factories to which allusion I read to the House is made cannot use brown sugar, and must have the refined article. some factories are getting more than their share of refined sugar? say, the position is as I have stated.

SAW-MILLS. presenting the Minister for Repatriation say whether the Government have purchased any saw-mills in Victoria? ment have purchased mills in Victoria; and the honourable member will be supplied with full details if he will kindly give notice of the question. CO-OPERATIVE ENTERPRISES. that Parliament decided that returned soldiers might start co-operative enterprises, the Government giving assistance at the rate of £1 for £1 contributed by the men, and undertaking to accept either cash or gratuity bonds in payment. Can the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation say how soldiers who desire to undertake these co-operative enterprises may obtain this assistance from the Government? the question of repatriation was being revised, the Government set aside a sum of £500,000 for approved co-operative businesses. It was decided that the Government might assist approved enterprises to the extent of £150 for each soldier, and accept war bonds as contributions by the men. All proposals for such enterprises t must be submitted in the ordinary way, with a full outline of the business to be undertaken, and each enterprise is subject to the approval of the Commissioner and the Minister. All proposals of the kind, if submitted, will be fully investigated. sion, the House affirmed that it was time the Commonwealth took over the inspection of produce passing from State to State. I should like to know from the Prime Minister whether he has taken any steps in connection with the matter. Have the Government, for instance, got into communication with the State Governments ? said on Thursday or Friday last, that we have not taken any steps in the matter. I am sorry that I have not been able to attend to it, but there are other things that I have done in the meantime that are deserving of notice.

There is an Ordinance known as the Sago. Minister hasten the appointment of the t r i Ordinance 190S, which provides two methods bunal proposed by such measure ? for the acquisition of the right to cut sago palms-one , by the grant of a licence from the Government which gives the licensee the exclusive right to cut and remove sago from cerr e c e i v in g the a t t e n t i o n of the G o v e r ntain areas of Crown lands which have been ment. ' declared a sago reserve; two, by the recognition of agreements made between the natives and other persons giving the right to cut sago Secretary on native lands. The Ordinance does not prescribe the purpose for which the sago may be used, but I have now 20 . 1 suggested that the Papuan Legislative Council0 should amend the Ordinance by inserting con4 ditions that the sago palms are not to be used 2 5 for any other purpose than the manufacture of 3 '. 13 sago. 0 3 6 . 1 2.

I shall let the honourable member know 2 later. 1 .. 50 3. Yes. 108 .. 98 4. The right referred to is apparently that arising out of an agreement, made in October, 1919, by which certain native owners agreed to allow Mr G. F. D. Morgan to cut sago on their 2 land at Lakekamu, the consideration being £37. 2 The local Resident Magistrate approved of the agreement (1) as not giving exclusive right, and 6 (2) as not giving any right except to sago grow3 ing on land at the date of agreement. This was , .. 8 . 78 29 . 5 the Resident Magistrate's view in approving the agreement. It appears that Mr Morgan 50 . . 83 or his successors in title are now floating this 339 agreement into a company. They seem to re 12 gard the agreement as giving them exclusive rights and in perpetuity. The attention of the directors and solicitors of the company is being 20 invited to the fact that the Government of Papua are desirous that it should be clearly understood the .agreement does not give any exclusive right, and does not operate in perpetuity, but that it only refers to sago growing on the land at the date of the agreement.

Annwer -'Yes, as far as the Battery was concerned, but it cannot be ascertained whether Gunner Yates 'formed one of a gun-crew in the engagements at Villers-Bretonneux, Morlancourt, or the taking of Eamel.

(2) Where the Commissioner erects, completes, or enlarges, or enters into a contract for the erection, completion, or enlargement of a dwelling house-, in pursuance of this section, he may require the owner of the land to give such, .security as he thinks necessary for the repayment of the amount expended by him in the erection, completion, or enlargement of the dwelling-house."" movedThat after the word "" them,"" line 5, the following words be inserted:"" and for that purpose may acquire or establish, with the consent of Parliament, brickworks, saw-mills, and cement works."" This amendment, providing as it does that the Commissioner shall have power subject to the approval of Parliament, to acquire or establish brickworks, saw-mills, and cement works is a very important one. In connection with the construction of War Service Homes an exceedingly large sum will be expended. We have been told that up to the present something like 4,000 homes have been completed, and that 27,000 applications for the construction of these homes are under consideration. The Committee must not lose sight of the fact that the whole of the money so expended will have to be repaid by the returned soldiers for whom .the homes are erected. It is, therefore, most essential that we should keep down the cost to the lowest possible extent. Every one realizes what it means to a working man to be called upon to pay 20s. or 25s. per week over an extended period. The greater the cost of these homes the more the men will have to pay ""by way of monthly instalments. It should be our endeavour so' to keep down the cost that the men will have a reasonable chance to f u l f i l their contracts. I am afraid that many of them will"" be unable to do> so. As time goes on, they w ill probably be burdened with families in many cases, and. the maintenance of these, together with the regular payment of instalments in respect of' their homes, w ill put a very heavy strain upon their financial resources. It is thus quite possible that many of these homes will fall back into the hands of the Department. A l though something like 4,000 homes have been erected, we are now asked to agree that the maximum amount that., may be advanced shall be increased from £700 to £800. The Minister has told us that this increase is necessary, not because it is proposed to build larger homes, but owing to the greatly increased cost of labour and material. The cost of material, more particularly, has. enormously increased. The Minister( Mr Poynton), when moving the second reading of the B ill , told „ us that during the last twelve months the prices of building material had increased to the extent of 25 per cent., and that owing to the competition between the Department and private contractors prices'",27,General Foote

There is a great scarcity of building material, and it is essential that we should devise some means of keeping down costs to a minimum. That is necessary in the in terests of the men themselves. Obviously, we cannot hope to secure any reduction in cost if we allow the present competition between the Department and outside contractors to continue. We have been told that the Commissioner has purchased saw-mills, not only in Queensland, but in Victoria. My amendment would enable the Commissioner, subject to the approval of Parliament, to extend his operations in that directon. It is unlikely that any attempt would be made to purchase saw-mills, brickworks, or cement work3 unless the Government could show Parliament that the deal contemplated was a good one. I have not a word to say. against the recent purchase of saw-mills and timber areas in Queensland. about them. It may be that the Department has made an excellent bargain, but it is absolutely necessary that f u r ther purchases should he made. hardly likely that the Department will be able to supply timber from Queensland for the building of homes in New South Wale3, Victoria, and some of the other States at rates that will result in any material reduction in the cost of these homes. It will be necessary, in the interest of economy to establish Government mills in suitable areas in each. State. In that way we ought to be able to reduce our costs. In to-day's newspapers it is reported that, as a result of the purchase of saw-mills in Victoria, the Commissioner claims to have made a saving of 50 per cent, in the cost of timber for War Service Homesi n this State. If that can he done in Victoria, it should be possible also in other States. There are splendid hardwood forests along the north coast of New South Wales, where saw-mills could be established at comparatively small cost. a long way from port? of interest to the honourable member to learn that every day in the week vessels are carrying timber along the north coast to Sydney and other places. The timber can be brought down either by r a i l or water carriage. Excellent facilities exist. A railway runs within easy distance of the coast-line, and there are navigable rivers running into these hardwood forests. Sir Allen Taylor has mills on the north coast and vessels regularly engaged in carrying timber from them to the port of Sydney. If the Government acquired or established mills there it would' be possible to obtain at reduced cost the timber necessary for building War Service Homesi n New South Wales. Similar arrangements could be made in Victoria and the other States, with the result that we might be able once more to build these homes for £700, instead of £800 as now proposed. Having regard to the number of homes to be erected, it should be good business for the Department to go into the whole question with a view to reducing costs. Unless that action is taken we shall probably be asked twelve months hence to agree to the minimum being I know nothing raised from £800 to £900. The repayment of such a sum by monthly instalments is more than the average young fellow can undertake. job. men with families it is *an even longer job. member know that New South Wales timber merchants are erecting mills in Queensland, in order to obtain cheaper timber for sale in New South Wales? do know that there are ample supplies of hardwood along the north coast of New South Wales. not the Sydney timber merchants avail themselves of them? pointed out that they are doing so. monopoly.

Works everywhere have been hung up for the last couple of years because of the impossibility of securing supplies of this material. For over twelve months the streets of Newcastle have been torn up for the purpose of laying the rails for the hew electric tram system, but this work cannot be completed because of the impossibility of securing supplies of cement. It has been found necessary to suspend all operations unti l a sufficient number of barrels accumulate, and then the men are put on to work, but very speedily they are obliged to cease operations u n t i l fresh supplies can be accumulated. The same remarks apply to buildings all over Australia. plies of cement cannot be obtained to guarantee continuous or work. I have with me the minutes of the findings of the Public Works Committee in regard to the establishment of cement works for Federal Capital and other Commonwealth purposes. The conclusion arrived at by the Committee was as follows: The Committee learned that about two-thirds of the cement used in Australia is at present imported, and in view of the enormous demand anticipated in Europe after the war, is of opinion that it is improbable that the establishment of private cement factories in Australia would cheapen the price to the Commonwealth until the total Australian production was sufficient to fully supply Australian needs. It is considered, therefore, that from the point of view of economy, as well as convenience, it is a sound proposition for the Commonwealth to proceed with the establishment of cement works to supply its needs for Federal Capital and other Commonwealth purposes. Mr Finlayson movedThat the Committee approves of the establishment of a faetory at Fairymeadow for the manufacture of cement for Commonwealth purposesThe Committee divided on the matter. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) was the only member who voted against the motion, which wassupported by Senator Keating, Senator Story, now the honourable member for Boothby, the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr. Fenton), the then honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson), the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley), the then honourable member for W i mmera ( Mr Sampson), and the honourable As gentleman who is now Minister for the Navy( Mr Laird Smith). That was four years ago. There is now a greater scarcity of cement than ever. tion Department and Murray River Waters Commission are largely responsible for it . taken by the Murray River Waters Scheme will continue for a long time, and the demand for cement will naturally be in creased to that extent; but that furnishes all the more reason for the establishment of new cement works. We all know that buildings are held up because the contractors cannot get supplies of cement. acquired at F a i r y Meadow, where there Sufficient supis all the material for making cement. expeditious justification for our refusing to set about manufacturing our own requirements for the purpose of expediting the work of building soldiers' homes, to say nothing of reducing the price of the article to the community generally. We. cannot proceed with this huge scheme of building homes, which will run into an expenditure of millions of pounds, while prices are continually soaring through the scarcity of material, and because of our competition with outsiders, and consequent inability to secure what little material is available. I understand there are over 20,000 applications for the building of War Service Homes, and in all probability three-fourths of these applications will be granted. It means a very big business to be undertaken within the next few years, for which we ought to make every preparation. Scarcity creates increased prices, and if we do not increase the supply of materials we shall find that in twelve months' time the prices we are called upon to pay will be very much higher than they are at present. Already they are 25 per cent, higher than they were this time twelve months ago, and possibly they will be another 25 per cent, higher in twelve months' time.

It should be our endeavour to get the hcme3 built at the lowest possible cost, always keeping in view the fact that this money must eventually be repaid to the Commonwealth. A man may struggle on for twenty-five years only to find in the building a large number of War Service end that he is not able to maintain his payments. His wife and his children may have to deprive themselves of many comforts in order to put by money to meet the regular instalments due on the purchase of the home, but in spite of all this, plies to meet an abnormal demand, but they may not he able to redeem their promise to repay the money advanced by the Commonwealth Government, owing to the fact that the cost of material has been so high at the time of the building of the house that its price Has teen in creased hy £ 1 0 0 or £200. Of course, the question arises as to what must be done to meet such cases, but that is a matter for the future. All we should have in view now is the possibility of preventing men from being placed in such a position by endeavouring to keep down the cost of buildings. mills in Victoria and Queensland, and I hold that we should also acquire brickworks and cement works, and extensively supply our own material for the purpose of building, homes for our soldiers as cheaply as possible, so that in the future their occupants may not be hampered, as they may be, owing to the increasingly high cost of building material. [3.45] I join with the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) in his desire to cheapen the cost of building soldiers' homes, but the cost, as the M i nenterprises, but, if they are necessary for ister has already pointed out, is largely due to the great increase in the price of material, which again is largely due to an inadequate output. The present supply of material is not sufficient to meet the deinand for building purposes. Particularly is this the case in respect to timber. In every capital city the yards of timber merchants are bare. Merchants cannot get their orders executed. Nearly every timber yard in South Australia has had orders placed in Queensland eighteen months asro, which have not been executed, and no one knows when they will be. I was in Sydney a little while ago, and made inquiries there. In spite of the fact that there are extensive areas of timber in New South Wales, much of it suitable for building purposes, the t i m ber merchants of Sydney are in very much the same position as those in Adelaide. While this scarcity continues, prices are bound to be high. to a large extent, to the fact that we are Homes, but if we supply our own material the public will be able also to get supplies. trouble is due to the inadequacy of supthis abnormal demand is likely to continue for a very long time to come. The same remarks apply to bricks and cement. The increased demand is not only created by the building of War Service Homes. The works undertaken by the Murray Water Commission are assuming considerable proportions. Honourable members have no idea of the magnitude of the cement orders placed by that Commission. There are other large water conservation works demanding cement. will also make a very material difference in the demand. The question is how to reduce the cost of the material required for building soldiers' homes, and it can only be done by increasing the output. Does the honourable member for Hunter mean that his proposal to create State enterprises will overcome the difficulty ? careful inquiry before it is undertaken. I am opposed to the extension of State the purpose of bringing an undue monopoly to its bearings, I will support them. That has been my policy for many years past. As to the price of bricks, it has been pointed out that there are numbers of important brickworks lying idle today. The Government should know the reason for this, and if th© same remarks apply to other materials required for this enterprise, th© Government should know whether a monopoly is injuriously affecting the public interest, and, if necessary, take action to check it . In my opinion,there is no necessity for the amendment, because the Government have the power irrespective of it . _ I offer no apology for once more referring to the question of the construction",31,Warservice Homes Bill

We South Australian representatives made vigorous and repeated protests. statements, too 1 not make one; I can prove up to the hilt overy statement we made, and more. ments as to the prices for which these houses were being built by the State. not; we got quotations from the State Bank of South Australia, and I challenge the honourable member to deny the facts. If he goes to the State Bank he can be shown the figures, and he can compare that cost with that of the buildings constructed by the Commonwealth Repatriation Department. He will see that the State work compares more than favourably in regard to the extent of the land, the spaciousness of the buildings, and in other respects. I may further point out that neither the Ministerf or Repatriation nor any officer of the Department has challenged those figures, and I cannot see what more information than they have can be possessed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. creation of this new Department is characteristic evidence of the grasping efforts of some public official to magnify his office; and it is this that is responsible for ference with the construction of these buildings by the State Government of South Australia. The competition sent up the cost of construction so much that the State Government have retired altogether from the business. 'honourable member should acknowledge that on his representations, and» the representations of other South Australian members, the Commonwealth Government deliberately withdrew, and .placed this work temporarily in the"" hands of the South Australian Government. Australian representatives here moved the adjournment of the House on the quesThis tion, being determined to keep the matter before the Government and honourable members.

Act, the power of the Commissioner to build on individual applications was not clearly defined, and this clause is designed to put the matter beyond doubt. The clause provides that the Commissioner may erect, complete, or enlarge, for eligible persons, dwelling-houses "" on land owned by them,"" or may enter into contracts for the erection, completion, or enlargement of dwelling-houses on such land. It w ill be seen, as I have said, that tions to this House for ratification, how the clause is limited to that type of applicant who himself owns the land on which he desires the house to be erected, either through the Commissioner's staff or under a contract, let by the applicant and approved by the Commissioner. The clause does not cover the whole range of construction under the main Act ; and the amendment of the honourable member for Hunter, if it has any effect, w ill be rather to l i m it the power under that Act. Personally, I read the proposal of the honourable member as vesting in the Commissioner power to take all the necessary steps for the acquisition of land and material, and probably to go the length of himself establishing the necessary means of obtaining them, under the direction of the Minister; but clearly, if the amendment is carried, it will not achieve what the honourable member no doubt has in his mind, namely, to give the Commissioner the power to provide the whole of the material. There The seems to be a great deal of confused thought with regard to what this House has already done in respect to the housing scheme, and honourable members appear to be very much divided in mind as to what are the powers of the Commissioner, with the approval of the M in ister. I take it that this House charged the War Service Homes Commissioner with the great undertaking of [3.59] building homes, and of acquiring, subject to theapproval of the Minister, the necessary material; and the first occasion on which the work of the Commissioner is called to account is when he enters into a contract for the purchase of mills and timber areas. As to the question of the wisdom or otherwise of entering into this contract without the approval or ratification of Parliament, I leave that aside for the moment; but I do not think any honourable member will contend that the Commissioner, with the In the approval of the Minister, has not t h at power already. £5,000. liberately decided to remove what might be called the"" commercial side of this great undertaking from parliamentary influence and control, and place it under a Commissioner. If the Commissioner is expected to bring every one of his operacan we have con tinuity of work, when the House is not in session? I do not plead, of course, for the expenditure of huge sums without reference to Parliament, if Parliament is available; but the Commissioner is given no power to engage in a contract, particularly by the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Hunter, for the purchase of land or material without the consent of the M in ister. Honourable members will not contend that the consent of the Minister means the consent of the House; and in matters of great magnitude it becomes a question of policy or discretion with the",33,Warservice Homes Bill

The wisdom or otherwise of that policy is another question. decided to create a business Commission. The Government appointed a Commissioner with certain powers, and authorized him to engage business men and experts to advise him in regard to all the ramifications of house-building. He has acquired by contract, and otherwise, the necessary material to build all the houses that have been erected to date, and no question was raised by this House until the timber purchases were made. I regret that, from time to time, loose statements, which reflect very gravely upon the Commissioner, and also the Minister, have been made. I am certain that anybody who knows the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) well will agree that there is no more painstaking M in ister, and none who does more to appjy business methods to the management of his Department. The honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) has asked certain questions in regard to the case of MrJ . the material can be obtained. First of T. Caldwell, and he suggested that if certain information which had reached him was correct, a very serious state of affairs existed, which warranted the appointment of a Royal Commission. Apparently the honourable member desired an inquiry into statements made by Mr Caldwell to him. To use the words of the Minister for Repatriation, Mr Caldwell desired to sell to the Commissioner a "" gold brick. "" He offered to sell to the Commissioner the lease of certain lands in the islands under the control of the Pacific Islands Commissioner. Commissioner received him in good faith , and listened to his representations, but on inquiry of the Commissioner of the well held no lease or concession of any kind that he could sell to anybody. An other statement has been made in regard 'to the purchase by the War Service 'Homes Commissioner of timber mills m the Beech Forest. According to the critics, those mills are on their last legs. experience and skill which established In answer to a question by the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson), I promised to supply complete details of the purchase. The facts are that the Commissioner has purchased from Mr G. W. K not t , of Melbourne, for £48,570, five saw-mills-the e in the Beech Forest, one at Cheviot, and one at Broadfordtogether with 694 acres of freehold land and cutting rights over an area of not less than l',000 acres.to each m ill. The Certainly Parliament effect of the purchase is to assure to the Commissioner a supply of 30,000,000 super, feet of hardwood (scantlings, & c ) , 3,000,000 palings, and 6,000,000 lineal feet of dressed weatherboards at prices varying from 15s. 9d. to 33s. per 100 feet super, as against the present market rates of from 25s. 8d. to 54s. He is thus assured for the next three years of the material that is necessary for the cheaper building of homes for soldiers. A f u r ther condition of the contract is that, at the end of three years, the contractor who is to operate the mills w ill take them over at the purchase price. Personally, I do not object to any criticism so long as the Department is afforded a reasonable opportunity to meet it . But I ask honourable members to endeavour to assist the Commissioner and the Government in their efforts to get materials with which to build home3 at a reasonable price. There are three methods by whic all, there is general competition in the open market, but large orders such as the Commissioner will necessarily have to place must mean, in the present limited market, soaring prices. The second alternative is that the Commissioner may, with the approval of the Minister, enter into arrangements similar to. that made with MrK not t , and by a subsidiary contract, which will not be operated by the officials of the Department, assure to himself supplies of timber at reasonable rates. For the conduct of timber mills The War Service Homesi t is necessary to have skilled and experienced men. The third method is that suggested by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), namely, that the Government should enter into' State undertakings. The Government cannot see their way to embark upon a wide range of undertakings for the supply of building materials unless as a last resource. The Government and the Commissioner have not at their command that works have, and for that reason they would be greatly handicapped in entering upon State-managed undertakings. WhilstI credit the honourable member for Hunter with a genuine desire to help the Commissioner to acquire material at reasonable rates, the Government are",34,Warservice Homes Bill
132,"Pacific Islands, He Found That, Mr Cald","unable to accept the amendment for the reasons I have already given. The latter part of. the Minister's statement in regard to the agreement made by the Commissioner for the supply of timber in Victoria indicates that the soldiers will get cheaper homes. The principle he has outlined is a, good one, and it should be extended to the supply of bricks, cement, and other materials. ferred to competition in the open market, but there is no competition in regard to bricks. AH the brick-making firms are joined together i i i a Combine, and the Government cannot get a fair deal from them. It is, therefore, the duty of the Government to establish brickworks. That could be done at a small cost. honourable member has said that notwithstanding State enterprise in brick manufacture in New South Wales the price of bricks there is not cheaper than in other States. That is true to a certain extent. About £140,000 has been expended by the Government on tlie establishment of State brick works. The biggest consumers of bricks i u New South Wales are the Railway Commissioners, and as a result of the State brickworks tendering at lower prices than those quoted by the Combine, the Railway Commissioners have saved £177,000 since the brickworks were established. Last year the brickworks showed a profit of £37,000. at 38s. 6d. per 1,000; the private firms sell at 50s. bricks is always below the price quoted by the Combine, and it is the intention of the State Government, as soon as the capital cost of the plant has been wiped out, to reduce the price very considerably. is a continuing entity, but the War Service Homes Commission has only three years of life. monwealth as an entity is permanent, and always growing. It is always requiring brioks for public works, and, furthermore, if the principle of State enterprise is good in connection with providing homes for soldiers it is good also in regard to the provision of homes for private citizens. of the War Service Homes Commissioner to build houses for private citizens. as the Commonwealth endures, it will require supplies of cement. In connection with nearly every big public work cement is used. We are told that the establishment of cement works in Tasmania will help to relieve the market. No doubt it will. But even if half a dozen new cement works were started the whole output would be required. The big works The Minister rethat are being carried out in connection with the Murray River scheme will absorb all the cement that can be obtainedGreat quantities of cement will be required also in connection with the building of the Federal Capital at Canberra. I do not say that the Government have not power to do what the amendment Some suggests, but the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) merely desires to for t if y the Government by getting the Committee to assert the principle of State enterprise. The Committee of Public Works submitted to Parliament a report on the cost of establishing and equipping up-to-date cement works at F a i ry Meadow, on the southern line, close to Canberra, and handy to the Murray River. A good piece of land for the purpose has been acquired, and if the Government would establish these works they would be entering upon avery profitable speculation. They would reduce the cost of building the soldiers' homes, whilst, also providing cheaper cement for other Government undertakings. I concur in the action of the Government in acquiring timber areas and saw-mills, and if the 1 The price of the State transaction is proved to be fair and square I shall support-it. Unless they adopt a policy of that kind the Government w ill be in the hands of the rings and trusts It is their duty to take whatever steps are necessary to protect the interests of the soldiers. In regard to timber they have adopted the right policy, and I hope they will extend it to bricks and cement. T h a t is so, but the ComThe amendment will not make any sxxbstantial alteration to the powers conferred by the existing Act, and, therefore, is not necessary. ber believe in the principle underlying it? is another reason why I cannot support it .

That would be a far saner procedure than to give the Minister and the Commissioner power to go about in a general and haphazard way, setting up these works in all the States. If cement is to be made by the Commonwealth, it would bo better to produce it at the spot where the best facilities are alforded, and thence, to distribute it throughout the Commonwealth, rather than that numbers of works should be established all over the States. If the Government embark upon this class of enterprise, there will be a riot of Government established industries, and works of one character and another will be growing up all over the land. The guiding principle in regard to all this legislation is how best to benefit the returned soldier. We should consider nothing else but how to provide soldiersi with the cheapest and mo6t suitable homes. not have the effect of delaying the building of homes, and can only make them cheaper.

I trust, however, that -Parliament will first be consulted. I do not agree with what the Minister( Mr Rodgers) has just said concerning the approval of the Minister. I think he is quite wrong in his argument. It was not intended, when the Act was passed, that the Minister and the War Service Homes Commissioner should be able to put their heads together and, without consulting Parliament, run the country into a purchase involving £500,000. A r e honourable members to stand by, without being informed or consulted, and then to be required automatically to signify their approval, long after a "" deal "" has been completed and when there is no course open but to pay ?

If the State Bank authorities in South Australia were satisfactorily doing the work of home-building it will be far better for the Commonwealth Department to refrain from meddling.

Isi t any wonder that the cost of production is so high? I should like to know what was the cost of making bricks at Canberra. The brickworks ther© were established by the Government at a cost of something like £75,000, and the cost of th© bricks produced was-enormous. State brickworks expect to pay out of profits in another year the whole of th© capital cost of £140,000. ern Australia bricks are being sold at 48s. per thousand as against £ 3 per thousand in Victoria. The price here, I presume, is controlled by a Combine. I 1 would do everything possible to prevent this restraint of trad©. 'while ago evidence was given before the Fair Prices Commission in Victoria that up to £ 5 per thousand was being charged for bricks. I would make it very uncomfortable for those who, at a time like this, take advantage of th© needs of t i e community. The Wa r Service Homes Commissioner may find it absolutely necessary to erect brickworks. He has power to do so under the principal Act. If prices continue to rise, and it is found impossible to obtain bricks at a reasonable price, he may deem it essential to establish brickworks. Ther© is nothing to stop him fro m doing so, and in such circumstances the House, I am sure, would commend him for taking such action. Parliament, however, should b© consulted in respect of any large expenditure contemplated by the Department. We have given the Minister and th© Commissioner enormous powers under the principal Act. In carrying out t i e War Service Homes .scheme they w ill probably spend something like £30,000,000. thing like 27,000 applications for war service homes still remain to be dealt with . Neither in th© principal Act nor in this B ill is there a provision that the Minister or the Commissioner shall f u r nish an annual report to Parliament.. The Commissioner need not send in any report with regard to the progress of his operations. majority w© will pass the honourable member's proposed amendment. to accept it in substance. a provision is a reflection on the draftsman of the B ill . Measures of this kind ar© usually framed on existing legislation, and I copied most ofmy proposed amendment from a provision in the RailwaysA c t of 1917. However, the Minister already has the power to do what the honourable member for Hunter desires to give th© Commissioner power to do, and if it were found that Combines were being formed, rendering it very costly to obtain material for building soldiers' homes, I am sure he would set about the establishment of the necessary works.

I had distinctly in mind that whereas the .ordinary current price of certain classes of timber is 25s. per 100 feet, the same class of timber is to be supplied by these mills at Beech Forest at 15s., thus effecting a saving of 10s. on the ruling market prices of to-day. price now ruling continues. the honourable member suggests, that the purchase of these mills by the Commonwealth may result in bringing down the price of timber in the open market, and that affords another splendid for inserting the honourable member for Hunter. any case, as I have already pointed the mere insertion would have a deterrent operations of Combines. already do all these things without the consent of Parliament. would be a double-barrelled safeguard.

To my mind, the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Atkinson) and the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) tell more strongly in favour of the amendment than against it . I suppose that before we are finished with the work of repatriation we shall have to erect, roughly, 100,000 homes, which, ai, only £700 each, represents an expenditure of £70,000,000. Under the circumstances, we should, in every way possible, protect the returned soldier, who, after all, has to find the money.

226,Mr Gibson,"A l t h o u g h most of the right, but I am a little doubtful. It is time enough, when all other resources have been exhausted, to enter into State enterprises of this kind. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr per ton dearer than the price at which Charlton). Industries such as that of cement and iron manufacture in existence to-day cannot supply present demands, and the Government ought to make sure of a proper supply of material in order to avoid failure in the building of these War Service Homes. There are, I believe, about 70,000 applications for homes already in, and we may look for 100,000 before the work is completed. This means the consumption of a vast amount of raw material which the Government ought to be able to provide for themselves. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) is against the Government taking the control of any industry because, he says, such attempts in the past have not proved successful. I remind the honourable member, however, that he was against the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, which certainly has not proved a failure. Then, again, the Small Arms Factory is a paying proposition. Arms Factory is a paying proposition for the purpose for which it was originally, intended. The agricultural implement works established by the State Labour Government in Western Australia were also a success. The Government were glad to get rid of them. cess, and produced implements at prices 30 per cent, below those quoted by private manufacturers. The implement works are still in operation, and nobody raises any objection to them. Therefore, they must be on a fairly satisfactory footing. Thfi Saddlery Factories have also proved profitable enterprises. If Government control is a success in connection with the enterprises I have mentioned it is fair to assume that it would be equally successful iron works. In each of those industries in connection with brick, cement, and iron works. Under existing conditions soldiers are not getting their homes built as cheaply as they could do if better arrangements were made for obtaining the necessary material. To-day, cement and lime are fully 30s. per ton dearer than they should be, whilst roofing iron is £40 it could be profitably manufactured in Australia. Corrugated galvanized iron is quoted at about £70 per ton, whereas statistics prove that it could be manufactured in Australia at £35 per ton. That price would give a reasonable return on capital. There is no reason why the Government should not establish these enterprises. There are comparatively few cement works in Australia, and they cannot supply the demand. Large quantities of cement are being consumed by Government Departments, and private buyers cannot get supplies. The main objection to the amendment raised by honourable members opposite is that Government control will not be successful. The old tale that Government enterprise is a failure will no longer serve, because every industry which the Government have established and managed has been a success. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) said that the Lithgow Small Arms Factory was not a success. for Defence stated a few days ago that the C03t of producing a rifle at Lithgow is £13. "" that, but the conditions under which the employees work to-day are vastly different from what they were when the factory was first established. At any rate, rifle.* are manufactured as cheaply in the Government factory at Lithgow as they could be produced elsewhere in Australia. If the Lithgow article is not cheaper tha'.i. the article produced by private enterprise it should be, because the Department refuses to pay its employees the same rate of pay as private employers pay for a Commonwealth Clothing anl similar class of work. There is plenty of scope for the Government to establish industries in almost every portion of the Commonwealth.

W ill the honourable member deny that there nature is a shareholder, contributing tens of millions of tons of limestone and shale on the spot, and convenient supplies of coal. that State there is room for the establishment of similar enterprise. Hoskins works at Lithgow have unlimited supplies of ironstone and coal. There is an opportunity for the Government to .establish works which would produce iron at prices cheaper than those ruling to-day, and instead of the profits going in to ' the pockets of private enterprise, they would go into the coffers of the Treasury, whilst the community would get a cheaper article. ment seriously desire to erect homes for soldiers at a reasonable cost they must see that the necessary material is obtained as cheaply as possible, and not continue paying private individuals whatever prices they choose to ask. Cement is quoted at about £ 5 , 2s. 6d. per ton, although anybody who knows anything about its manufacture w ill admit that it could be produced at a much lower price. Lime is from £ 3 to £ 3 15s. per to n ; about five years ago it was selling at 27s. to 30s. per ton. These facts are worthy of consideration. A number of returned soldiers have applied, bodies, for assistance in the purchase of homes. They were given to understand by the Comptroller of Repatriation that they could purchase houses already built, but they have never been able to get the money from the Department. Numbers of applicants have waited month after month to get a final answer froiu the Department, and they are still without satisfaction. I should like the Minister to see that a more expeditious method is adopted. not heard any strong argument against For cement works there is abundthe amendment. It merely provides that Parliament shall decide in regard The only material to any large purchase which the Government mav contemplate.

Acts of Parliament should be made clear enough for The anybody to understand, and so explicit that there can be no evasion of the intention of the Legislature. I am not of opinion that the acquisition, by the Commissioner, of saw mills and timber areas will lead to any reduction in the price ""of timber. The Government action in this regard is equivalent to removing an experienced farmer from the land and putting an inexperienced soldier in his If the Governplace, with the idea that, by so doing, the more rapid development of agriculture will be encouraged. I endorse the argument that the Government would have been better advised had they established mills in virgin forests, and thus supplemented the supplies at present available to the public If the Govern; ment are going to acquire more of these mills, such acquisition must, of necessity, reduce the output to the general public. I fail to see the wisdom of purchasing mills which, in many cases, have been working for years. An y one with experience of saw-milling must know that, when a mill is established at a suitable through local repatriation forest site, the longer the mill remains in operation the more denuded does the neighbourhood become of suitab'e and accessible timber.

I permitted tire Minister( Mr Rodgers), quite irregularly, to deal with the question of the What is the definite timber purchases, although it was not at all relevant to the clause or the amendment before the Chair. In fairness to the honourable member I , therefore, permitted hfm to make a lengthy reply to the Minister's statement.

263,Mr Charlton (Hunter ) [6.0],"that .proposed by me has been clearly shown during the course of the debate. Practically every honourable member is in agreement with the principle for which it provides. One or two honourable members have .intimated their intention of voting against it ; but an analysis of their speeches shows that they are in duty bound to support it. The Minister( Mr Rodgers) has declared that the Department has already sufficient power under the principal Act to expend whatever it pleases on the purchase of timber mills, or anything else, necessary in connection with the construction of War Service Homes. H is only objection to the amendment seemed to be that it requires that Parliament shall be consulted before the Commissioner acquires or establishes any of these enterprises. So or.any honourable members had said that the Parliament should be consulted in respect of all projects involving a large expenditure that I did not anticipate any opposition to my amendment. During the war period a system grew up under which Ministers and others were permitted to undertake huge expenditures without consulting the Parliament. We have become familiar with the practice, and it seems now to be taken for granted that it should continue. The honourable member for Wilmot ( Mr Atkinson) and the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), who adopted practically the same line of argument, concluded by stating that they would oppose the amendment. member for Wilmot said that under the principal Act the Minister had power to acquire any business enterprise necessary to the building of War Service Homes, and that, therefore, this amendment was unnecessary. A moment later he declared that if the Government continued to expend huge sums of money without first consulting Parliament, they need not look to him for any further support. He said he would have to consider whether he would be justified in supporting a Government that would continue that practice. Notwithstanding this declaration, he objects to an amendment which expressly provides that the consent of Parliament shall be obtained to any proposal by the Department for the purchase of a business enterprise. Sir member merely desires to provide that the consent of Parliament Ur. Charlton. tained, why does he not say so, and omit the other part of his amendment? principle for which it provides. Those who favour the principle, and yet oppose this amendment, are taking up a very strange position. The honourable member for Dampier urged that to carry the amendment would be to give a direction to the Commissioner that he should purchase or set up big industrial enterprises. He admits that the principal Act gives the Commissioner power to incur large expenditures in such a direction, and that being so. he ought not to take exception to the amendment. It provides for the very principle for which he has declared. method is for Ministers to apply to Parliament for approval to incur large expenditures. That being so, why insert such a provision in the B ill ? contended throughout the afternoon that the Minister has power to acquire certain propositions, but that they ought first to be referred to Parliament. If that is so, how is it a constitutional power ? To my mind, the necessity to refer such matters to Parliament ought to be placed in the B ill , so that there can be no escape from it . However, very soon we shall have a division on my amendment, and then we shall have the spectacle of , honourable The honourable members, who have pointed out how absolutely necessary it is that no large sum of money should be spent without the consent of Parliament, voting against an amendment which places on the Minister the obligation to seek the consent of Parliament before undertaking any big business transaction, and doing so on the flimsy pretext that they do not think such a provision ought to be included in the Bill. member be prepared to alter his amendment to provide that the Commissioner shall not acquire any of these works without first submitting the proposal to Parliament?

268,Mr Charlton,"No ; I want thehow difficult it was for me to make repayments of money I had borrowed in connection with my home, I can speak feelingly about the position of soldiers. member think that a soldier would be safer in the hands of Parliament than if the matter were left in the hands of a Minister? 1 ing to place the matter under the control of Parliament, but the honourable member is evidently opposed to that principle. "" shall "" is used. vent the Minister from doing anything in this direction except under exceptional circumstances. I would give h i m the option of carrying on these enterprises. I take no exception to what the Minister has done recently in the purchase of saw-mills, but I hold that no money should be expended for the purpose of acquiring undertakings, although they may be found necessary to reduce the cost of building material, unless the consent of Parliament has first been obtained. If this provision is made in the B ill , there can be no ground for complaint against any transaction. It surprises me that some honourable members are opposing my amendment. Only the other day they were condemning the Minister for having purchased mills in ""Queensland at a cost of £500,000, without the consent of Parliament, but now that they have the opportunity of compelling him. to first submit to Parliament any proposition he wants to acquire, they wriggle and advance a l l sorts of excuses for not supporting it . If they have any desire to be consistent they have the opportunity of displaying their consistency by supporting my proposal. There is such a scarcity of material, and there are so many competitors in the field for the quantity available; that higher prices must prevail, and, in twelve months' time, I believe the Minister will be compelled to come down to this House and ask permission to make a further advance to soldiers for the purchase of hom.es. member's amendment add to or take away from the power which the Commissioner already possesses ? the Commissioner would be obliged to been pointed out that this House has lost [211] come to Parliament for approval of any undertaking. pleted without the consent of Parliathe honourable ment. case. There are always people who are only too anxious to cast doubt upon any transaction. My amendment would reI am endeavourlieve the Minister of any responsibility in that regard. If he recommends a certain proposition to the Parliament, pointing out that a saving would be if the word effected by it , and if Parliament consents to it , he clears himself of all future responsibility in connection with it . I think the amendment is a reasonable one. Listening to the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) one would think that his amendment was designed to safeguard the rights of Parliament as against individual Ministerial action, and protect the soldier against the Commissioner; and if that were the effect of the amendment I would most gladly support it , because it is time Parliament had more control over expenditure, and it would be better for the individual soldier to always have such matters referred to this House, but the amendment does neither of these things. It merely gives a direction, to the Commissioner to acquire these different undertakings. member contend that each individual soldier's case should be submitted to this. House1 If a better means could be devised by which a soldier could reach this House instead of through the Minister, and the honourable member for Hunter implied, that that was what his amendment sought to achieve, I would support it , but I fird that under the amendment the soldier would get no nearer to this House, and that the power of Parliament would not in any way be decreased. The Minister would still remain the sole arbiter. ter or the Department be the best judges as to whether a proposition should be acquired ? ment would be the best judges in such a No , except that case.

Very often I find myself in agreement with the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), but, in -regard to .this amendment, I .find -myself in total disagreement with him. Aa the honourable member has oladmed that all honourable members on-this side of the House .ought to support his amendment, I think it necessary to say a word or two in regaTd to my attitude towards it. I believe in the Minister and the Commissioner having .the powers they have at present under the Act. I believe in the Commissioner having the power to expend money up to the sum mentioned, £5,000. I also believe that he should not have tbe power to expend over that amount without the approval of the Minister. But, having intrusted the Minister and those associated with him with the expenditure of an .immense sum of -money, I ,am perfectly content to leave it to them ito spend it , subject always to their responsibility to Parliament. If a Minister, pursuant to the powers given him under the Act, spends money unwisely, he can be brought to book on the floor of the House. can challenge every transaction in which he engages, and if he does something that is iclearly -unbusiness-like, lie can be brought to book, and the Government that endorses his action can be thrown War Service [REPRESENTATIVES.] Homes Bill. out of ©ffice. UndeT the Act, the Minister and .the Commissioner already have power to acquire all the classes of enterprise which the .honourable member for Hunter thinks it may be .necessary lor them to undertake in the interests of the economical building of soldiers' homes. As a matter of fact, the amendment would really restrict, and restrict unnecessarily, their power in this respect. I would leave the whole .of the responsibility as to .the way in which the money is to be expended .on the .shoulders of the Minister. cept the responsibility, because it has to pass 'the expenditure. but we ihave given the Minister power to spend an immense amount of money, and if in the interests of the economical building of homes -he sees an opportunity of making a good "" deal,"" perhaps of securing a saw-mill at a reasonable price, which may involve an expenditure of more than £5,000' or even £20,000, he can grasp it ; but the amendment would compel him to come down to the House and allow Parliament to discuss the advisability or otherwise of carrying out the '""' deal.'"" get an .option. could.

However, suppose the Minister gets an .option on the purchase of a saw-, mill. Just imagine this business proposition being introduced to the House. There would be .all sorts .of wrangling. My experience in the House is that it is exceedingly difficult to have any question discussed on its merits.

I ask the Assistant Minister to adopt, by administrative act, the principle that operates in 'Western Australia under the Workers Homes Act, whereby, if the estimated cost of the building is exceeded, the excess is added to the worker's obligation for the time being, and he is allowed a period of months, and in some cases years, in whioh to pay off such excess.

Repayment provided same basis ns prescribed in Act limiting capital cost. I also suggest that the cover for all homes to be erected under the Act should be sufficient, and let me disabuse honourable members' minds on another point. If an applicant for a home asks for extras while the house is in course of erection, or for any alteration in the plan resulting in increased expenditure, he should pay the difference in cash. I am arguing for those cases, and there are many, in which an applicant for a home is not in any way responsible for the added expenditure, and finds that he has to put up a certain amount in cash before he can get into his home. Probably cases similar to these have given colour .to statements that we hear outside that -the War Service Homes Department are ;really charging a deposit on their homes, 'whereas we know that they do not. However, in this way a deposit is virtually The Department then rebeing secured from certaia applicants, definite undertaking that, in the administration of the Act , cases similar to that which I have mentioned, will Be met by allowing the increased cost to be spread over a number of months rather than by demanding hard cash from the applicant.

These offieials would prepare plans, which had to be submitted for approval, however, to the Commonwealth Bank.

Another case which bas come under my notice has to do with a returned soldier who happened to be a carpenter, and a decidedly smart young builder. He prepared plans of a home which ha was desirous of erecting for himself, and which he could have constructed for less than the amount indicated by the Department in respect of its plans. man's plans were a decided improvement on the standardized sets, but, because his -,7as not a standard plan, he was not given permission to build tbe house for himself, liven although he was prepared to carry on under the supervision of the Oommisrioner's staff. He became so disgusted i.hat eventually he borrowed money from friends and put up a house for himself. Incidents such as these reveal pinpricks and the placing of unwarranted disabilities in the way of furnishing returned soldiers with homes. Where a returned man happens to be a builder or carpenter, surely it is better to let him do the work In that city, there rather than that others should be put on to the job while he continues to draw his sustenance allowance. What is the use of that to him while be stands idly by, perhaps, watching the work of men who are not as competent as himself? The hard-and-fast standardization of plans But the Commonwealth may have its advantages, but in individual cases, such as I have mentioned, the Commissioner should be free to exercise his discretion. the Commissioner will receive a quiet hint from the Minister that, in such circumstances, the returned man shall be allowed some little say in the matter of building his own home, for which, after all, he must pay, and in which he will live. The case for returned men has been quite properly put by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Burchell). It is possible that a man may, in all honesty, exceed the estimate by a small amount, and may find it impossible to furnish the difference in cash. There is no reason why the Department should not extend the payments over a longer period in order to cover the extra amount inmight arrange for increased payment of interest over the period now provided for to permit the extra money to be included in the general account. The statement of the Minister in connection with the in, crease of tbe advance does not quite meet every case. Honourable members regarded the increase from £700 to £800, not in the light of its being conceded to The returned exceptional cases, but of its being generally applied by way of meeting the added cost of building to-day. It takes at least £800 now to build as good a home as could have been reared for £700 when the principal measure was before Parliament. Returned men believe that the proposed increase of advance was intended to provide the same degree of comfort in the building of homes to-day as could have been secured when the ori-",57,Pairs

In August last this soldier submitted to tbe War Sendee Homes Department a property which he desired to purchase, and which was valued at £700. He paid the Department a guinea to obtain a valuation of it. After he had sent in""his application he received a reply stating that His offer had been accepted conditionally upon the payment by him of £35, as the property had. been valued at only £665. He was told that, if he paid the Department £35, tlie balance of £665 would be advanced to him. Upon the strength of that communication he at once concluded the purchase of the property, and handed over the £3*5 to' the vendor. Subsequently he received from a new Deputy Commissioner in Queensland aletter stating that his application had been turned down, and that the advance could not be made upon the ground that he was not in a position to undertake the purchase. This man in a letter to me points out that he is in permanent employment, and is in receipt of a wage of £4 per week. I brought the matter before the War Service Homes Commissioner and asked him to wire the authorThere must be something radically wrong Conmiissioner affirms in writing that the whilst another says that it has been re-first Deputy Commissioner authority to act? that this returned soldier shall be recouped any loss which he may sustain in connection with this transaction. To me it seems an exceedingly hard case. I fail to see how the additional cost referred to in this clause is incurred. I presume that, if a soldier has a home built for him under the War Service Homes Act, a contract .is made with thebuilder, and if the cost of the house exceeds £700 the onus of completing it is upon the contractor. that the honourable member would get many builders to sign that sort of contract. every one of the soldiers' homes which, have been built by the State Bank in South Australia, if the contractor could not complete bis contract at the stipulated price, tihe responsibility was his. that tbe Department is making the soldier responsible for tbe increased cost. wealth builds homes for our soldiers, surely it does not undertake to build them without first fixing a price for their erection.

The whole conception of the Act is in the interests of the soldiers alone. The Government are perfectly fair in the matter. A great many homes have been built, and well built, to the satisfaction of all concerned, on the basis of a cost of £700. able friends seem to have the idea that this standard price of £700 is to be increased to £S00. ever, would be unfair to those for whom homes have already been built, since the basis of the principal Act was the erection of homes at a standard cost of £700. The Government «say that in some cases the cost is a little more, and in the circumstances they very properly propose in this B ill to provide for a margin of £ 1 0 0 to cover all contingencies. It is not contemplated, however, that the standard is to be altered, and that an £800 house is .to be substituted for a £700 one. If that were done, these Eomes would probably cost nearer £900 than £ 8 0 0. The present trouble would thus be repeated, since every estimate would be based on the standard of an £800 house. I therefore submit that, in the light of their experience, the Government are taking up a very f a i r attitude. want to continue to build the £70 0 standard type of house. The cases that have been mentioned by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Burchell) and the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) are amply provided for in the proposal now before the Committee. To alter the principle of the Acti n the way suggested by the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Blundell) would be a serious mistake, and would not be in the interests of the returned soldiers themselves. B y our action in in creasing the maximum advance from £ 7 0 0 to £ 8 0 0 , the Department will be given a margin of £ 1 0 0 to meet contingencies, and in that way will be able to do justice to all concerned. am pleased to observe the enthusiasm with which this question is being discussed. Judging by the speeches that have been delivered from both sides of the Committee, our returned men are going to have a fair deal. While I regret the system under which these War -Service Homes are being built, I must compliment our returned men on the fact that they are to have a fair chance to obtain houses for themselves. Where the estimate of £700 is exceeded, however, I think it is unfair to require the man for whom the home is buil t to pay the excess in cash. That, I am sure, is not the desire of the Committee. The Some of my honorrepayment of the additional cost should be spread over a period of years. Tbat, howject to paying the additional amount. What they object to is the rule of the Department, under which the amount by which the estimate has been exceeded must be paid in cash. men w ill face a liability of £100 where the payment is spread over a period of years, whereas they would not think of incurring such a liability if it had to be satisfied forthwith. Unfortunately, there is too much red tape associated with all our Departments. In the United States of America a field marshal receives the same pension as a private. Here, as in the old country, the lower the rank of a pensioner the less he receives. I hope that the Government will go a little further than they have done in connection with this They scheme, and w ill establish a Commonwealth Insurance Department, or else make use of the State Insurance Departments of Queensland and Victoria. Unfortunately, the insurance companies, w i th the great power of their money, have not given the Victorian State Insurance Department a fair chance; but, as the result of its creation, premiums have been very considerably reduced. The United States of America insured every soldier, without medical examination, who had been accepted for service. Under their system a soldier could insure his life up to £2,000 for a premium of £ 1 5 . Such a policy would have cost an Australian soldier £ 1 5 0 per annum. I want the Government to establish a system of Commonwealth insurance, and to insure I every one of . these War Service Homes against fire. In that way, those of our returned men, for whom homes were built, would be saved a vast amount of money. The Victorian State Government used to collect from the State railway employees the premiums due by them to insurance companies. In that",61,Pairs

The Repatriation Department will have to collect the instalments payable from time to time in respect of the purchase money for these homes, and could at the same time collect the fire insurance premiums, so that the cost of the insurance scheme would be reduced to a minimum. It would thus be possible to insure at 'rates f a r below those charged by the insurance companies. honourable members to read the splendid speech delivered by my honourable friend ( Mr Tudor), as reported in Hansard, page 4687. It is a compendium of in formation on this very question of insurance. The honourable member showed .the f o l lowing startling facts:-In Brisbane, where ""the premium on a wooden building was formerly £5 2s. I d . , the rate f e l l to £ 3 8s. when the Government insurance scheme was initiated. The premium on a brick building fell from £ 3 15s. to £ 2 10s. A t Toowoomba the premium on a wooden buildingfell from £ 3 12s. to £ 2 8s., and a brick building from 5s. to 4s. A t Warwick the premium on a wooden building fell from £ 1 2s. 3d. to 14s. l O d .; and in the Darling Downs district the premium on a wooden building fell from £ 4 7s. to £ 2 12s. 2d. For the first time in the history of insurance, the StateI n surance Department in ""Victoria has actually returned the whole of the premiums paid by insurers for whom the necessity to insure has not arisen; that is to say, a refund has been made to persons who did not employ the number of workers covered by the premiums paid. Although my voice might be like that of the solitary pelican crying in the wilderness, I could offer a suggestion as to how these soldiers' houses could be built at an infinitely less cost, and by which they would ultimately become a most excellent rent-producing asset for the Commonwealth that would continue for ever and ever. I hope honourable members will forgive me for my reiteration of this argument, but after thirty-one years' close study of the question, I am certain that it is the only way in which the country can clear itself of the avalanche of debt that is, unfortunately, lying on it to-day. I would like to see the Government issue War Service Homes currency notes as the buildings progress, all rents payable for the soldier occupiers, which would be much less than the payments provided for in this Act , being earmarked and paid into a f u n d , and on a certain day in each year, when that f u n d has risen to a specified amount, so many of these currency notes being burnt. Chanter) -The honourable member is not in order in dealing with that question on this clause. I invite show the Government how they can save the extra £ 1 0 0 in the building of these homes. Perhaps another opportunity will be afforded me of doing so. Under no circumstances should our soldiers be sacrificed. Of the available manhood of Australia, 70 per cent, offered their services in the war; 43 per cent, were accepted, and 3 3 per cent, lef t our shores; 1 but we have not yet touched one penny of the last shilling. We are informed by the Commonwealth Statistician that the wealth of Australia prior to the war was £1,200,000,000, and that, during the war, it increased by £400,000,000, sufficient in itself to pay the whole of our war debt, and affording a great reserve upon which the Government can draw when the time comes to do so. I object to. saddling the interest upon our war debt upon our children's shoulders. The Treasurer once said that he could readily see how Canberra could be built at no u l t i mate cost to the country. Surely he can see that the same can be done with regard to these soldiers' homes. The Commissioner, with or without control, and if he is the right man in the right place, will no doubt see that these soldiers' homes will not be a loss to the community, but ultimately an asset. Treasurer) [9.22] -This is one of those cases in which the trouble is not all on one side. I heard for the first time tonight with, I confess, some surprise that the Commissioner was compelling soldiers to pay in cash the difference between the actual cost of a house and ""the amount contracted for, and that seems to me to be a hardship, seeing that the soldier may not have the cash to put down at the time. If he is a married man, in all probability he w ill not have it , and if he is about to get married, he will want a little ready money with which to furnish his home.

' That has nothing to do w i th the question which the honourable member for Fremantle in troduced, and which was not really relevant to the clause. I do not say that an actual promise has been made, but there is a widespread impression amongst the soldiers, whidh .has not been discouraged by the Minister, that a B ill would be introduced whicE would make' available £ 1 0 0 more in each case for the purpose of building soldiers' homes. The Treasurer says the soldier insists on getting a £700 house. Let me direct his attention to what has happened' inmy own electorate. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Blundell) spoke of what is done in South Australia.. It may be that for £700' a very fine house can be erected in South Australia, Western Australia, or Queensland, but eo difficult is it to erect houses near the metropolitan area of Sydney for £700 that the Commissioner has been up against the municipal by-laws, which fix a minimum of air space for houses erected even in industrial centres. centres where house building, is expensive is that we are providing homes,, the rooms of which are smaller than the average in the localities in which they are built. In order to squeeze the estimate within the £ 7 0 0 , we are building homes that the soldiers are very reluctant to buy. There hag been a demand that a greater sum should be made availablei n order that homes more in accordance with modern ideas of decent housing accommodation should be provided. I ' have had scores of letters askingwhen the £800 will Be available, and the impression exists throughout New South Walest h a t the Minister has promised' that a BilT w ill be introduced to raise the amount from £700to. £ 8 0 0 . I am sure that if the statement made by the Minister a few moments ago, that 'the proposal' in the B ill is onlyintended to meet the case p u t by the honourable member for Fremantle^ represents what the Bill really means-, it is not what the soldier expects and' notwhat he is entitled to, in view of the increased cost1 of buildingsoldiers' homes. The honourable member for Kooyong. ( Sir Robert Best) said that we built a house for £ 7 0 0 three years ago and thafr we ought to go om building houses for £700' all. t h e way through, even though, the cost of building them may have doubled or trebled-. That argument is too absurd to be presented to the Committee. Whatwe are trying to do for the soldier is not to build a house for a certain sum, but to give h i m a. home embodying a. certain degree of comfort 'and usefulness for his use and occupation. If it is found that the house which cost £700 three years ago to-day costs £800-,. our duty is to see that the soldier gets the right kind of house, and not that the design is cut down by £ 1 0 0 because material has gone up £ 1 0 0 . I move the amendment to ascertain whether the Committee are going to. adhere to the £700 maximum of the Act , with the suggestionthat the Treasurer has accepted, or whether they intend to keep f a it h with the soldier and give him as good a house as could be built for £700 when the Act was passed,, but which in my judgment, will now easily cost £ 8 0 0 . I wish to omit the words which impose on the Commissioner the necessity of seeing that special circumstances, j u s t i fy Ms actiam, in order that the Committee may W h a t is happening in the direct the Minister tliat the £ 8 0 0 maximum shall be substituted for the £700 one.

It would be very much better for this House, the Minister for Repatriation, and the War Service Homes Commissioner that the whole of the details should be presented in a report to Parliament m the same way as private trading concerns, whatever they may do publicly, present a report covering such details to their shareholders. information concerning the operations of the Commonwealth Woollen and Clothing Factories. railways, either. fore long, Parliament will insist upon being supplied with more information in connection with some of the enterprises which have been referred to than we have been given up to the present time. were not for the Commonwealth Clothing Factory, the uniforms of our soldiers would have cost nearly double what they have cost. the objection to giving us detailed information of the operations of the Factory? titled to reasonable information, but it seems to me that the honourable member for Dampier asks for too much detailed information. surer what is the objection to giving these details? Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) that we might, in this way, inform private saw-mill proprietors of the stocks we have in hand does not appeal to me. I wish to know what will be the result of this enterprise. T have seen the results of 'similar State enterprises in Queensland and Western Australia, and they have not been satisfactory. found that in both States the prices at which the State saw-mills were cutting timber for the Commonwealth were quite as high as those charged by any privately owned saw-mills insurance in Queensland has had tbe effect of reducing ordinary premiums by one-half. with saw-mills, and I have seen the operations of some of the State saw-mills. The system in operation in them would not be tolerated for twenty-four hours in.any decently conducted private enterprise. As a matter of fact, no private enterprise could conduct its operations in any such way. This House bas a right to insist upon the fullest information on all these matters, and I therefore hope that the clause will be passed as it stands. Treasurer) [10.9] -The honourable member who has submitted this clause has often complained of the lack of information supplied concerning the working of Government Departments, but in this new clause it appears to me that he goes to the other extreme. The honourable member quite ingenuous in dealing with this matter.

This is what the Oommonwealth Railways Act providesTlie Commissioner shall, as soon as possible after the close of each financial year, submit to the Minister an annual report and balance sheet, showing stocks on hand, depreciation of property, proceedings, and an account of all moneys received and expended during that year.

That, surely, will include War Service Homes, timber mills, and every other branch. The amendment also asks fora balance-sheet showing cash and stocks on hand, and an account of all moneys received and expended during that year. It goes on to ask for what I take to be a third balance-sheet operations in connection with timber mills. this sectionTho Commission shall furnish to the Minister annually, for presentation to the Parliament, a report of the administration and operation of this Aet. That covers everything. I suggest that the honourable member-for Dampier( Mr Gregory) should be content to terminate the first paragraph of the amendment at the words "" showing trading operations in connection with timber mills."" that the Government twelve months ago paid £85,400 for five mills in Victoria. If that sort of thing is to go on ment spends money in that way. stop you. means. If the honourable member goes on as he proposes, he will stop the operations of the Departments entirely. actions secret? No member of the House knew of the purchase in Victoria. Sir JOSEPH COOK I fancy honourable members did know of it . had a complete revelation this week. We ought to have known about this before. Sir JOSEPH COOK I think that honourable members should know. I may inform the Committee that I have never given the Commissioner a shilling for anything tbe application for which has is the obnot had the Minister's imprimatur upon it. whole business of which we complain. Sir JOSEPH COOK I think honourable members are stressing this matter unduly. There are many operations in connection with every Government Department that go on in this way, b u t because one transaction has been dragged into the daylight, and looks largerand I think it is a pity that Parliament was not consulted in regard to it , if that could have been done-d o not imagine that everyother little transaction should be dragged before the -House. If all transactions were referred to the House, honourable members could do nothing w i th them. H u n dreds of thousands of these operations showing trading are carried on by the Government during the year, and no matter what the House The Repatriation Act includes may do, it can never control the details of these departmental transactions.. That must be recognised by every honourable member who has had administrative experience. May I recall honourable members to a middle, moderate, and sweetly reasonable course? I dislike extremism on either side; and I desire to bring the extremist chairman of the Public Works Committee ( Mr Gregory) back to a sane, moderate course. surer think that when the House was discussing the Queensland deal some information should have been given ' by the Government in regard to the purchases in Victoria? honourable member that we are restraining the Commissioner in every reasonable way.

471,Sir Joseph Cook,"I assure the year's end to year's end. members should be reasonable. There is no trouble in the Repatriation Department or the -Commonwealth Railways branch. The 'Commissioner of Railways makes an annual report, setting forth all the operations, of the Department, and that is laid upon the table. The amendment asks fhat the Minister and the Commissioner shall give this detail and that detail, and dot this "" i "" and cross this ""t."" move That all the words after ""mills,"" in .parahonorable members ought to foe thankful graph (1), be left out. The amendment will still provide foT two balance-sheets, and that should be enough for anybody. The balance-sheets will include a resume of the operations for the year, and will .show all the trading operations in connection with the timber mills. Surely honourable members do not want more than that. proposing .to exclude paragraph 2? remain. Treasurer's proposal.; but tbe Committee must decide upon it. member is very stubborn when he makes up his mind. -The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) might very well accept the suggestion made by the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook), because in its present form the clause will limit the nature of the report to a great extent. A legal axiom, as applied to. the Constitution, states that the more you define the more you limit. That is a truism that we all ought to accept. If honourable members will turn to the Budget papers they will see there a fairly detailed balance-sheet in connection with the Commonwealth Shipping line, giving gross expenditure on the fleet, office, and general expenditure in London and Australia, interest on capital to date, amount written off for depreciation, and so on. The Minister has promised a balance sheet of that description in relation to the operations of the saw-mills. Honourable Mr .RILEY. -We also get a balance sheet in connection with .the Woollen Mills and other factories. parliamentary papers dealing with the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, Cordite Eaetory, Clothing Factory, and other Government activities. All these returns are certified to by the Auditor General, and a similar return in connection with War 'Service Homes acThat is going to extremes. I tivities ought to be sufficient. I support -in principle the contention oif the honourable member for Dampier, and think that 'to him for having brought this matter forward, because it was a serious lapse on the part of the framers of the measure in connection with a big Department like the War Service Homes, for by the time we have finished building soldiers' homes the expenditure might be in the region of £60,000,000. This money will eventually be repaid, but, nevertheless, Parliament must not lose its grip on big finannot cial operations of this kind. not bear any loss on the operations of these mills, though. if there should be a loss on these minor operations in the big scheme; but, for the most part, the soldiers will have to find the cash eventually. [10.24] I advise the honourable member for Dampier .(' Mr Gregory) to accept the reasonable proposal made by the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook). The balance-sheet will then include a profit and loss account of each timber mill. There is some ground for the contention of the Minister that any returns giving the superficial feet of timber cut would involve a very great deal of detailed work and expense; but the honourable member may at any time call for a special report in respect of these matters if necessary. to eliminate that portion of the clause requiring the presentation of a profit and loss account. want to insist particularly on a profit and loss account being furnished to Parliament for all these separate ventures.

The suggestion made by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) for the presentation of a profit and loss account is a very valuable one, and if the Treasurer would acquiesce perhaps' it would meet the situation. inclusion of a profit and loss account being furnished in respect of each timber mill, and will, therefore, amend my amendment 'by retainingthe words '' and a profit and' loss account of each timber mill."" Amendment amended accordingly. On the understanding that the Treasurer will accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster), I take no objection to the clause being amended in the direction indicated. My reason for desiring the detailed information was that when the Commissioner purchased these mills in Queensland he made certain definite statements about the profits that were going to accrue f r o j i the transaction. I want to be> able to follow up this matter next year and the year after to see whether his statements were justified or not, and in. order that honourable members themselves may be able to arrive at a definite conclusion.
