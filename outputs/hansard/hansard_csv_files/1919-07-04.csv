13,"Upon Which Mr Higgs Had Moved, By",,20,Ministerial Statement Motion Of No Confidence
14,Mr Considine (Barrier) [11.3],"Trust is operating strongly in the Commonwealth to-day. sented by a Commission appointed by the United States Government to inquire into the Chicago Meat Trust and its ramifications, quotations from which appeared in the Barrier Daily Truth of 5th A p r i l last, there is given a list of the operations of the Beef Trusti n various countries. According to the report of the Commission, Armour and Company, of the Meat Trust, are represented in Australia and New Zealand by Armour and Company, of Australasia, and Swift Company, also members of the Trust, are represented in Australia by the Australian Meat Export Company. The Commission reported thatTlie Commission had to meet deliberate falsification of returns properly required under legal authority; we had to meet schools for witnesses, where employees were coached in anticipation of their being called to testify in an investigation ordered by you (President Wilson) and by the Congress of the United States; we had to meet a situation created by the destruction of letters and documents vital to this investigation; we had to meet a conspiracy in the preparation of answers to the lawful inquiries of the Commission. The public were told that no "" Trust"" existed, and that the "" Big Five"" were in most effective competition, but the report declares that "" these five .corporations and their 500 odd subsidiary, controlled, and affiliated companies, are bound together by joint ownership, agreements, understandings, communities of interest, and family relationships."" In the three years 1915-1916-1917 four of the five big concerns made net profits amounting to Â£35,600,000, and it is stated that in 1917 their earnings were more than four times as much as in the year before the war. The Commission went on to sayI t is our opinion that the failure of American meat production to keep pace with population is in large measure due to the conditions created and maintained in the markets by the Big Five. This may well be the Teasonf o r the high cost of meat and other commodities in Australia. It has been denied from time to time that the Meat Trust is' operating in Australia. claring, on unimpeachable testimony, that it is operating not only in America and other countries, but in Australia. Despite the fact that this evidence is in .the hands of the Government, that all this informaI n a report pretion is available to them, they show no disposition to take any action in regard to the Trust. A t this critical period in our history, when we are facing a readjustment of industry and thousands of workless people do not know where they aTe to obtain the next meal, the Government are still unprepared to do anything. The Ministerial statement deals with a number of comparatively immaterial matters, but there is not even a hint in it that the Government intend to do anything to alleviate the necessities of the people or to deal with Trusts and Combines. I do not wish to weary honourable mem. bers by making long quotations, but I desire to place before them an extract from an article entitled "" The Simple Annals of the Poor,"" which appeared in the Age of 20th June last. This statement is made, not by a Bolshevik or a red-ragger, but by a newspaper in an article dealing w i th the work of the Ministering Children's League. Referring to a meeting held by that League. in the TownH a l l , the Age states that I t was a pathetic picture of the lives of the little children of parents who were "" inefficient -no t very .good at anything,"" and whose helpless inefficiency was assumed to be largely due to stunted or ill-nurtured physiques. The fathers have very poor earning capacity, and they are the first to be dismissed when work slackens.. Therefore their little ones know too much about want. One child, just returned from the Cottage by the Sea at Queenscliff, met her mother with the cry, "" Mother, thero was food left over after every meal!"" As Sister Emilie, of the Central Methodist Mission, said, that one sentence revealed a terrible condition of affairs in that child's home. It is only too tine that this state of affairs relates not to the home of one child only, but is characteristic of thousands of homes in Australia to-day. The honourable member for Franklin several hundred soldiers had been prevented fro m returning to their homes in Tasmania because of the action of Mr. Walsh, general secretary of the Seamen's Here we have a Commission deUnion, in calling out the crew of the Wyandra. That statement illustrates the .colossal hyprocrisy of the Government, who are trying to persuade the people that the seamen are the cause of the present",20,Ministerial Statement Motion Of No Confidence
15,( Mr Mcwilliams) Said Last Evening That,"trouble. As a matter of fact, the Government are deliberately holding up the coal supply and trying to utilize the Seamen's Union, just as they availed themselves of the Eveleigh Workshops dispute in 1917, to starve the women and children of this country, and to blame tlie workers for the trouble, in order to break down our industrial organization.

105,"I ""Had The Privilege"" Of Meeting Mr Mur","want now to say that good as were Mr Murdoch's opportunities for obtaining information, it was not always possible for him to go to the best source, and his .periodical letters to certain newspapers in this country were hut the expressions of opinion of Mr Murdoch, and of nobody else. Australia we have different view-points on matters of immediate importance, and in just the same way it may be assumed that Mr Keith Murdoch's view-points differ from those of other well informed people in the Old Country. It is rather unfortunate that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to >bhe Sun, bedoch in that journal on 25th February, 1919 :The shipyard strikes are delaying 0,000 Australians in England, and causing keen disappointment amongst the troops. Monash has ascertained the views of the men awaiting passages, who include a large proportion of unionists, with the result that artisans have freely volunteered to fit the ships. Tliese men wore immediately engaged on two vessels, sent to -the southern ports from London. Tliey receive union wages, besides their military allowance, and are working vigorously. I quote that to show that Mr Murdoch, in Ids capacity as a pressman, is also prepared to see the other side of an argument, and that while he wrote in December of certain things that were not being done as expeditiously as might be desired -afte r aU, but an expression of opinion on his part-whe n it came to a question of fitting up ships he was prepared to, faithfully , advise the'people of Australia what was being done. We had a further statement from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that ' instructions had been issued by the Government to send our soldiers back to this country at the rate of 15,000 per month .for a certain .period, and that for the balance of the time only 10,000 a month were to be sent. Director^General sonally, and quite straight; that the proposals of the Government were for 12,000 to be sent in December, 14,000 in January, 16,000 in February, and so on, increasing by 2,000 per month until .the Mr Burchell. whole of the men were returned. Yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition stated that the Government deliberately prevented men from returning to their that, after all, homes. member 'know what was proposed?

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Higgs) sees things from one point of view, while I , perhaps, view them from another angle. It is no reflection upon the honourable member, then, when I say that my views and opinions do not tally with his. fers to official documents. sequent events, his information must have been from official documents, because it was true. what were the instructions given, and arrangements attempted to be carried out by the Demobilization Department. the soldiers ever had.

115,Of Demobilization Per,"Mr BURCHELL I am not prepared14,000 men should he sent away. In mistake, I gave the figure just now ae 12,000 men. January; 18,000 in February; and so on, increasing by 2,000 each month. Those arrangements were made in December. Mr Keith Murdoch wrote his letter on 8th December; but the arrangements of the Demobilization Department with the Shipping Comptroller were upon the basis I have quoted. been charged that they deliberately blocked men from coming home. They did nothing of the sort. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition quoted certain figures regarding the number of men despatched during December, January, and February. Those figures, I believe, are correct. They are certainly not up to the totals which I have ju6t quoted, the reason being that the I m perial Government could not provide the ships. The Shipping Comptroller could not keep anywhere near to his original agreement w i th the Australian Military authorities. In regard to the figures which Mr Higgs quoted, it must be kept in mind that i u February there was a tremendous slump. The total went down to about 4,000 or 5,000 men. That was directly due to the great strike throughout the United Kingdom among the men responsible for refitting and finishing the fittings on troopships. It was not a question of a strike among waterside workers, as we know that body in Australia, or of a strike of seamen; it affected carpenters and artisans. The trouble was not settled in London and Southampton u n t i l some considerable time after matters had become normal in other ports. Wef e l t the effect of the strike in February, mainly because tlie ships which had been allotted to the Australian troops by the Shipping Comptroller were in the Thames and at Southampton Docks. That fact explains the fall in the February returns. General Monash-as Mr Murdoch cabled in the extract which I have just quoted-know ing that the Australians would include a very large number of unionists, and that they would not desire, unless circumstances were very grave, to attempt to take the places of the men on strike, simply put the whole case before the men themselves. I know, from personal contact with the situation, that he stated There were to be 16,000 sent in the position to the men who were to come home on one ship in particular, and that was the Euripides. He said, in effect, "" There is the ship at Tilbury Docks at the present"""" moment. I cannot control the strike. I am not in any sense responsible for it . On the other hand, I cannot secure a vessel from the Shipping CompThe Government have troller to replace that ship. It is for you .men now to say whether you will take the place of those who are not at work, and prepare the ship to be sent home witb yourselves on board."" Thereupon a number of the Australian troops concerned undertook to fit that ship as well as others; and that is how the difficulty was overcome. Moreover, . Mr Keith Murdoch told the Australian people on the 28th February that that was so; and I can support what he wrote, because it was an absolute fact. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made another statement to the effect tliat strong pressure would secure ships. doch said. It is a quotation from one of his articles. able member's pardon. I was under the impression that he had made it as his own statement. I only know this, that General Monash and his staff, and Mr. Hughes on every conceivable occasion, and Sir Joseph Cook at every opportunity , did their utmost to get shipping from the Comptroller. Honourable' members opposite, however, should place themselves in the shoes of the Comptroller. That official had not only the Australians to consider-h e had to provide for the transport of food supplies to England. He knew that there was food to be got from the United States and Canada. He was compelled to bring the foodstuffs from the nearest points first, in, order to relieve the tension. British public opinion would never have stood for an official who would say, "" Let us put all the ships on thc Australian run. Let us send all the Australian troops home in them. There is food to be got from Australia; but I w ill admit that the ships w ill be away for six",28,Yates Bu T I Can The 13th Doch On Several Occasions And I Can Speak
116,Mr Higgs,That is what Mr Mur,29,Yates Bu T I Can The 13th Doch On Several Occasions And I Can Speak
117,Mr Burchell,"I beg the honormontlis, while, if I were to send vessels to Canada they would be there and back with foodstuffs within a month."" We should endeavour to realize, also, some of the difficulties which our representatives in the Old Country have been, and are, up against. It is not simply a case of putting up their hands and saying, "" We demand the ships."" Mr Keith Murdoch knew that as well as I did. General Wisdom was appointed to take charge of transportation organization. I met him a few days before I left London, and I sliall mention what was said at that meeting merely to indicate the attitude of responsible officials concerning demobilization.. General Wisdom was in high glee -that I was unable to travel upon her. He said, "" I have just secured another 3hip which the Canadians had had on offer, hut which they have not been able to use. I have persuaded the Shipping Comptroller to turn it over to the use of the Australians; and, although it means that we must prepare our draft and make ready all the necessary information after the men have been selected, and that we shall have only five days in which to do it, I have nevertheless agreed that we shall fill the ship and send her out."" That officer has been right through the mill, starting as a major and finishing as a brigadier. He knows the game. He. knew what the Australian soldiers wanted. that extra ship that he showed his gratification in unmistakable manner. While honourable members in this House criticise the Government and hold them responsible, tbey must remember that the individual administrative duties in London are being performed by men who are as keen to get the Australian soldier back home' as anybody out here in Australia. speeding up of our soldiers happened tralian troops."" Then he went into the only after Mr Keith Murdoch's expose? that that was the case. Let us examine "" Z "" ; and General Monash placed those the various dates. Mr Murdoch wrote from the Old them-no t as instructions from the GoCountry, and' January's figures showed vernment, but as a Corps Commander. an increase over those of December. perhaps. then came the slump during February. After that, followed the increase in March and the subsequent continued increases ever since. ber also explained that our men fitted the ships themselves; so that could not have been placed as an obstacle. According to the honourable member there was only one ship. knew positively of the Euripides. That happened to be because I had been placed on the boat roll to sail on the vessel. I might add that it'was owing to influenza home, did you sleep in a hammock? cots! member need not worry about that. I invite him to consider the statement of General Monash, made on 26th November. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said Sir John Monash addressed senior officers of the corps on 26th November, after receiving instructions from the Government. He may be interested to know that General He was so keen over getting Monash and Mr Hughes did not meet from the date of the signing of the Armistice until 1st December. The honourable gentleman said, further, that General Monash would never dare to deliver an address to his senior officers. That makes me smile. Sir John Monash is a wise man. He called his senior officers and others together and said, "" I have been asked by the Government to accept the was it that the responsibility of demobilizing the Auswhole thing with them.

I left France on the 24th November, 191S, and was in London one week ahead of General Monash. I was intimately associated then with the demobilization work, and I knew the moves .that were being made. After hearing that statement the honourable member will know that I have sought to give him informatiou and prevent any misunderstanding regarding the officer who is responsible for the demobilization of the Australian troops. whether, in your opinion, Monash is competent to carry out the demobilization ? body who knows that gentleman will agree that Australia could not have had a better organizer or a more competent man, from both a military and a civil point of viewa man with broader knowledge of what the Australians require, or better equipped with the driving force necessary to carry on his organization well and promptly. ing now ? saw General Monash arrive in London on the 1st of December with a few senior officers in order to create and conduct the demobilization scheme, and I have seen his Department grow, and the work done, at close hand.

That is my firm conviction after hearing all the arguments and discussions, and having read the information afforded by the press. rather disrespectful towards the British Government ? thing in it disrespectful to the British Government. The honourable member knows as well as I do that the gentlemen who compose the British Government are human just as he and I , and are liable to make the same sort of mistakes. After all, it is time after time necessary to get to the right man in order to ""make good."" The honourable member for Capricornia referred to a speech made by Major Henley, who is member for Burwood in the New South Wale3 Parliament. No date was quoted as to when the ships in question were offered and refused, and I remind the honourable member that to offer a ship to the Australian authorities to-day, and say that it must be loaded on Sunday is not practicable. On this side of the world we desire every man to return with a f u ll statement of his affairs as they have developed oversea. In giving this information, I am not using technical terms, but stating the facts as briefly as possible in a fashion that honourable members can accept and appreciate. We desire to have with each man a photograph of his pay ledger card in order that when he arrives here it may not be, as it was originally, a matter of weeks and months before he can be finalized. Profiting; from mistakes in the past, the Department on the other side decided that after selecting a man for a quota or draft, they would get all the particulars and papers necessary, and send them on the ship on which the man travelled, so that he and they might arrive simultaneously. In about 1 per cent, of the cases the plan fails even to-day, as the most carefully arranged mechanism and administration must fail. When this honourable member of the State Parliament of New South Wales makes the assertion he does, it would be as well to find out the date on which the ships were offered and rejected, and the period that was allowed in which they were to be filled with men. I do not know the circumstances at all, but thing has since been denied in London. gesting that there may have been a reason why the offer was rejected, if it was rejected at all. NowI am advised there has been an official denial. Honourable members may not be aware that originally it was proposed by the Imperial Government that all oversea troops should be returned to their home countries direct from Prance, and, acting on that assumption, thc Canadian, the South African, the New Zealand, and thtUnited States Governments got to work and made their plans for demobilization. However, there was a change in the programme, and the change was notified only after the armistice had been signed. 1 ask honourable members generally to bear in mind what this one change alone would mean in the way of organization. Large bodies of men cannot be moved unless careful arrangements are made for the movement, and for proper feeding, housing, and so forth. By way of illustration, I may say that in the Old Country it was not possible to get the necessary camp accommodation for our Australian soldiers without much delay and much cross-firing between the Home authorities and the representatives of Australia. Ultimately, the difficulties were overcome, and we were able to get additional camps. I do not think that honourable members opposite would desire Australian soldiers to be quartered in tents on Salisbury -plain in winter time. hers had been there themselves! honoraible member, and on this question the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) and myself will be in accord. teen in a tent, though the honourable member has not had that experience. what I saw of oflicers generally. ber has no right to judge unless he knows.",31,Yates Bu T I Can The 13th Doch On Several Occasions And I Can Speak

189,Mr Burchell,"It may have been,office, a table, and a telephone; writing material eventually came along; and 1 was bold, ""The Australian Imperial Force is there; select the staff you need to carry on this work, and go ahead."" Not knowing the Australian Imperial Force very intimately, I sought the advice of officers who did, and secured the names of a number of men who were considered suitable for the class of work I had on hand. ThenI applied through the departmental channel of Horseferry-road to have these men sent across from France to London for the purpose of an interview; because the work I was doing was performed wholly by men who volunteered to remain in Great Britain and see it through. I emphasize my use of the word "" volunteered;"" it has a bearing on something which I wish to say later on. It took me exactly six weeks to get one senior officer from France to London through the Horseferry-road administration. It took me ten days to get another officer through -the Demobilization Administration. was not excessive for an officer to spend ten days in reaching London owing to the transportation delays that ensued upon the signing of the armistice, but a delay of six weeks was outrageous. That is my experience from an interdepartmental point of view. Now, in reference to the voluntary work of members of the Australian Imperial Force in London, Senator Pearce has been accused of having taken twenty-seven pay clerks from Australia to the -Old Country. It was in January last that Senator Pearce left for London with these officers, but at that time one had the ment in Australia, in my judgment, make greatest difficulty in the world to get members of the Australian Imperial Force to volunteer their services for any work in London. When news came to Australia from Great Britain that clerks were scarce and worth their weight in gold, and that the necessary work had to be done by employing English people in the Australian offices, the Defence Department decided to send these twenty-seven pay clerks from Australia to London, where they were required. was no desire on the part of the Administration to force a member of the Australian Imperial Force to leave France against his will and go to London, and thus be blocked from returning to Australia. despatched after the chance of doing the work had been offered to practically every man serving over, there. gated time after time, through General Orders, that this work was available. I have seen official letters from the Acting Corps Commander, General Hobbs, and from other senior officers in France, showing that they did their utmost to meet the request of the Director-General of Demobilization that he should be supplied with the necessary clerical assistance. that returned soldiers did not have the opportunity of getting those positions, and that men who had not seen a day's active service were chosen in preference to them. double-barrelled complaint, but I believe I am right in saying that quite a number of the.men who went away from herein fact, about half of them-hav e seen overseas service. Silting suspended from 1 till 2.15 p.m. the promptitude with which the Government dealt with the. work of demobilization in London after the armistice had been signed, I do not think that the complexities of the undertaking were realized by Ministers here, nor did the Governthe preparatory arrangements which ought to have been made before the armistice. The matter was brought under the notice of the Govermnent in July and August of last year, but while the demobilization schemes of other countries, including some of the Dominions of the Empire, had been outlined and agreed upon by their respective Administrations, we in Australia were undecided. Various propositions were put to the GoThere vernment, but were neither rejected nor accepted.

194,Mr Burchell,"Whil e I commendattention been given to tbe original suggestion put forward from the Imperial end. I am glad that the Leader of the Government requested me to deal with the demobilization proposition. BeforeI left the Old Country, General Monash also asked me, not only to advise members of the Cabinet here as to what was taking place, but also to make it as widely known as possible, since he recognised tliat the work he was undertaking, which was not perfect in his eyes, needed some explanation, in order that .the people, and particularly the members of this Parliament, might appreciate some of the difficulties associated with it . Turning to the repatriation proposals in the Ministerial statement, I say quite frankly that my brief experience in my constituency taught me that the work of repatriation bristled with difficulties. The Department entered upon it without any precedents for its guidariee. Precedents had to be created from day to day and week to week, and at the outset the machinery governing . the repatriation effort was necessarily imperfect. There have been individual cases where the regulations framed under the Act have pressed harshly, and, in the view of some honourable members, rather unjustly, but my experience of the Department is that it is not only sympathetic in its treatment of the returned soldier, but does its utmost to meet the varying and conflicting requests that are put forward. We all know that what suits one individual may not suit another, and that a regulation framed to-day to meet, perhaps, quite a number of cases of a particular kind may be apt to press heavily on other individual cases. Taking the work of the Department all through, however, when we find that, after allowing for the men who have returned to their former avocations without assistance, only 4 per cent, of those who have been dealt with by the Department have not 'been satisfactorily placed, we must agree that its performance is most creditable. I was surprised that the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson) should have attempted to throw on the Mr Burchell. 1 Government the whole responsibility for the industrial unrest prevalent throughout Australia to-day, on the ground that they had not made it easier for various unions to approach the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Every honourable member of this House is familiar with the constitutional and either difficulties that have been in the way, so that the honourable member, in seeking to lay the whole of the blame at the door of the Government, was most unjust. He knew perfectly well that his statement was incorrect. The effect of the return to civil employment of the men who have been fighting is not being felt in Australia only. The matter is one that affects the whole world, and industrial unrest to-day is world-wide. In to-day's newspapers there appears a cablegram reporting a speech made by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), in which he clearly indicates that industrial unrest in the Old Country is a very pressing question, and reminds both Capital and Labour that in order to satisfactorily settle it, the greatest care must be exercised in the re-absorption of our tens of thousands of soldiers into civil employment. I believe that in this process a good deal of friction is inevitable, since it means the displacing of a great number of women workers and of others who necessarily filled the gap during the absence of our men at the front. That friction, however, is not going to be removed by the making of inflammatory speeches. Every honourable member should realize the responsibilities resting upon him, and if we are to assist in bringing about a better understanding between employer and employee, we should get to grips with the problem before the nation. ber be surprised to learn that 323 out of the 400 men on the Repatriation Department unemployed list for South Australia are labourers? prised. In the State of which I am a representative a number of those appearing on the Repatriation Department's unemployed list are artisans.

There are strikes in various parts of the Commonwealth to-day, while others are threatening. Honourable members opposite aro now pledging themselves to favour arbitration as against direct action. Many of them throughout their political career have been in favour of arbitration, and whether it be by a reference to the Court or by round table conferences, we must have some form of arbitration if we are to bring about a clearer and better understanding between employer and employed. WhatI desire above everything else-and I say this to employers as well as employees-is that there should be a more humane feeling displayed between the two parties. say that there should be more equitable results ? member will permit me to elaborate my argument, he will learn exactly where I stand with regard to the industrial problem. While ""in the Old CountryI .had an opportunity to deal directly with the National Alliance of Employers and E m ployed. I was surprised to discover that in that organization there were many men ing world, as well as amongst the industrial classes, that the Federation of Trade Unions, with its general secretary, Mr Appleton, 2,000,000 workers, was directly affiliated with the Alliance. I found that on the executive of that body organized Labour had equal representation ""with the employers, that they met on terms of absolute equality, that the principle of one man one vote was applied, and that in every way the object of the organization was to create a better understanding between employer and employed. I found, also, that the work of this organization was most effective. We are discussing in Australia to-day the report of the Whitley Commission. That Commission was the outcome of an organized effort on behalf of the National Alliance of Employers and Employed to secure the appointment of a Select Committee of the House of Commons to deal with the subject. That Committee was converted into the Whitley Commission, whose report was influenced and swayed by the experience of its members of the working of this very organization. I invite honourable members to get together, and to have a heart-to-heart talk as to the best way of meeting the present situation. It is useless for one side to .be abusing the other. There should be no tearing down. There should be no saying this, that, and the other , of the capitalists, and there should be no condemnation of the worker by the employing class. will have to talk in that way to his abusive Prime Minister, and induce him to alter his tone.

One of the principal representing some officers on tlie Labour side of this organization is a man named H a r r y Duberry, who, for several years, was the secretary of the Independent Labour party in the United Kingdomi n pre-war days, and he is not a man who by any stretch of imagination could be charged with truckling to employers or to capital. Other men who have given the whole of their lives to the cause of organized labour in the Old Country-me n like Ben Tillet, Appleton, and others who could be quoted-ar e members of this organization, and are meeting, for the sake of the workers whom they represent, the direct opponents of all the Conservative ideas of the Motherland.

The objects of the alliance, briefly stated, are as follow:1. To promote active co-operation of employers and employed in the treatment of questions generally affecting labour and employment in all trades and industrial occupations. 2. To promote the welfare of the industrial workers of the country, and efficiency of its industries. 3. To promote arrangements for facilitating the reinstatement in civil employment at the end of the war of men serving with the Forces, and also munition workers. This organization was only formed in 1916. It was bred out of war-time conditions, and with a knowledge of what the war might eventually mean. In the report for 1916-18, the following excerpt is quoted from one of the ""Whitley reportsTho causes of industrial unrest are clearly associated not only with the industries and the technicalities relating thereto, but with thc wider social, domestic, or national questions. affecting the homes and domestic concerns of the people. I am sure honourable members opposite have all questions affecting the homes and domestic concerns of people at heart. Those are among the things with which this organization dealsWe arc convinced that these causes are not local or peculiar to any particular industry, but are of a national character, and a remedial policy must be adopted by the Government quickly and vigorously, if the incipient and I went down to the growing dangers now threatening the industries are to be averted. What is wanted is a new spirita more humane spirit, one in which economic and business considerations will be influenced and corrected, and, it is hoped, will be eventually conThey did not feel very much trolled, by human and ethical consideration. The main cause of unrest lies deeper than any mere material consideration. The problem, is fundamentally a human, and not an economic, I should be only problem. A new spirit of partnership is therefore essential. The gentlemen responsible for the formation of this alliance thought so much of those remarks that they put them into their report.

To-day, realizing their responsibilities, they are helping in this work. honourable member w ill understand, they have "" got the wind up."" Is not that the reason ? with that at all.

There is no question of the British Government "" having the wind up "" is there ? .Unfortunately, the workers' organizations, for some reason or other, turned the. proposition down, according to cabled reports. Again, in West Hartlepool, a private employer offered his employees in a shipbuilding concern equal representation on -the directorate, and, 'after the payment of their own and other salaries and working costs, an equal share in"" this profits.

Although its stores are packed w i th foodstuffs from floor to ceiling, there are empty stomachs in this glorious country of ours. Would the honourable member for Fremantle see his dependants starving whilst every shop in Perth and Melbourne is f u l l of the very foodstuffs that are necessary for the maintenance of human life ? We, as legislators, if we are prepared to Tise to the occasion, ought not to wait for amendments to the Constitution or for action on tlie part of the State Governments. If we valued' the lives of human beings we should have prepared for this time. But what have we been doing ? Resting On our oars. I do not blame this Government exclusively for that. I blame the Fisher Government, Hughes Governments, and the present Government, for not so organizing our industries that we should be prepared for the demobilization of our troops. for Fremantle supported them all. tinues to do so. Tliese are stern facts that we have to face. I would not shrink from adopting any means-eve n the smashing of the Mace, or the tipping of Mr Speaker out of his chairif that would bring food to the hungry. take my share of the risk incurred in any such action. I am sure that the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Spence) well remembers the dire distress which followed the collapse of the land boom National and the great industrial troubles that occurred in the early nineties. We all know W h y do not honorthe persecution and the starvation which ensued. We have the iron in our souls to this day, as the result of the treatment which was then meted out to innocent people. God forbid that there should be any repetition of those times in Australia. Yetf o r more than twelve months I have been urging that the same spirit that existed in. the early nineties exists to-day. There is' a tendency on the part of employers, assisted by capitalistic Governments, to squelch trade unionism in this I withdraw it . I have no country. No effort is being made to bring about a better understanding beI want to look at Austween employers and employees. There is no endeavour made to rescue the people from the talons of the profiteer and to provide employment for the people. I feel almost the blush of shame rise to my cheeks when I read on the political programme of the National Federation the plank, "" Unemployment insurance."" What an awful indictment that is against an intelligent and up-to-date people. Ought there to be any unemployment in Australia? To that question every voice in this House w ill reply, "" No ."" I . am not surprised at the present industrial unrest in this country. Knowing, as I do, the spirit of the men and women of the working classes, the wonder to me is that there is not still greater unrest. We, here, talk about this thing and that the succeeding thing. Yet we do nothing. Parliament has become merely a talking shop. When we stress the industrial unrest caused by the excessive cost of living, some honourable members whine, "" Why, we have tried to induce the people on two occasions, to give this Parliament larger powers, but they have turned down our proposals."" Buti t has always been the policy of the Labour party to t r y and t r y again. When the people were first asked to give this Parliament greater powers under our Constitution, by an overwhelming majorit y they declined to do so.

We were then assured by our political opponents, as the honourable member for Fremantle knows, that the Labour party was acting in an extremely foolish way by endeavouring to obtain at an election time an amendment of the Constitution. Nevertheless, the questions were submitted to the people, and some of those questions were within an ace of being carried. W it h that latest vote on record, why have we waited all these years without asking the electors once more to endow this National Parliament with the powers which we need ? a referendum passed this House. to have been submitted to the people. But we all know ihat it was represented to the Prime Minister that if he would set aside those measures, the State Premiers would take certain action in the direction of voluntarily handing over to this Parliament more powers than it at present possesses. We were impressed by that offer, and we were urged at that particular time to drop the Billsi n question. that they should be dropped indefinitely if the promise which was made by the State Premiers was not respected. soon as it became evident that the State Parliaments did not intend to sanction the proposition of the Prime Minister, I made it my business to wait upon Mr Hughe's. I said to h i m : "" Y o u see how things are g o in g "" ; to which he replied, "" Yes ; it is very unfortunate."" I then r said, "" The sooner we submit these proposals to the people the better."" denied that the promise was made by the State Premiers. promise was not worth much, in view of the fact that the Legislative Councils of the States had power to prevent effect being given to it . A t that time, however, the State Governments were really afraid that if the electors were afforded an opportunity to do so, they would hand over to this Parliament the powers which it sought, and accordingly they deemed it wise to voluntarily offer to surrender them. in South Australia on the second occasion. South Australia has always done' its duty in that connection. We have no right to delay in this matter. If the party opposite were in earnest, and if the Prime Minister were in earnest in a desire to remove the disabilities under which the people of Australia suffer, they would have submitted at the election in 1917 a proposal for the amendment of the Constitution.

I say that every Constitution in As Australia should be put into the melting pot as soOn as possible, that we might draw from it a National Parliament clothed with the powers which it was originally believed this Parliament would possess. We could then delegate to provincial councils-no t State Parliaments-certai n powers which they might appropriately exercise.

' I ask how honourable members think we would have got through the war if the workers had stood aside. We know very well that it is impossible to carry on any industry without the assistance of organized labour. I shall quote an extract presently to show what has been said' elsewhere regarding the necessity of ranging organized labour on the side of those who hope to do anything for the country. In a few words, It may be said that no voice was raised by the workers of the country in support of the demand for proper organization to meet the conditions with which we would be faced on the return of our men from the Front. In this connection I shall quote what was said at a deputation to the then Acting Prime Minister (Senator Pearce) when the Prime Minister was absent on his first visit to the Old Country. The deputation represented the Trades Hall Council of Melbourne, and there was present on it also ,a South Australian Minister, Mr Anstey, who happened to be in Melbourne at the time. He heard that a deputation was to wait on the Acting Prime Ministeri n regard to the organization of industry, for the time when our men would return, in order that unemployment would not be pre-, valent during the reconstruction after the war. The deputation waited on the Acting Prime Minister (Senator Pearce) on Friday, 24th March, 1916. There were present, in addition to those to whom I have referred, a number of members of this House. All the speakers laid before Senator Pearce the necessity of organizing properly for the time when the demobilization of our troops would take place.

242,Mr Fenton,"The difficulty towould be worse than criminal if the Commonwealth did nothing to prepare for that time when it came. When fhe word came that the war was over, and it might come suddenly, thousands of men would be thrown out of employment in Australia. The Commonwealth should be prepared to divert that labour into productive channels. Speeches of a similar character were delivered by many at that deputation. Mr. Hughes, prior to leaving for Great Britain, had intimated hy a speech in this House, and .by some aotion he took, that the Governmenit intended to establish a Bureau of Science and Industry. This was one of those high-flown titles which are given to some organizations, and which, though they impress some people, never impress me. I never had very much f a it h that this organization would do much for our Australian industries. We told Senator Pearce that the Bureau would he of very slow growth, would probably be controlled by a number of university professors, and that very little benefit would accrue from it to the industries and workers of Australia. We pointed out to h i m that organization as necessary, in order to prepare for the time wheu the war had come to an end. Pearce's reply to the deputation, but I can give the effect of it . He said .that he quite realized that the representations made by the deputation were quite correct, that the Bureau of Science and In dustry could not meet all the demands of Australia, and would certainly not satisfy the people of Australia in making their industries prosperous, establishing new industries, and providing employment for the people. He said he would take the representations of the deputation to Cabinet, and that the Government would endeavour to evolve a scheme to meet itheir wishes. I make hold to say that, had the Government at that time taken in hand the propei' organization of industry in Australia, we would not be in the muddle in which we find ourselves to-day in regard to demobilization and unemployment. _WÂ© should bave done it long ago, and we are late in taking action', but we must do something in this matter. I am sorry that the honourable for Premantle is not here, because I proMr Fenton. pose to make a quotation from the London Times of 10 th May of this year. I was looking over tbe file the other day, and from the latest number on it I extracted many valuable quotations. In the Times of the 10th May of this year there is an article which contains the f o l lowing statement:If the Government must depend primarily on the support of the House of Commons in the most decisive of all the .phases of the great conflict, it is absolutely of the first import, ance that they should carry with them the great mass of organized labour. That is the opinion of the London Times, and I believe it is the opinion of Mr. Lloyd George. I believe that his efforts have been, very largely in that direction. In the reconstruction period he is desirous of having behind h i m the whole body of organized labour. The Government in GreatB r it a in are doing theiT best not to antagonize organized labour, but to show themselves as friendly disposed to labour as possible They realize, as do many writers of distinction in the Old Country, that without the 'assistance of organized labour, reconstruction after the war must be a terrible failure. That course is not I have not Senator being followed in Australia. The workers of this country have recently been called by the most opprobrious names. We are called to order sometimes for what is said on this side, but I remember distinctly that only quite recently a certain honourable member on the other side, pointing to the Ministerial 'benches beneath him, said, "" We are the builders,"" and, pointing over to the Opposition, "" You are the wasters."" ber is welcome to that opinion; but the remark was disorderly, in the first place, and it was also distinctly offensive and absolutely untrue.

That may be regarded by certain people as a mere bagatelle. But it is when such comparatively small amounts are heaped on each other that a huge aggregate is discovered. that particular site required? There is land available in the Victoria Barracks yard which should amply serve the requirements of the Repatriation Department. There is also a large area at present carrying only some old iron buildings, at the corner of St. Kildaroad and Wadey-street, at the northern end of the Barracks block. It is occupied now by the Victorian police. has an area of, approximately, 84,000 square feet, with a frontage of 135 feet to St. Kilda-road, 458 feet to Wadeystreet, and 198 feet to Wells-street. The report of the Accounts Committee points out that if a building were to be erected on that land it would not be architecturally necessary to conform to the style of the existing Barracks, which are built of bluestone. If the Government are keen upon improving a property at all, why should they not improve their own ?

Owing to the serious riots in Egypt, the General Officer Commanding there suspended the demobilization arrangements, and .utilized the troops for quelling the disturbances, which were of a serious nature. It was thought that this suspension would only, mean a matter of a few weeks delay, but, as it appeared to be longer, tinCommonwealth Government took up the matter with the Imperial Authorities, and strongly objected to the delay in demobilization, and to the Australian troops being used as part of the Army of Occupation in Egypt. A.s a result of these representations, conducted in England by tlie Prime Minister( Mr by the permission of the Government Hughes) and the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), the Imperial Authorities decided to relieve the Australian troops of this duty, and the shipping authorities were directed to provide ships as soon as possible for their return to Australia. As a result of this action. eight ships were allotted for conveyance of Australian troops from Egypt, and the 'dewere premobilization is now in f u l l swing. The system adopted for demobilization of the Egypt troops is to return them to Australia by units. Prior to the suspension of demobilization, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Regiments had left Egypt, and havo since reached Australia and been demobilized. The 3rd Regiment reached Australia last week, and the 4th Regiment is now nearing Australia. Advices have just been received to the eifect that the 5th, 0th, and 7th Regiments embarked and sailed on 2Sth June, and thc Sth Regiment aud ANZAC Divisional Details embarked and sailed yesterday. The total number of Light Horse Regiments in Egypt was fourteen. It is anticipated that the remaining six w ill cmbark in the ships allocated, and leave Egypt before tlie end of the month.

A side of the case which seems to have been lost sight of is the position of the doctor on the s.s. Sonoma. No doubt, the shipping company wished to get r i d of ain unwelcome visitor, but its doctor seems to have trespassed beyond the bounds of decency in getting rid of him, because I find that both morning newspapers in Sydney, in describing "" the imminent death "" of Freeman, reported that 'the doctor on the s.s. Sonoma had said that Freeman's temperature was down to 93, and that he was on the verge of collapse. It was found, when Freeman was removed to the m i l i tary hospital, that his temperature was 98.3, and I am quite sure it was the correct temperature, because I know that in the case of a perfectly healthy man a few days' starvation w ill do h i m no harm, provided he has an ample supply of water. A personal friend of mine does himself very well for six months of the year, and then has ten days' rigid fastj but during that ten days he does all his physical exercises and the other things necessary to keep him in good condition, and he looks just as well at the end of that period as he did at the beginning of it. have been suspended to-day for referring to the fact that certain people had to undergo a compulsory fast. ber is disposed to get up a personal subThe gentleman whose scription for those unfortunate people who have been -thrown out of work through no fault of their own, I shall do my utmost to help him, but that is a different thing altogether.

He is probably an American citizen. he is probably laughing heartily now, and may laugh heartily when he reads my remarks.
