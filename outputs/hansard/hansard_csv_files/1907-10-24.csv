I hope that the Committee will be prepared to extend consideration to the industries of the smaller States. It has been said that the use of paraffine wax candles in mines is injurious to miners, but those made in Tasmania are sold for household purposes, the miners obtaining other candles to suit their-special requirements. candles made in Tasmania could be sent to the other States for use in the mines. whilst we have on the mainland much larger factories, which can successfully compete with them. as a good protectionist, ought not to complain about this duty. on any of my platform pledges. first offered myself as a candidate for election to this House, I said publicly that I believed in a fair protectionist Tariff, and would vote against any duty that was calculated, in my opinion, to be prejudicial to the public interest. My proposition is designed to do justice to Tasmania, and I feel confident that the representatives of the larger States will be prepared to do this act of justice to an industry of one of the smaller States. The Tariff Commission took evidence in Tasmania, as well as-on the mainland, in regard to the manufacture of candles, and the protectionist section of it recommended the imposition of a duty of Jd. per lb. on paraffine wax. The Chairman of the Commission, the honourable member for Bendigo, in dealing with this question , in the course of the general debate on the Tariff, saidAt the same time we recognised that there were candlemakers in Tasmania and New South Wales who were making composite candlesthat is candles composed partly of stearine and partlv of paraffine wax-and we declined to accede to the request to increase the duty upon paraffine wax and the raw material, because any such action would oppressively affect the manufacturers in question. That decision was arrived at after careful consideration, and I hope that it will be endorsed by the Committee. move That the figure "" id.'"" be left out. If that amendment be adopted I shall of paraffine wax tends to increase the use submit a further proposal that the Governof tallow, an Australian product, in the ment be requested to bring down a message candle-making industry. to increase. the duty to 2d. per lb. It is generally recognised that the use of paraffine wax candles in mines should not be encouraged, as they are injurious.to the health of the miners. If we allow paraffine wax to come in at a low duty it will be used extensively for moulding candles in Australia, with the result that our large stearine candle works will probably be closed, and many men thrown out of employment. Stearine is manufactured in Australia. The raw product, from, which it is made is produced in abundance here, arid I fail to see why we should destroy a great industry for the benefit of foreign producers. here. be produced at the shale works at Hartley Vale, New South Wales, but the quantity is infinitesimal as compared with our outWhenI put of stearine. Australia is a stockraising country, and, therefore, the raw material necessary for the manufacture of stearine candles is produced here. I hope that my proposal will be agreed to. amendment proposed by the honourable member for Balaclava is designed to prevent the introduction of paraffine wax. I would point out that, on page 12 of the report of the free-trade section of the Commission, it is stated thatSome of the niakers who protested most loudly against the importation of the -material were the largest buyers of it, and made candies with the largest proportion of wax. Among these were Messrs. Kitchen, Mowling, Upton, Clarke, Testro, and Gillies. A certain proportion of wax is absolutely necessary in the making of some classes of candles. The principal ground on which it is urged that we should encourage the manufacture of stearine candles is that stearine is made from tallow,-which is kinnon, a well-known candle manufacturer, told the Commission thatThe use of paraffine wax enables a larger quantity of tallow to be used in the manufacture of candles. A lower percentage of the by-products required to be extracted, while the use of the wax stiffened and finished the candles made of this low-grade stearine.

91,Mr Bruce Smith (Parkes) [3.47],"each one giving the lie to the other. The only effect which this correspondence has had upon my mind has been to convince me of the great value of a body like the Tariff Commission, which sat in a judicial capacity, which subjected the authors of these communications to a most searching cross examination under oath, and which, after hearing their evidence, endeavoured to arrive at a conclusion which was just and reasonable under all the circumstances. That Commission sat for two and a half years. Its Chairman was the honourable member for Bendigo, who is a confirmed, protectionist. After hearing all the evidence in favour of those who advocate adutv of 2d. per lb. upon these articles, and also the testimony of those who favour no duty at all, the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended that the rate of duty operative under the old Tariff should be adopted. I am informed that the comparative statement relating to the Tariff, which is before honourable members, contains an error. The honourable imember for Illawarra assures me that, under the B column of the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, the words "" i o per cent. "" should be substituted for "" 20 per cent."" He ' further tells me that 10 per cent, is .equivalent to Jd. per lb. The protectionist section of all the evidence of manufacturers, recommend the adoption of a duty of Jd. per lb., and the free-trade section of that body recommend the imposition of a duty of \ d . per lb. Therefore, even if we accept the recommendation of the protectionist half of the Commission. member accept their finding in respect of all the items in the schedule? that I shall, but I will accept the complete Tariff Commission's findings, because its members are in an infinitely better position to judge of this question than we are.

Now, it may be a very proper thing for honourable members to echo the recommendations of large manufacturers who happen to be located in their particular constituencies. it is the right thing to do.

But whether the Treasurer said so or not, does not touch my argument that we are here to do our duty to the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. We are here to remember the consumer-the forgotten factor in protectionist arguments. I feel that it is quite impossible for any of us to give these matters the same judicial treatment that has been given to them by the Tariff Commission.

In view of the fact that paraffine wax candles are .said to be injurious to miners, we ought to do all we can to encourage the use of -candles made from Australian stearine. The Hartley Vale Company are manufacturing oil from shale, and, no doubt, will be able to turn out paraffine wax as a by-product. It is anomalous to impose a duty of 2d. per lb. on paraffine wax candles, and then to propose a duty of half that amount on paraffine wax, thus nullifying the decision at which we arrived a few minutes ago. pointed that the Treasurer has adopted an attitude which will prevent any honourable member proposing, with any hope of success,' that the duty on paraffine wax shall be raised to 2d. per lb. reduce the duty from i d . to Jd. Under the latter duty, which was fixed in 1902, practically no stearine was introduced into Australia; and, from that point of view, I am personally not particular whether the duty be Jd. or i d . per lb. In regard to paraffine wax, however, I think In that the Committee would be right in making the reduction suggested. I suppose that 90 per cent, of the candles made in Tasmania are of paraffine wax; and it would not pay any firm there to erect a still for the making of .stearine, because such a still would have to be run day and night, and would turn out more stearine than is required in so small a community. There were four factories in Tasmania not long ago under the duty of Â£d. representatives per lb., but now there are only t w o ; and we may readily imagine the result to the remaining factories if the duty be raised to i d . If we are to have protection it ought to be fair and just all round. It is unjust, merely in order to bolster up' Messrs.

I am satisfied that the Committee will give that generous consideration which is author of essential to the industry by agreeing to the amendment proposed. The manufacI have already inturers of stearine candles have nothing to fear from the manufacturers of Tasmania, who could not possibly compete by exporting their product to the mainland.

We exported during last season from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia about 1,250,000 56-lb. boxes of butter, every one of which had to be lined with waxed paper. An equal number of boxes would 'be used locally, also lined with waxed paper. Waxed wrappers are also used in the confectionery trade and in the 0 putting up of tea. It is also used in the local finishing of certain electrical goods and in many other ways. In fact, paraffine wax is the raw material of many manufactures and trades outside candle-making.

Sydney) [4.15] -It is evident that the suggestion that the duty on stearine and paraffine wax should be increased to 2d. per lb. is due to a desire to make a wholly unnecessary gift to the large candle manufacturers of Australia. The proposition' is an extraordinary one. We have already increased the duty on foreign candles from id. to i j d . and 2d. per lb., although under the old Tariff the manufacturers here had practically captured the bulk of the Australian trade. Apparently the local manufacturers have sufficient influence to secure the acceptance of their representations, For inand eventually their prices will be raised to the full extent of the duty. We are asked to make a large gift from the moneys of the people of Australia to those engaged in a successful industry. The shares in some of the candle-making companies of Australia have been advancing, and their present rates are far above the levels of previous years. We are .now asked to.so fortify them that no one will be able to compete with them. By the imposition of a duty of 2d. per lb. not merely on paraffine wax, but on stearine and the other associated articles in this item, we shall enable the large local manuout any small competitor. The smaller in which these duties are dealt with by the Parliament. It is all very well ""for representatives of Victoria and New South Wales to support the imposition of duties which they know, or ought to know, will lead to a monopoly in their own States, but they ought to be prepared to extend consideration to the manufacturers in other parts of the Commonwealth. I am prepared to accept the statement of those who are competent to speak with authority on this question that the use of paraffine candles in mines is injurious to the health of the miners, but if their use for such purposes is to be discontinued it will be necessary for the States to impose a prohibition. Eveni f we adopted the proposal of the honourable member for Balaclava we should not overcome the difficulty. Paraffine is already being produced in Australia, and Sir George Newnes' company will shortly give an increased output. It seems idle to declare that paraffine is injurious and should not be used in imported candles, whilst at the same time we allow paraffine wax to be locally used. one of the two evils by producing paraffine for our own use. the whole secret. As a matter of fact, a considerable quantity of paraffine wax is used in composite-candles, and the duty of 2d. per lb. will not prevent the use of such candles in our mines.

I ami also reminded that the honourable member for Hindmarsh made a similar statement. Now, as a matter of fact, almost 50 per cent, of the total importations of paraffine wax into the Commonwealth come from the Straits Settlements and from British Burmah. If honourable members will turn to the comparative statement relating to the Tariff and to importations and duty payments for 1906, they will find that our imports of paraffine wax during the year totalled 6,457,692 lbs., valued years' the British ImperialO i l Company competitor Trust of America, with the result that the latter has"" not the monopoly which it formerly enjoyed. I wish, further, to point out that in the stearine industry very little labour is employed. The bulk of the work is performed by machinery, and the industry is one that we are not justified in attempting to bolster up. making industry throughout the Commonwealth is practically in the hands of a very few individuals. ' These have already crushed a number of the smaller manufacturers, and under the monopoly which we shall give to them, if we sanction the duty proposed, they will possess even greater power to crush small competitors. I do not think it is the desire of the Committee -that we should create monopolies. If anything is to be done in the way of promoting industries, I think that, even from a protectionist stand-point, more regard should be paid to the struggling man than to the individual with an immense amount of capital, who by means of business combinations is in a position to crush his smaller rival. But honourable members seem determined to give every possible assistance to the bigger men who are able to pool their interests, and thus establish monopolies. Later on we shall be doing our best to circumvent the very monopolies which we are now creating. ber is one of those who is assisting to pass legislation which' will have the effect of creating monopolies. monopolies. ference between the two evils. I do not see that the competitor who is crushed by a monopoly is benefited by the knowledge that he is crushed by a local and not by a foreign monopoly. If I were to be placed under a steam roller and crushed into pulp .it would not be any consolation for those who are dependent upon me to know that that roller was made by a local firm, and not by a foreign one. The effect would be precisely the same. To me it would not matter whether I were crushed by a roller of foreign manufacture or by one which was manufactured in Collingwood.

There is the iron-making industry, for instance, which must of necessity be a monopoly; but surely it is not suggested that, therefore, we must not develop that industry and make our own guns and machinery. The same principle is involved, only its application is of lesser degree, in the case of candle-making.

The honourable member for Yarra said that in the manufacture of stearine candles there was four to six times more labour employed than in the manufacture of paraffine wax candles. I am sorry the honourable member is not in the Chamber, because I should certainly have liked to hear some justification for that assertion. The labour cost in connection with the manufacture of candles was gone into very closely by the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission. I may point out that the protectionist section of the Commission did not seem to bother themselves' much about the labour cost of this or any other product. I contend that the labour cost is one of the most important facts to be taken into consideration, especially by protectionists, when deciding as to the rate of duty necessary. On this subject, the free-trade section of the-Tariff Commission say, at page 20 of their reportWitnesses were in practical agreement that the entire labour cost in the manufacture of best stearine candles does not exceed Â£ 6 per ton. At' an average price of 4d. per lb., the product would thus be worth ^37 6s. 8d. per ton; therefore, the proportion of labour cost to product would be 16 per cent. Wax and composite candles cost much less, from Â£ 1 ns., all wax, up to Â£ 3 ios. per ton for composites, including the making of the stearine. At an average factory value of 3id. per lb., equalling Â£ 3 2 13s. 4d. per ton, the labour cost would range from 5 per cent, for wax to 11 per cent.' for composite candles, according to quality. There is a very great difference between those figures and the ratio presented to us by the honourable member for Yarra. honourable member draw from that fact, in regard to the item before us? is there is no justification for the proposal of the Government, but that, on the contrary, there is every justification for the recommendation of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission. On the question of labour cost, I would refer honourable members to page 19 of the report of the free-trade section 'of the Commission, where it is shown that Mr Testro, one of the most competent witnesses that we examined upon this question, gave evidence thatWith an up-to-date plant, costing .Â£40,000 or less, and 150 men and boys, he could produce all stearine required by the Commonwealth.

In dealing with this question of labour cost, are we to consider the labour employed in every industry even remotely associated with the manufacture of stearine?

The position of those honourable members seems to be that they follow the recommendations of the Tariff Commission when it suits them to do so, and ignore those recommendations when these are not in accord with their opinions. D i d Parliament relegate to the Tariff Commission the right to fix the duties? If Parliament did do so, why should we put ourselves and the country to the trouble of considering the Tariff? In my view, however, the Royal Commission was appointed because it 'was considered that a few men could collect, better than the larger body of Parliament, evidence from those who are directly interested in industries, and present of ment, in its wisdom or unwisdom, to decide what shall be the Tariff of Australia. lost sight of the fact that the Committee have already, by a large majority, fixed the duty on candles made of paraffine wax, and also of other materials. Yet we are now discussing the question whether we shall allow the importation of the raw product at the low duty of Jd. per lb. by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. with the Tariff Commission. I am assured by men who work in this industry that, in the manufacture of stearine, six times -as much labour is employed as in the manufacture of candles. I am not a candle maker, and, like honourable members opposite, can ' only speak from information received. I may -say that I have little concern with employers ; my only interest is with the working men who sent me here. 1 have enough common sense to know that unless employers can make their businesses pay, the wages paid must be small; but the -information I have given as to the proportion of the labour employed, is that given to me by those who are most closely 'interested, as employees, in this industry. Under such circumstances, where is the -common sense in allowing paraffine wax to be imported in large quantities? be derided for expressing the opinion that Tasmanian manufacturers ought to be able -to manufacture the whole of the candles required in that State. But I see no reason why that should not be so. I cannot believe that the only chance of the Tasmanian manufacturers lies in importation of this raw material. Surely there is enough tallow in Tasmania to provide all the stearine that is required; and I say that in spite of the fact that some ,Â£40,000 has been estimated as the cost of plant and machinery, I have known candles to be made in a little shed, at very much less than their cost to-day, though, of course, it must be admitted that the larger and the more modern the appliances, the cheaper the production. In my opinion, the manufacturers of Tasmania ought to be able to place the natural stearine product on the market as cheaply as do the manufacturers of Victoria. ' Anthe result in the shape other fact which seems to be lost sight of a report, leaving it to Parliais that in New South Wales to-day paraffine wax is being produced, and that a duty would be beneficial to the manufacturers of Honourable members seem to have that State. It has often been said that the protectionist proposals are made in the interests of the cities of New South Wales and Victoria; but, as a matter of fact, the oil works of New South Wales are situated in the country. Knowing that we have tallow here, and also paraffine wax, it seems illogical on the part of any protectionist, even of the milk and water and revenue tariffist order, to accept the proposal for a duty of Jd. I quite understand that many honourable members, who represent mining or agricultural constituencies, must pay regard to the price at which the candle is placed on the market; but it has been proved over and over again that protection does not eventually mean Of course, an increase in price, but rather the"" reverse. There are innumerable examples of the truth of that statement, and I am not claiming more for the manufacturers here than I am willing to concede to the manufacturers and producers in every other porOf course, tion of Australia. Honourable members may not be immediately concerned in this item before us, but the time may come when items in which they are interested, and in regard to which they expect to get some support speaking from an Australian stand-point.

We must be guided, not by any consideration of what may suit the people of one electorate, but rather by a desire to benefit Australia generally. industry is a large one in which some of our natural products are employed, and it would be foolish to impose a high duty on the manufactured' article if we did not also impose a reasonable duty on the stearine and wax used in the production of that article. I should like to see a duty of 2d. per lb. imposed, since we have imposed a fair duty on the finished product. should like to remind the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that the proposition that the duty should be reduced to Jd. per lb., so far from being a free trade one, was actually made by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. After taking evidence, and giving the matter full consideration, that section of the Commission recommended that, in the interests of Australian industries, and from a protectionist, and not from a freetionist view of this question, because the trade or a revenue point of view, a duty of ^d. per lb. should be imposed. That being so, the Opposition are not raising, in this case, the fiscal issue. the position taken up by the honourable member for New England. Notwithstanding the efforts that we are making to suppress monopolies, he does not seem to be very much concerned about their creation. He ought to remember, however, that it is ' a very serious thing to suppress a young industry in any part of Australia in the interests c of a big combine or association. We may not be able to do all that we want to do, but young industries, although perhaps they do not employ a large number of men, should receive from protectionists a. fair amount of consideration. ber affirm that there is a combine? sonal knowledge, but I understand that the great candle manufacturers of the. Commonwealth have an arrangement which practically makes them an association. The Royal Commission have reported to that effect, and the statement has not been denied. We must remember that the Commission was composed of gentlemen of very great intellectual power and experience who have had the advantage, which we have nothad, of 6eeing the witnesses and hearing the evidence. They have laid it down that the great manufacturers of candles have a. The candle-making sort of association which is tantamount to throwing the whole industry under the one power, even if it does not mean turning the whole of the profits into the one pocket. Whether a man is a protectionist or a free-trader his feelings are rather in favour of the small ""struggling industry which has been able to fight combinations."" industry in Tasmania is purely artificial. a little more desirous of preserving the plant, which has been struggling under such unfavorable conditions. When the old Tariff was under consideration, a statement that a man and a boy had a.tinpot factory in Little Bourke-street carried the whole Committee, but when we now hear that factories in Tasmania have to fight against dumping and all sorts of contrivances, the position seems to be different. We are not asked to forsake the protecprotectionist branch of the Commission proposed, the' very duty which the honourable member for Bass desires should be imposed.

For that reason, if for no other, I sincerely trust tion of the protectionist section of the Tariff that the Committee will pass the item as it stands. Although a large section of tbe Committee would doubtless have supported a duty of 2d. per lb., we felt that a duty of i d . per lb. would be sufficient, and as the on this side whom he regards as his enemies, Government proposition is a moderate one I trust that it will be endorsed by the Committee.

The higher rate proposed by the Government is not asked for by the trade, and is not needed for protective purposes, because the local manufacturers have command of the market. Therefore, if imposed, it can only so to swell the profits of the manufacturers by increasing prices. That is a business-like view which even a protectionist might take. As for paraffine wax, I am informed that the best quality is made in New South Wales, although a great deal is imported. Much of the imported wax is used in candle-making; but the candles in which it is used will be raised, while no more employment will be given. Under these circumstances, I cannot understand the action of the Government in wasting time by sticking out for their proposal. Why do they not accept the recommendaCommission, and let us get on to some other item better worth fighting about?

The honourable member for Hindmarsh has declared that paraffine wax is a product of Australia, and that, therefore, we ought to encourage its use. Is he prepared to adopt a similar line of reasoning in regard to the imposition of a duty upon kerosene? members have affirmed that Tasmania 'should produce her own stearine. But Tasmania is only a small State, and to establish stearine works there would necessitate a capital . outlay of about .Â£40,000. Even when the works had been established, there would not be a sufficient local demand for their produce. Any business man must recognise that it is impossible to establish such a large industry as stearine in a small community like that of Tasmania. Of course, it has been urged that such an industry would be in a position to export its produce to the mainturbed when a suggestion was made that a land. But large stearine works have already been established there, and Tasmania would not be in a position to compete successfully against them. The statement has also been made that the paraffine wax candle industry in the State which I represent employs only a limited number of hands. It . may be my misfortune, but throughout my life I have made it a practice to study the weak and the poor. If my.honourable friends of the Labour Party will adopt a similar course upon this occasion their action will redound to their credit. 'employed in the industry ? do not go round the factories inquiring as to the class of labour which they employ. But during the course of this debate it has been pointed out that one of the Tasmanian manufacturers was considered good enough to be selected to contest a Senate election as the nominee of the Labour Party. The Government boast that they have accepted 400 of the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. Why, then, do they ignore the conclusion at jvhich that section arrived in respect, to this particular item? I -have been charged with considering this matter from a provincial stand-point, but if any other industry in the Commonwealth occupies a similar position to that of the paraffine wax industry of TasmaniaI shall be found supporting it. mania could purchase their paraffine wax from New South Wales.

Medicated confectionery, if dealt with in item 291, will bear a duty of 15 per cent., whereas, if the amendment be carried, it will have to bear a duty of, perhaps, 60 or 70 per cent. Medicated confectionery is quite distinct from ordinary confectionery. One class of confectionery is supposed to give a great deal of pleasure, while the other is intended to cure pain of some kind, and is simply a medicine. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [8.28] -The honourable member for Parramatta is quite mistaken, because, under whichever item medicated confectionery appears, the duty will be about the same. Under item 291, the medicated confectionery is described as "" troches,"" which would include, for example, cough lozenges; and I am informed by the Comptroller-General, that,while the duty will be about the same, it is more convenient to collect it under the heading of confectionery. seems a likelihood of this amendment being accepted very quickly, but I warn honourable members that it represents a considerable danger. If the Treasurer had taken the trouble to read the report of the Royal Commission on secret drugs, he would have found that a large and important part deals with what is called medicated confectionery, under cover of which, not only drugs, but alcohol in various disguises, is dispensed. I suppose, however, that the only object of the Treasurer is to get his Tariff through, iand obtain revenue.

It is contended that the drink habit is engendered by the juvenile consumption of the form of medicated confectionery. Chlorodyne and other dangerous drugs are .made up in this way. Just as in the days of our childhood, a' Gregory powder was administered to us in a spoonful of jam, fo various drugs are concealed in confectionery. The honourable member for Barrier, who has taken a keen interest in the question of patent medicines, should be able to give us some interesting information on this question, and I think the matter is. one which we should take into serious consideration. Amendment agreed to. move That after the figures "" 3?d."" the words "" and on and after 25th October, 1907, (General Tariff) per lb. 2d.,"" be inserted. During the discussion of the Tariff reference has been made again and again to the facility for the formation of combines which is afforded by high protective duties, and before granting further protection to any industry we should be careful to .ascertain whether any combine exists in relation to it. I have nothing to say against the confectionery works in Victoria, which I inspected a few days ago, and which I found to be thoroughly up to date; but I have before me a copy of a letter addressed by Mr W. T. Home, secretary to the committee of the retail confectioners, to the editor of the Argus, and published in this morning's issue of that newspaper. Mr Home writes' I am desired by the committee of retail confectioners' to place before our legislators and the public the reasons for and against the increase in duty on confectionery. The proposal is the outcome of efforts put forth by the local manufacturers for many months past, and when the present tariff was announced it came as a surprise .upon an unorganised body of shopkeepers who had to face the strongest combination of manufacturing confectioners Victoria has yet seen, backed up by a bank balance so substantial 'that opposition seemed almost hopeless. LYNE -The amendment Mr W. Bowman, whom we have to thank for voicing our side through your columns,has shown"" ("" The Argus,"" October 15) that all manufacturers but one had joined the combine, the smallest being required under the constitution to pay Â£1 0 entrance fee, an'd a subscription of 2^ per cent, weekly upon this, eciual to Â£ 1 3 per There are annum. This is not a ordinary trade association, and its constitution proves that it will be almost impossible for any' new manufacturer to commence business, unless be becomes a member, and the combine reserves to itself the right to refuse admission. Turning from the power and financial strength of the combine to the industry sweets in itself, we claim to have shown very conclusively that the progress made by manufacturers is proof that under 'the former tariffthey were amply protected. In the progress report of the recent Tariff Commission (page 8), in spite of decreases shown, in Queensland and Western Australia, figures are given showing that the whole number -of factories in the Commonwealth increased in six years (1899-1904) from 71 to 79, and the number of hands employed from 1,845",44,Pairs

Since the last date given, a still more striking proof of the progress made is found in the report of the chief inspector of factories (Victoria), issued in May I do not think it is necessary to read the whole of the letter. It contains a direct charge that a combine exists amongst certain manufacturers in the confectionery industry in this State. I intend to make an effort to show that such a combine exists. I shall begin by reading a letter written by Messrs. Bennett and Taylor, importers and wholesale confectioners, and published in the Argus of 25th September.

The letter is as follows. In your issue of yesterday a-nnears a statement by Mr MacRobertson, denying altogether that there is a Confectionery Combine, or that anything in the nature of such exists. On or about the gth August, we, by request, waited on the Secretary of the Chamber of Manufacturers with reference to a document which we wereasked to sign under threat of being refused local goods. In this document was embodied a clause binding those who signed to procure all their requirements for the' confectionery trade, only through members of the Victorian Manufacturing Confectionery Association. As, at one stroke, this would rob us of a considerable portion of our business, we refused to sign. On the evening of August 14th we again attended by request at the Chamber of Manufactures, and had the matter further threshed out, with the result that the association gave way with regard to oversea importations, but absolutely prohibited shipment from Sydney, even insisting that we must cancel all contract with New South Wales. proves the incorrectness of Mr MacRobertson's statement, and is conclusive evidence of an existing Combine. Additional proofs to the above facts of the working of a very real and live Combine will be given at the proper time and place.

Sirs, As a Retail Confectioner, I protest against the increase of Duties on Confectionery, for the following reasons :ThatI shall have to bear the extra burden, for the position is such that I cannot charge the Public the extra duties, and I have no hesitation in saying that by allowing imported Confectionery to come in on a fair duty, the local manufacturers will be able to make progress in the future as they have amply done in the past on a duty of id., and 2d. per lb. For example, similar goods that are sold to shop-keepers in England at rod. per lb. and are retailed to the Public there at i d . per oz., are made by the leading firms here, and are sold, to us at is. 3d. per lb., which we have to' retail at 2d. per oz., or 2s. per lb. This shows that the Public of Australia are already very heavily handicapped and the shop-keeoers here are in a worse position than those in England, for we have not got the population to work on. our rents are higher, cost of gas over 100 per cent, more, and many other things . are in keeping with those mentioned. The following are also some of the troubles that I have had to contend with :1. Short weight in the boxes. This was so glaringly rampant that though I complained to the traveller 'about it , and he to the firm, it still went on, and I then brought into' the shop my large scales, and weighed the boxes in front of the carters, and required them to put the gross weight on the boxes, and initial them, and when empty I again weighed the boxes to ascertain the nett weight received. told me there was trouble about my delaying the carters, and that I was to weigh them myself, and what was short he .would always (and did) allow me for.'

Then again, the discount has been (and I have every reason to believe is still) a source of great complaint. I have been getting 5 per cent., but J find some have been getting 10 per cent., and some 15 per cent., whilst one lady who signed our petition to Parliament showed me invoices (two of which I now hold as evidence) on which she received no discount at a l l ; yet we, as retail confectioners, are asked to trust these firms who are craving for more protection, which w ill, if carried, .injure us still further, and penalize the public.

The honourable member will be a grey-headed old man before the confectionery industry in Australia is nationalized. I wish to secure something in my own time, and not in that of my grandchildren. Butit seems to be an offence to suggest that a -confectionery combine exists. If the Minister of Trade and Customs is not in a position to reply to my statements to-night, he might very well agree to postpone the consideration of this item until he is.. Some of the comments upon the Confectionery Combine which have emanated from 'the members of the Labour Party are rather -amusing when we recollect what happened the other day in connection with the bakers' strike. When some members of the labour combine desired to sell their labour a little cheaper than the majority of their fellow trade unionists, what 'occurred ? bined to lock them out. fined. In other words, we have one form of government inside another form of government in this country. We have the municipal government, the State Government, the Federal Government, and the Trades Hall. ration. Federation is not permitted to fine anybody nowadays. It was able to do so ""at one time. It is singularly amusing to hear these violent onslaughts upon combines emanating from persons who are members of the biggest combine in the country. I admit that the formation of combines is typical of the spirit of modern trading. Of course, our object must be to so regulate the operations of such bodies as to preturns, and I cannot find any reliable invent them from robbing the retailer and the public. I had previously read all the statements which the honourable member for Grey has placed before the Committee this evening. I dare say that there may have been excessive combination on the part now that the matter has been ventilated, there is not much risk of any further injury being inflicted upon the retailers. The petition which I presented to this House, and which was signed by 744 confectionery retailers, constitutes a strong indictment of the methods which have hitherto been followed by 'the .manufacturers of confectionery. But now that they realize that the retailers are combining against them, it ' is very probable that if their methods are continued they will have the worse of the deal. tai lers do if we exclude imports ? and refuse to sell the goods of the manufacturers-. The confectionery industry is a very valuable one, and one which every civilized community desires to encourage. There is no doubt that the manufacturers of Australia are gradually getting this industry into their own hands. In 1905"". the number of people employed in the confectionery trade in Victoria was. 797, whereas in 1906 the number was 1,043, which shows a very satisfactory increase.

In 1906 the importations of ordinary confectionery into the Commonwealth amounted to only 3,000,184 lbs., representing a value of Â£116,000.

Crown Law Department can compare that sent to them with the agreement which the honourable member read this evening. If the Manufacturers Association have committed a breach of our Anti-Trust legislation, it will be open to the Crown Law Department to take action. They were not afraid to put their agreement before the Department. We all know that the importers are anxious not to lose any part of their trade, and they would naturally do their utmost to prevent the expansion of an Australian industry. It has been said that this industry is holding its own. I have taken from the Customs returns the imports for 1904-5-6, and find that, whereas the imports of confectionery in 1904 totalled 2,724,000 lbs., 2,729,000 lbs. were imported in 1905, and 3,237,000 lbs. in 1906. Milk chocolate is a line which has displaced, to a large extent, ordinary confectionery, and I find that the imports of cocoa and chocolate in 1904 were 2,449,000 l b s . ; in 1905, 2,821,000 l b s . ; and in 1906, no less than 3,355,000 lbs.

As a matter of fact, the immediate introduction of the new protection proposals would be the best way of securing a speedy dealing with the Tariff. As an ardent free-trader, I can say that I should not occupy much time in dealing with the proposed duties if I were certain that the benefits would be equally distributed amongst the manufacturer, the wage earner, and the consumer fhe Labour Party voting duties pntil they have seen the new protection proposals. I be asked to vote for high duties before I know what the new proposals are?

Personally, I should help in such a movement; and I am astonisFed that the more ardent spirits of the Opposition have not endeavoured to force the Hand of the Government in this connection. raise the protest. am suggesting is resistance to the Tariff until the new protection pioposals have been introduced, because it would be most unfortunate if the high duties proposed were adopted, and the Government got into recess without their scheme of new protection having been dealt with. The honourable member for Fawkner frankly said that he was a Victorian, and that he desired the confectionery trade to be captured by the manufacturers of his own State. What a truly ""noble and Federal spirit! I do not ""desire to see any State obtain any special advantage from the Tariff; and in view of the attitude taken up by Mr Stedman, to which I have already referred, I am prepared to vote for a duty of 2d. per lb. all 'round, with, of course/a preference to Great Britain in whatever proportion honourable members may desire. Fawkner was most unfortunate in his reference to the importation of the bountyfed sugar of Germany into England. A few days ago the honourable member received .rather a severe castigation at the hands of the Melbourne Age, and I can only suppose that he is now endeavouring to put himself right, and desires to 'obtain a panegyric as a thorough Victorian protectionist. In Germany the people are taxed in order to produce bountyfed sugar for export to England, to be there converted into confectionery, which is sent to Germany to undersell the German manufacturers. worked in England. answer to those who say that the confectionery of Great Britain is made by means of cheap labour, which competes with the more highly paid labour of Australia. English labour in this connection competes not only with the highly paid labour of Australia, but with the low paid labour of Germany. I may say that I have refused, on this or any other item, to receive any technical information from manufacturers, the Tariff until the Govern.importers, or importers' agents, preferring to rely entirely on the results of the inquiries of the tariff Commission. On this item there is no difference of opinion between the two sections of that Commission, because both recommend a duty of 2d. per lb. all round. Personally, I am astonished that the Commission should have recommended a specific instead of an ad valorem duty I cannot understand why low priced confectionery should bear as heavy a duty as the higher priced articles. I intend to vote for the adoption of the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, with a reservation in regard to preference to Great Britain. The honourable member for Yarra has said that he is prepared to do certain things. I ask him to assist us to stick up this Government until they introduce a Bill embodying their new protection proposals.
