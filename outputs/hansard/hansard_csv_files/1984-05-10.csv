If the Government goes that is that the ordinary PA YE taxpayers of this forward with the conviction that this is a threat country are paying significantly higher levels of for a double dissolution it is sadly misguided. tax because of an involvement by many members This is an attack, through retrospectivity, on of the community, and many people associated tax avoidance. One has to repeat time and again with the Liberal Party of Australia, in the tax the comment of the Minister for Finance( Mr avoidance industry.

Tax avoidance is not a crime. Tax taxpayers will take note of a couple of points avoidance involves using the taxation legislation raised during the debate today. They will concede to do things with minimum impact on taxation, that the honourable member for Hume was corFederal or State. That is what tax avoidance is rect, that the argument is not about retrospecabout. When we are talking about avoidance, let tivity.

We have heard the same member for Hunter( Mr Robert Brown) when he rhetoric from Labor on all of these Bills and I besaid that the tax avoidance industry, the tax dodglieve it is time we had a look at its position. ing industry, blossomed in the Fraser years. I will As I mentioned, tax avoidance is a separate give some facts and figures in connection with issue altogether from tax evasion and I wonder where this started. It is up to people to decide whether the Government can quantify for me whether they want to blame a government for it. how much of that $7 billion lost every year, acA few things are relevant. In the early 1970s the cording to the honourable member for Hunter, Curran scheme was in fashion. I believe it was Mr applies to tax avoidance. I assume, from the Crean who, as the Federal Treasurer at that time, figures of the Commissioner of Taxation, that it indicated in his Budget Speech that he would would be less than $1 billion, compared with tax attack the Curran scheme. But absolutely nothing evasion which totals $6 billion. I then ask what was done from the time of that announcement to the Government is doing about the collection of when Labor lost office in 1975. the tax being evaded in this way. There is another relevant fact. Look at the People lodging their returns, who the Governoverall statistics through the 1970s, of people payment might claim are tax avoiders, might do so on ing personal income tax in the highest tax bracket. the clear understanding that their returns comply At the moment the highest figure is 61c in the dolwith the laws of the time and in every respect are lar. Go back to the early 1970s and compare the legally correct. I am not talking about morals; I figure with that of the late 1970s. If honorary am talking about legality. There are no morals in a members do so they will find that only half of the government that would change the rules, to make taxpayers who were paying tax in the highest illegal the situation where a person lodged a rebracket in the beginning of the 1970s were paying turn on that basis, by retrospecting those laws. in that same bracket at the end of the 1970s, or Retrospecting those laws the Government is, right even in the mid-1970s.
