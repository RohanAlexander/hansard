7,Mr Gregory Asked The Minister For,"0. If not brought under the operations of this Act, was an attempt made to impose duties on goods which the Parliament declared should be free of duty; if so, under what authority? answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. Yes. Owing to the fact that the invoice showed the export price to be substantially lower than the domestic price in the United Kingdom, tliere was a prima facie case for investigation under sections 4 and 5 of the In dustries Preservation Act, and the Collector of Customs, Western Australia, required security in a sum of £46 5s. Od., representing the difference between the export and domestic prices, pending inquiry and report by the Tariff Board. The Tariff Board recommended, and the Minister approved, that dumping duty should not be imposed. Refund of the amount required as security was made. 2. Yes. The facts are identical with those stated in regard to 1. 3. A local manufacturer lodged a complaint that wire netting and fencing wire were being dumped at prices detrimental to the Australian industry. The State Collectors were instructed by the Department, on 3rd April. 1023, to investigate importations and report f u l l particulars, and pending a definite decision, to require security in a sum equal to the difference between tlie export and domestic prices. In some instances this security was required. On 1st May, 1023. this matter came under the notice of the Tariff Board, when immediate report was made, and, acting on the report of the Tariff Board, the Minister directed State Collectors to be instructed to take no action to apply the provisions of the Industries Preservation Aet until otherwise advised. 4. The condition prescribed by the Act for the imposition of dumping duties is a notification by the Minister in the Commonwealth Government ^Gazette. Fencing wire and wire netting havo never been gazetted. The securities taken were in the nature of a precaution if the facts of the case eventually justified gazettal. on fencing wire and wire netting has not, atany time, been recommended by the Tariff Board or approved by the Minister. 5. The provisions of the Industries Preservation Act impose the responsibility of levying dumping duty in those cases where the prescribed conditions exist. Unless the question is raised, and the matter investigated at the time of actual importation, goods on which dumping duty is rightly payable would evade thc duty. It is necessary, therefore, either to detain the goods until the question has been decided or tn give delivery subject to security pending decision -The latter course has been adopted as causing less inconvenience to importers. Although fencing wire and wire netting are admitted free of duty under the British Preferential Tariff, there is a local industry, protected by bounty, which may suffer detriment by dumping from overseas, and if proof of such dumping is established, the fact of f r e j admission under the Tariff does not debar the industry from the protection of the Industries Preservation Act. The Industries Preservation Act is the authority for the imposition of dumping duty, and the authority action necessary to enforce the provisions of the Act. Trade and Customs, -upon noticeI n view of the extended powers granted to the Minister under the Tariff schedule to remit duties, aud, subject to the recommendation of the Tariff Board, to bring imports under the provisions of the Australian Industries Preservation Act, and, if approved, to considerably increase duties-Will he favourably consider an early amendment of the above-mentioned Act making it compulsory to hear in public all applications for remission or increase of duties, take evidence on oath, and make all recommendations public? m a t t e r has already received very f u l l cons i d e r a t i o n by the T a r if f B o a r d and the Minister.

If I may, I also desire-althoug h this may, perhaps, seem something new as coming fro m the Opposition-to congratulate the Government record-the record of having two sessions of Parliament opened with all the item We may search the annals of responsible government in vain for a similar set of circumstances. A t the end of the last session my honourable friend, the Assistant Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey), in a very able speech, criticised the Government for having failed to submit their policy to honourable members. On that occasion the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) excused himself on the ground that he was new to office, and had not had sufficient time to formulate a programme. adjourned to enable the Government to prepare their measures. In such circumstances one would naturally expect the Government to set about the business of formulating a policy; but instead of doing that, members of the. Ministry, and the Prime Ministeri n particular, visited the several States, not for information to guide them in the preparation of their legislative programme, but actually for the purpose cf killing time, and performing certain administrative acts behind the back of this Parliament. During the past few months many things have happened. Though honourable members on this side take strong exception to certain administrative acts of the Government, their mouths have been closed. The Prime Minister has mentioned the Premiers' Conference as one of his reasons for delaying the opening of this session. He said he wanted to consult with the Premiers. 1 should like to know what they have to do with the legislative measures mentioned in the Governor General's Speech. Many of them, certainly, did not emanate from the Premiers in Conference. Why did not the Prime Minister convene Parliament earlier 1 Tbere was nothing to prevent him meeting Parliament, and at the same time consulting the Premiers. We have had numberless conferences of State PreI miers, and, so far as I have been able to learn, nothing has emanated from those gatherings. Had Parliament been sumhave had time to deal with the proposals mentioned in the Governor General's Speech. But now we are told that the session is to be limite'd to a certain time. It is of the utmost importance, declares on having established a the Prime Minister, that he should attend the Imperial Conference. Apparently' it is more important that he attendant pomp, without one should go to London than that Parliaof legislation being passed. ment should continue in session doing the business of this country. In order to create the right atmosphere in the public mind he has, as I have said, been travelling from State to State addressing select audiences such as the Chambers of Commerce and the Millions Club, and impressing upou them how essential it is that he should attend the Imperial Conference in order to deal with the problems that confront Australia.

It was charged against the ex-Prime Minister (the Right Hon. W. M . Hughes) that he was a dictator, but I will-say this for him, that when He appears to think that, although we on be went abroad to represent Australia at Imperial Conferences he at least allowed Parliament to sit during his absence. He was not afraid to trust his colleagues. The Prime Minister is in exactly the same position as his predecessor in office, fie knows that if he desires to go abroad on public business there will always be a pair for him in our division lists. The Ministry would suffer nothing in this respect. But perhaps he believes that unless he is at the wheel himself the Goverument ship will go on the rocks of disaster, that divergent views are held by certain members of the Ministerial following. They do not all speak with one voice. They cannot see eye to eye on all matters, and there is no common agreement in regard to their political ideals But there is one thing upon which they are agreed, and that is that if the present Government fail to retain place and power the consequences, from their point of view, may be disastrous, because the Labour party will then gain office. This statement, has been made by the late Prime Minister and also by the present Leader of the Government, as well as other Ministers on the Treasury bench. But they know quite well that we will never seek office unless we have the voice of the people behind us, and are returned in sufficient numbers to insure stable government. This cannot be said for our honourable friends opposite. The Prime Minister and his Lieutenant represent minority parties in this House. they were before the people the Leader of the Government declared that he wanted to remain loyal to. his late chief, who, he said, was the only man capable of controlling the destinies of this country. It must be noted, however, that the Treasurer on that occasion, as the Leader of the Country party, held quite the opposite view. He maintained that the late Prime Minister was the worse man possible to hold office. But after the Can the Prime Minister re-election, and when it was found that the Is the Nationalist party could no longer continue in power, the Prime Minister deserted his old chief, and in order to retain office he came to the conclusion that he himself was destined to rule Australia, l i e has set a very bad example. this side represent the majorit y party in this House, our mouths are to be closed; that we have no right to deal with the problems confronting this country except in the time which he has allotted to us;. and that during his absence from Australia we are to be denied the privilege of meeting for the purpose of dealing with affairs affecting the Commonwealth. By the grace of the Prime Minister this House will last for only twelve weeks in the year. 'We did nothing for two weeks, and during the next ten weeks we shall be expected to get through the business which he places before us. It matters not to him how important some of it may be. It must, he says, be disposed of within the time limit , failing which, like a sulky school boy, he will not go to London. The Prime Minister has said that he will not represent Australia at the Imperial Conference unless Parliament goes into recess. dreadful threat? cally means that if the Estimates are passed Parliament will adjourn and may not be summoned until this time next year. If honourable members supporting the Government 'consent to such a procedure,, they will be digging their political graves. honourable member and his supporters. from a political point of view; but we have a duty to perform to our constituents. The Prime Minister informs us When that it is necessary for him to attend the Imperial Conference, where important problems confronting the Empire are to be considered.' One of the .chief topics to be discussed will be that of Empire defence. The members of this party believe that the time has arrived when the energy of such men as the Prime Minister and other leading Ministers of the British Empire should be devoted to securing",20,Governor General S Speech Address In Repl Y Motion Ox No Confidence

When the last great international conflict was in progress, we were told by those who are now supporting the Government that it was to be a war to end war, and afterwards that the League of Nations had been brought into existence for devising means of preventing further conflicts between nations. the leading men in the Empire, with the exception perhaps of one or two, are refraining from galvanizing the League into activity. Many of them are more concerned in framing defence proposals with a view to preparing for future wars. We 7 are told that Australia will be full y represented at the next gathering of the League of Nations, but it is more thanprobable that the delegates sent from Australia will be men who are hardly known to the publio of the Commonwealth. If the meeting of the League is not considered to be of sufficient importance to justify the attendance of the PrimeM in ister or some other Minister, the Government will send a representative from Australia who is probably unknown in his own land. If a woman delegate also attends, probably one associated with some women's organization in the city of Melbourne will be sent. If the League of Nations is to be a success, we must popularize it ; but no attempt is being made in that direction by the Government. I have seen the danger confronting us for a considerable time. Prior to the last general elections, a cablegram was despatched by the then British Prime Minister( Mr Lloyd George) to the ex-Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) asking if Australia would be prepared to send troops overseas to assist, if the Greeks and the Turks became further engaged in war. Before the message was submitted to Parliament, the ex-Prime Minister and those supporting him agreed to' render what assistance was necessary without ascertaining any reason for the impending war. A t that particular time, the members of the Opposition were strongly opposed to Australia being pledged in any way before the people were consulted. The present Prime Minister, as reported in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, said in effect that Australia should have a greater voice in Empire affairs, and that a Government had, without knowing anything of the circumstances, been asked to participate in what might have been a disastrous European conflict. -The Prime Minister, when in Queensland a week or two ago, said that it was necessary that he should attend the Imperial Conference in order that the voice of Australia should be heard in connection with international problems, and that we should not be embroiled in a war Notwithstanding this promise, without knowing the reasons which caused it . When we put a similar position before this House those who are now supporting the Government opposed us. The members of the Labour party are opposed fo war; we believe in peace. way to insure peace is for the representatives of the different nations to endeavour to secure it , instead of discussing problems of defence. There are means of settling international disputes without recourse to war, but action is not being taken in that direction. I am sure that every honourable member is pleased to learn that the Government intend to increase the old-age pensions, and my only regret is that the matter has been so long delayed. Had this party been in power the rate would have been increased long ago. During the war, and since, the cost of livin g has been so high that the old people find it impossible to manage on the small pensions they receive. 10s. to 15s. per week. quite insufficient. Does the honourable member for Bass think that 15s. a week is adequate? vernment, when dealing with this question, w ill be as generous as they can, and thus assist the aged and infir m in our midst, to live in a reasonable degree »f comfort. It is also hoped that many of the existing anomalies will be removed, especially in regard to the small incomes from property. I know of an instance where two old people who were unable to work were receiving 20s. per week in rent from two small cottages, and who were later compelled to reside in one. Their pension has now been stopped. If they had not been receiving 20s. in rent they would bave been entitled to 30s. per week",21,Governor General S Speech Address In Repl Y Motion Ox No Confidence

76,Mr Charlton,"Yes. It was a good the amount lost through relieving the rich man of taxation. In that way, the poorer people would indirectly help to pay for the war. No doubt it seems to the Government to be a very convenient way to take the burden off the shoulders of the wealthy and place it on the backs of the great body of the people. Under the Government's proposal, the per capita grant would disappear. The States have now no legal claim to that grant. Recognising the nnancial needs of the Oommonwealth, the States are ready to give up the 25s. per head of the population which emanated from the expiry of the Braddon blot. I admit that the grant has been paid out of the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth, but immediately incom"" taxation is handed over to the States there will still be the National debt to be met, and what channels of taxation are left to the Commonwealth with which to discharge that obligation? Taking the year 1921-22 as a guide, we find that the total revenue of the Commonwealth was £64,897,046, including the following amounts : Customs ancl Excise Post Office Land Tax Income Tax Succession Duties War-time Profits Tax Entertainments Tax The expenditure of was £31,337^164, amount from the total of we have a balance of £33,559,882. the income tax amounting to £16,790,682 were handed over to the States with the exception of the companies tax, amounts to about £5,000,000, mean that the Commonwealth would be further depleted to the extent of £11,790,682. the balance to £21,769,200. from the Post Office in 1921-22 was £9,320,654, but I take it from sions of opinion in this Chamber time to time-especially the Country party-that must be treated as a business standing and that the revenue derived from it should be utilized for the purpose of extending telegraphic and telephonic vices throughout the country districts. is therefore revenue ilr.

Leaving the Post Office out of the calculation, there will be £12,448,000 left with which to carry on the affairs of the Commonwealth. How can the Government proposals do it without removing taxation from the wealthy people and loading it on to the masses? It cannot be done. Everybody knows that the Government to-day is astonished at the -amount of revenue which is being received from Customs duties.

My object is to show the effect upon the Commonwealth of the ridiculous proposals emanating from the Government-proposal s which the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) will support. Members of the Opposition will fight those proposals to the death. It will be impossible, when we next appeal to the electors, after the Government has got into a financial muddle, to allege that Labour members acquiesced in the proposals. of the Government may think that the proposals are sound, but they w ill find if they sift them that there is nothing in them. Certain reasons have been adduced to camouflage what is in the minds of some people. Their object is to avoid their share'of the taxation which has to be paid as the result of the war. What right has any Government, by entering into an agreement with the States, to give away the powers contained in the Constitution ? There has been a struggle in this country for the past few years to get enlarged powers under the the Commonwealth of Australia the status of a nation. We are crippled because of the State jealousy that existed when the Constitution was framed. Now we have in power a Government which proposes to whittle away the rights of the Commonwealth Government under the Constitution. I wonder what men like Mr Alfred Deakin,. Mr Kingston, [3] Sir Edmund Barton, and other stalwarts, who took part in building up Australia, and making her Constitution what it should be, would say if they heard of these proposals. They would t u r n in their graves if they knew that, after all their efforts, after all they had done to make Australia a nation, this Government, without any mandate from the people, without even a majority of the House, in either of the parties composing it, was proposing to give away deliberately the powers that we enjoy under the Constitution.

They do that on the grounds that there are overlapping awards and competition between State and Commonwealth tribunals. There is only one v/ay to remedy the overlapping of awards, an'd that is by allowing the Commonwealth to make awards which will have currency throughout Australia. There would then be no overlapping; every industry would be placed on the same footing, and each would have a fair opportunity td compete with others.

Since tbe Commonwealth and State Governments are so very anxious to deprive the Commonwealth of its power, I ask them to accept the decision of the people, if it is against their proposal, as a vote of want of confidence. I venture to say that they will not do this, but will stick to the Treasury benches as long as they possibly can. The unions have advocated Federal control in regard to arbiti'.ation, and this Parliament has, at different times, appealed to the people for an amendment of the Constitution in the direction of giving the Commonwealth greater industrial power. Those appeals have been unsuccessful: but that is no justification for the Government now agreeing to reduce the power which the Commonwealth already has.

Whilst the Government contend that they have a proper system of dealing w it h immigration, there is evidence that men are paid a commission in order to obtain people to be sent to Australia. In Syd-. ney last week I ascertained that quite a number of recent arrivals from overseas, under the immigration scheme, were in mates of a mental institution in New South Wales. add that Mr Garden's statement was denied by the Eev. T. Menzies Miller, who said, "" It is unfair to say that the majority of the boys are unfit, as only a few of them are not of the right type."" He, no doubt, is personally favorable to immigration, and yet he admits that some of the boys were unfit. That is evidence that the immigration system is not operated on satisfactory lines, and that Australia is being loaded w i th "" derelicts, ' 1 men who cannot hope to make good in this country. Here is the newspaper report of a Hobart ca.seA pathetic ease was before the Police Court when an assisted immigrant, Frederick Porter, was charged with vagrancy. Porter said he had been induced to come to Australia by advertisements he saw in London, saying"" there were ""bags of work ' in Australia. 1 He had a wife and six children, and they were living on charity because he could not get a job of any kind. The case against him was dropped wheu the Bench was told that the Charitable Grants Department was taking steps to send Porter and his family back to England. Whilst talking about the necessity for exercising economy, we are spending the money of the taxpayer in bringing famiT h e PrimeM in lies out to Australia when there is no employment available for 'the -breadwinner, with the result that the wives and little ones have to depend on public charity.

We are constantly telling the people of England, through the press and tlirough the Government agencies, that openings exist in Australia for thousands of men. We forget to tel l them that thousands of our own people are unemployed, and the result is that we get a stream of immigrants. If the Government desire to deal with this question in a proper manner, let them realize that the starting point is to make the land available for those people who want to settle on it . Land is now being held in very large areas, and is not 'being put to its f u l l productive use. The land is the when some men will be unemployed; but heritage of the people, and in the interests of this country it should be producing up to its f u l l value."" If people insist on using for grazing purposes land which is in close proximity to cities, and which has easy access to market, the Government should' take steps to see that those people use that land to its fullest productivity, thus absorbing the labour of this country: or the Government should take the land from them and see that it is used in the development of this country. This Government, and the Governments of the States with the exception of Queensland, are not prepared to adopt a policy of that nature. They talk about the land they are going to settle! Much of that land is away back in the Never-Never, and our own peo]jle will not select it . It is proposed to dump immigrants on to such land, which requires at least a year's work even to put into proper order. It will cost this country £1,000 to bring each of those men out. A t the expiration of one or two years they will find that they cannot make a success of land settlement, and they will come on the labour market to compete for work with the other men who are unemployed. The Labour party believes that employment should be found first for our own people. should be introduced to make land availahle for those who desire to settle on it . We believe that, if you make the conditions in Australia such that there will be plenty of work for everybody, with provision against unemployment, so that a man, his wife, and little ones, w ill not be brought to starvation at any time by reason of unemployment, you will secure the best class of immigrant without spending any public money in bringing them out. very much better here than they are anywhere else. would be justified in adopting such a policy. We are not, by any word or deed, going to support a policy of immigration whilst so many of our own people are unemployed. lieve there ever will come a time when there will be no unemployment? provision should be made insuring such unfortunate men at least sufficient to keep their wives and children in decent comfort. Do we ever look at that side of the question? I venture to say that we do not. We are constantly harping on some the necessity for populating the country, yet every day we are doing our best to prevent the best immigrant coming along -becaus e working men cannot maintain big families. If we held out encouragement to them we would he in a very much better position in regard to population . I have referred to what I consider to be the three most important matters that appear in this speech. I shall not take up the time of the House by discussing to-day many other proposals that are set out. We shall have other opportunities to deal with them during the session, unless the Prime Minister, in order that he may attend the Imperial Conference, resorts to measures to stifle debate. The responsibility for any such action will be upon him and those who support him. They may not appreciate that fact now, but they will do so when they come once more face to face with the electors. It was the resort to similar tactics in the We believe that legislation last Parliament that led to a great deal of muddling.

119,Mr Charlton,"Exactly so. Thethan those chosen by their predecessors. The proposal to close down the Parliament at the end of a ten weeks' session is an illustration, and yet another example is to be found in the action taken with regard to Major Oakley, the Chairman of the Tariff Board. Never before in the history of this Parliament, so far as I am aware, has the chairman of an important Board been summoned before a political party to be castigated or, at all events, criticised. Tbe Prime Minister, in reply to a question put to him by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), said that the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) asked that Major Oakley should be sent to Sydney to have a chat with him in regard to certain matters. May I ask the Treasurer how many members of his party were present when he interrogated Major Oakley? Was he alone, or was Major Oakley interrogated at a meeting of the Country party, over which the Treasurer presided? gentleman will not reply to my inquiry; but it is well known that Major Oakley was called on to appear before a meeting of the Country party. Had the Labour party, when in office, required heads of Departments to attend their meetings from time to time because they did not approve of action taken by them in their administrative or judicial capacity, we should have been condemned, and rightly so, throughout the length and breadth of the country. The action of which I complain was most pernicious. ing the Judiciary before them later on., Tariff Board has judicial powers. It was appointed to carry out certain important functions; but we find that in the discharge of its duties it is to be interfered grace of the honourable gentleman we are with because the party led by the Prime Minister and that led by the Treasurer cannot see eye to eye with it. What happens? The two parties from which the Government is drawn have a difference of opinion. Cabinet having formulated a certain policy, we have the spectacle of the Prime 'Minister explaining to a meeting of the Nationalist party what the Government have decided to do, and inquiring whether any exception is taken to it, while the Treasurer, his right-hand man, makes a similar explanation to a meeting of the Country party. The Country party thereupon proceeds to find fault with the Government, and, in order to reconcile the two factions, the Country party-the smallest in this House-is allowed to arrogate to itself the right to call before it the Chairman of the Tariff Board and to question him as to his official acts. The Country party, although, it comprises only some fifteen members of the Parliament, has been allowed to "" r u n the show."" The Prime Minister fears, apparently, that it would do so completely if Parliament remained in session during his absence in Great Britain. He proposes, therefore, that we shall close down after a ten weeks' session. He is afraid of what might otherwise happen. member blame him? what happened to Major Oakley, there would appear to he some reason for the honourable gentleman's fears. The CounThe honourable try party may believe that it can unite' with the Nationalist party and yet preserve its separate entity, but it is quite impossible for it to do so. The people of Australia will judge it by its actions. Members of the party may claim that this is a composite Government; but, whether they like it or not, it is known throughout the country as a Nationalist Administration. There is no escape from that position. The two parties represented in the Government cannot remain separate entities, and in the effort to do so they will probably bring upon themselves serious trouble. I can well appreciate the reluctance of the Prime Minister to go abroadwhile this state of affairs exists; but it is a bad thing-for the country that because of it Parliament should close down for months. By the to be allowed ten weeks within which to deal with the many proposals set out in the Governor General's Speech. What have we to do? We have first of all to deal with the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, which in ordinary circumstances would occupy our attention for at least three weeks. We have then to pass a Supply Bill. Having regard to the time that we have been in recess, the grant of Supply should take a week. That having heen disposed of, we shall have to deal with the Budget and the Estimates.

Are we doing aivything? members on this side of the House are putting before the country the actual position. When the honourable member has been a member of this Parliament for a. little while longer he will appreciate the importance of such a step as we are now taking. The business which I have just detailed-the ordinary business of the Parliament-canno t reasonably be dealt with in less than ten weeks, to say nothing of the consideration of the agenda for the Imperial Conference, and the numerous Bills foreshadowed in the Governor General's Speech which we are to be asked to pass this session. The Prime Minister tells us that the Government will meet the Parliament as soon as possible after his return from England. He expects to be back about February next, but he may not return unti l A p r i l or May cf next year. No one can foresee what may hapjJeni n connection with the Conference. No one can say that the Prime Minister may not be compelled to remain in England for a very considerable jDeriod The Parliament may remain in recess u n t i l this time next year. I would particularly impress upon new members the fact that once the Appropriation B ill is passed the Ministry will be free to govern this country by administrative acts-the y will be able to do as they please, behind the back of ' Parliament, just as they have been doing during the last three months. We have imposed ujson us a great responsibility, and I appeal to honourable members opposite not to permit the Government to close the session, as proposed, in August next. If that is done we' may not meet again unti l May or June of next year. It is our duty to see that the business of the Commonwealth is properly carried out. The well-being of the community is in our hands. It is expected of us that we shall, amongst other things, carefully look into the national finances and the general administration of the Commonwealth. Why should we, merely for the sake of getting into recess, give the Government freedom to act as they please for seven or eight months? But for the fact that the Supply already granted will run out by the middle of next month, I do not believe that the Government would have met the Parliament as soon as they did. It was a matter of compulsion. are we now This is proved by a statement made by the Prime Minister. He has said on many occasions outside this Chamber that. Australia requires a complete rest fromlegislation. He would prefer apparently that there should be no Parliament sitting. my honourable friend come here for? Isi t to do nothing ? Judging by the honourable member's interjection he comes here to do nothing, and he is doing it well. I have shown what the position is. The Government intend to shut up this Parliament. They intend to obtain Supply which will enable them to carry on u n t i l July of next year. The Parliament may or may not meet before then, but in the meantime the business of the country is to be carried on by administrative acts such as we have had during the last few months. The Government have been giving away the assets of this country at less than their value, and giving away the powers conferred upon this Parliament under the Constitution, which they have no right to do. May I assert again that the time is not far distant when the people of this country will put an end to this sort of thing. They-desire larger not smaller powers for the Commonwealth Parliament. They realize the necessity for true economy, and believe that . the existing State Parliaments should be practically wiped out. There should he a Commonwealth Parliament, and, in addition, provincial councils or bodies, to be called by what name honourable members please, endowed w it h power to deal only with matters referred to them. In this way only shall we secure true economy in this country. In stead of following the trend of public opinion, the present Federal Government are endeavouring to set the clock back. Though the powers which we now enjoy are insufficient aiid inadequate, the Government are prepared to surrender them in order to appease the different State Governments.

So far as honourable members opposite are concerned, there is no necessity for legislation by this Parliament.

The Government is composed chiefly of men of very little parliamentary experience. honesty. about their honesty. We are all honest, I hope. I do say, however, that a few months ago the Prime Minister himself never expected to be in the position which he now occupies. much tojustify his appointment to such a position. honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton). as I find them. In my opinion the Prime Minister acted wisely in giving up the position of Treasurer. This is supposed to he a business Government, and the Prime Minister is assumed to be a business man. If we are to be guided by the statements put before the House before we went to the country at the last elections, they show how many errors business men can make in connection with the administration of public affairs. I repeat that the present Government is composed chiefly of inexperienced men. quite understand that they have not had sufficient experience to enable them to take more than a parochial view of great 'national affairs. As a consequence, they are prepared to whittle away the powers of the Commonwealth as they are tryin g to do. 'Sof a r as honourable members ou this side are concerned, when we are called upon to face the country, we w ill fight the Government on their proposals for the amendment of the Constitution if the agreements at the Conference with the State Premiers are taken so far. Hitherto, I have known nothing to come out of a Premiers' Conference, and I have yet to learn that anything w ill come out of the Conference that has just heen held. If any action is taken on the proceedings of that Conference to secure the consent of the people to the proposals which have been made, we shall see whether they are prepared to permit a Government like the. present to whittle away the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament without a mandate from them. I move That the following words be added to the proposed Address :"" but we consider that your Advisers no longer retain the confidence of this House owing to their attempt, to limit the rights of But a great deal of the Commonwealth with regard to constitutional powers, with special reference to financial and industrial matters, also for the I say nothing unsatisfactory arrangements made in connection with immigration."" ter) [4.25] The present Commonwealth Government have been in office and have been carrying on for some f o ur He has never done months.

I am very sorry for him. He had to r is e a nd attack the Government, and we have listened to his attempt. I do not think that any impartial person could come to any other conclusion than that he had a very poor case, and that there was very little that he could say. I believe that honourable members on his own side are f u l l y aware that that is the position. Apparently We can most of them were a little reluctant to hear the honourable gentleman's very poor case put forward, and they consequently stayed away. I think that, on the whole, it was wise that they did so. Another thing which I think was demonstrated by the honourable gentleman's remarks is the fact that the first part of his speech must have been prepared some considerable time ago, and would have been delivered on a previous occasion but for the unfortunate circumstance that the honourable gentleman was unable to be present in this Chamber.

The first part of the I think they should do so-bu t in your speech he has made to-day is, as I have said, obviously a speech which he should have made on a previous occasion. Tbere was nothing in it but an attempt to criticise tbe coining together of two parties on this side that had taken place. ,The honourable gentleman must be regretting now that he did not have an opportunity to deal with that matter very much earlier, when he might have had some chance of making a little headway. Eour months have gone by since the members of those parties came together, and they are now working harmoniously and in the most admirable spirit, and are doing very useful work for Australia. Tho Leader of the Opposition is too late now in his attempt to interfere with what has been done. He might have had a chance before the parties had really got together and settled down to work, but I assure him that he is too late now. pathize with him upon having to return to that subject at a time when he cannot hope. to achieve' anything by his references. The next matter to which the honourable gentleman had to return was a criticism which I thought he would have the discretion not to make in view of the parliamentary experience he claimed for himself, when referring to our lack of it. He made this criticism some time ago when searching for something to say about the Government. ling spectacle of Ministers rushing from one State to another, visiting different parts of the Commonwealth when they ought to have been sitting down in the Capital formulating their policy. I imagined that he would have grasped by this time that that criticism of the Gosession. But he seems to completely oververnment is one with which 99 per cent, of the people of Australia totally disagree. Thc people of Australia entirely endorse what the Government have done, and appreciate our efforts to obtain, at first hand, a little knowledge of the problems which affect different parts of this great continent. This criticism by the Leader of the Opposition seemed to me amazingly stupid, even from his own point of view, when it was first used, and it is extraordinary that he should repeat it now. justice to admit that I raised no objection to public men going about the country-case, when you asked for an adjournment to formulate a policy, you should have formulated one. difficulty that confronts the Leader of the Opposition. I quite realize that he had to try to have something reported in Hansard at that stage; but, with the utmost respect, I must say that I do not think he helped his case in the very least, but rather made it a little worse. not go into. Hansard, because it was not said here. terjection went into Ilatisard as, I say again, it was designed to do, and I repeat that the honourable gentleman only makes his case considerably worse when he now states that Ministers should ordinarily I symtravel about, but that this being a new Government, we should have framed our policy first. That is only to say that he has no desire that members of a new Government, -with' all the responsibility on their shoulders, shali know the Commonwealth as a whole. I welcome this criticism, though I do not agree with the honourable gentleman; and I .may say that the members of the Government are entirely unrepentant, and in the future propose to do exactly as in the past, and see' Australia for themHe has referred to the appalselves. Another point raised by the honorablo gentleman was that the Premiers' Conference need not have delayed the meeting of Parliament-that the Conference could have been held while we were in look the importance of the questions that had to be dealt with; he does not appear to see that those questions had to be considered before the Government could pur, its policy before the countryThe first problem that Australia is concerned with, and one in which the people are more interested in than, I think, any other, is how to get rid of the present overlapping and duplication that exists between the Commonwealth and the States.

141,Mr Brtjce,"I suggest that the inresult, and substantial advance Avas made witb regard to a great number of questions. I shall have to deal with the Premiers' Conference at some little length, but as the points that were raised by the honourable gentleman in his direct motion of no confidence cover questions handled at that Conference, I shall turn to them when I -am replying to what he has actually said. There are, however, a few other matters which I should like to bring before honourable members before coming to those three specific points. The honourable gentleman referred to the statement made that this is to be a session of ten weeks, and he drew'pictures of legislation being rushed through without proper consideration, suggesting that f h a t would have to be done, or no business would he effected. I wish at once to clear the honourable gentleman's mind by pointing out that there is a programme laid down which we are going to carry out, and that we propose to give ample time for proper consideration and discussion of every measure. per time! member that the Government have no intention to prevent discussion, or to rush measures through without opportunities for thorough consideration, but, at the same time, we refuse to have the whole programme held up by opposition and obstruction to every proposal made. The honourable gentleman also said that there is much business to justify this Housei n continuing to sit on beyond the time proposed. outlined Speech what it thinks should be done, and what this country desires shall be done at this moment. the Government will carry out, and when that had heen done, there would be no advantage in the House sitting and trying to find something further to do. I have on occasion said, and it has been quoted by the honourable gentleman, that what this country desires now is not a mass of new measures placed on the statute-book. That statement. I repeat how, for I believe that it represents the opinion of the people of this country. They desire that certain measures shall be passed, and we have indicated what measures, in the opinion of the Government, should be passed and put into operation. All this the Government propose to do; but we are not going to t r y to gain a reputation for ourselves as a Government which has passed innumerable measures. That has too often been the basis on which Governments have claimed credit for themselves-Government s which have passed many measures, and have not paid quite sufficient attention to the quality and merit of the work done. Our desire is to concentrate on what is important to Australia in her development and progress, and we desire only to pass those measures, and no more, which will truly advantage the country to-day. I can assure honourable members that in thisten-weeks' session we shall put our programme through, and that we shall afford' reasonable time for the discussion of all measures. We shall introduce our financial proposals at the earliest possible date in the new financial year, and time for the f u l l consideration of those proposals and the Estimates w i ll be given. The Government are determined to put this programme through, and in coming to that decision, we are certain that we are carrying out the wishes of the people of Australia to-day. I have now to refer to the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition on the question of defence. He said, as he has said so often, that the object of his party is peace-peace , apparently, at any price. That seems to be what is at the back of the honourable gentleman's m in d ; he gives no consideration to facts as they are, but utters platitudes about the League of Nations, and the attitude of men throughout the Empire.

That, I think, is an extraordinarily unworthy attitude for the Leader of a great party in Australia to take up at the present time. yelling for war? The party of war!. War mongers ! that the party on this side is a war party; and that cry is designed to deceive the people. Not the slightest interest is taken by the party opposite in Australia's safety, and, in their attitude, they are only misleading the people.

144,Mr Mahony,Why are you always,35,Honourable Members Hear Hear I
145,Mr Bruce,"There is ever this cryare safe, and they are ever trying to make political capital in this way. I say, without hesitation, that this is a most unworthy attitude for honourable members opposite to assume. It is a matter for which the people would never forgive them if , unhappily, this .country should be plunged into some great crisis such as occurred in 1914. Opposition, in an attempt to make it appear that he had given some thought to this subject, talked about the League of Nations. I know just as much about the League of Nations as does the honourable gentleman. Possibly, I know more; hecause I attended one of its sessions, and I have seen it at work. No one in Australia has a greater belief in the League than I have, and no one is more certain than I .that, some day, it will function as it was intended to. I wouldlike to remind the honourable gentleman that upon my return to Australia, after attending an assembly of the League, I told the House what I thought on the subject. Since then I have travelled up and down Australia giving the people my views of the League and stating my belief in its future greatness and possibilities. But while I believe all that I have said about the League, I would be recreant to my duty to Australia if I expressed the opinion that at the present time the League of Nations can insure the safety"" of Australia and the peace of the world. It cannot do anything of the sort. With three great nations like the United States of America, Germany, and Russia outside, the power of the League must inevitably be somewhat limited. that, in the not distant future, these three nations will be members of the League, which will then become the power for peace it was expected to be. It is regrettable that responsible men should endeavour to bring the whole question of Australia's defence into the realm of party politics. The people of Australia must clearly understand the position, and know where they stand. I do not propose at this stage to deal with the Imperial Conference, as it is linked up with the question of Australiau defence and the naval defence of the Empire. given to debate this subject when the agenda of the Imperial Conference is before the House. I have given honorablo members opposite an assurance that the agenda will be submitted in time to permit of adequate discussion. I repeat that promise now. The agenda of the Economic Conference will also be placed before honourable-members at the proper time, and, therefore, there is no necessity to discuss it now. But I do want to imThe Leader of the press upon the people the paramount importance of these Conferences to Australia. I also;want to stress the fact that the Government believe it is imperative that Australia should be represented at those gatherings: The Leader of the Opposition is entirely wrong when he suggests that Parliament must go into recess at the end of ten weeks merely because I am going to attend the Imperial Conference. Parliament is going to close at the time-fixed because we believe the legislative work outlined can be done in the time allotted, and there is no reason why we should sit longer. Obviously, it is very undesirable that Parliament should be in session when the head of the Government is away. My honourable friend pointed out that Parliament had remained in session on other occasions when the Prime Minister had been absent from Australia. That was perfectly true during the war period. It was necessary then. To-day it is not. It is the custom in all the States, when Premiers are absent, for Parliament to remain in recess. Two of our State Premiers have been visiting Great Britain on important public business, and are still absent. Naturally, they left when their Parliaments were not in session. If ithad -been possible to hold the ImperialI hope Conference later I would have been only too glad. I did my very best to have the opening date fixed for 1st November. South Africa desired the Conference sittings to commence on the 1st September, and eventually, after considerable discussion by cable, the 1st October was fixed as a compromise between the two dates. That is the position. The Conference must open on that date, and members of the Ministry are quite definite that it is desirable that Parliament shall rise prior to the departure of those who are going to represent Australia at that gathering. We have submitted our programme, which embraces those measures Another opportunity will be which we believe ought to be passed. It is intended to translate them into legislation within the limits of the session, as I have suggested. We also propose to give ample opportunity for reasonable discussion of all measures to be introduced. My honourable friend touched on the question iof old-age pensions, but naturally had very little to say on that matter, ficulty could be overcome would be for as the Government have made certain provision in iihat direction. He touched also on 'the Oommonwealth Bank, and again had little to say, so there is no necessity for me to follow him in a discussion on that subject. But when he came to the particular matters on which he based his motion of censure he had a good deal to say. On the question of double taxation, for instance, he told the House that the Government had no right to whittle away the powers of the Commonwealth. In reply, I would point out that we have whittled nothing away. We are retaining for the Commonwealth every power that we ever possessed; but for a period of five years, in order to obto that proposal is that we cannot do it viate duplication, we undertake not to collect taxation in a certain field. We are not giving up any rights at all. That is the first point which I want to get cleai'ly into the minds of honourable members and the people. But knowing that the people want to get rid of this duplication, the honourable gentleman felt that he would be in a somewhat embarrassing position if he advocated any course of action that would perpetuate it, so he suggested that the ohject sought for could he attained in some other way. He proceeded to show that it was quite a simple matter, and Ifhat there need he no difficulty at all. He 'brought into the argument the suggestion made hy the Royal Commission that if the Commonwealth and the States would pass uniform income tax assessment laws the whole difficulty would be solved. of course, is most desirable. cordd have such . a uniform law all duplication would be done away with; but, apparently, the honourable gentleman forgot .to tell the House that we have been trying, steadily and consistently since 1916, to do this. We have had conference after conference of Premiers and income-tax officials, but up to the present not the slightest headway has been made. The real fact is that it is an absolute impossibility to get a uniform taxation law with the States 'and the Mr Bruce. Commonwealth both functioning in ihe field. Even if the Commonwealth gave up this field of taxation, the States themselves would never be able to agree,to a uniform taxation covering the Commonwealth. The only way in which the difthe whole of the income taxation to be taken over iby the Commonwealth, and levied by the Commonwealth. Royal Commission recommended. taken over. The position in regard to this matter has to be considered very closely. There are a number of ways in which we could achieve what we are attempting, and the simplest is that the Commonwealth should take over the whole work of collecting income taxation, and that the Commonwealth Act should be the only Taxation Act. The objection under the Constitution, and the States would never agree to it in any circumstances. Another proposal is that the Commonwealth should completely discontinue collecting income taxation and hand over the 'responsibility to the States. We are not going to do that, and we could not consider it for a moment from a .financial point of . view. Another is that both the Commonwealth and States should continue, to function in the field in which we are operating to-day, but 'that the Commonwealth should 'be the only collecting authority. That would mean a certain advance; but .we have to rememher that if we had only one collecting authority the problem would not be solved unless we had uniform taxation laws for the Commonwealth and the States. Mr Speaker, That, when acting Prime Minister and TreaIf we surer, made an offer to collect taxation for the States at one-third of the cost then incurred, but the States would not agree. A. similar offer has been repeated at other Conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers, .but the States' representatives have been opposed to the scheme. When Treasurer, I went into the matter full of confidence, and said that, although others had tried and failed, I was sureit could be done. ' I ' conferred with State Treasurers, to whom I made proposals, and met every objection they brought forward. I said an agreement",35,Honourable Members Hear Hear I

That seemed to present the possibility of a solution. We, therefore, submitted certain proposals to the Conference, which I will briefly indicate, but which need not be stressed. We suggested that the Commonwealth should discontinue taxing incomes under £2,000, and, having allowed the States a larger arena in which to collect taxation, should discontinue the per That proposal the States would not entertain.

According to .the best statistics we can get for the present year, the probable assessments amount to £13,100,000. The honourable member also forgot that he was dealing with the collections for the year before the Commonwealth had reduced its income tax by 10 per cent., increased the exemption to £200, and increased the deduction for children from £26 to £ 4 0 . Comparing the field we are vacating with the payments to the States, of v/hich we shall be relieved, fche approximate loss to the Commonwealth will be £1,500,000, against which a saving of £400,000 in administrative costs must be set off. figures will be given to the Housei n greater detail at a later stage, when the financial effect of the agreement will have, to be reviewed by honourable members. For the moment, I am merely giving a broad outline of what is likely to happen. There is no need for the Leader of the Opposition to fear (bhat the. Commonwealth's finances will be hopelessly embarrassed. sidered very carefully, and the Commonwealth's requirements for the next five years have also been f u l l y weighed. The proposals are for five years only, and one can easily see how the Commonwealth's financial requirements may be met over thafc j^eriod. The honourable member also appeared to be very anxious as to whether the jiroposals had been acceptable to the people. found acceptable. The only persons who have shown any grave distaste for them are those whom the honourable member suggests are delighted with them, the people who have very large incomes. From this source there have been strong representations that they do not like the arrangement, and would prefer not to have ifc put into force. . The honourable member suggests the effect of the agreement States would he to take the burden of Mr Bruce. income taxation off the big man and place it on the small man. He has produced no evidence to show that this is likely to happen. As . a matter of fact, there is no possibility of such a position arising unless a State Treasurer of .his own He has volition deliberately brings it about. There is no intention, at this moment, of altering the revenue from taxation. It is no.t intended to raise more or less people of Australia. The present position will remain except that duplication will be avoided and administration costs will be considerably reduced. It rests with the Treasurers of the States to levy their taxation in a manner which is just to all the people. There is nothing in the proposals that w ill shift the burden fro m the big man and place ifc on the small man, or will place any taxpayer in a different position from that which he has occupied in the past. Federal Ministers, who. already have a great number of responsibilities, cannot be held accountable for what may be done But all these by State Treasurers. The Leader of the Opposition talked about this question as if he knew all about it . He said, "" Look at New South Wales with its flat rate of Is. 3d. in the £ 1 on the big man and on the small man. What will happen there?"" New South Wales has a graduated scale of tax which runs from Is. 3d. to 2s. 6d. in the £ 1 , and there is no reason why the State The figures have been conTreasurer should not alter his graduations by increasing them. fche exemption. ' In fact, he says he must do so. aspect a little later. The State Treasurer can alter his graduations and deal with the position in any way he likes in order to bring about the same measure of justice that has been achieved while the I think they have been Commonwealth has been imposing this form of taxation. Indeed, if he is a v/ise and able Treasurer, it is quite possible he may bring about an even greater measure of justice than the Commonwealth has afforded. The honourable member says that SirA r t h u r Cocks, the Treasurer of New South Wales, declares that the income tax exemption will need to be lowered to £ 1 5 0 ; but SirA r t h u r Cocks that has made quite a number of other statewith the ments. He declared at the Premiers' Conference that the Commonwealth's",38,Honourable Members Hear Hear I
152,Mr Chablton,He could also lower,39,Honourable Members Hear Hear I
153,Mr Bruce,"I w ill deal with thatproposal would throw on the States a burden which they could not bear, because in the area which the Commonwealth was vacating the States could not collect the amount which the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation was able to collect. For instance, he pointed out that the Commonwealth aggregated the incomes of individuals earned in several States; and as the State Governments would not be able to do this, he said it would mean that the difference between what could be gathered by the State, collecting only from the individuals on their earnings in that State, and what the Commonwealth could collect, when those individuals' incomes earned in several States were aggregated, would amount to £2,000,000. In the peak year mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, the total amount collected by the Commonwealth from aggregated incomes of individuals and partnerships, was £2,176,000. Cocks, declares that £2,000,000 of that amount will disappear, the States w ill, apparently, only be able to collect £176,000 from the individuals contributing this £2,176,000. Treasurer of New South Wales went f u r ther, and said that this loss which he spoke of would occur in New South Wales only. If we take the figures for the whole of the States, the difference, at a very outside estimate, should not exceed £300,000, and if it amounted to £400,000 it would be perfectly amazing. In face of these facts, I do not think we can attach much credence to the assertion that the income tax exemption will have to be reduced in New South Wales to £ 1 5 0 . man. escape under a lower rate? can alter the incidence of its taxation in order to bring its revenue into line. There is not the slightest need to throw an extra burden on the people With lower incomes. It is only a matter of altering the incidence of taxation, and the necessary adjustment can be made. The Commonwealth has taken this fact into account in determining the field thafc ifc is prepared to evacuate. In the calculations at the Central Office we have gone on the basis that the States cannot collect as much tax as the Commonwealth has done, because the States cannot aggregate incomes, and we are, therefore, prepared to make a payment to bring into line any States that may be at a disadvantage on that account. The whole idea that there is any intention to remove the burden of taxation from the rich classes, and place it upon the poor, is perfectly ludicrous. It is not proposed to raise more taxation, and ifc is merely for the State Treasurers to adjust the incidence of their taxation so that it will f a l l fairly and equitably on individual citizens. come tax not imposed for war purposes ? me to deal with another phase of the question in order to answer the honourable member. Prior to Federation, the States were collecting their own Tariff revenue, but when the Commonwealth was established we gathered in the whole of the Customs revenue. A t that time the Commonwealth did not require for As SirA r t h u r its own purposes the whole of the money collected. Its own expenditure was then very small, and an arrangement waa arrived at by which three-fourths of the Customs revenue was handed back to the Incidentally the States. That arrangement was observed for ten years. In 1910 the position was reviewed, and the payment to the States of three-fourths of the Customs revenue terminated. The States were given 25s. per capita in substitution for the old arrangement. The States wished that thc paiyment of the 25s. should be maintained, not merely for a period of ten years, but for all time; and the question was submitted to the people of Australia afc a referendum. The people refused to endorse the arrangement desired by the States, and declared that the payment should be for ten years, or u n t i l the Commonwealth Parliament otherwise determined. Prom 1910 to 1920 the payment of 25s. was made to the States, but three years ago the arrangement expired, and the Commonwealth is now no longer under a legal obligation to pay the per capita grant. Another aspect of the question is the moral one, and we have to consider whether the Commonwealth is under any moral obligation to continue the grant. The basis of the payment in the first place was the fact that the Commonwealth had no obligations of a national character to meet, but since then the war has been fought, and the Commonwealth has borne the whole of the war expenditure. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton)",39,Honourable Members Hear Hear I

157,Mr Bruce,"It will be necessary forpointed out, the Commonwealth expenditure last year to meet direct war obligations was £31,000,000. That figure will be reduced in future, but it will not be curtailed as much as most people seem to think. Por many years it cannot be lessened to any substantial extent. There is a sum of £20,000,000 required annually to meet interest and sinking fund upon our war indebtedness. Loans have been incurred for no other purpose than Australia's direct war efforts, and this expenditure must go on for many years. We also have a payment of £7,000,000 for soldiers' pensions. This liability will continue for a long time, and cannot be materially reduced. At present it is actually increasing, because Australia has the most generous system of soldiers' pensions of any country that was engaged in the late war. Even the children of disabled soldiers are' entitled to pensions when they come into the world. for soldiers and their dependants involves an expenditure of something like £27,500,000. It has also to be remembered that there was an expenditure last year of some £2,000,000 for repatriation. This amount will obviously be reduced as the soldiers are re-established in civil life, but there are certain payments-of a diminishing character, certainly-whic h will continue for some time under the obligations we have shouldered. The amount under the heading "" Other war expenditure "" will eventually disappear, but for many years the Commonwealth's liability in respect of direct war obligations cannot be less than £27,500,000, and it will probably' be between £28,000,000 and £29,000,000. Our war obligations have come upon us since the days when the Customs duties not required by the Commonwealth were paid to the States, and the Customs revenue for the last five years has not been sufficient to balance our direct war obligations. For the next five years our war obligations will be as great as, if not greater than, at present, and therefore we are under neither a legal nor a moral obligation to pay the per capita grant to the States out of the Customs revenue. Such payments have been made out of the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth. money was not paid from the Customs, marks with regard to State instrumentalibut, from, the Consolidated Revenue? Mr Bruoe. and undoubtedly the Commonwealth is entitled to cut ofi the per capita payments. It cannot be claimed that these payments have been made from Customs revenue. The fact is that the Customs revenue is needed to meet our war obligations, that being our primary source of revenue under the Constitution, and that the Commonwealth is making the per capita payments to the States from income taxation raised from the same taxpayers as those upon whom the States are levying income tax. It seems that the Commonwealth is raising money and handing it over to the States, thereby creating a duplication by occupying the same field and taxing the same taxpayers. The scheme under discussion will get rid of that. We are not giving away more than we can afford, or any money that the The provision for pensions Commonwealth needs for its own requirements. We are not relinquishing the right of the Commonwealth, under the Constitution, to levy direct taxation in the form of income tax. We are adopting merely a temporary arrangement, for a period of five years, in order to evolve something which the people of Australia greatly desire. It is certainly the first time that there has heen any prospect of abolishing the duplication, or that a practical plan to that end has been before us. The proposal has not the characteristic, which the Leader of the Opposition tried to allege, of shifting the burden from the rich to the poor man. That statement was made purely and simply for political purposes. There is no truth in it, and if such a result came about, it ""could only be hy the deliberate act of the State Treasurers in not properly apportioning the incidence and burden of taxation. The next question with which my honourable friend dealt was the efforts that were made at the recent Conference to bring about an improvement in the industrial position. The honourable gentleman did not devote himself in the least to the industrial question itself, or to the troubles from which Australia is suffering owing to the duplication and overlapping of authority in the industrial ties, and contended that the trouble could",40,Honourable Members Hear Hear I

If it became the predominant factor in the world, the first thing for which the League of Nations would ask us would be an account of what we were doing to develop this country.

Nations would tell us that we must throw our doors open to the members of every race and every nationality, and there would be no possibility of our resisting such a decree. If the League of Nations came to us and said that we could not keep this wonderful undeveloped country for the exclusive enjoyment of a few people, that it had to be used for the benefit of the whole of civilization, and we^protested against such a decision, we could be silenced by the question, "" How did you get this country in the beginning?""

Very great efforts are being made things and that the Leader of the Oppoby all the States to-day to do that which sition, on the other hand, knew little or the honourable gentleman suggests should nothing. At the outset, he declared that be done. It is doubtful whether some of the States are not proceeding so vapidly as to endanger their chances of achieving that which they desire. Quite apart from those lands which, we are told, should be split up and converted into smaller holdings, a .policy with which I am undeveloped area in Australia. I think that we would be well advised to concentrate on that side of the question, with the object of seeing whether we cannot open up those areas and give the opportunity to settlers to go there. I remind the honourable gentleman that, notwithstanding the fact that a Labour GovernThe League of ment was in power in New South Wales for a considerable time, and that in Queensland there has been a Labour Government in power for ;a considerably longer period, the millennium has not been brought about in those States. The sovereign, simple remedy which the honourable gentleman suggests does not really exist; it is a difficult question, and it is one that requires the greatest amount of careful thought. Save for a few general observations, those three were the only points on which the honourable gentleman touched in his attempt to find something with which he could attack the Government. I venture to suggest that he did not make out a did not bring forward anything to support the contention he put forward.

193,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [5.50],"the Leader of the Opposition had had nothing to say, bnt later on he admitted that the honourable member had had a good deal to put before the House. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister occupied more time in replying to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition than was taken up in giving utterance to them. this session we are going to . f i g ht w it h bare knuckles. The gloves are off. The Prime Minister has thrown down the gauntlet iand has to-day taken up a stand that is calculated to give rise to the very keenest opposition. for him tolay the flattering unction to his soul that the time has passed for the Leader of the Opposition to stress the point that two differing sections of the House have fallen into line behind the Government, but I am convinced that before he boards the steamer that is to take h i m to England he w ill have had from some of his professed followers exceptionally rude reminders of the t r u th of my Leader's contention. no complaint of the fact that the two their performances so far have been in actual keeping w i th our predictions. and others of the Opposition have spoken of the Country party as an unimportant joint in the tail of the Nationalist party. They may think that they are preserving their separate entity, but if they do they never made a greater mistake. As Comrade Dunstan said at the recent Farmers' Conference, they will be laughed at if , when they again face the electors, they declare t h a t notwithstanding that they have joined with another party to carry on the government of the country, they are still a separate entity. Some of the very members of the Country party who denounced the Nationalist Government because of the support it received from Flinders-lane and various fiduciary institutions, jumped at the first opportunity offered them to join with the Nationalists in the formation of a composite Government. I imderstand that the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen), drew himself up to his f u l l height of almost 7 feet and used exceptionally vigorous language in his opposition to the proposal that they should join with the Nationalists in forming a new Administration, yet we see him to-day eating like a lamb out of the hands of the Prime Minister. The lions of the Country party have now become as little lambs in the Nationalist fold. I am glad that this is so, and I compliment the managers of the Nationalist party on the result of their conference with the representatives of the Country party in regard to the formation of the present Government. One of them, It is obvious that during who is present this afternoon, emerged from the conference with a smile on his face more expansive than that of the tiger in the well-known linesThere was a young lady of Eigi, Who went for a ride on a tiger; It is all very well They returned from the ride with the lady inside, And a smile on the face of the tiger. The Nationalist party may well smile, as they do to-day, knowing that they have politically swallowed what was known as the Country party. The people have reason to be alarmed at the existence of an Administration which is so inept as to play into the hands of the big financiers of this counI make try by placing on the market a conversion loan of £38,000,000 with a currency parties have come together; of twenty-five years. This, in itself, apart from anything else that the GoI vernment have done during the recess, should be sufficient to arouse the suspicions of all sections of the community. There has been no public condemnation of its action in this regard, but there is much yet to be said, and the PrimeM in ister w ill come out of some of the political conflicts in this Housei n a f a r more bedraggled state than that in which he is likely to emerge from this debate. The loan closes to-day, I understand, so that I shall iiot prejudice its chances of success by any statement. I may make. I do not hesitate to say that it is one of the worse financial proposals ever submitted by a Government claiming to be out to secure economy. It hands over to our large nnancial . institutions for twenty-five years a big interest proposition. The Treasurer-par t of the t a i l of the Nationalist party-ha s expressed pleasure at the interest displayed in the loan by the stock exchanges and the banking and insurance companies of Australia. It is only natural that they should be keenly interested. Complaint is made that the smaller investors are not coming forward, but the fact is that, whereas they cannot afford to do so, the big financiers can. The small farmers, the workers, and the middle-class people of Australia fear that the Government are jeopardizing their rights and privileges. Undoubtedly with such an Administration in power their liberties are in danger. Isi t reasonable to expect from such a Government either a progressive policy or sound administration? out of season we have advocated the amendment of the Constitution, and it is somewhat amusing to hear the Prime Minister inquiring, in reply to our demands, "" What am I to do in the face of the opposition of the State Premiers?"" What have other Prime Ministers done when confronted w i th like opposition? F r o m the very inception of Federation, fighting, more or les3, has been going on -between the Commonwealth and States' Governments, but hitherto every Prime Minister has been able to resist the attempts of the State Premiers to encroach upon the powers of the Commonwealth. ister alone has failed to do so. present Government have bowed down before the image of State rights. Honourable members will remember that the State Premiers met before the Conference with Federal Ministers took place. I can. quite some of whom have held office for a number of years, saying, "" There are a number of ' greenhorns' in office in the Federal Government now. This is the chance for which we have waited for twenty-three years. We must stick out now u n t i l we get what we want."" The State Ministers fought other Commonwealth Governments and PrimeM in isters for twenty-two years in vain, but the present weak-kneed Pederal Government at once gave way and bowed to the image of State rights. They have given way to the State Governments not only in connection with taxation and high finance, but are prepared to hand over to them the very limited industrial powers we have at the present.time, and to do so if they can by secret negotiation's. We can never look for true economy in Australia u n t i l the Federal Parliament occupies the supreme position, and delegates powers to State provincial councils taking the place of the existing State Parliaments. Unification, and the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford) must know that it is not. I suggest what the honourable member has himself advocated when on this side of the House. I have heard the honourable member advocate the same thing from public platforms. That is the only method by which we can secure f u l l financial and industrial control. TheI n season and Prime Minister made a great deal out of the' fact that State Ministers were prepared to allow the Commonwealth a free course in regard to industrial arbitration, but I will remind the honourable gentleman of what was said. by one of the keenest men who has occupied a position in State politics in recent years. I refer to Mr Holman. Whilst he was Premier of New South Wales he showed a jealous regard for State rights, although he was a Labour man part of the time and part of it a sort of composite individual. He was prepared to fight for State rights in many cases, but in connection with industrial matters he said that to bring about The present Prime Minthe peace that is essential for industrial The concerns in Australia, the Federal Parliament should have complete industrial power. That was the utterance of a statesman. Mr Justice Higgins has expressed the same view. Sir William Irvine, the present Chief Justice of Vicimagine those knowing men, toria, whilst occupying a position in this Housei n opposition to the Fisher Government, agreed that if there was to be industrial peace throughout Australia"", it was essential that there should be one power controlling industrial affairs. The Prime Minister has come into Federal politics only recently. I am not going to say that he will not achieve distinction. It is not my business to hand out bouquets to the honourable gentleman this afternoon, or, indeed, at any time in the future, in view of the speech he has made. It seems to me that he would do well to learn something of the history of the struggles that have taken place between the States and the Commonwealth in the past. He is the head of the first Government of the . Commonwealth that has bowed to the claims made by the State Governments. Just as the honourable gentleman and his fellow Nationalists must have smiled when they swallowed the Country party, so the State Ministers, with the exception, perhaps, of SirA r t h ur Cocks, of New South Wales, must have smiled at what they got from the W h a t I suggest is not Commonwealth Government at the recentConference. It was a splendid State",45,Honourable Members Hear Hear I

195,Mr Fenton,"Rights Conference. What right had a Premiers' Conference to assemble in Melbourne or any other city in Australia to confer with the Prime Minister of Australia in any but the ordinary business way? What right had they to create a super-Parliament, at which they were able to say to the Prime Minister, ' ' Here is your programme, bring it before your Parliament, ancl as you have a majoritycarry it into effect."" of the Conference was an acknowledgment that the Prime Minister and his Government could not meet this Par-' liament until they, heard what the State Premiers had to say in regard to certain matters. It was one of the weakest positions ever assumed by any Prime Minister of Australia. I have stated MrH o l fflau's opinion in regard to the control of industrial matters, and that SirW ill i a m on this side are against any limitation of Irvine agreed w it h that opinion. They had both appeared in the Courtsi n connection with industrial legislation, and they knew what they were talking about. They contend that the Pederal Parliament should be supreme in industrial legislation. I can quote from memory, though perhaps not the exact words, what Mr Justice Higgins said on the subject When I mention the name of Mr Justice Higginsi t will be admitted that, whether in the industrial or other Courts, he has always held the balance as fairly as it was possible to hold it , and has shown himself to be one of the most just Judges who has ever occupied a seat on the judicial Bench. He expressed the opinion that there is nothing that creates so much dislocation, or gives rise to so much dissatisfaction, as that men performing exactly the same work in different States should receive different rates of wages. The conflicting decisions given by State and Federal. Courts have been the cause of much industrial irritation. The Prime Minister's proposal has not solved this question. I do not know whether the honourable gentleman has read the criticism of his proposal by the Victorian Attorney General. One of the most severe criticisms of any proposal put forward by a Government was that made by SirA r t h u r Robinsoni n referring to the industrial proposals of the Commonwealth Government... No one will say that Sir Arthu r Robinson does not understand the subject, and yet he actually ridiculed the Commonwealth proposals. In a few words his verdict was that they were absolutely umvorkable._ Yet the Prime Minister would have us believe that the proposals in connection with industrial matters which he laid before the Premiers' Gonference w ill solve all the difficulties that have confronted us in the past. Instead of that being so, one of the gentlemen who conferred with him , and one amongst those most ready to grasp additional power for the States, The holding ridicules those proposals. I put the opinions I have quoted before the Prime Minister. He claims to know everything in regard to arbitration, as well as other matters with which the Commonwealth is concerned; but, as one comparatively new to politics in Australia, he might defer to the opinions of men who, in my judgment, know a great deal more of this subject than he does. Honourable members the powers of the Federation. I have said here before, as well as on the platforms of the country, and I w ill say again, that the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament must continually increase, while the powers of the State Parliaments must continue to decrease. Otherwise, how is the government of Australia to be carried on? What did General Smuts say in regard to the South African Constitution ? In an interview with a newspaper representative as long ago as 1910, he said, "" We have avoided the mistakes of the Australian Constitution : Ave have assumed powers which make the National Parliament supreme, whilst Ave have delegated: certain powers to provincial councils."" It is true that he Avas dealing Avith a comparatively small population, but with a countiy comprising a very large area. The Union, of course, covers an immense territory, and, Avhile Ave need not copy the Soutb. African Constitution in every detail, no doubt something like it is needed in Australia if Ave are to have a true National Parliament, Avith true local government in the States. That end is to be attained by a vote of the people, but the Prime Minister woiild have us believe that Ave have reached our limits in this direction, and should make no further effort to amend the Constitution. Four or five years ago Sir William Irvine, in this House, said that the Constitution fitted Australia as a coat clothed a man for whom it had been made years beforefchat ifc fitted so tightly as to split at every seam. ter say that the Constitution is good enough as it is? said that he had exhausted every possible method of securing other means than those now proposed of dealing w it h industrial matters. that the honourable gentleman has the ability but not the courage to do .what is required, b.ut I may put it in another, and, perhaps, a ruder way, though still within the Standing Orders, by suggesting that he knows what ought to be done, whereas his masters outside order h i m not to do it . Looking at tbe long li3t of their administrative acts, the one prominent feature is the fact that this Government are the absolute tools of the moneyed classes of the country. being my conviction, and the conviction of my party, how can we accept from the. Government a statement such as that made this afternoon? However, we do not intend to accept the statement. As to the overlapping and duplication as between the Commonwealth and the States, I do not say that the best possible arrangement has been made in Western Australia, where there has been an attempt to simplify taxation and other returns; but if one step can be taken towards simplification in a State with a certain measure of success, why should not the Commonwealth t r y it on a more extended scale? I am sure that no one on this side of the House is in favour of the multiplication of returns, or the duplication of electoral rolls, and so for t h ; but it seems to me that it would be an easy matter for an arrangement in this regard to be made. The PrimeM in ister has recently vacated the position of Treasurer, and, notwithstanding the rosy picture he painted to-day, I ask him and his supporters how they propose to "" pay the piper "" in ' the coming years if , by diminishing our means of taxation, we have diminished opportunities to raise revenue. able member means the stoppage of public of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has works and the throwing of people out 'of pointed out-and this is the kernel of the employment ? that was the kind of economy suggested ; to this Parliament, would be prepared to at any rate, if public works are stopped, and unemployment is caused, honourable members opposite will have achieved what their masters told them to achieve. The Commonwealth has spent £400,000,000 or over; and on what ? Wasi t used to build railways, construct water conservation works, or lent to the States to be used I shall not say in revenue-producing developments? No ; for the most part the money has been thrown away in powder. It was a large insurance for our safety, but the money is gone, and we have hardly an asset to show. The only asset we hold in respect of money advanced to the States is -the transferred properties, representing £9,000,000 or £10,000,000. How different is the position of the States. I do not say that all the money borrowed by the States has been spent upon, reThat productive works. There are some people who would have us believe that our education systems are not reproductive; but really they represent tl.e finest and most reproductive expenditure we can undertake. Beyond that, however, the States have their railways,, water conservation schemes, and quite a number of other State instrumentalities that yield constant revenue. There are men of the same political opinions as mine who sit in -the State Parliaments, but, unfortunately, they have been attacked by the microbe of State rights, and it is those men we have to convert to our view. No man or woman, having regard to the present position, can view with equanimity the proposition laid down by the PrimeM in ister at the Conference with State Premiers. The Commonwealth needs all the revenue that it can raise, because it has now a great deal more to do than in the past. The Commonwealth, for example, must carry out certain public works, and help to develop the country. We have lent the States £500,000 for road construction,, and there are great schemes for which it is essential that the Commonwealth should find, the funds, since they w ill never be carried out by the States, notwithstanding that the people are clamouring for them.

201,Mr Fenton,"endorse the proposition laid down hy the Prime Minister at the Conference, ^ and again this afternoon. Such a proposition is against the very Constitution that we are sent here by the people to administer to the best of our ability; to act as the Prime Minister suggests would be to practically tear leaves out of our charter. If the people thought there was a danger of a majority in this Parliament limiting in any way its powers, or interfering with our constitutional rights-, candidates who supported such limitation or interference would have very little chance of success. Such Pederal candidates would be told that if they were prepared to hand over further powers to the States, and thus belittle the National Parliament, they had no right to seek seats in the latter; they would be told that they must rid themselves of local jealousies, and enter the Federal sphere in a true Federal spirit, and do their f u l l Federal duty. States have been successful in this regard, simply because there is a weak Government in. power. tion became a fact there have been these attempts to aggrandize the States at the expense of the Commonwealth. For over twenty-two years successive Governments have withstood the pressure of State requests, and it has remained for the present Government, in 1923, to accede to them, and to hand over to the States -privileges which up to the present have been enjoyed by the Federal Parliament under the Constitution. The Government, of course, have their majority, and they say that what is proposed is all right. But I remind them of what happened as a result of legislation passed in 1909. In that year, notwithstanding a choriis of protest from this side of the House, £he Government of the day put certain measures on the statute-book. Parliament went to the country in the following year. During that election campaign members of the Labour party explained to the people what had been done, and declared that, if returned to power, they would immediately take steps to repeal certain of the measures that had been passed. The people responded. They gave Labour a majority in both Houses, and, as a result, the legislation passed in 1909 was repealed. Let me quote for the information of honourable members what the Leader of our party ( Mr Charlton) had to say in respect of the industrial situation during the election campaign last yearVested interests believe that, aided by unemployment, and by the Governments, they can break the working-class organizations and reduce wages below the standard. They desire the abolition of the -Court, and their Governments move to the desired end. Federal servants have been removed from the general Court to a special Court, and from this special Court more and more are being eliminated. The effort to remove State employees from the shelter of the Arbitration Court has been defeated by the High Court. The Victorian State Government, on behalf of itself and other National and State Governments, is sending Mr Owen Dixon to the Privy Council. If he loses, the Commonwealth National Government will come into the open -with an amending B ill to exclude a l l State employees from the Arbitration Court. TheB ill is already drafted. lost his case. The Oouncil practically told him that he had no standing. Ever since Federatralia was governed by its own Parliaments, notby the British Parliament. that. The Privy Council told Mr Dixon' that he had no standing, and, in effect, fchat he should mind his own business. It was upon the strength of the declaration made by our Leader that Labour candidates were returned in such strength at the last election. What followed in 1910 will happen again. Much of the legislation that will be placed upon the statute book this session and, perhaps, in succeeding sessions, if the Government live so long, will certainly be repealed when the Labour party return to power, because we shall then have a mandate from the people to repeal it. We shall not go behind the backs of the people, but, as in 1910, we shall restore constitutional government. On the occasion to which I refer, the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford) was most emphatic in his declaration that, as soon as the Labour party were returned to power, they would take steps to repeal the legislation that had heen placed upon the statute-book in the preceding year by the Fusion Government. But we shall do nothing without the approval of the people.

Several of the members of that delegation have since been Cabinet Ministers in British Governments, and I can readily recall some of the speeches they delivered hv Australia, in which they indicated in unequivocal terms that when they returned to Great Britain they would do their utmost to advertise Australian goods, and see fchat Britishers, at any rate, made Minister this afternoon reciprocal arrangements in the matter of must be retrade.

The nation in the East which is so frequently referred to has also made reductions in armaments, and to a greater extent than some of those who wish to foster the war spirit are inclined to give her credit for. The Prime Minister has also complained because a protest has been uttered against Parliament going into recess within ten weeks, and, in justification of the intended action of the Government, he mentioned the fact that the Premier of New South Wales( Sir George Fuller) and the Premier of Victoria( Mr Lawson) are at present abroad because the Parliaments of their States are in recess. gentlemen selected a suitable occasion to go away, and expect to return to Australia and meet Parliament at the accustomed time. ing the of of Australia. Eveni n a session of six months, we would hardly have sufficient time to deal with the whole of the financial problems confronting us. We could not have that privilege during the war because important measures had to be rushed through. The war spirit prevailed, fabulous sums were spent, and we were prepared, in a sense, to allow important matters to pass w i th very little discussion. But now the Parliaments of all countries are looking closely into financial questions and studying keenly every item of expenditure. Surely the Commonwealth Parliament is not in Australia, and other exempt from this responsibility. It is, therefore, our duty to remain sitting sufficiently long to investigate thoroughly all financial proposals put forward for the benefit of Australia.

212,Mr Fenton,"What is said here willtold that our Tariff revenue is bounding. That simply means that the Tariff is no longer protective. The Treasurer would not be enjoying this huge revenue were it not for the fact that so many Australians prefer to buy foreign goods made most likely under miserable sweating conditions instead of providing employment for'Australian workmen under decent labour conditions. If we could only create an Australian sentiment in this respect, we need not care a snap of the fingers for our Tariff; even our farmers would be found purchasing goods made in Australia in preference to those made in other parts of the world. If I had the opportunity I would make our Tariff truly protective. I would prevent any goods from coming here. One is not more than twenty-four hours in the United States of America before he realizes that the people there are prepared to stick up for their own country and to purchase goods made by their own workmen to a far greater extent than we do in Australia. If we copied their example there would soon be more employment in Australia and more contentment in industrial circles than is evident to-day. Obeying the dictates of the State Premiers, the Government are seeking to paddock off at least 150,000 or possibly 170,000 persons employed in State instrumentalities by preventing them from approaching the Eederal Arbitration Court. Why should these men be shut out of the Federal Arbitration 'Court? great cry of those who fought for a universal franchise and democracy was "" greater privileges for the people."" Yet here, in this supposed enlightened country, we have a Government which is prepared to take a retrograde step, and say that tens of thousands of men and women have no right to approach the Federal Arbitration Court. The position is anomalous, to say the least of it. If action is tffken to deprive these employees of their rights, there will be great trouble. down. Were any honourable member opposite prevented from exercising his privilege of going into one of the Courts of justice in order to 'have a wrong redressed, he would be the first to protest against such ill-treatment; but the present Government are prepared to so tinker with the industrial situation as to play into the hands of private employers, and take away a right which the employees of Mr Fenton. State instrumentalities have been declared by the High Court to possess. Among these employees aTe the railway men, and no body of men is doing a finer work -than they in assisting to develop Australia. Their employment takes many of them far from the centres of population. They are required to live in isolated spots, where the facilities for the education of their children are of the most meagre character. Australia is developing on quite socialistic lines, and there is an increasing army of employees of State instrumentalities, such as railways and tramways, municipal councils, water and sewerage Boards, fire brigades, and harbour trusts. There will soon be quite an army of men employed in Victoria in connection with the Morwell electricity scheme, and this State, which has been described as a cabbage garden, will be the home of .one of the finest socialistic ventures yet undertaken in Australia. Day by day the employees in State instrumentalities are increasing in number, and the total is bound to grow. The demands of these men must increase, and any Government which tampers with their rights and privileges will suffer for it at the ballot box.

The State Governments, at the behest of employers, are obtaining immigrants, and as a result of the influx of the new arrivals they hope to see a reduction of He wages, a lowering of the standard of living, and the creation of chaos in the industrial world. Among the Britishers who arrived five or six years ago are many who are sadly disappointed. In some cases three families are living in one small house.

I was told that it was not usual for a Government to make public details regarding loan transactions. The action which I wanted the Government to take was uot unusual: similar action has beeu taken by statesmen in Great Britain, where the first successful loan conversion was made in 1749. I was not asking that anything should be done which would affect detrimentally our loan transactions. to make that request, because I had in my mind the associates of the present Ministry. We judge men by the company they keep, and I am justified in judging the Ministry by the company they keep in dealing with the financial interests of Australia. During the progress of the GreatW a r I again and again brought under the notice of the Government that whereas Great Britain was setting apart 33 per cent, of her actual income from all sources to defray the cost of carrying on the conflict, we in Australia were' doing nothing in that direction. I urged that the example of the Motherland should be followed. The Nationalist party was in power when the War-time Profits Assessment B ill was in per cent., and thereafter 3 per cent., troduced, and the Labour party endeavoured to induce the Government to take steps to compel those who, as the result of the war, were making huge profits, to contribute a proportion of these gains towards the cost of the war. It is useless to deny that great profits were made in Australia during the war period. In one year we raised over £80,000,000 over and above the ordinary revenue. That liuge sum of money was distributed amongst the community, and so out of the unfortunate circumstances of war, many became phenomenally rich. A new aristocracy was created in Australia, and honours were bestowed so freely that even a theatrical man was knighted for running a vaudeville show. A knighthood, indeed, became so cheap that the average citizen came to look upon a knight much as he would look upon a mongrel in the Street. There was a time when honours were conferred on men only for rendering great service to the community either in the political arena or in the field of science, art, or literature. In those days honours conferred upon a citizen by the K in g were regarded with the utmost respect; but, to-day, practically no respect attaches to them. Coming to the question of loan conversions I find that the first attempt to convert the national debt of Great Britain was made by Sir Bobert Walpolei n 1714. w Walpole was not very successful, but another conversion scheme carried out by Henry Pelham, in 1749, was very satisfactory. I suggested in the House that tbe Government should follow the example set by Pelham, who, as Chancellor I was prompted of the Exchequer, in 1749, was the first to secure the passing of legislation providing for loan conversion. I urged the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to take similar action with regard to our .war loans, but my suggestion was turned down, doubtless because I was a member of the Labour party, and was considered, therefore, not to be socially the equal of honourable members opposite. A British Parliament, composed largely of Tories, in 1749 passed a B ill introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer providing for the conversion of about £58,000,000 of 4 per cents. The terms were that for one year the rate of 4 per cent, should be continued; then for the next seven years the interest payable should be 3£ with a proviso that the Government should not be at liberty to pay off any part of the loan without giving one year's notice. That measure was agreed to by a British Parliament, amongst the members of which were many men connected with the banking and other financial institutions in Lombardstreet and Threadneedle-street. They were patriotic enough to realize that the working section of the community should not. be bled in order that the national war debt might be paid off. Gladstone in 1853 endeavoured to carry out a further conversion scheme, but was not very successful owing to the fact that at the time events were rapidly leading up to the Crimean War. In 18SS, Mr. Goschen carried out a large and successf u l loan conversion. He grouped the -whole of the 3 per cents., amounting to £558,000,000, and by Act of Parliament consolidated them into new stock to bear 2^ per cent, until 1923, and thereafter 1 \ per cent. The position in Australia is wholly different. Honourable members opposite are not prepared to allow this Parliament to deal with the national finances, which are the very groundwork of all our responsibilities. A failure of our finances throws thousands of people out of work; yet we are told that it is wrong that Parliament should deal with loan conversions. I have in mind tonight, not loans raised 'for carrying oub of repToductive works, but war loans-mone y poses, which vanished in the smoke of battles that depleted our manhood. Mr Goscheni n making his conversions received some assistance from the fact that he converted many of 'his loans into 2^ per cent, consols, ancl the Savings Bank took up a large number of these consolsand held them for some time. I repeat again that the whole of these operations were carried out with the sanction of the Parliament of the country. I have referred to these loan operations in Great. Britaini n order to put an object lesson before Che members of this Parliament. I desire that they should have more respect for the Parliament and the position they occupy, and should realize better than they appear to do what the people of Australia have sent them here for. T hold the opinion that present members of Parliament are notas big men as were some who have gone before them, and do not reach the standard of parliamentarians of some years ago. I have been troubled in mind for some time by the fact that, although loans are falling due, there is a total indifference displayed by the Government and their supporters as to what Amount of Loan Interest, Bonus and Cost.. £88,343,435 I think it is fair to ask the Governup by the big insurance companies. The ment why they have proposed to exsmaller people do not know why the loan tend this loan for twenty-five Such a course would not have been and I cannot understand it , unless it be followed in any other part of the habitthat the unfortunate Treasurer, being new able globe where parliamentary ment £38,723,590, five years £4 9,619,845, and when we have he has done. Every statement. I have paid that amount, we shall still have the made on this subject is based upon the £38.723,590 to pay. Why is this done? actual facts. The only conclusion to which I can come Treasurer should not be as well informed is tliat it is due to the influence by the insurance companies. I know that ordinary individual. I have not had the the Prime Minister is likely to have a same opportunities as the honourable social acquaintance with Mr Garvan, Mr gentleman. I have no clerks to obtain in Meeks, and gentlemen like them, and this formation for me, and I did not receive a loan of £38,000,000 is only being taken Mr West. the result may be, and what are their reraised for war pursponsibilities in this connection. I thought that honourable members would have awakened to the fact that the time has arrived when our financial position, so far as loans are concerned, is a matter worthy of their serious consideration. The loan that is at present uppermost in my mind is theconversion loan of £38,723,590, In connection with this loan, a bonus is being given by the Government. It is higher than that paid during the war period. I do not know why. Surely£ 5 Is. 5d. per cent. should satisfy the most greedy individual who has money to lend to the community in view of the fact that it represents a War Loan conversion, l t is not as though the money were being borrowed to be invested in some commercial enterprise which might be liable to go into liquidation. A gilt-edged security is offered, and yet interest and bonus during the twenty-five years, which is to be the duration of the loan, will amount to £49,619,845 or nearly £2,000,000 more than the actual amount of the loan itself. The operation is set out in form of a balance-sheet, as follows : £ 38,723,590 Interest 49,082,60 6 49,619,845 Bonus to Shareholders 387,239 Cost of Conversion and Expenses 150,00 0 49,619,845 Balance due 1948 3S,723,590 £88,343,435 years. should be for a term of twenty-five years, governto ofiice,. has been surrounded by these is in operation. Por this people and they have led him astray. we will pay in the twentyThere can be no other excuse for what I do not know why the exerted as I am on this subject. I am"" only an University education. When I went to school, schools were carried on by private enterprise. I nave to obtain my information from trade and nnancial journals, and this is what one of them saysThe average bank rate of interest in London during last year was £3 13s. per cent., as against £6 Is. 5d. per cent, in 1921 and £6 14s. 2d. per cent, in 1920. The average in the second half of the year, according to calculations made by the Statist, was substantially below that for the first half. Even the trade and financial journals supporting the views of honourable members opposite point out the fact that in two years the average rate of interest fell from 6 per cent, to 3 per cent., and yet the £ 5 Is. 5d. per cent, for twenty-five years to satisfy insurance companies and such institutions that have money to lend. I have obtained some further information which may be of value to the Treasurer from an Australian journal. It is not a Labour journal, but one which will probably be found on the tables of clubs in Melbourne. No doubt the Governor General receives it , and probably the Speaker glances at it occasionally, seeing that he takes an interest in public companies. This journal made the following statement in A p r i l , 1923: Mortgages are being quoted by some institutions, banking and others, at a rate that would not have been looked at some months ago, but there has not Ibeen any relaxation in the matter of rigid exaction with reference to the soundness of backing offered for that class of accommodation. It will be seen that there is direct evidence that the ^bank rate has gone down in such a way as to justify my strong opposition to the flotation of this loan for twenty-five years, to the benefit of persons who are interested in financial in stitutions. A t the present time there is what is known as a Finance Committee in connection with the Treasury, and all tlie three members of that Committee are connected with public companies, for their services to which they receive large emoluments. Doubtless those services are faith f u l l y rendered, and I ask, How can these men defend the interests of the Commonwealth when the interests of their own in stitutions are involved ? No doubt, those institutions benefit by the advice these gentlemen give the Treasurer, and I do not see how we can expect anything else. I know they are respectable men and good citizens, but, as apublic man, whatever may be my opinion of their social and other qualities, it is my duty to represent the people. The figures and quotations I have laid before honourable members are, I submit, sufficient in themselves to compel this Parliament to deal with the finances, and not allow secret diplomacy to have control over millions of money. We have such transactions as borrowing £38,000,000, paying £49,000,000 in in terest, and then still owing the original loan; and that is a condition of things that cannot be allowed to continue. In 1925 we shall have £49,000,000, and in 1927, £72,000,000, falling due, and I ask whether we shall then do the Commonwealth Treasurer offers same as in the past. We are not fit for our jobs as representative men in a legislative body, with the destinies of Australia in our hands, if we allow such financing to continue. In December, 1922, the population of Australia was financial 5,634,352, and our total debt was about £850,000,000. This Ministry is certainly going on very rapidly, and it is distinguished by two outstanding featuresexcess of borrowing, and the desire to destroy Commonwealth activities which have within them the possibility of combating the profiteers, as shown in their action in regard to the Geelong Woollen Mills and the Federal shipping. Mr. Lawson, the Premier of Victoria, and Sir George Fuller, Premier of New Soutn Wales, both went to Londoni n their official capacity, and I suppose our own Prime Minister is filled with t/he desire to do the same thing. No doubt, when the Prime Minister does arrive, he w ill be invited to the Carlton Club, the Reform Club, or the Athenaeum Club, and given a fine dinner amid magnificent surroundings. Under, suoh influences he -will be, as it were, hypnotized, and then the company will begin to talk about borrowing money. Under such conditions Australia must suffer. It is said that Sir George Fuller is anxious to be "" Baron Fuller, of Blow Hole,"" a noted place near Kiama. Lord Forrest, who was elevated to the peerage only a very short time before his death, was a nice old man whom I loved; but he was ambitious, and thought more of being a lord than of anything else on earth. Bruce? Mr. WEST -No, I think it will be another title for the Prime Minister; his name is Stanley Melbourne Bruce, and",56,Honourable Members Hear Hear I
227,Mr Mcgrath',"Will it be Lordprobably he would like to be the "" Duke of Melbourne.""These visiting Premiers are really canvassers; they have nothing to sell, but they, are seeking money, and in so doing are inflicting untold in ju ry on Australia. It is hard for us to realize what evil is done by these means. I knew London well in my youthful days, and 1 can appreciate what the effect of such visits must be on the interests of this country. Had we had in power a Prime Minister and a Treasurer who knew their business, they would have told the Premiers' Conference that this National Parliament will wake up to the responsibility the people placed in their hands when Pederation was established, ana that the Commonwealth Government and Parliament must be the only governing power in Australia. The Premier or South Australia, Sir Henry Barwell, was knighted for making the suggestion, when at-Homea suggestion with which I do not think many honourable members will agree-thaf c a' barbed wire fence should be placed across the northern portion of Australia, and any race, however objectionable, allowed to settle beyonci that fence. reason at all why that gentleman should have been knighted. with the Arbitration Courts. compared with the maintenance of our White Australia policy. I remember fchat when Sir Henry Parkes, as Premier of New South Wales, placed a poll tax of £100 on Chinese, .there was quite a turmoil on Circular Quay, numbers of men, each armed with a lump of wood, being prepared to meet the immigrants. The Chinese were on the ships in the harbors, and I asked Sir Henry whether he intended to prevent our stopping Asiatic races from entering this country of ours-whethe r he would like his daughter to bring home to tea on a Sunday one of the Chinese as her young man. "" W o u l d you like a Lascarf o r a son-inlaw?"" I asked. He replied, "" Jack, I certainly would not."" "" Then,"" said I , "" you should not do anything that would make it possible for any g i r l to put her father Postal Department. And as the result in that relation."" That would be the result of any departure from our White Australia policy. Either the white population would be driven out of our northern areas or they would be dragged down to the level of the coloured and Asiatic races. An y attempt in this direction must be sternly checked. The authority of State Governments must give way to the w ill of the National Parliament. The responsibility is on us to see that the already burdensome public debt of nearly £1,000,000,000 is not unduly enlarged. Are honourable members aware that the public debt of this country, State and Federal, represents a mortgage of about 10s. per acre of the whole continent, including swamp lands, lakes, rivers, mountains, and unproductive waste areas? The recent Conference of Ministers was a farce. It s decisions have been ridiculed on every hand because the representatives of the various States are what were known in the early days of Federation as "" L it t l e Australians,"" whose vision does nofc extend beyond the buttons of their waistcoats. Do they realize, I wonder, that in every ten years the Commonwealth has to provide £270,000,000 by way of interest on its public debt and still has the debt to pay? In view of our There seems to be no other financial position, it was extraordinary that the Prime Minister should surrender this right of direct taxation to the States. I can only come to the conclusion that he is prepared to allow the burden of Customs and Excise duties to fall upon the poorer sections of the community, whose contribution to the Consolidated Revenue in this way would equal that of a man with an income of from £7,000 to £10,000 a year. The attitude of the Government in regard to our finances is in marked contrast with the course adopted by Mr. Stanley Baldwin, Chancellor of the British Exchequer, who recently announced that owing to unexpected reductions in expenditure there would be a surplus of £101,000,000, which would be applied to the reduction of the National Debt, and that next year it would be possible to reduce the debt by another £50,000,000. The Commonwealth Ministry, it appears, are content to take 10 per cent, off the income tax, and to submit a proposal to borrow £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 to extend the facilities of the of secret negotiations in connection with the conversion of loans, substantial benefits are to be conferred upon a limited number of insurance companies and other financial institutions.",60,Conversion Op Loan 1923

229,Mr West,"That is a small matterI enter my strong . protest against the introduction of sectarianism during the last election campaign, and the suggestion that I and other members of my party were not f it to sit in this Parliament. No one is so vile as the man who would sell himself and his principles for position, place and power. In connection with a measure brought forward in the Parliament of Great Britain, a Mr Johnson drew attention to the Commonwealth Bank which until rece,ntly has been under the control of Sir Denison Miller. In the death of that gentleman, Australia has lost one of her most able men, and in writing to his widow I said that I found it difficult to express my sympathy with her in her bereavement, and in the loss which Australia had sustained in consequence of his death. A few months ago a gentleman named Mr Williams, connected with a British banking institution, wrote to the Associated Banks of Australia in an endeavour to get them to use their influence in getting the Australian note issue increased to overcome the difficulty in meeting payments for the excess of imports over exports. The communication was brought under my notice, and I was astounded to think that there was a possibility of the note issue being used for such a purpose. I mentioned the matter to the late Sir Denison Miller, who said, "" West, no such tricks will be played by those gentlemen."" The Government propose to appoint a Board to control the Commonwealth Bank, and I presume the members of that Board will consist of men who are occupying important positions in connection with existing financial institutions. Naturally they will consider the interests of the institutions with which they are directly concerned. is, of course, aware that the note issue surplus is obtained is employed in has been under the control of a Board for reducing the national debt.

The honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford), when a member of our party, and I conferred with Mr. Fisher in an endeavour to arrange that the whole of the States Savings Bank business should be absorbed by the Commonwealth. It was suggested that if that were done, the Commonwealth should not interfere with the State Savings Banks' existing mortgages, and that 70 per cent, of their income sbould not be touched by the Commonwealth If the State Governments transacted their business through the Commonwealth Bank there would be no occasion to issue bills until loans could be floated; yet notwithstanding the concessions that could be obtained by the States, there are unfortunately men who cannot realize the advantages that would be derived if such a course were adopted. I have already referred to the action taken by Walpole, Gladstone, and others, in connection with the conversion of loans. I have not referred to the liabilities of the States, because they have assets in the form of railways, water conservation works, and other schemes; but have confined my remarks more particularly to war expenditure, which is not reproductive. In order to meet the interest on loans amounting to £92,000,000 floated in England at 6 per cent., every man, woman, and child in Australia will have to contribute at least £ 1 per head for thirty-three years. In addition, we shall have to pay interest on the last loan conversion amounting to £49,000,000. During the war Australia depended on raising loans for the payment of its war expenditure instead of devoting Customs revenue to that purpose. Great Britain set us an example of how war expenditure could be met out of revenue, and even to-day, although that country is not that when the Prime Minister goes",61,Conversion Op Loan 1923

If these acted conjointly they could, with their control of the seas, aud their numerous outposts, reduce the chances uf war to a minimum. Such a combination appeals to me as more likely to benefit the world than any attempt to pacify races in southern Europe with widely divergent aspirations. These nations are'fighting with one another at present, and I see little hope of bringing about peace between them under any agreement in which their word would be of value. I am afraid the Prime Minister has left it open for people to suppose that he 'is eager to bring the present session of Parliament to a close because he is determined to do nothing, and does not wish Parliament to do anything in hit, absence.
