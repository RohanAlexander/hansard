I After writing that letter, I contacted the wrote to the minister to say that, if we were minister's assistant and I was told of the way to suspend the program, we should at least that the minister had decided to handle this put into place some kind of humanitarian issue. Firstly, Minister, for those within the program for those who had relatives here. 4,000 Kosovars coming to this country who have relatives here, I imagine that obviously, After it had been announced that the 4,000 under the special power you have, you will be Kosovars would be coming, I spoke again able to consider them for permanent residence with Mr Lloga. His concerns and those of the if they so desire, and I would ask you to give Kosovar representatives were that we should that matter consideration. Further, perhaps try to select from amongst those who were to you might indicate in your response to this arrive in this country those with some links issue whether in the public interest you will with Australia, whether in the form of relaconsider, with the power given to you, maktives or close friends or whatever.

Under that provision, minister will have to be exercised more would ask that you consider those who have significantly or more extensively than was relatives here in Australia. We may think that originally envisaged to enable more groups of the Albanian Kosovar community is a small people to stay here on a permanent basis or one, and relative to other communities it is at least an extended or more extended basis small. But, even if it comprises only a few than was the original idea in the bill. hundred families, it is still significant for I hope that under the provision which is those families, and I make this plea on their allowed to you, Minister, you will be taking behalf. into account developments in that part of the The minister has done something else for world and seeing whether it is safe for them which I have commended him; that is, he also to return-not merely to the borders of Albahas announced that the government will nia and Macedonia but to Kosovo itself-and provide resettlement of a permanent nature for to return. in a way which guarantees their displaced people from Kosovo who do have safety.

We are that is just your indication of how many. I talking about a group of people which has hope that certainly, if there are to be more suffered a lot and which may desire, in the than 200 in this category, they would all at final analysis, to stay here rather than return least be given the opportunity to come under to the circumstances which may be created for your consideration. them. I think we should be flexible about this. I Having said all of that, I think in general we can approach this matter on a bipartisan th-nk we should keep our options open. I basis and we can achieve something of subthmk we should allow the minister to exercise his powers in a humanitarian way to ensure stance for the refugees of Kosovo. Of concern that, firstly, those who have relatives here to a number of members who have spoken to me about this matter is the question of the who want to come and join those relatives are able to do so; and, secondly, those in the longer term future of these people. The bill indicates that they will be asked to return 4,000 who do have relatives be able to join once circumstances have reached a point their relatives. Also, those who are here who do not have relatives but who will have where they are able to return-and we all concerns about returning to Kosovo in the hope that that will be the case. But what short term will need to be given some comhappens if the circumstances become drawn passion and consideration. out over a considerably long period of time? What do we do in that situation? I think this I have dwelt so far on the question of the question needs to be addressed. It may be that general circumstances.

We saw some of the atrocities of situation, and I hope the minister will take the the Milosevic regime and the Karadzic regime opportunity to clarify that position, because at that time, and some of us were accused of obviously it will be much less of a burden on taking sides.

It is a little pious for want to refer to the political situation which the Western powers to now be saying, 'We has created these circumstances. Many people want to get rid of Milosevic at whatever cost.' who are supporting the Kosovar refugees and What happened back then when it would have who are supporting the general thrust of been possible, through political processes in trying to get them returned are sometimes Serbia itself, to initiate a campaign against Mr accused of supporting the Western powers in Milosevic for what he had been responsible all that they are doing in relation to the earlier on in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia? Milosevic regime. I want to say this about the The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, Milosevic regime: whatever one says about has called for some kind of political solution the people of Serbia-and the Serbian people in Kosovo. I think that is right. We need a are the ones who have suffered the most from political solution, because only a political the Milosevic regime in my opinion-what is solution will resolve the issue. But some happening in Kosovo is a very shameful people are fearful that a political solution will exercise. Whether or not it has been approved somehow bolster the position of Mr by certain people or whether or not other Milosevic.
