Yesterday both the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) and the Leader of the Country Party (Dr. Earle Page) gave the committee a dissertation on what I may term the interim budget of the present Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) in a manner which suggested that they themselves had never been associated with the conduct of the financial affairs of the Commonwealth. deavoured to convince the committee that the present situation, and the remedies proposed for it, are entirely attributable to the incapacity of the present administration, and that the accumulated ills of Australia ought, event at this early stage of the Government's career, to have been, not merely prescribed for, but cured. The case made out by the Leader of the Opposition as a justification for his amendment to reduce the item by £1 could more properly have been stated during a discussion on the Estimates for the Defence Department. If that course had been followed,' honourable members could have devoted themselves on this item to a consideration of the economic positiou of this country. The honourable gentleman has endeavoured to make the suspension of compulsory military training a major issue on this item, and therefore the committee is obliged to discuss the policy of the Government in relation to a specific department rather than the position of Australia as a whole. pulsory military training is a subject that concerns the country. ought to have been postponed until the Defence Department was before the committee. If we were to discuss upon the first item questions involved in the activities of all the departments, the debate would'drag on interminably; each honourable member would discuss his own pet subject, and there would be no coherence in the debate. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Watkins) I point out to the of the committee to have a general debate on the first item of the Estimates. would have been more appropriately moved at a later stage. I do not propose to discuss any of the administrative acts of the Government; they can be dealt with when we are considering the items with which they areparticularly concerned. In regard to compulsory military training I shall merely say that if , ten years after the signing of the Armistice, aud having before us the considered opinion of those who are presumed to know something ""about the manner in They enwhich the next great war will be fought men who, doubtless, express opinions upon military strategy and the future safety of different countries.",13,Canberr A Public Baths

The man who led the Australian armies in the greatest war in history could not be found a satisfactory position by the Government of the day when he returned to this country. Council of Defence. of the defence of this country surely is that which is associated with aviation; yet a son of Australia, who is one of the greatest aviators in the world, and who single handed performed the most remarkable flight in the history of the world, could not be found by the last Government a niche into which, he could be fitted in our aerial defence system. Therefore honourable sit opposite ought to cease prating about their whole-souled regard for the effective realised. While I was listening to the defence of this country, and the proper utilisation of men who are qualified to give advice upon that subject. Their policy was to train boys at Woolloomooloo and Collingwood, and at the same time to shut down ordinance factories. There were only twelve military training centres in the Commonwealth when the last Minister for Defence ceased to be responsible for the administration of the department. troops. port of the Inspector-General of the right honourable gentleman spoke ably and Military Forces has acquainted me with at great length upon a variety of subjects, the fact that the governments which have it is remarkable that this was one upon been in charge of the affairs of this which he made no comment.

Yesterday the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) stressed strongly what he alleged were weaknesses in the present budget. If his strictures were deserved there would be a major case to answer. The right honourable gentleman, however, omitted to state that the present budget is largely based upon the principles of that which he himself introduced. It is true that certain increases, of taxation are proposed; but they are due entirely, as the present Treasurer has explained, to the disclosure that the members who previous Estimates of revenue and expenditure would not have been right honourable gentleman yesterday I felt that he should have answered the specific accusation in this budget statement that the possible revenue was underestimated, and that the expenditure to which this country was committed by the policy of his Government will be greater than his estimate. under the new Treasurer's administration. has been made, and it is the justification If it be true that under the last budge* year have been faced with another deficit",14,Theodore

69,Mr Curtin,"That definite chargeou the year's finances, the right honorahle member would have repeated in this financial year his performance of last year, and the year before that. For three consecutive years he would have had an expenditure in excess of his estimate, and I think that he would have had a revenue less than he had expected. All the talk about the credit of Australia and the stability of its finances and resources would have' counted for nought in face of the outstanding fact that for three consecutive years the Commonwealth had been unable to keep its expenditure within the revenue for which provision had been made iu the budget. What would weaken the financial stability of Australia more than three consecutive deficits ? If credit overseas is important, surely the* need of the Treasincrease unemployment. In 1922-23, urer to live within his resources is imperative. The reason given by the present Treasurer why he had to ask for more revenue than his predecessor intended to provide, and why the expenditure is greater than the previous Treasurer said it would be, was a challenge which yesterday the right honourable gentleman lamentably failed to answer. He made the accusation against this Government that, because it had found the need for exto assert that increases in governmental penditure to be greater than was previously provided for, that was proof of its financial incapacity. That is to say, the only way in which the present Government could prove that it was capable of administering thefinancesof this country wisely was by allowing the departments to incur commitments for which no financial provision had been made. At the end of the year we should have then had a financial deficit, and the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) would have based his indictment, after the event, upon other grounds entirely. If the present Government allowed a deficit to recur such as we had at the end of last year, the parrot cry that the change of Ministers had resulted in no financial reform would have seemed to have an ostensible justification. The Treasurer took an early opportunity dustrial services of the country, and are of saying that whatever Obligations had operated by private enterprise. We must been deliberately assumed it was his duty recognize that one of the first duties of to provide for the revenue necessary to dispublic men, in both the State and Federal charge them; indeed, it would be misspheres, is to reduce the economic burden chievous if any other course were pursued. that the present system of government It is true that the present budget provides for an increase in expenditure to the extent of £1,700,000, but, if that be a wrong, on how many occasions has the right honourable member been guilty of the same offence? Take the Estimates of expenditure that he has on more than one occasion submitted to Parliament, and compare them with the actual expenditure incurred. We find that he has increased his annual expenditure by infinitely greater sums than £1,700,000. The right honourable member went on to say that the increase in customs revenue was further evidence of this Government's incapacity. He said that to increase that revenue by the amount proposed in the present budget would be to demoralize industry and when he was Treasurer, customs revenue amounted to £32,000,000, and last year it was £41,000,000, while his own estimate for the present year provides for a revenue in excess of that of last year. So his accusations of yesterday are unsound. That is clearly shown by reference to the Estimates that he himself has previously presented. It is easy taxation are bad. We know that, to the extent that a government can reduce taxation, it will increase the wealth producing resources of the country. When I heard the charge made yesterday that the real burdens of Australia are due to union bosses and industrial extremists, I desired to know why the whole burden of the cost of government was not taken into account? One of the main reasons for our economic difficulties is the terrific burden imposed on the people by the cost of government, both State and Federal, which has to be borne by a comparatively few people. The State and Commonwealth governments are engaged in many economic activities which for the most part have been established on the basis that they should be self-supporting. Many of them, such as railways, are of distinct assistance to the inplaces on the people. I make that statement without committing myself to the manner in which the political' government of Australia could be most soundly accomplished. More and more in every country centres of economic authority. idea that the State was concerned purely with political affairs no longer obtains. world have come to the assistance of the capitalistic system, which, of itself, over a long series of years by the Coal will not operate efficiently. No matter whether they are ship-owners, coal barons, iron and steel merchants, manufacturers, or primary producers, in one way or another capitalists are leaning on the authority port in dealing with their economic and industrial told that the workers run to the law for the protection of their wages; but we know that legislation is being invoked day by day, and even in this Parliament, in order to affect prices; I might instance the measures on the statute book relating to butter and dried fruits. It is well known that the increase of production in Germany was largely stimulated with the assistance of the State. The relation of its central bank to the great industries of that country was one of the reasons why it was so well prepared economically for the late war. More and more, governments are exercising economic authority. That is why the organization known as the National Union has been the recipient of large benefactions from great moneyed interests. I have said that a definite relation between political power and economic authority has developed in every country in the world, and I have given certain instances of it. The Miners Federation is related to the economic life of the country. Although there is not an item on the Estimates for the granting of assistance to the coal industry, we know very well that one of the. possibilities of the present, economic situadepended, to a large extent, upon the tion is that the industry may have to beassisted by the Government. has been made in the past for the payment of bounties to assist certain industries, and Parliament may be asked to provide a bounty for this industry. Ur. Curtin. pended in this way the Miners Federation will, of necessity, try to ensure that its views shall be considered in this House. The only way in which it can obtain the satisfactory representation of its opinions governments are becoming is to take part in the political game. it! Governments throughout the it finds itself to-day is the definite and inevitable outcome of the policy adopted Vend. The exactions of the Vend, and its control of the coal resources of this country, enabled it, so long as there was no substitute source of power, to bleed Australia white, economically speaking. There is of the State for supnot an' industry in Melbourne or Adelaide, and possibly not a manufacturer in Sydproblems. We are ney, who has not hud to pay to the coal owners coal-miners. coal industry, a price for coal which was unjust to the consumers of the product manufactured. I direct the attention of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Archdale Parkhill) to the Isaacs' report of 1908, following upon au inquiry into the operations of the Coal Vend. Sir Isaac Isaacs made the statement at that time that unless the combination between the coal-owners on the northern fields of New South Wales, through their association, and the interstate shipping monopoly could be terminated, toll would continue to be taken from the public to an extent that would be unjust and injurious."" necessarily Sir Isaac Isaacs' opinion today. to the honourable member, I suggest that His Honour's opinion, after hearing the evidence submitted to him, was more valuable than is that of the honourable member for Warringah. The. economic, development of Australia has ever since situation described by Sir Isaap Isaacs at Provision that time. There has been no fundamental change in the organic control of the coal industry since then. The difficulties from which the industry is suffering to-day have been caused by the deIf money is to be exvelopment of a substitute power. As 8",15,Theodore

The BrokenH ill Proprietary Company -could employ 1,000 more men if it could get coal at a reasonable price. Australian workers arc out of employment. crisis developed. Early this year, while the previous Government was in oflice, Australia had a record uumber of unemployed, but there was no coal crisis at that time. The unemployed position was so serious in 1927 that the last Government directed the Development and M i gration Commission to make an .investigation into the position. In these circumstances it is absurd to suggest that the coal crisis is chiefly responsible for the unemployment that exists. Australia imports hardly any coal from Newcastle, and yet has a considerable number of unemployed. States of America is certainly not dependent upon Newcastle coal, but in the last fortnight thousands of factories and plants have ceased operations there. Most people realize that one hundred and one causes are contributing to the present industrial depression. Professor Copland presented to the Development and Migration Commission a most elaborate treatise on unemployment, which the Commission considered to be so valuable that it' incorporated it in its report. In the course of his statement Professor Copland said that "" the major cause of unemployment is to be found in the banking and credit policies."" That is not my statement; it is the opinion of such an eminent authority as Professor Copland and was quoted by the Development and Migration Commission which the honourable member for ""Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) loves so much. love it ; and I have not denied the statetricts are of no more consequence to the ment of Professor Copland. [33] remarks from an article in the Ecorwmic Record for May, 1929, entitled ""Unemployment : Some Recent Suggestions "":It is in banking and credit policies that It may be true that Professor Copland finds the most important influences. It would appear that a decline in the proportion of advances to deposits, or a rise in the proportion of reserves to deposits, is accompanied by a rise in unemployment, and the reaction of credit conditions upon business conditions is undoubted. Credit policy is, therefore, of very considerable importance, nnd it is, as suggested, desirable that bankers should have more explicit knowledge -of fluctuations available in determining their credit policy. A conclusion of equally great importance is that tlie balance of payments abroad constitutes a prime cause of credit But this was so before the coal fluctuations in Australia Based upon this analysis, Professor Copland proposes a number of constructive measures of control. Those within the power of public authorities whicli he recommends are long-range planning of public works, the establishment of a research organization, and the concentration by Australian banking authorities upon the maintenance of exchange parity with London through the medium of a modification of the gold exchange standard. The latter he regards as "" the most important single measure than can be taken to control business fluctuations in Australia."" ""Western The Professor's position is diametrically opposed to the opinion promulgated from the Opposition benches this week The United in regard to banking and credit. In considering this budget the people of Australia would do wellto accept three propositions The first is that taxation cannot be reduced by the Commonwealth or the State Governments while their present obligations remain as they are. With the present dual control of the Commonwealth and the States, the performance of the services which the people are enjoying cannot, be cheapened to a great extent. There must necessarily be a readjustment on a large scale before the cost of these services can be brought down to a more reasonable figure. My view-and I have already put it once this week-is that it would be wrong for the Government to contemplate unifying the railway gauges of Australia unless the entire responsibility for our railway services devolved upon this Parliament. My reason for saying that is that the railways that I do not pass through important and settled disreal requirements of Australia than tbosfl",17,Theodore

It is not a question of getting the particular constitution that best suits the government in power for the time being, because, if that were so, we would never have an amendment of the Constitution. The Opposition would line up against the -Government and 'the residue of fear which remains in the States would be sumcient to give a majority for the Opposition proposals. That is the history of almost every attempt to change the Constitution. No party in this Parliament should attempt to push through constitutional amendments that are opposed by the other political parties. In any case the parties in this Parliament are incapable of making constitutional amendments; all they can do is to draft such amendments, with the f u l l knowledge that the public will probably not accept them. This Government should summon a convention at which the States as States and the Commonwealth would hold a deliberate session for the purpose of drafting a constitution not only for the Commonwealth but for the States as well. There should be drawn up a statement of the functions of the States as well as of those of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth functions should be denned, what remained devolving on the States. I say reluctantly that if the State functions were specified, and what remained were left to the Commonwealth, there would still exist a great deal of uncertainty, overthere. In that way Japan is training for lapping and confusion, and the High Court would, in the future as in the past, set aside the laws made by one or other of the legislatures. pened in Canada. monwealth's functions should be in the E-ational field, which alone it can enter.

We must participate in this movement because it is part of the process of civilization. .We should not remain outside it. A knowledge of international difficulties and of what is being proposed internationally to deal with them, is essential to the people of Australia and more essential to those who have a definite responsibility imposed upon them. Whether it be the League of Nations, the Disarmament Conference, the Imperial Conference, or any other Conference, I feel that we should have associated with our delegation three or four representative men in the sole capacity of research workers, whose duty on their return to Australia would be to engage in effective educational work in accordance with what has been done at the Conference. It may be said that that would add to the cost of Government. while?

What Australia needs to do is to study the causes of war, and to assist the influences that make for peace.

The British, and the ' 1 1929-30. great powers of Europe need not worry about the possibilities of war for the The next great next ten, fifteen, or twenty years, because the whole history of warfare teaches, us that it takes a nation a generation to recover from a great world war. It will take even longer than a generation to recover from the last war, bepause of its enormously destructive character. The bankers will not permit the countries of the world to fight each other again until they have been paid for the last war. I look forward to the time when the mental outlook of men and women will make war impossible. There should certainly be a more regular and definite contribution by this Parliament to the cause of peace, and the elimination of international conflict. his budget statement the Treasurer told a very old tale in a very old way about an empty treasury and the misleading estimates of his predecessors. Its outstanding features are the provision for a sensational increase of expenditure and heavy and discriminating additions to taxation; but as its details have been effectively criticized by my leader and the Leader of the Country party, I propose to address myself to some of the administrative and legislative acts of the new Ministers. The Government is fresh from the people; it has a big majority in this House, and it was the wish of all the members of the Opposition in the early months of its career to adopt a tolerant and even helpful attitude towards both its administration and its proposals. I regret, therefore, that the Government has commenced in a way so extraordinary, so startling, and so discreditable to itself and Australia at home and abroad, that there is little opportunity for generosity or assistance from this side of the House. In brief, the actions of the Ministry up to the present have been almost without exception made notorious by frantic haste, bitter discrimination between sections of the people, juvenile folly, and an unseemly and unprecedented dishonouring of election pledges. In six weeks this has done more to injure the credit of Australia in the eyes of the world than was done by any other government in as many years.

No government iu any other country at any time has ever in this abrupt and unthinking manner demolished its system of national defence. In conjunction with this must be considered the decision of the Ministry to postpone, and, as I believe, abandon, the project for the erection of a national memorial in Canberra. Again, it is the only government in any country on' the allied side which has pleaded poverty as a reason for not erecting a national memorial to those who fell when fighting fop their country. The next act of the lEiiistry was to suspend migration. Wheni t assumed office migration was a mere trickle; iu fact, the new arrivals were fewer thau the people leaving Australia. But in its folly and in its desire to pander to certain sections, the Governmember say he represented sheep? ment advertised to all the world that Australia's economic plight was so great that it could not absorb a few people each year from the United Kingdom. That action showed crass folly and absolute ignorance of the task in hand. Equally foolish, but of less magnitude, was the extraordinary embargo on the export of stud sheep. I doubt if any previous embargo imposed in Australia failed to honour existing obligations. The prohibition of the export of sheep was not only an unparalleled breach of a firm contract, but had another feature which is exciting a good deal of comment. On one day the Ministry allowed 5,000 stud sheep to be shipped to Russia, and on the following day prevented the export of 500 sheep to our co-dominionists in South Africa. I do not say a deliberate discrimination was exercised in favour of Russia, but for a couple of weeks before this occurrence the newspapers had contained full accounts of the proposed shipment of sheep to that country. The Minister and the Government knew of it, but the proclamation of the embargo was made five minutes after the shipment for Russia had cleared territorial waters and about five minutes before the next flock of 500 was ready to be embarked for South Africa. I do not charge Ministers with deliberately giving preference to their Russian friends, but their complained of, he must withdraw it. actions demonstrated in a most unfortunate way a lack of business foresight aud it. capacity.

The interest on the war gratuity, the payments for repatriation, war pensions, and soldiers' homes, and other post-war expenditure, absorb upwards of £30,000,000 annually, and, in addition, about £5,000,000 is voted each year for defence, making a total equal to more than half the annual revenue of the Commonwealth. Eor many years a feature of the debates on this subject in each session was that they were carried on almost entirely by returned soldiers, who obviously had a better knowledge of their subject than other honourable members. I expected from this Government nothing better than it has proposed in regard to defence and the War Memorial. As the honourable member for Balaclava has pointed out, this Ministry, elected by the vote of the Labour party, does not contain one member who was on active service. In saying that I am not reflecting, in any way on any individual Minister. point I am making is that the ministerial party when electing its leaders chose only those who had not served at the war.

More than half of our people live in exposed cities and towns on the seaboard. ""No other country is so open as Australia to effective raiding. Then we have our all the ideals which it implies, to which I , in common with every other honourable member, completely subscribe; but policy in an international sense, that could be adopted by any country. I do not believe that any good purpose would be served, when discussing defence, by shutting our eyes to international realities. After years of study of this subject, and a good deal of travelling in countries round about the Pacific, I sincerely believe that, if it were not for the might of the British Navy, and its readiness to come to our aid at all times, our White Australia policy would be challenged effectively within a period of one or two years. I do not say that we should be invaded by any great power, but conversations on that policy would be opened compulsorily, despite any protest we might make. The present Government has thought fit, without having the grace to consult this Parliament, to do away with our system of compulsory military training. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) touched on one great virtue of this training which no voluntary system, even if it were relatively successful, contains, and that is that it gives to any country that has it a strong and constant reserve of young men of a fighting age. Under a voluntary system, those who are enthusiastic enough to take up military service, remain in the forces until they are of middle age, so that the actual strength that can be mobilized is the handful of men that happens to be available at a particular time. We are asked to return to the voluntary system, which was abandoned because it had failed, and was excessively expensive in comparison with results. Everything points to the conclusion that the return to that sysem will be a total failure, because there will be a much smaller force available in an emergency, and the cost will be greater than under the compulsory system. Under the latter system we had 49,000 young men in training, and the Government now proposes to raise a voluntary force of 35,000. Sir Harry Chauvel, Inspector General of the Military Forces, is easily the first authority in Australia upon the system of warfare that is suitable for the ""White Australia policy, with defence of this country. He led throughout the Palestine campaign the greatest body of cavalry that has been assembled, and there was not only fighting such as it is the most provocative that in France, but also a great deal of open warfare. He said in his last report, dated the 31st May, that a force of 49,000 is "" the minimum possible for the approved organization, and, therefore, for security."" Members of the Government have said in this debate that the late Government had already reduced the defence forces to the point of impotence. Let me read what Sir Harry Chauvel wrote on that point in his report:To summarize my report so far, I may say that much has been accomplished since the introduction in 1022-23, and improvement has been made in every direction. The spirit of the forces has been revived. The nucleus has been increased. The training has been extended. Some essential technical and nondivisional units have been formed. A munitions developmental programme has been initiated. A commencement has been made in mechanised training. That shows that the forces had been brought to a highly efficient state. Sitting suspended from 12.U5 to 2.15 p.m. that this action has been taken without proper consideration or investigation, I object to the institution of the voluntary system because it throws on a small number of patriotic and public-spirited citizens of all ages the responsibility of training themselves for the defence of their country. It singles out the few persons who are prepared to take up this solemn and imperative duty, and the relatively small number of patriotic employers who will consent to their employees taking time for military service. On those grounds, apart altogether from the deadly blow which the Government's action has struck at the defence of Australia, I deplore this change. The one duty which any government, irrespective of party, should",23,Theodore
123,Mr Gullett,"Apart from the factperform despite all political considerations, is that of providing for defence, aud this Government has been guilty of a grave dereliction of duty in not doing so. I resent it exceedingly that, owing to the clamour and pressure from a small though influential, and, as I see it, sinister section of the Government party, we have lost our compulsory system of military training. I come now to a subject closely allied to defence!-the National War Memorial at Canberra. This has already been discussed at considerable length, and I shall only add that I cannot discover any acceptable reason for the Government's decision to delay the building of this memorial. I can attribute it only to the unseen and evil influence which has led to the destruction of our defence system. There are in Australia to-day, we are told, nearly 200,000 persons unemployed. The Government, we know, is exceedingly anxious, as we all are, to find employment for them. There is a considerable number of unemployed in the Federal Capital Territory. The Government pleads that it has no money to provide woi'k for the unemployed here, yet at the same time it is finding money for public works, and, if repeated reports are to be credited, it procation to Great Britain, and having it poses to find £1,000,000 for expenditure through the States on public works for the relief of unemployment. Apparently the Government is prepared to hand over its money to the States, without controlling its expenditure or knowing how it is expended; while here at hand there is an important work to be done, and one which the Government is under a solemn obligation to do. I can find no satisfactory explanation for what the Government calls the postponement, but what I strongly suspect to be a total abandonment, of this work. I wish to touch briefly on migration, and particularly upon the communication from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to the Prime Minister of Great Britain, in which he strongly urged the suspension of that part of the Migration agreement which makes it obligatory upon the Commonwealth to accept a certain number of assisted migrants for every million pounds of loan money contributed by Great Britain. The Government's action was a combinaMr Gullett. tion of folly and ignorance. The policy of the last Government, acting in cooperation with the States, together with the lack of employment offering here, had resulted in reducing the migration stream from Great Britain to a .mere trickle. It is a fact that more people left Australia during the first six months of this year than entered it, and for the first nine months of the year, the net gain in population from migration was only a few thousands. The great majority of those were women and children, nominees of migrants already in the country. Being for the most part, women aud children, their presence here must have had the effect of increasing the volume of work to be done by others, since they did not become competitors for what employment is offering. If we could get another half million women and children to come to Australia immediately, it would be the best thing that could happen for industry. In this matter, the Government has acted rashly and hastily, as it has so frequently done in the recent past. As one who has given much time and thought to migration, I strongly deprecate the action of the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) in sending that communipublished throughout the world. It was, first of all, an extraordinarily bad advertisement for this country, and there was no need to send it at all. Such migrants as were coming to Australia were helping rather than hindering us, and the announcement must have a bad effect on the migration movement as a whole. It takes years of propaganda to develop a strong and steady stream of immigration, and it is very easy to dry up that stream by hasty or ill-considered pronouncements. The message of the Prime Minister is calculated to shake the confidence of the British people in Australia as a field of migration. I subscribe to the slowing down of migration; I have always opposed having migration during times of acute unemployment, but seeing that the influx of migrants has been already reduced to practically nothing, it was unfortunate that the very definite announcement should have been made to the people .of Great. Britain that we could take no more migrants other than the close relatives of those already here. This exception covers the only migrants who arc actually coming here. The Government has been guilty of a piece of calamitous folly which will undoubtedly do a great deal of harm to Australia. 1 come now to a subject in which I am naturally particularly interested, the new tariff schedule. The Prime Minister within the last day or two called this the most scientific tariff schedule ever tabled. 1 cannot believe that he was speaking seriously when he said that. This schedule, conceived and prepared in a hurry, has been given no intelligent consideration at all. It has been built up on a formula, and might have been constructed by any schoolboy of ten or twelve who had been provided with the percentages to be added. As a protectionist who spent the best part of a year in protection provided by this Government the construction of a schedule along what I consider business-like lines, I take strong exception to the Government using its big majority to force a tariff of this kind upon the country. I object to the manner in which the Tariff Board, which was set up by Parliament, has been ignored by the Government. Not one half of the items in the schedule have been before the Tariff Board at all. Others, such as the duties on prunes and rice, arc still before the board, but the Minister has brought down his schedule without waiting for the board's report. The board has been treated with contempt, and if the Prime Minister did the honest and logical thing he would forthwith abolish it, and save the country a good deal of money. Moreover, in regard to many of the items on the schedule, and many of the industries protected by it, no application was made to the Government for the increased duties. Industries have had this increased protection heaped on them without their making any request for it. I referred the other day to the increased whisky duty. No application had been made from the whisky makers of Australia for this increased protection while I was connected with the deimrtment, and that was only six or seven weeks ago, yet the Government has practically doubled the measure of protection given to the whisky manufacturers. It has departed from the old principle enunciated again and again in this Parliameut that, in carrying out our policy of protection, we should uot aim to give Australian manufacturers an absolute monopoly of the Australian market. We should not, by legislation, prohibit the importation of goods. Our policy has always been that we should put the Australian manufacturer, with the assistance of the Tariff Board, on a generous competitive basis, with the odds in his favour, aud so enable him to pay a wage which would preserve industrial conditions and a standard of living conforming ^vith Australian ideals. This Government however, has imposed a tariff which amounts to prohibition, and which creates an absolute monopoly for many large interests. It is singularly interesting to me to observe that the extraordinary degret of in the new schedule will largely benefit powerful millionaire firms already possessing practically a monopoly of our trade. These firms are paying huge dividends, and are exceeding prosperous, yet the Government is giving them the extra shelter of tariff increases of from 25 per cent, to even 100 per cent. If this is what the Prime Minister calls "" scientific protection,"" all I can say is that on this subject he is beyond hope. A great deal of nonsense has been talked about controlling the selling prices of commodities. In reply to questions by myself and other honourable members on this side of the chamber, the Prime Minister has said that if the manufacturers attempt to exploit the consumers by increasing the prices of their commodities he will l if t the tariff from them. But he has cleared the way for such exploitation, and he cannot expect anything else than that prices will increase. His solemn threat is so much humbug and bluff. When I asked the honourable gentleman whether he proposed to make a gesture against the trade unionists of this country who exploit the tariff, he brushed the question aside as one of no moment. Buti t is a matter that should not be overlooked. Any attempt that a government, possessed only of the powers with which this Government is clothed, may make to control prices is foredoomed to failure. The great monopolies that will be created by the protection granted in the new schedule will undoubtedly prosper, but the people will pay for it. There is no way by which increases in the price of commodities can -be prevented. To ask manufacturers not to increase their prices when it is made -easy for them to do so is equivalent to -asking a bookmaker with whom one has made an indifferent bet to return one's money after the horse has lost. The Government has not attempted to put the Australian manufacturers on a competitive basis of any kind, but has in many cases given them an absolute monopoly. That is not tariff-making. Although the new duties may make more work, I have no hesitation in saying that the introduction of this tariff is the greatest calamity that the economic progress of Australia has suffered since federation. In conclusion I wish, in the interests of political morality and of the dignity and decency of Australian politics, to criticise the quality of the propaganda of the Labour party during the last election campaign. I am compelled to do this, because the class of propaganda that was scattered throughout the country was entirely new in Australian politics. The outstanding feature of the printed matter that was circulated was the constructive and deliberate lies that it contained. Millions of pamphlets were distributed also in which deliberately false promises were made to the people. This constructive and deliberate lying and false promising had a great deal to do with the result of the election. I am not squealing because the last Government was defeated, but I am convinced that unless the other political parties can show the people quite clearly that they have been deceived and misled, they might as well go out of political life, for no party can live in such a political atmosphere. Honourable members opposite may not like our constant reference to this subject, but it is essential that we shall drive it home to the people that statement after statement placed before them during the last election, above the names of prominent members of the Labour party consisted of downright, constructive lies. This was something new and alien in our political life. it was that on this occasion you found yourselves up against bigger liars than Mr Gullett. yourselves. You were beaten at your owu game. to a green pamphlet printed with the special object of appealing to the disabled returned soldiers of Australia. Apparently nothing was sacred to the honourable gentleman opposite, who desired to exploit the votes of the people by this iniquitous method. The particularly serious lie contained in this pamphlet was that if the Labour party were returned to power it would absorb in the Public Service of the country every disabled returned soldier who desired to be so absorbed. The Prime Minster has since said that no government would be foolish enough to make such a promise. Therefore, we are now asked to regard the promise as a joke or a mere votecatcher. Another equally notorious and contemptible pamphlet was that issued to the 10,000 or 11,000 coalminers who are on strike. These men were informed that if the Labour party were returned to power the mines would be re-opened within fourteen days without a reduction of wages. It was also said definitely that the Government had power to open the mines. That is deliberate and conscious lying, designed to catch votes. It was outrageous that the Labour party should have exploited these people, who at the moment are the most unfortunate of the workers in Australia.. Nothing was too low nor too mean for these propagandists, and I repeat that if we cannot discredit those responsible for it to sueh an extent that in the future ueither their spoken nor written word will be believed, we might as well disappear from public life. The unfortunate thing is that the lies told were believed. lieved next time. can bring home to the people the fact that they have been deceived, and quote chapter and verse to them in each case.

As the honourable member is an officer of the Citizen Forces, and is, I understand, prepared to accept a similar position under the voluntary system, it is highly regrettable that he should have been the first person to speak widely against the new system. Parliament, and I spoke in that capacity. orable member may have rendered good service to Australia during the war, he has to a large extent, nullified the effect of it by declaring in this chamber that it will be impossible to defend Australia by the voluntary system. The honourable member has rendered another great disservice to the Commonwealth to-day by saying that only 10 per cent, of the available men can be secured for training under the voluntary system. No sooner had the Government announced its intention to substitute voluntary for compulsory military training-and nothing else could have been expected from a Labour Government, for this is part of its platform-tha n the honourable member rattled his sabre and entered upon a fierce denunciation of the system. The Labour party's policy in this connection is clear. I do not wish to be misunderstood. Every honourable member and every citizen has a perfect right to discuss the merits or demerits of voluntary military training; but I object to the manner in which the honourable member for Balaclava has done it. The honourable member for Balaclava has broadcast the statement that only 10 per cent, of the present trainees would volunteer. Let me remind him of the illustrations that, have appeared in the press showing these young trainees, even in his own electorate, voluntrainees as against 50,000 previously. The teering in their hundreds. The following enlistment figures of the various units appeared in the Melbourne Herald on 28th November lastInfantry-37t h (Dnndenong) 75, 52nd (Dandenong) 100, 57th (Preston) 80, 58th (Moonee Ponds) 20, 32nd (Footscray) 74, 14th the Commonwealth Government might (Prahran) 120, 22nd (Richmond) 70, 24th (Surrey Hills) 191, 59th (Brunswick) 20, 00th (Westgarth) 50 and 29th (East Melbourne) 1.13. In addition there were enlistments in the technical units. In most units there was a good response for senior cadets, and in several, places more cadets enrolled than could be absorbed. Australians played their part during the war under the voluntary system, and they can play their part in peace time under the same system. Voluntary training went with a swing right from its inception, and the honourable member for Balaclava, in criticizing that I am also a member of scheme, has done a regrettable thing and a disservice to his country. As a matter of fact if he were a regular officer of any other country, even Great Britain, he would be court-martialled for decrying its defence system. the Minister knows about the subject. ber has tried to convey the impression that he has a great knowledge of defence matters, but his record does not bear that out. If the honourable member wishes to make this a personal question and to reflect upon my personal honour, he must expect a Roland for his Oliver, and he will get it if he continues in that strain. to explain his reference to my record. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Crouch) -The honourable member may make a personal explanation after the Minister for Defence has concluded, -his remarks. taught me that the returned soldiers who. have the least to say accomplished most at the war. That can be.taken as an invariable rule. versa. member for Balaclava said that under voluntary training we would have 30,000 proposal is that we shall enlist 35,000 trainees as against 47,000.

I ask the Minister to withdraw that remark. want the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) to understand clearly that although Minister for Defence in a Labour administration, I am not without fighting quality. He has asked whether any military officer of the Defence Department suggested the abolition of compulsory military training. Would any officer ask for the abolition of his job? If a departmental head were asked if his department were over-staffed, he would probably reply in the negative, because it would be natural for him to magnify the importance of its functions. The fact remains that the whole of the officers of the Defence Department are working with enthusiasm to make the voluntary system a success. Sir Harry Chauvel and Brigadier-General Dodds are energetically canvassing the country for volunteers, and it remains for men like the honourable member to misrepresent the action of the Government in abolishing . compulsory military training. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr expenditure. Hughes) pointed out that the compulsory system had become practically useless, and his statement is borne out by the records of the department. No other British dominion except New Zealand, has compulsory military training. That system was a blot upon Australia, and I am proud to be the Minister responsible for its abolition. It is true that many years ago the Labour party advocated the adoption in Australia of the Swiss system of compulsory training, so that every man capable of bearing arms would play his part in the defence scheme. Even the socialistic democrats of the Old Country at that time believed in compulsory military training. It was adopted as a plank of our platform until it was found that it could be used to restrict the freedom of civilians. Neither Canada nor South Africa has a system of compulsory military training time had a form of compulsory training. to-day. By introducing the voluntary system in Australia we shall save £150,000 on camps for the year, and I undertake to say that Australia will not be one whit worse off without those camps for this year. Later on, if found necessary, they will be restored. When I first took office I was of the opinion that a complete scheme of training should be arranged before any change was made, but after studying the financial position of Australia, we decided, in the interests of economy, to make a straight-out announcement of our defence policy. One honourable member has stated that, by taking this action, we have left Australia naked. The members of the Opposition belong to a party that, in 1921, abolished military training altogether. pended, and renewed later. member to allow me to continue my speech without interruption. Under this scheme we are saving £150,000. We could save thousands of pounds more if we dismissed a large portion of the staff of the Defence Department, but our policy is not to dismiss any official.

He inferred that there had been a sinister influence directing the action of the Government. In fact, that Russia overshadowed everything so far as the Labour party was concerned. Let me say that this Government will carry out its policy in respect of returned soldiers. Practically nine-tenths of those who enlisted during the war were supporters of the Labour party. Our party will be conducted on democratic lines; no man will be kept out of the Cabinet merely because he is a returned soldier, but any returned soldier may become a member if the",28,Theodore

Cameron) included in the last Ministry? His military experience and general knowledge are as great as those of any other honourable member in the last Parliament, and he is held in very high esteem by honourable members of both sides. But he was passed -over. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) was not offered a portfolio, despite the special knowledge of military matters he thinks he has.. Than he, no man would have better adorned the position of Minister for Defence-in his own opinion. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr tralia, that one volunteer is worth ten Prancis) was overlooked. So were the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell), for whom I have a very high regard, the former member for Bendigo( Mr Hurry), and the former Hughes). The then honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) held a portfolio for a time, but was -displaced at the earliest opportunity, to make room for somebody else. So much for the suggestion of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) that, for sinister reasons, the Labour party excluded returned soldiers from the Cabinet: I turn now to the attitude of the country towards the policy of voluntary enlistment. I have received hundreds of letters from all parts of Australia, commending the Government for the change it has brought about. The Labour party is pledged to the effective defence of Auswe are seekingI am determined to do tralia, but the Government will not continue the great waste ,that is being incurred in connection with all arms of the defence service.

Thousands of pounds will be saved without inflicting undue, hardship upon anybody, and the defence of the country will not be a whit less effective because of these economies. tralia to be considered safe for democracy? SinceI have assumed office, I have been assured that there is little likelihood of a major war within the next seven years. Good God, are we to spend millions of pounds annually to guard against something which cannot happen opposite towards returned in the next decade? Unfortunately, an. anti-Australian spirit has been transplanted in Australia from abroad-a spirit that is not in accord with the grand ideals of world peace. Some of those who are animated by that spirit realize theirhighest ideal when they are marching a few boys along a road on a Saturday afternoon, and lording it over them. Many who are engaged in this form of military exercise conceive that they are discharging a sacred duty; but others do it for no other reason than that they believe it raises them socially. It is the intention of the Government to inculcate into the minds of the young men of Auspressed men. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) has stated that I am without military knowledge or experience. I did my turn as a volunteer when I was a boy. Every Saturday afternoon I travelled 37 miles to drill with my company at Prahran, despite the fact that I was tired after a week of hard work. But I was glad to do it. We in the company were few, but we took our training seriously, and we believed that we were doing something useful for the country. I have no desire to decry unduly the compulsory 'system that we have just discarded, but of the hundreds of boys that I have consulted, not more than 50 per cent, cared for it : the others considered themselves conscripts. While such feelings were entertained how could we expect to have an efficient force? I make bold to say that if we enlist anything like the number' my part, and I ask the honourable member for Balaclava to help me able member will help. But I shall not be grateful to him if he delivers any more speeches like that to which we listened yesterday afternoon.

147,Mr A. Green,"I hope the honormore costly than those at present in use, but that is not determined yet. Honourable members can rest assured that the additional cost will not add much to the financial burden of the Commonwealth. Australia is a continent two-thirds the size of Europe, and it has a population of only 6,000,000. Our great task is not to teach men to right about turn and form fours, but to develop the country, and our most urgent requirement is capital. We cannot afford to continue spending money on superfluities. If ever there was a time when it was necessary to economize in defence expenditure that time is now. We are sending a Minister abroad to confer with the representatives of other nations regarding policies that will promote international peace, and at such a time the bellicose utterances of honourable members opposite are ill-advised and inopportune. The abolition of compulsory military training will have a repercussion for good all over the civilized world. That is Australia's friendly gesture in support of the peace movement which is foremost iu the minds of all thoughtful men. In the year 1928, under the last chaotic Government, £29,000,000 or 92s. per head of the population was expended as a result of old wars, and 17 s. 8d. per head in preparation for new wars; 52s. 6d. per head was left to finance other Governmental services. In other words, only one-third of the Consolidated Revenue was left for the further development of the country. The balance was absorbed by the ignoble fetish of preparedness for war, the greatest blot on our civilization. Mere disarmament will not alter that condition of affairs, and I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) that if we devote ourselves to extending the right hand of fellowship to other nations, we shall do something more effective for the peace of this country than the expenditure of immense sums of money on militarism. When two men armed with sticks are saying to each other ""If you hit me I will hit you "" peace is not so assured as when one says ""I have laid down my club, will you lay down yours ?"" Tho rotten system of militarism puts a strangle-hold on the country and its industries and absorbs a great proportion of the wages of the workers. Mr A. Green. I have already referred to the manner in which the last Government whittled down the defence system. That is proved by these statistics regarding the number of training centres in the various states1921. 1929.

If enemy forces had. landed in the north and gradually swept over the land they could not have pushed back our troops more effectively than the Nationalist Government did. We want no more of the humbug we have heard from the honourable members of the Opposition. We have been told that the number of trainees was 47,000. The average number of these poor devils who turned up on Saturday afternoons was 7,000; the other 40,000 were at football or cricket. The voluntary system, will have at least this merit, that only those will join who are keeu enough to attend the drills. Under the compulsory system only comparatively few were standing up to their jobs, and that was to be expected, for no Australian will be compelled to do what he does not want' to do. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) is not the final authority as to the best method of defending this country. As Minister for DefenceI have had to consult representatives of different arms. I have been told by military experts that Australia can be saved only by a big military force; the Navy Department is satisfied that the navy is the only strong arm, whilst the Royal Australian Air Force is equally positive that the invader must be beaten off in the air. The opinion of experts in the department is that no nation could prepare to invade Australia in less than six mouths. In the meantime what would our intelligence officers be doing?",30,Theodore

That is another excuse offered my record, and I now invite h im to do so. to the public by the Labour party for MrA . GEEEN I did not say that the honourable member's war record would not stand inspection. the last election the Labour party made many promises to the people, but, now it is in power, it seems to have difficulty in f u l f ill in g them. The Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) and the Postmaster-General( Mr Lyons) have sounded a note of alarm which they hope will influence the people, just as did their election promises. When they got into power they said that they found not a penny in the Treasury. ments in tbe press, the Postmaster General stated in Hobart that Australia would be shocked when it discovered that the Treasury was empty. But we can find no such statement to the contrary in the budget of the late Government. During the last campaign I heard two Labour members talking. One of them said that he thought there were two outstanding statesmen in AustraliaMr Australia interpolated that the CommonBruce and Mr Collier. Another man remarked, "" I don't care a d knows it, I am supporting the Bruce Page Government."" I ask whether the late Government tried to make the people believe that there was plenty of money in the treasury. In May last Mr Bruce met the State Premiers in conference in Canberra, and, in a stateOn an occasion such as the present, when both Commonwealth and State, are gathered together, it is desirable that we to state our views with the utmost frankness, leadership. The situation that confronts us experienced periods of temporary depression, which have been due in the main to adverse D u r in g the course of his seasonal influences. not carrying out its election promises. It feels confident that, during its occupancy of the treasury bench, Providence will smile on Australia, and give it good seasons. Mr Bruce went on to sayGenerally speaking, we have been fortunate in that they have been of short duration, and that the disabilities which they have occasioned, such as unemployment and stringency in public finance, have rapidly disappeared with the return of normal seasons. Our present position is, however, due, I suggest, to causes tliat are more deeply seated, and good seasons alone will not restore prosperity. The prices of our staple commodities-woo l and wheat-hav e recently declined. The sale of the surplus products of most of our other According to stateprimary industries has become unprofitable, and the position of our secondary industries is becoming more and more difficult owing to ever-increasing competition from overseas. The cumulative effect of all these things is discernible in the growth of unemployment throughout Australia, and in the increasing complexity of the problems with which we have to contend in relation to our finance, commerce, industry, and production generally. At this point in the late Prime Minister's speech, the Labour Premier of Western wealth was the biggest culprit in bringwho ing about that condition of affairs, and he instanced the heavy customs duties that the people have to pay. Speaking on the Address-in-Eeply in the Western Australian Parliament, Mr Collier remarked' The position iu Australia to-day was serious. The Commonwealth was literally living on its",31,Theodore
150,Mr White,,32,Theodore
151,Mr Prowse (Forrest) [3.17],"A tprimary industries-whea t and wool. consternation caused about a month ago when a fall in wheat occurred indicated the results that would follow any serious fall in the price of those two commodities. With the competition of artificial wool, a further reduction in the price of the real material threatened next year. There was no doubt that any fulling-off in tiie volume of production of wool or wheat, quite apart from any fall in price, would create u serious situation for the people of Australia. The cost of production in Australia was too high. Australia had to compete in the world's markets. The producer of wool aud wheat had no say in fixing the price of the commodity he produced. It was determined by external influences over which he had no control. If Australians were to compote with other countries they would have seriously to consider the question of lowering the cost of production. Has the tariff lowered the cost of production in Australia? Five of our best authorities on economics iu Australia have pointed out that £36,000,000 belonging to the people has been given to certain industries, in order that they may be bolstered up, and that this means a burden of 9 per cent, upon our export industries. Is that not an extremely high handicap for those industries to carry? surprising that our primary industries are declining? According to Mr Bruce, Mr Collier and the leading economists of Australia, those are most important industries, because they bring new money into the country, and make living here possible. This fact is clearly shown by the report of the "" B i g Four,"" whicli statesBut all measures designed for the increase of Australia's wealth production and power of absorbing new population tend to be defeated if there are strong forces within her which operate so to raise her costs of production that she cannot sell her products in the markets of the world, and is restricted within the limitations of her own home market. Here we approach the most vexed, and the most important of all Australian questions, that of the combined effects of the protective customs tariff and of the legislative enactments, both of the Commonwealth and of the States, for the fixing of wages and conditions of labour, which we will call, for brevity, the arbitration acts. These authorities, who have no political prejudices, all agree that a vicious circle is created which increases the cost of production and living in Australia, sd that it is extremely hard for us to compete in the world's markets. This GoSlr. Prowse. The vernment proposes to add to the burden on the community. It has disregarded the economic advisers of the Commonwealth, including the T a r i ff Board. It proposes to increase direct taxation by £1,285,000, and to raise an additional £1,200,000 by meaus of the tariff, making a total increase in taxation of £2,485,000. This is being done during what is admitted in the Governor General's Speech to be a bad season. Any government with the interests of the people at heart should consider, before enlarging on undertakings that will increase expenditure, on whose shoulders the burden will f a l l. All these party promises have, eventually, been fulfilled by the taxpayers. To my way of thinking, the best test of a good government is the manner in which it taxes the people and spends the money it gets. A good government will raise money in the manner least, harmful to industry, and use it ' to increase production and national wealth. This additional impost of £2,485,000 is being added by the Government to the existing burdens of the people in such a way as to retard national progress. It constitutes a Isi t further tax on industry. The Government seems to avoid taxing luxury and amusements, which surely ought to be taxed if extra revenue is required. I am a smoker, but I should not think it unfair if a heavy duty were placed on tobacco. If I could not pay it I could reduce my smoking. The same applies to whisky and moving picture shows. If I could not afford to use as much whisky, after the duty had been increased, as formerly, 1 could get along quite well on less. A man who objects to paying the amusement tax could attend fewer shows, and so get over the difficulty. The present increases, however, are laid on the food and clothing of the people. The increase in the tariff on cotton falls particularly on the poorer classes of the community. The cost of children's hats will be quadrupled by the duties that have been imposed on them. The people were not told that the Government was going to do these things. It is evident that what is most needed in Australia to-day is to reduce the cost of production, aud to produce more for competitive export.
