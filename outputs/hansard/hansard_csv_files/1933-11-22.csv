This alteration is necessary to correct an error which and should have been noticed when the bill was still in this chamber. Motion agreed to. Resolution reported; report adopted. committee (Consideration of ESTIMATES 1933-34. In Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from the 21st November (vide page 4864). Proposed vote, Â£498,700. The Estimates provide for an increased expenditure of Â£28,000 in this great revenue-producing department, but no objection can be taken to that increase when one considers the nature of the work done by and the amount of revenue derived from this department. In 1928-29 the customs revenue amounted to Â£29,500,000 and the excise revenue to Â£li,500,000, making a total of Â£41,000,000. In 1931-32, the customs revenue amounted to Â£18,500,000, and the excise revenue to Â£9,900,000, making a total of Â£28,400,000. In the last financial year the custom's revenue amounted to Â£21,300,000, and the excise revenue to Â£11,700,000, making a total of Â£33,000,000, which represents an increase of Â£4,600,000 over the revenue for the previous year, due substantially to committee (Consideration of reduced duties and increased imports. In collecting that revenue of Â£33,000,000 only Â£28,000 was expended in administrative charges. I notice by a recent press statement that the permanent head of the Trade and Customs Department, Mr E. T. Hall, has had to retire owing to ill-health, and I desire to pay a special tribute of praise to that gentleman. He was a most conscientious and trustworthy officer, and for a 'considerable period gave loyal service to the department, and to successive governments. His ill-health was brought about largely by his close and honest application to his work. The duties of the Comptroller-General of Customs are onerous and nerve-racking, as is shown by the fact that Messrs.

In the circumstances, Mr Hall was wise in retiring,and now that the strain of responsibility has been lifted from his shoulders I trust that he will enjoy good health once again. In severing his connection with the Service, in which he had spent practically a lifetime, he took with him the esteem and respect of a capable and loyal body of officers, and as ex-Minister for Trade and CustomsI wish him many years of happy life in his well-earned retirement. I hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) will arrange for the new Comptroller-General of Customs-who ever he may . be-to make periodical visits to other parts of Australia to enable him to keep in touch with the officers of the department and to give promising young officers in the .other States an opportunity to transfer to the larger centres and the central office for the purpose of gaining experience. I know that during the last four or five years the concentration of work in the department has made it almost impossible for fhe permanent head and. his deputy to visit the capital cities and other important centres in the States. It has sometimes happened that, in a department like th.is, brilliant officers have been sidetracked at remote centres such as Townsville, Rockhampton, Newcastle, Perth and Fremantle. Because their ability been brought directly under notice of the Comptroller-General of Customs, quite unintentionally their qualifications have been overlooked, particularly when prompt' appointments have had to be made. believe that in the future when high positions in the Public Service are being filled, merit should prevail over seniority to a greater extent than it. has. in the past. the hands of the Public Service Board? Board was created by the Parliament, and the Government could, no doubt, formulate a policy which would be observed by it. In making promotions to-day the board does not consider seniority alone; that is only one of the factors taken into consideration. Owing to the policy of preference to returned soldiers, which has operated over a number of years, and against which I shall not say anything at the present moment, there have been no appointments from the youth of Australia to the Commonwealth Public Service. That, of course, will make it difficult to fill high administrative positions, within the Service within the next ten years. Many returned soldiers entered the Service -when they were middle-aged, and a large number of them, although conscientious officers, have not had an opportunity to obtain the sound training and early experience in administrative work which are usually gained by an intelligent officer before he reaches the age of 21 years. I hope that in the Department of Trade and Customs and other departments of the Public Service an effort will be made to recruit brilliant youths, and to give them later an opportunity to qualify for high administrative positions. 1 agree with the decision of the Minister to establish in his department a tariff revision branch. As a matter of fact, such a body has existed in practice for quite a long time. Certain officers have been entrusted with the work of tariff revision, but, unfortunately, their salaries have not been commensurate with the responsibility placed upon them. I am pleased that this branch is now under the control of a capable officer of the and experience have not department whose status has been in the creased as the result of his appointment. I notice that the departmental vote includes the item "" Tariff Board "", tlie expenditure this year being Â£4,628, as I against Â£4,029 last year. While I do not agree with many of the recommendations of the Tariff Board, I realize that it has to carry out important functions. I do not criticize the board for its recommendations, but I do criticize the Government for its 'blind acceptance'of many of those recommendations. For the chairman of I have the greatest respect and admiration. Just before the last elections the TJnited Australia party promised that if returned to power its tariff policy would be largely based on the recommendations of the Tariff Board, but it was never expected at that time",15,Department Or Trade And Customs

40,"The Tariff Board, Mr Mcconaghy,","that the Government would become such a slave to those recommendations. ber suggest that the Senate has been blindfolded? refused to accept a certain duty which was imposed as the result of a recommendation of the Tariff Board. I hope that in that case the Minister will abide by the recommendation. In the main, the board has recommended decreased duties, and no doubt that meets with the policy of the Government. I believe that the board carries out its work conscientiously, but, unfortunately, the Government seems to treat it as a sort of body of supermen, whose recommendations must stand, notwithstanding the views of honourable members or of people outside who stand for the development of Australian secondary industries under an adequate protectionist policy. According to a reply which the Government gave to a recent question asked by me, the Tariff Board has a considerable number of inquiries to make. It made 33 inquiries in 1928-29, 51. in 1930-31, 55 in 1931-32 and 7.1 in 1932-33. which is an average of 60 inquiries a year. At the present time there are 167 matters awaiting attention,' so that the board has practically three years' work already before it. before the board are of a minor nature, and should not take so long to dispose of as those which previously occupied its attention. to the pa3t, and that the board has not been engaged upon the consideration of major matters all the time, so that it will probably not make much faster progress in the future than iu the. past. I know that some of the inquiries on the board's list refer to industries for which increased protection has been asked, and I hope that they will be dealt with first before further unemployment is created. No matter what government is in office, some kind of tariff board will be necessary. It should, however, be comprised of men who have at heart the best interests of Australian secondary industries, and who are imbued with a protectionist spirit. They should not be the catspaw of any political party or government that wishes to tear down Australia's tariff wall. I should like to kuow whether the Minister has yet received the report of the Tariff Board on cotton yarn? I received a telegram.to-day from one of the cottonspinners which emphasized the need for immediate action. The message states that if Parliament goes into recess before something is done to protect the industry, the spinners will not be able to negotiate next season's crop, and hundreds of employees will be dismissed. Increased markets aro nooessary, and they can be obtained only by imposing duties on those cotton yarns now being admitted free. Spinners and knitters can land Japanese yarn in store to-day for less than they pay for Queensland raw cotton. This subject has been before the board for over twelve months, aud the industry was never iu a more serious position than it is to-day. honourable member must not pursue that discussion. He must confine his remarks to the vote before the Chair. formed by telephone that 200 workers in a spinning mill are to be put off to-night because there is no market for the product of their labour. The Minister should bear in mind that importations of yarn increased twelve times as compared with what they were three years ago. Definite action should be taken before Parliament rises, or both the primary and secondary branches of the industry will be in serious trouble. The Estimates this year show a considerable increase in the expenditure of the Customs Department as compared with the previous year, and this at a -time when we have been assured that everything is being done to cut down administrative costs. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) referred to the constitution of the Tariff Board. Under the act, the chairman must be .an officer of the Customs Department.

The board should be as independent as it is possible to make it, and its chairman should be quite free from anything in the nature of ministerial interference or control. I have been informed that, in the past, attempts have been made by the Minister to induce the board to bring in reports favorable to the policy of the Government. The lionorable member for Capricornia said that the members of the board should be imbued with a protectionist spirit, and should not be the catspaw of afraid that if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had the choosing of the members of the board they would, without any question, be the catspaw of a political will be accompanied by good health and party. The members of tbe board should be independent of all political parties and their duty should be to obtain all the information relevant to subjects under inquiry, and place the facts before Board, for further consideration, the duty Parliament. able member put on the board? gesting who should be appointed; I am merely replying to the suggestion of the Deputy Lender of the Opposition. I hope tliat the act will be amended to ensure that Tariff Board reports-whic h frequently contain recommendations for increased taxation-shal l be the property of Parliament as well as of the Government. The board is responsible to this Parliament to an even greater extent than to the Government, and reports should be laid on the table of the House within a reasonable time after their presentation to the Government. WhatI am asking for is a greater measure of parliamentary control. By granting to governments powers in regard to the making of regulations, Parliament is losing to a large extent the control that it should have over the expenditure of public funds as well as over the administration itself. Too often governments go beyond the spirit of an act, and by proclamations are able to assume powers that the Parliament never intended they should have. The Customs Act was uot designed to enable embargoes to be imposed upon trade and commerce. While I believe in giving certain powers to governments, I consider that the exercise of them should be within the control of this Parliament. I urge honourable members to insist upon the preservation of their rights. They should be supplied with the fullest information in regard to the imposition of taxation upon any section of the community. I endorse the remarks of the Deputy. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eorde) concerning the retirement, on account of ill health, of Mr Hall, the Comptroller of Customs. It has beeu my privilege to any political party. I am consult Mr Hall on many occasions, and I have always^found him courteous, and eager to advise and assist. I hope that the respite which his service has merited be enjoyed for many years. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) to refer to the Tariff on axe handles, in the light of a report on the subject that has been made by Mr Galbraith, of the Melbourne University, since the matter was considered by this Parliament.

If the Minister reads it, he will realize that the question is deserving of further consideration. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that Parliament must have some body to advise it on tariff matters. I am not concerned with the personnel of the Tariff Board; whether it could be improved is a matter of opinion; but",17,Department Or Trade And Customs

54,Mr Martens,"Statement s that I believe that the board is performing its duties conscientiously, and that it considers it is acting in the best interests of Australia, bearing in mind always the terms of the Ottawa agreement. As to whether or not the Government should, willy-nilly, adopt its reports, is a debatable point. In connection with axe handles, it was clearly shown that the board made a mistake. I am pleased to have the Minister's assurance that he will read and take cognizance of Mr toms ( Mr White) to follow slavishly Galbraith's report. Eor the moment, I am not concerned with the composition of the Tariff Board; but I am concerned with the board as an institution, to the extent that I believe that its function is to advise governments and Parliament, and not' to formulate policies. ""While the Scullin Government was in office, the position of Australia was able and necessary. If information were so critical, and the need for prompt action so necessary, that information and advice concerning the drastic steps considered advisable had to be obtained speedily from the board. That, however, did not mean that its recommendations had to be accepted. In many instances, they were rejected. produced to Parliament. cerned about a lot of them, because we could not delay action until they had been received. After all, if a government has heen commissioned by the people to administer the affairs of Australia in accordance with the terms of a declared policy, all that is necessary is to bring that policy into operation. I do not say that prohibitions and embargoes would have been imposed had a cataclysm not struck Australia and the world. But I do contend that we were elected on a policy of high, protection. We still advocate that policy, and, when we again go to the country, will strongly urge the adoption of full and complete protection of the primary and secondary industries of Australia. member must realize that, if he were permitted to continue along those lines, another full debate on the tariff might ensue. which the honourable member has referred is yet a long way off. now make the declaration is that there are comparatively few months to go. In all probability, we shall return from the elections as a government. If that be the case, we shall be expected by my friend the Minister for Trade and Cusevery recommendation of the Tariff Board. Since the advent of the Lyons Government, the board's recommendations have, generally speaking, not been along the lines of what might be termed high protection. They have reflected, not a fiscal policy which meets with my personal approval, but the fiscal beliefs of the present Minister aud Government. Nevertheless, I believe that the board is valunot collected and collated by it for the guidance of governments and parliaments, that duty would have to be performed by officers of the department. AlthoughI do not desire the abolition of the Tariff Board, I maintain that this Parliament should not slavishly adopt its recommendations or decisions. The Government has shed on to the board too much of the responsibility that Ministers should carry. A question that might particularly be referred to the Tariff Board is, the constant attacks on Australian materials and production. The Women's Mirror, which is printed by the Bulletin Newspaper Company, of Sydney, has published an article, headed "" Buying furniture."" The writer of it signs himself "" Salesman,"" but does not give his name. In it he saysDo not be guided by the weight of a piece of furniture. Many of the cheap and unreliable timbers are heavy. Tasmanian oak, for instance, is a heavy timber, but is not comparable to Japanese oak for any class of furniture. The beautiful timbers which decorate the interior of this building are of Australian production. High-class furniture is made from Tasmanian oak, and beautiful furniture from Tasmanian blackwood. as Tasmanian oak; it is hardwood.",18,Department Or Trade And Customs

Although it may he more rightly described as Tasmanian hardwood, it is a splendid timber, and for all kinds of joinery work is held in very high repute by artisans and carpenters. It is anti-Australian of the Sydney Bulletin, which has always proclaimed its adherence to a policy of high protection, to permit the publication of an article condemning an Australian timber, and expressing a preference, on the ground of quality and beauty, for a Japanese wood. I suggest to the Minister that inquiries might be made into the origin of these anonymous attacks that are launched from time to time. -As one who, for a brief period, administered the Department of Trade and Customs, I wish to, express my very deep regret at the premature retirement of the Comptroller-General of Customs, Mr Hall, who, unfortunately, has been in indifferent health for a number of years. I wish him a very happy, healthy, and prosperous period of retirement. He has faithfully served the Commonwealth from his youthful years onward, and leaves behind him a brilliant record. He can certainly enter upon his retirement in the pleasurable consciousness that he has earnestly and consistently discharged his very arduous duties in the interests of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. Having a lengthy knowledge of the very high standard of the officials of the Trade and Customs, Department, I can understand the anxiety of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) regarding its future personnel. Doctor Wollaston, the first Comptroller General, who was followed by Mr the Government follows too slavishly the Lockyer, there has been a succession of most able heads of the Trade and Customs Department. At one time it could be said by the Comptroller-General of Customs that he had under him a number of young officers who possessed an international knowledge of customs affairs, were excellent linguists, and were highly trained in the technicalities of the, departhonorable members on other items, I shall ment. I hope that that is still the case, and that the high standard that has been so consistently set will be maintained. There is no more important department in the Commonwealth Public Service, and it is essential that every endeavour should be made to ensure that it functions smoothly, and efficiently. Honourable members know how strenuous are the duties associated with the Trade and Customs Department, the long stretches of hours its officers are called upon to work, and the intricate problems that they are asked to elucidate. It is essential, therefore, that there should be junior officers to understudy the seniors and relieve them when possibly through illness it becomes necessary to do so. Despite Australia's financial position, there should be no undue cheeseparing in connection with the personnel of the department; rather should the Government err on the liberal side in tliis connection. I have been wondering whether the recently-formed tariff revision branch of the Trade and Customs Department is to supersede the Tariff Board. make invidious comparisons; but, from my own experience, I know that there are officers in the department who are better fitted to give information to the-Minister than are members of the Tariff Board. It is only natural. I think the Minister is wrong in attributing omniscience to the 'board. When we were young we were told that, if we were to become useful community units, we should equip ourselves thoroughly for certain tasks. A jack of all trades, we know, is of little use to any one, and makes but little headway. It is impossible for members of the Tariff.

My chief objection is that recommendations that are made by the board. After all, Parliament must accept responsibility for any policy that is pursued.

Reference has beeu made to its large staff. I am of the opinion that there is much work for it to do, and it appears to be impossible for the present staff always to keep abreast of requirements. While I believe rhat Parliament and the people have confidence in the Tariff Board, it appears to me that there is a hiatus between giving effect to its recommendations, in relation to duties for certain industries, and considering the effect of those duties upon other industries and the country generally, and I should like the Minister to consider attaching to the Tariff Board an economic adviser or other outside expert to consider aud report on such problems. Honourable members should also be supplied with reliable information regarding tbe prices which obtain in Australia and elsewhere. Recently there was a discussion on cornflour in this chamber, and it was found that, whereas the wholesale price of cornflour in Scotland is less than half that charged in Australia, the price of cornflour in packets in this country is practically identical with that charged in Great Britain. Allowing for the 25 per cent, exchange against Australia it is eviand upon the community generallya dent that the English retail price seemed disproportionately high. Such matters require explaining. We had another experience in connection with galvanized iron, being told that in New Zealand, where the commodity is admitted duty free, the price is higher than in Australia; agreements between this country and its also that the price in Perth is Â£24 a ton. I should like to know why Australian galvanized iron is not saleable in Auckland, which is no farther away from Newcastle than is Perth. When I asked the Customs Department what had been the export of Australian galvanized iron to Auckland, I was informed that the figure for the last year, for which returns on the subject. are available, was 1 ton 9 cwt.

The prices seem to be so out of harmony that it would be advisable for the Government to appoint a body from which reliable information can be secured. Something similar occurred in regard to machinery, honourable members being informed that the difference between the price of a binder in the Commonwealth and in New Zealand was Â£18.

The fact is that the Government has not shown any real inclination to effect trade agreements with Australia's good customers, and it is unfortunate that this important matter has not progressed sufficiently to enable the Goverument to implement the necessary agreements before the House rises.

Nearly a year ago, the Tariff Board was requested to make an investigation into the industry. Unfortunately, its report has not yet come to hand. I ask the Minister to give an undertaking that if it does not come to hand until two or three weeks after Parliament adjourns for the Christmas recess, I take it that the Minishe will do whatever he can under departmental by-law to give effect to any recommendations made by the board for the benefit of this industry. be done until I see the report. without reference to the Tariff Board, to classify cotton yarns.

86,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"members of the Tariff Board, for everybody knows that they are excelled* gentlemen of great ability. I am of the opinion, however, that the board has been overloaded with work. In fact, the whole department has been understaffed during the last two or three years, probably because of the abnormal conditions that have prevailed. I notice that a slight .increase of expenditure has been made in the salaries of members of the board, out I-do not think sufficient has been done in that regard. If this board is to be a tariff-making .advisory body it was originally intended to be, it should be enlarged considerably. .an advisory board to advise us on tariff matters, similar to the board which advises the British House of Commons on such subjects; but in consequence of the actions of this Government, the Australian Tariff Board has become the Australian tariff-making machine, and has superseded Parliament in this regard. Under these circumstances, the board is unable to cope with the work that requires to be done. Various recent happenings have proved the truth of my statement. the inadequacy of the board's inquiry into cornflour, tools of trade, particularly axe handles, and the electro-plating of radiator shells. When the discussion on these items of the tariff schedule occurred in this chamber, many statements were made by the Minister( Mr White) on the authority Board, to be incorrect. This indicates that the board's inquiries were altogether too limited in their scope. On the subject of axe handles, for instance, the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) made certain remarks which caused a controversy in the press. Sworn declarations have since been obtained proving that the honourable member's statements were correct, and that those of the Tariff Board and the Minister were incorrect. The board reported that no Australian grown timbers were suitable for the manufacture of axe handles of the highest type as used by professional axemen; but tests since made by university experts have demonstrated that axe handles made from Australian spotted Mr Holloway. gum are superior to those made from American hickory. I have an axe handle autographed by Mr Galbraith to this effect and sworn declarations from professional axemen who have won prizes at the last Melbourne and Sydney shows, stating that they used handles made in Australia from Australian spotted gum. But unhappily, the damage has been done. Similarly, statements made in this chamber by the Minister, with the backing of the Tariff Board, regarding the price at which cornflour was body instead of the sold in the Melbourne shops, have also been proved to be wrong. As to the electro-plating of radiator shells, it was sugWe should have gested, one inferred, that the Government's policy was designed to give effect to the provisions of the Ottawa agreement; but it has since been demonstrated that the action taken in that connection, which has .wrecked this young Australian industry, was beneficial only to the United States of America. I urge the Minister, in these circumstances, to request the board to make a fresh inquiry into each of these items in order that the mistakes made may be rectified. I instance, in particular, tro-plating of radiator shells has already been referred back to the board, and I undertake to ask the board to make another inquiry into the subject of axe handles. the Minister replies to this debate, he will make an official statement to that effect. of the Tariff These axe handles are of native timber which have since proved and are manufactured by Australian workmen. I have shown that, in certain instances, the investigations of 'the Tariff Board have not been complete, and that damage has resulted, but apart from that I suggest to the Government that, the Tariff Board should be an advisory and not a tariff-making body, and that further inquiry should be made into these cases.

The members of the Country party-have frequently expressed disappointment because of the fact that the Government, on taking office, did not immediately reduce all duties; but that has not been done for the reason that, the Government is following the definite policy enunciated by the Prime Minister at the last elections that it would make no tariff alterations until full inquiry had been made by an expert board. The Tariff Board acts in an advisory capacity to the Government. Despite what was said to the contrary by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eorde), we have not slavishly followed the recommendations of that board. I agree that in the main We have accepted its advice, but it must be remembered that it is the Government's responsibility to watch the revenue, and that more than half the duties in the tariff schedule are revenue producing. I wish to pay a tribute to the excellent work of the Tariff Board. The fact that the Ottawa agreement had to be woven into the tariff fabric increased its work enormously. Some honourable members have expressed the fear that certain indusstated that one firm is likely to dismiss tries may suffer because of the-Government giving effect, to the decisions of the board, but.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) quoted figures showing that as the result of the tariff policy of this Government employthe Parliament ment in the secondary industries has increased.

It is paying no heed to criticism, but is steering between the Scylla and Charybdis of extreme tariff thought, with the best results generally for the Commonwealth. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked that some action be taken in respect of the report of the Tariff Board on cotton yarn, but I would point out that there must be a beginning and ending of the schedule somewhere. The reports of the Tariff Board have seldom been delayed by the Government, and in nearly every instance they have been tabled in both Houses of the Parliament as soon as received. Of course, some delay must take place. Whether anything can be done for the cotton industry by way of classification, as the honourable member for Cook( Mr Riley) has suggested, will be ascertained when the report has been received.

If particular industries are misrepresented, those concerned with them have plenty of opportunity, through the press and otherwise, of placing the facts before the public. The honourable member for Riverina( Mr Nock) suggested that an economic adviser would be useful to the Tariff Board to consider the effect of tariff alterations upon industry generally, and, I presume, in particular, upon primary industry. I feel that there is a great deal of merit in the suggestion. the board should confine its activities to inquiring into secondary industries; it might extend tbe scope of its inquiries to embrace primary industries also. .This phase of the work need not be undertaken by the same personnel, but if some economic inquiry of this kind were held there would be less guesswork when help to primary industries had to he considered.

If the right kind of man is selected he should be able to do a great deal to encourage more friendly relations between the two dominions. been, for some years past, a good deal of ill-feeling in commercial circles in Australia and New Zealand, and that feeling had reached its height at the time the late MrH . E. Pratten, then Minister for Trade and Customs, visited New Zealand in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a trade agreement. I believe that a better feeling already prevails as a result of the visit of Senator MassyGreene; who was successful in arranging an agreement between the two dominions. As I have stated previously, I was not satisfied with all the articles of that agreement, particularly those relating to citrus fruits, the wine industry and certain Australian manufactures, but I recognize that it would be impossible to negotiate a trade agreement which would please everybody. now been ratified by the Parliaments of New Zealand and Australia, and I should like to know'when it is proposed to bring it into operation, and when a trade representative is to be appointed. Will the trade representative who is to be appointed to Batavia spend all his time there, or will he be expected to represent Australian interests in the surrounding islands? I should also like to know what the office is expected to cost. To what extent has the Minister followed the policy which was under consideration by the last Government of appointing cadets in the commercial intelligence branch of the Department of Commerce? It should be possible to train well-educated, intelligent young men in the art of commercial diplomacy, and in matters relating to the trade of Australia with other countries, so that they would be able to render valuable service to Australia in overseas fields. While the last Government was in office, a trade representative was appointed to Canada, and, from reports I have read, he appears to have been to pass certain legislation. doing useful work. Will the Minister inform us to what extent he has been successful in developing additional trade between the two countries, especially as a result of the CanadianAustralian trade agreement and of the Ottawa agreement? From the experience I gained during the six and a half months as Acting Minister for Commerce-o r of Markets and Transport, as it was then calledI Unfortunately there has formed the opinion that Australian trade representatives in other countries perform most useful work. I sliould like the Minister to give an assurance that legislation providing for the stabilization of butter marketing arrangements will be introduced before the Christmas recess. Honourable members will recall that this subject was considered at a conference of State Ministers of Agriculture, as a result of which certain recommendations were made to the Commonwealth Government.' Both the Queensland and Victorian Parliaments have passed legislation necessary for the carrying out of common marketing plans, and the Parliament of New South Wales is, I believe, about to Â»as similar legislation. But complementary The agreement has federal legislation is necessary to give the dairying industry the power to control the marketing of its produce, and to obtain for butter a price that will cover a fair cost of production and give a reasonable return to the producers of it. As I stand for the protection of Australian",26,Department Or Trade And Customs
109,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [4.27],""" against the manufacturers of other countries in which cheap labour is employed for long hours, to be consistent, I must also stand for the granting of similar protection to primary producers. The dairying industry is a most important one. Dependent upon it, either directly or indirectly, are 600,000 persons. Those who are engaged in it are forced to accept a price that is based largely upon world parity. The Australian worker is not asked to accept the wage that is paid in Japan or England, although unfortunately unemployment has forced many workers down to a standard of living lower than that. That, however, is not in accordance with the ideas of the Australian Labour party. Honourable members on this side believe that those who are engaged in the dairying industry are entitled to the redress of their just grievances. The Labour party has in its platform a definite plank which provides for Australian-wide co-operative marketing for dairy-farmers and other sections of the primary producers. This is a live question among the dairy-farmers, of whom, there is a large number in my electorate. All that I want the Minister for Commerce to do at this juncture is to promise definitely that he will introduce this legislation before the'Christmas adjournment. statement in answer to a question. make it, and shall not be satisfied until I have obtained a definite assurance from him. from this side of the chamber a few days ago by the Attorney-General( Mr( Mr Stewart) now holds. Those who Latham) led me to believe that the Government did not intend to introduce this legislation during the present session. The Minister for Commei^ce may be able to disabuse my mind of what may be an erroneous impression. I admit that the question of what is to be done in regard to the wheat industry is a complex one. I became associated with it, as Acting Minister for Markets, while I was Minister for Trade and Customs, and found it very troublesome. I consider that the Government has delayed a decision too long. The manufacturers, so that they may compete matter may have been considered at the party meetings held to-day, and probably the Minister will be able to make an announcement of the Government's intentions. Wheat is now being harvested in the Riverina and other parts of New South Wales, and immediate steps will have to be taken by the Government if the growers^are to be assisted during the present season. Whatever may be done for those who have been able to produce wheat, some measure of relief should be given on an acreage basis, through the States, to those who have not obtained a fair crop. It is unfortunate that wheat is grown in certain parts on unsuitable land. I do not think that it should be the policy of the Commonwealth to bolster up inefficient production, or to encourage the growing of wheat on land that is not suited to its production. I should, however, like the Minister to indicate when the necessary legislation is to be introduced. Can he say that the Government will take action before the present session ends? If so, when? I desire to have a reply to-day. -On e of the most unsatisfactory aspects of the administration of the Department of Commerce is its absolute failure to arrive at a decision in regard to the attitude that should be adopted towards the heavily-subsidized Matson Line of Steamers. It is just on three years since this matter was first brought under the notice of the Commonwealth Government. Its origin dates back to the time when the exThe reply given to a question ningham) occupied the position which the honourable member for Parramatta are most deeply interested in this matter are the workers in maritime industries, and my representations are made on their behalf. These men realize that, sooner or later, their employment will be jeopardized if this highly-subsidized American line is allowed to continue to trade withoiit hindrance or interference on the Australian coast. They feel that companies whose vessels are registered in Australia, will transfer their registration to another part of the world. In this connection reference might be made to the Union Steamship Company, which I .",27,Department Of Commerce

The operations of the Matson Line constitute a real danger to Australian seamen, stewards, butchers, and others engaged in seafaring occupations. body known aa the Maritime Council, through its secretary, Mr Tudehope, of the Marine Butchers' organization, has repeatedly made representations on the matter to the Oommonwealth Government. The last occasion was a little more than a month ago, when a deputation waited upon the Minister, who said that he would f a r sooner argue the case from the point of view of the unionists, than attempt to j u s t i fy in any way the continued inroads upon Australian maritime trade. In response to the that were made, the Government replied that the matter would be discussed at Ottawa, where the representatives representatives of New Zealand and Great Britain. action has not been taken. said that it was necessary for further consultations Economic Conference, or at other conferences which were projected at about that time. That period has passed, and we are still iu the same position. we were told that the matter would be further considered and discussed with the New Zealand Government. Somehow or other, nothing definite can be arrived at. It appears to me that the longer the matter remains undecided the more secure will the American subsidized become. prepared to employ methods similar to those adopted by the TJnited States of America to prevent the exploitation of Australian who are affected will have to accept the decision whether they approve of it or not, and will have to devise means outside of governmental with the problem. I put it frankly to the Minister that the time has long gone by for a definite pronouncement ject. In order that the committee have some idea of the manner in which the American system works, aud of the extent to which the Australian being monopolized, I read the following ilr. Beasleif. extract from the San Francisco Times of the 9th October, 1933 :In 1929, under the Jones-White act, Mr Herbermann set out to borrow $7,122,750 from the Shipping Board to build his four "" E x "" A passenger liners. He got the cash at less than 1 per cent, interest.' When his Government loans begau to gall, ho went to Washington to get them extended, spent $11,300 in 30 days on "" entertainment."" The Shipping Board's comptroller recommended disapproval of the extonslion,, bqkause Export Steamship owed $3,952,000, had assets of only $1,172,199. Robert Patterson Lamont, then Secretary of Commerce, wrote the Shipping Board that he saw no objection in the 3->to-l balance-sheet. In 1928, Mr Herbermann procured for his line a ten-year ocean mail contract at $1,044,000 per year. When his new ships began to operate Walter Brown, then Postmaster-General, increased this subsidy to $2,185,000 per year. But Export Steamship was not overburdened with postal charge. From August, 1928, to June, 1929, its ships representations carried precisely 3 lb. of mail, a cost to the first Government of $234,980 per lb. In 1929 it carried 1 lb. of mail for $115,335. For fiscal Australian 1931 it carried 8 lb. of mail for $125,820 per lb. Its defence was that ocean mail contracts would consult with the are only a legal pretext for an outright subsidy, that its ships always had cargo space Ottawa has come and gone, yet reserved for mail, but that the Post Office It was then Department assigned them no more than enough to keep their contract valid. to be held at the World 'Senator Black estimated that Export Steamship Corporation, the first of 50 shipping companies on the committee's list for scrutiny, bad received federal subsidies and benefits worth $2f>.(if.3.151 since 1928.

The Government must be aware of the position, which is common knowledge, and should show without further delay just, wliere it stands in the trade, let it say so. Those matter.

The shipping companies and the box-makers lost nothing, but the growers lost everything. In July, the Orestes and the Cormorm took 14,000 cases each, on which shipments the Government lost is. a case. Again, the shipping companies aud boxmakers lost nothing, and the grower received-nothing . The trouble was that the market was glutted as a result of the aotion of Spain and Brazil, whose growers were exporting under a bounty of from 3s. 6d. to 4s. a case, which had been allowed to them as a set off against the disadvantages from which they were suffering from the operation of the Ottawa agreement. It is desirable that honourable members should pay more attention than they have done hitherto to the real , effects of the Ottawa agreement on some of our smaller primary industries, which are, at present, passing through very trying experiences. It should be borne in mind that growers of citrus and other fruits always have to wait for many years for the first returns from their orchards, and this makes it all the more unfortunate for them when they get ho return from a crop. I suppose the citrus-growers work,, on the average, just as hard as the dairy-producers, but, unlike the dairy-farmers, they have to work for a number of years before their operations become profitable. I was informed only yesterday, that the mandarin-growers of New South ""Wales have been instructed by the State authorities to destroy all the fruit that remained on their trees at the end of October. This order was, no doubt, issued for the protection of the growers, for, if the fruit were left to hang on the trees, it is quite probable that pests would flourish, and cause the growers additional distress. It is distinctly creditable to many growers that, when they saw that their fruit was likely to be left on their hands, they took steps to distribute it free Mr Beasley. in the thickly-populated areas of Sydney. It agreed to provide In some instances, tbe cost of transport was borne by others who are deserving of the hearty thanks of every section of the community. The final consignment to the overseas market to which I shall refer were made by the Clan MacDougali and the Orama, October, respectively, with 13,000 cases of fruit, which were confidently expected to show a net return of about 5s. a case. Tho shipments, which resulted in a total loss to the growers, in the first two months totalled 53,000 cases. The reduced enthusiasm of the growers resulted in their sending consignments totalling only 38,000 cases in the following three months. As the growers had failed to obtain any return for their early shipments, it was natural for them not to be too hopeful about the later shipments. I have often heard the Minister for Commerce say that business methods should be applied by the Government when it engaged in any commercial enterprise, and during his political campaign before he entered this Parliament he frequently eluded governments for a lack of initiative; but now the honourable gentleman has himself had experience which may somewhat alter his outlook. No doubt the Minister has learned that people are frequently able to do things in ordinary private business that they cannot do in government business. learned that. I should like to have the same authority in government business as I have in my own private business undertakings. able gentleman will now have a little more sympathy than formerly with some of his political opponents, who have been responsible for administering certain government business undertakings, and have had to face even greater difficulties than ho is facing. ences as the Minister has recently passed through which do much to help honourable members opposite to appreciate common difficulties which in the case of Labour Governments are sometimes more extensive.

119,Mr Beasley,"It is such experiMinister will acquit me of any desire to criticize him unfairly, because of the difficult circumstances in which he now finds himself. After all, these primary producers were led to believe that, if business methods were adopted in the marketing of their products, everything would be well, and their interests would be safeguarded. They have now found that, in spite of the so-called business methods adopted by this Government they are still in great difficulties. I am putting forward the case for these producers, because I believe that end of the season is reached. I believe it is desirable, in the best interests of the country, that they should be helped; but I am also concerned about the interests of my own electorate, for the greater the volume of primary products shipped overseas the better it is for my constituents who are interested in work on the waterfront. I am, therefore, on this occasion speaking directly for both primary producers and workers generally. I hope that the Minister will make a satisfactory reply to the important questions that I have asked him regarding the Matson steamship line, which is being heavily subsidized by the Government of the United States of America, and the citrus-growers, who are being ruined by the difficulty in marketing theii products. wish to refer briefly to the important part that the Department' of Commerce is playing in the control of our exporting industries. I believe that if the same degree of interference occurred in secondary industries that is now occurring in exporting primary industries the manufacturers of Australia would complain bitterly. I do not, wish to say anything disparaging of the Minister for Commerce( Mr Stewart), for I believe that he is carrying out his duties remarkably well in the face of many difficult problems. have no doubt that in consequence of the I direct particular attention to the mutton and lamb exporting industry. I understand that under the Ottawa agreement the exports of mutton and lamb from Australia this year are to be limited to 165,000,000 lb. In 1920, our exports of mutton and lamb totalled 246,000,000 lb. I am afraid that this year a lot. of mutton and lamb will be left on our exporters' hands after our export quota has been reached. What, is to happen to it? This year New South Wales has so far exported 64,000,000 Va. and Victoria 79,000,000 lb. of mutton aud lamb, leaving 13,000,000 lb. and 25,000,000 lb. respectively, for each State to reach its quota. It may be said that we are not much more than half way through the export season. This has been rather a late year for lambs, and as S4 per cent, of our exports consist of lamb it appears to me that great difficulties will face this industry before the that after the Government agreed to a restriction to 165,000,000 lb. under the Ottawa agreement, it made auother agreement for an additional curtailment of a small amount. I do not know whether any agreementhas been made to cover any period beyond the end of the 1933 season, but I hope not. No doubt the provisions of the Ottawa agreement covering the control of the export of mutton and lamb were advantageous to Australia, and I have nothing to say against them, but, in general, the less government control there is in our exporting industries the better it is for the country. The Government has entered into an international agreement for the restriction of the exportation of wheat. I believe that it was wholly wrong for any agreement to he made for the restriction of the production or exportation of wheat. If mankind could control the weather, there might be nothing wrong in controlling wheat production, but if the harvest should fail in only two of the principal wheat-producing countries of the world there would be a wlieat famine. If is bad enough to be starved in a time of plenty, but to be starved through the artificial restriction of production would be a calamity of the greatest magnitude. I weather during the last week or two a load of anxiety has been taken off the. mind of the Minister, for the wheat yield of Australia has undoubtedly been seriously affected. Had it not been so the Government would have been forced to buy anything from 20,000,000 to 30,000,000 bushels of wlieat. Howi t would have found the money to do so I do not know, nor do I know what it",31,Department Of Commerce
120,Mr Gibson (Corangamite) [5.12],"I would have done with the wlieat that it purchased. The Government should have declined to enter into any agreement for the restriction of wheat exports. If the wheat merchants and pools operating throughout Australia would make provision for the storage of the wheat and issue certificates upon which the banks may make advances to the wheat-growers the wheat could be held; but when governments enter into ihe business and begin building up huge reserves these reserves are always in the minds of the buyers, and make it difficult to dispose of future harvests. I ask the Minister to inform me what any benefit accruing to any one. It is the position will be when onr export good to see our people making use of quota of mutton and lamb has been tourist steamers to travel freely from reached.

I hope that the Minister will be able at no distant date to assure the representatives of Tasmania that there will be some permanence of freedom in the communications between Tasmania and the mainland. should like to have from the Ministerf o r Commerce( Mr Stewart) a statement regarding the Government's proposals for the stabilization of butter marketing. The dairying industry has, undoubtedly, suffered greatly during the last twelve or eighteen months. The price of butter to-day is below the cost of production. Each State has different methods of marketing and organization. I understand that the Dairy Export Control Board has been in communication with the Minister for Commerce who has promised to introduce a bill dealing with"" the dairying industry before the Parliament rises for the Christmas vacation. No one is more capable of handling the dairying industry than those engaged in it . Some of the States are large exporters of butter. Queensland exports about 75 per cent, of its production. The stabilization of the industry will assure a permanent market to the producers and enable them to receive a fair return for their labour. The moat industry is also in a serious position. Our big exporting industries, such as the butter, meat, and wool industries have been looking to the Department of ComThe people who merce for some assistance in respect of marketing, and a number of people engaged in those industries have been wondering what is really, the policy of the department, because up to date, it has not' justified its existence. I hope that the Minister will extend to the meat and wool industries tlie marketing facilities that it .is intended to extend to the butter industravelling facilities. We try. Queensland is a large producer of meat, but the graziers of that State are not permitted to send their product into New South Wales. Mr P. A. Brown, the secretary of the United Graziers Association, Queensland, has forwarded to me. a letter in which he complains of fees and rates charged on meat entering the metropolitan abattoirs area of New South Wales. The regulation setting out the charges was framed by the New South Wales Metropolitan Meat Board, and I am bringing this matter under the notice of",33,Fakes To Tasmania

The representatives took strong exception to the fees provided in the regulation, as they considered same unnecessary and unwarranted, and an unreasonable charge for the services rendered. It was pointed out that the fees must be ultimately borne by the growers, thereby reducing the price per head to them. The representatives strongly urge on you an early consideration of this impost of fees, and trust that the regulation, which certainly hampers interstate trade, w ill be repealed.

Action should be taken by the Commonwealth to prevent _a State from enforcing regulations which interfere with interstate free trade. On the 26th October, 1932, the Commonwealth Wool Inquiry Committee furnished to the Government a report containing many important recommendations in regard to the. marketing of wool. In 1913, the freight charge on wool between"" Australia and the United Kingdom was fd. per. lb., but, at the present time it is no less than 1.062d. per lb. The committee recommended that the Mr Riordan. Government should take action to have shipping freights reduced, and also railway freights in those States in which they were too high. Present freight charges were fixed when wool was selling at peak .prices, but last year wool was selling for as little as 6d. per lb., and there is no certainty that the improved prices of to-day will be maintained. Important 'concessions have been made to the shipping companies by way of taxation reductions, and the Government should ensure that some of the benefits of those remissions are passed on to the wool exporters. In Vietoria and Queensland, railway freight charges have recently been considerably reduced, and the shipping companies might well follow that lead. Shearing ancl other labour charges in connection with the production of wool have been reduced by 30 per cent., but shipping charges are unaltered. Moreover, some of the firms which handle wool have been making profits and adding to their reserves during the whole period of the depression, which seems to indicate that their handling charges have been unnecessarily high. If they do not reduce these charges the Department of Commerce might be able to arrange a sys'tem by which the growers could, market their own wool for considerably less than they now pay to the wool brokers. The Government has adopted the recommendation of the Wool Inquiry Committee by reducing the land tax, and it should also follow up its recommendations in regard to reduced freights on wool. I am sure that those engaged in the dairying industry will appreciate the Minister's promise that legislation will be brought down this session to cover the marketing of dairy products, but I hope that the Minister will follow this up by doing something to assist the other two great primary industries, namely, meat and wool. ter for Commerce) |5.42'| I was pleased to hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fordo) express approval of the Government's policy to appoint trade representatives in various overseas countries.

The honourable member also asked for an assurance that legislation dealing with butter marketing would be introduced during this session. In reply to a question asked yesterday, I . gave a definite assurance that such legislation would be introduced before the House adjourned, and I now repeat that assurance. It is the intention of the Government to introduce within the next day or two legislation along the lines of the Dried Fruits Act of 192S. The only request made of the 'Commonwealth Government in this connection is that we should introduce legislation prohibiting interstate trade in butter unless the prescribed quota of tlft> total production of the licensee is sent overseas. The wording of the bill will follow very closely that of the Dried Fruits Act, and the measure will be introduced and, we hope, passed through Parliament within the next few days. Queensland is the only State which has, so far, passed legisForeign Office with American represenlation in connection with butter marketing. I understand that the necessary-bill is practically through the Victorian Parliament, and tliat a. similar measure will be introduced into the Parliament of New South ""Wales on Thursday next. Commonwealth Government will not await the passage of the necessary legislation through all the State Parliaments, but will place its own complementary act on the statute-book, and allow it to remain in abeyance until after certain negotiations have taken place with the operative by proclamation. The honourable member for ""West Sydney( Mr Beasley) complained of the activities of American subsidized shipping lines, and mentioned particularly the Matson Line. He referred to a statement which I made to a deputation which waited upon me in Sydney when I said that I would much rather be supporting the case of the deputation against the American shipping companies than contesting it. I do not retract one word of The staff to be what I then said. Unfortunately, however, -the remedy for the trouble is not vernment is prepared to play its part in trying to correct the position, but no finality has yet been reached. ""We frequently hear that the Government of New Zealand has already passed the necessary legislation to check the competition of this shipping line, and is only awaiting the passage of similar legislation by -the Commonwealth in order to take action. That statement is entirely incorrect. As a matter of fact, the New Zealand legislation, to which reference has been made, is merely a section of the Customs Act, and dates back to 1908, which was before tliere was any Matson Shipping Line, or any subsidized shipping problem. A l though the New Zealand legislation dates back 25 years, it is, I understand, based on a section in the British maritime law of 1382. Therefore, the suggestion that Australia, through its reluctance to pass the necessary legislation, has been hampering New Zealand, cannot be substantiated. The Government is prepared to do whateveris necessary to meet the position, and we have asked the Government of New Zealand to co-operate with us. We have had conversations through the tatives, and we are hoping 'that, long as the delay has been, the remedy will eventually be applied. The The honourable member for West Sydney took the Government to task for what he describes as its callous indifference to the interests of the citrus fruit-growers. He said that, for some time after the situation became acute, the Government took no action at all, and that when it did move its action was inadequate. That is not a fair statement of the position. Honourable members will recall that the embargo by New Zealand on the importation of. citrus fruits from Australia very seriously affected the Australian industry, particularly the New South Wales section. At one time Australia exported 250,000 bushel cases of citrus fruits to New Zealand annually, but due to circumstances over which we had no control, New Zealand imposed an embargo which meant the sudden and complete stoppage of that trade. It therefore became necessary for the industry and the Government to collaborate in finding other markets. I am happy to be able to say that we have been very successful in that, effort. It is true, as the honourable member said, that the first shipment of citrus fruits to the United Kingdom-to which he referred as the Olranlo shipment-arrived on the London market. simultaneously with the arrival of 200,000 cases of Spanish fruit. That was a misfortune which neither the industry nor the Government could have foreseen, and the result of it was that prices were not so satisfactory as were desired. It is a pity, however, that the honourable member confined his remarks to this and one other shipment. been better informed had it been given particulars of all the shipments that have been made. For example, the prices obtained for the Buteshire shipment only this week, not only released the Government from its guarantee, but also satisfactorily remunerated casemakers and others associated with the citrus industry, and proved most profitable to the citrusgrowers themselves. The suggestion that the Government is indifferent to the welfare of these growers is entirely negatived by the written testimony of accredited representatives of the industry. I have endeavoured to secure, but have beeu unable"" to do so, a letter that was received justification for making any claim upon from the secretary of the Federal Citrus Growers Organization, in which he effusively commends and thanks the Government for the very great assistance,it has rendered to the industry in having guaranteed the whole of the expense on the fruit that has been shipped overseas. Prior to the application of the New Zealand embargo, the largest quantity of fruit shipped to the United Kingdom in onÂ© year was approximately 14,000 Mr Stewart. bushels. This year, however, the shipments have approached a total of 80,000 bushels. It . is hoped that the London market will prove a regular and not a transitory one, and that our shipments of fruit to it will be not only maintained at the present level but even increased. made in the Canadian market. with the consignment of citrus fruits to Canada, especially to the eastern provinces of that dominion, make the venture economically almost impossible. A few thousand cases have been sent to the Pacifio coast, but there is a definite limit to the absorptive capacity of that market. With a view to safeguarding itself, and ensuring that the efforts of the producers will not. be wasted, the Government has also contributed the sum of Â£500 towards tlie expense of sending to the United Kingdom a representative of the industry, to watch the arri val of ' shipments, and investigate the possibilities of developing additional markets on tbe continent of Europe. That officer, who was The committee would have selected by the industry itself, has already sent to Australia valuable reports concerning the issues to which I have referred. The honourable gentleman also made passing reference to the mandaringrowers. I happen to know that there has been, a definite attempt to trade on the disaffection of mandarin-growers, particularly in the electorate represented by the Minister for Commerce. But what is the position ? Has the Governanent been . indifferent' to the condition of these growers? After all, this is. essentially a State matter. The only the federal authority is the unfortunate effect of the New Zealand embargo. The Oommonwealth Government, however, has not. drawn very carefully the line between State and Federal responsibility. It has not even asked the State Government to assist in the ratio of 4 to 1, which would be perfectly warranted, but has suggested the contribution of Â£1 for Â£1 to an amount, of Â£10,000. Appreciate help could be given to the mandarin industry if Â£20,000 were available for the",35,Fakes To Tasmania

125,Mr Stewart,"The costs associatedpurpose. I have had furnished to me ample evidence of the appreciation of the industry of that action of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson) made some reference to the restrictions imposed on the export of meat. operates against the export of mutton and lamb, to which the honourable member specifically referred, is that contained in the Ottawa agreement, by the terms of which the Commonwealth undertook that during 1933 the exports would not exceed the quantity exported during the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1932. That was the peak year of Australia's shipments of mutton and lamb to the United Kingdom, and it is a compliment to Australia's ambassadors at Ottawa that they were able to secure it as the datum year. It is true that in several of tbe States, the quota fixed so as to conform to that requirement has been exceeded; but it would be perfectly untrue to suggest that any shipment of mutton aud lamb which could have left Australia has been prevented from so doing. Some of the States have not. exported to the l i m it of their quota, and it has been competent for my department to make adjustments as between the States. I say officially that it is not anticipated that one carcass w ill be held in Australia as the result of the operation of that provision of the Ottawa agreement. agreement terminates on the 31st. December next, and any ship which leaves Australian waters after that date w ill be right enthusiastic in regard to the agreement outside its ambit. Therefore, there are only two or three weeks in which mutton and lamb could be placed on board ship with any risk of the vessel leaving Australian shores before the end of the year. The honourable member for Corangamite also referred to the participation of the Commonwealth in the International Wheat Agreement, and for the -first, time ""the agreement has been condemned as one which should not have been made.. It is perfectly obvious that the honourable gentleman has had no caucus talk with other members of the party to which he belongs. From tbem I have received congratulations on the part played by the Government in this matter, not because they like the agreement-the y do not like it any more than the Government does-bu t because they appreciate the circumstances which rendered participation in it expedient. I venture to suggest that, with the depreciation of American currency, the time is coming when even the Australian The only restriction which critics of the agreement w ill change their tune. Australia has recently acquired in the East a very valuable business in flour and wheat. The entry of Australia into that market excluded from it a large quantity of American wheat and flour. That was made possible by the depreciation of Australian currency in comparison with that -of the United States of America. So long as that position obtained, so long had Australia a very good chance of maintaining its position in the East; but with the depreciation of the American dollar below sterling, and its close approximation to Australian currency, that advantage is likely to be lost, and the provision of the International Wheat Agreement which binds the United States of America not to export mora than 47,000,000 bushels of wheat this year, and a corresponding quantity next year, may yet prove most valuable to Australia. If the relation of the two currencies were altered in the direction towards which they are now tending, ancl the United States of America were free to unload 400,000,000 bushels, the position of AusAs a matter of fact, the tralian wheat exporters would be very serious. Consequently, I repeat that even some of those who have not been at all may yet live to change their tune. The . honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin) has made some reference to the part played by the Department of Commerce in connection with the exemption from the operation of the navigation laws of certain tourist traffic to Tasmania. I am pleased to confirm his statement that the very large number of tourists who travel to Tasmania in exempt ships has apparently had no effect on the existing interstate services, which, in fact, have shown increases over the corresponding period of the last tourist season. ' It is true, as the honourable member has suggested,""that the Government is making provision, and is at : present conducting negotiations, for the improvement of the quality of the permanent interstate service between the mainland and Tasmania. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) devoted the greater part of his speech to the condemnation of certain restrictions that have been imposed by the Abattoirs Board in Sydney on the importation into that city of Queensland meat. This, of course, is a matter that not only is not referred to in these Estimates-, but also is entirely outside the control of the Oommonwealth. may legislate in regard to interstate trade. ferentiation against interstate trade; the restrictions apply equally to Queensland meat and to meat from other districts in New South Wales. I have no doubt that the honourable member would find quite a number of 'members of the committee prepared to join with him in protesting to the Government of New South Wales against the conditions that have been imposed. refer to the necessity for the compulsory installation of wireless equipment on intra-state vessels. This matter has been under review since about 1920, when the late Mr Pratten was Minister for Trade and Customs. The different States were then invited to say whether they were willing to hand over the necessary powers to the Commonwealth, but, unfortunately, a number of them were not prepared to do so. The recent foundering of a coastal vessel, with an unfortunate loss of life, points to the necessity for immediate action. the recent inquiry? merce set up a departmental committee, the CommonAvealth can only exercise which took evidence in regard to this legislative control over interstate shipmatter and others, and presented a reping. We very readily acceded to the port; but no action has been taken upon request of the Premiers in question with it, although I understand that there has the result that the committee has already since been a Premiers Conference. There reported upon the installation of wireless is to be another Premiers Conference iu respect of both interstate and intraearly next year, and I should like the state shipping. The report upon intra-state Minister for Commerce( Mr Stewart) shipping has been forwarded to the to state whether he intends to make Premiers with a view to ascertaining what an endeavour to have the Commonare their intentions in connection with it. wealth vested with power that would enable it to protect the lives of seamen. The sinking of theChristina Fraser, and many other vessels within recent years, has been responsible for rather serious loss of life. The Governments of the States are anxious to obtain Commonwealth assistance when it is a question of protecting primary industries, but are rather diffident about handing over to the Commonwealth the powei to protect human lives. I hope that they will not further impede this essential reform, and that no time will be lost by the GoCommonwealth vernment in compelling the installation of wireless on intra-state vessels, with the object of protecting human life. for Commerce) [6.5] -It is true that, following on the loss of the Christina Fraser, I appointed a committee to investigate the desirableness or otherwise of equipping small vessels of that type with wireless, so that they might be able to meet possible emergencies. In Australia our existing legislation in regard to the provision of wireless on shipping is at least as advanced as that of any other country in the world. It provides that all vessels carrying passengers and all other vessels of more than 1,600 tons register must be equipped with certain types of wireless. But the Government is not prepared to discriminate between the lives of passengers on ships and the lives of crews of other than passenger vessels, and it is because Ministers believe there is room for improvement in this direction that the committee in question was set up. That committee has submitted a report to the Government. During the currency of its sittings, the Premiers of New South ambit of its inquiries should be extended",37,Fakes To Tasmania

Consequently, anything the Minister can do by way of inducing the shipping companies to provide them with cheaper freights may possibly enable them to make a profit. Not long ago, I read a statement that a shipper of a hundred cases of apples, had received a debit note of Â£5 odd for them. That amount, added to his cost of production, meant a loss of Â£25. During the past season, both freight and commission charges have been maintained, which means that all the concessions have been made by the grower. If the Government could provide for cheaper transport for our apples-for a freight comparable with that which obtained in 1914:-it would be of great assistance to our apple exporters. for that fresh f r u it exporters from the Commonwealth have not participated in the reduction of freights to ihe same extent exporters. That circumstance, however, is not altogether dissociated from the fact that the industry is one which cannot speak with one articulate voice. But, if the men engaged in this industry f a i l to benefit by their experience, I shall be very much surprised. other forms, of export have benefited by appreciable reductions of. freight, consequent upon an overseas conference between representatives of the Transport Association and the shipping interests, our apple exporters have not so benefited. In the first instance they were refused any freight concessions at a l l ; honourable member for but, as the result of intervention by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and myself, the matter was re-opened, a further conference took pl!Â»ce, and they were offered a reduction of 2d. a case upon all shipments made in June, and 3d. a case upon all shipments made in July. Of course, those are the lightest shipping months during the whole export season, so that the concession is not so great as it might appear at first sight."" Buti t is something that has been accomplished as the result of government intervention between the parties. Ministers, however, are not satisfied, and, following upon our representations to -the H i gh Commissioner, only last week, Mr Bruce had an interview with certain shipping representatives in London. He has since regretfully in formed us that the shipping interests are unable to grant anything further than the concession to which I have just referred, namely, a reduction of'2d. a case on all fresh-fruit shipments made in June, and of 3d. a case on all shipments made in July. But there is still some hope for the f r u it industry, because negotiati o n s are again proceeding between the Apple and Pear Council and the shipowners, which we hope will result in a furthe r concession in respect of shipments of f r u it .

The sum of Â£250 is set aside for "" World Conference ou Reduction and Limitation of Armaments,"" whereas Â£3,497 was expended on the same item last year. Does that indicate indifference on the part of the Government towards the reduction aud limitation of armaments? An amount of Â£150 is to be appropriated for "" Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Unemployment,"" for which purpose Â£89 was expended last year. I do not know whether this committee consists of the former secretary of the Committee for Public Works, but the problems that it is endeavouring to solve deserve most, serious consideration by the Government. Will the Minister state whether the committee nas submitted roports or recommendations, and if so, what effect has been given to them? I realize that Cabinet Ministers are kept busy with the affairs of their departments. So many matters engage their attentions that there is a danger of the problems associated with unemployment, being neglected unless some one is definitely deputed to attempt their solution. Despite the magniloquent election promises mado by Ministers that they would cure the ills of unemployment if returned to office, the Government has done practically nothing. Au amount of Â£5,000 is to be expended on the development of the fishing industry. Obviously that will place very few in employment. The Government -recently approved the expenditure of Â£15,000 for the construction of a fisheries ri'Search vessel, which again can do little to relieve unemployment. Something must be done by the Government to give a fillip to existing industries and encourage the creation of new ones.

In many instances beneficiaries under wills cannot pay probate duties, and workers cannot refund to the Government money claimed in respect of the property of their parents who were pensioners. Every effort should be made to rehabilitate the coal industry. I regret the callous attitude adopted by the Government to this industry, as shown by a reply given to me some time ago by the Attorney-General( Mr Latham), who said that tlie industry had cut its own throat, because the coal-owners and the coal-miners had combined for the purpose of fleecing the public. I disagreed w it h the Minister when he made that statement, and I again repudiate his suggestion Eveni f the industry had cut its own throat, is the National Government entitled to allow it to bleed to death? Many factors have contributed to the disaster which has overtaken this industry. The introduction of hydro-electric schemes, and the increasing use of oilburning boilers and internal combustion engines have reduced the demand for coal. Foreign fuel is imported for industrial and transport purposes, although a suitable fuel can be extracted from either coal or oil shale, of which there are enormous quantities in this country.

Every mining student-ther e should ""then be forced to give attention to the known resources of fuel oil to meet future gold, zinc, beet sugar, wine, galvanized cotton and other industries Why should ters aud their supporters declare their nationalized, but, as that is not the policy that wealthy foreign oil interests would endeavour to stifle any such, project because if the process were placed on an economic basis they would be unable auy longer to exploit the people of this country to the amount of Â£18,000,000 per annum for its requirements of fuel oil. the honourable member is directing his remarks to the vote for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The honourable member must confine his remarks to that item. oil from Australian coal resources is definitely linked up with the Avork of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I therefore contend that my remarks are relevant to the item under discussion. An adequate supply of fuel oil would have an important effect on the transport industry in Australia, and measures for the production of that fuel would not only do much to restore the coal-mining industry-but would also assist in keeping our transport services active in the event of war in the Pacific interfering with our overseas fuel supplies. We cannot afford to see it .languishing further. tion of our known resources of fuel oil would provide more employment and thus .take a great number of workers off the dole. The Government may argue that it is not concerned with the dole payments iu the various States, but, as it makes grants to some of the States, it is, indirectly, helping them to maintain their unemployed. If , then, we could provide our own requirements of fuel oil, we should be able to keep in Australia the Â£18,000,000 which we send abroad in payment for foreign oil supplies and, at the same time, we would revive the coal mining industry. The condition of the mining districts at the present time is a tragedy not only to the miners themselves but also to the business people and tradesmen. If Ministers or any of their supporters paid a visit to some of the districts they would, I am sure, be distressed at seeing the condition of the people. In many cases homes which the miners treasure are being taken over by the banks. It. may be news to some honourable members that 85 per cent, of the people in mining districts own, or prior to the depression were purchasing, their own homes. It is tragic to see the look of abject despair on the care-worn faces of so many of these people who have had to hand over their homes to the batiks because they could not meet the payment? due on them. The banks are waxing fat, and piling up profits at their expense. This should induce honourable members to support any project to revive the coal-mining industry. I sincerely hope that this Government will bring forward a practical proposal to save the industry and thus bring contentment to hundreds of thousands of people in this countiy. I support the appeal of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) to the Government to take definite action for the rehabilitation of the coal-mining industry. The obvious facts of this essential industry point, more perhaps than anything else, to the absolute failure of the existing system of capitalistic control, and re-organization upon, the basis of nationalization is required if the industry is to be saved. I know, however; that, it is futile to make any such suggestion to this Government. The placing of this The exploitavery important public utility on the same basis as national transport is a responsibility that will have to be discharged by a Labour government. The reasons for the present desperate plight of the industry are apparent, to honourable members on this side of the House at all events. Eveni f the Government does not take the steps which the Labour party thinks it should take, we hope that, it will do something to savean industry that is down and out. It will not profit us to dwell upon the grievous mistake made by the colliery proprietors, supported by the New South Wales Government, when, some years ago, they locked-out their employees for fifteen months and surrendered what was left, of the trade which, even before that dispute had occurred, was slipping from their grasp. Now, 7,000 good citizens of the Commonwealth are idle with no hope of re-employment,' and the remainder of the employees in the industry are, for the most part, ekcing out a precarious existence on intermittent work. Every day the position becomes worse.",42,Fakes To Tasmania

141,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [8.42].,"4920 Our export markets for coal have been seized by other countries, and the problems of the industry have gradually in creased until its position to-day is serious indeed. I u the early stages, the coal industry of Australia attracted many people from the other side of the world. Many British miners came to Australia, some with their families, and settled here. Others married here, acquired homes, and reared families. trait in their character was their ability to make themselves self-reliant. They naturally looked forward to continuity of. employment because they thought that the industry was absolutely essential and would have to be maintained in all circumstances. the dark shadow 'of unemployment came over them, and many are now experiencing want and misery. These men are naturally looking to this Government for some relief. 7,000 men are affected, most of them being dependent on food relief or intermittent work. Even within the last month or two, mines that were giving f a i r l y regular for Mines in the last Labour Government employment have further curtailed their activities. That action has, of course, added to the seriousness of the position. Like the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) I have been consulted by officials of the Miners Federation, led by a gentleman against whom neither the Government nor any member of this House can point the finger of scorn. I refer to MrD . Rees, who, together with the general secretary, MrA . Teece, has appealed to me to call on this Parliament to do something to relieve the terrible misery and want existing throughout the coal belt. Mr Rees stated in a letter to meThere is both a boiling point and a limit of human endurance and tbe miners are approaching both. Reckless indifference has been shown to ithe urgent need of control over the national industry of coal. Something must be done at once if wholesale dospoilation of the workers and bankruptcy of the coal companies are to bo avoided. The whole policy of the Government seems to be one of wait and sec, while men starve and industry languishes. A few weeks ago-1 appealed to the Government to realize the urgent need of the great body of men who grow the 3tr. Beasley. Estimates [REPRESENTATIVES.] 1933-34. wheat of this country, and the present in dications are that the Government in tends to give to them some assistance. I appeal again on behalf of another great body of men, those who mine coal in Australia, and who, I consider, have a similar claim for assistance. This matter is much too serious for political consideration to enter into its discussion. No object would be served in opposing the reA rather notable quest of the lionorable member for Hunter on party political grounds because he, as a representative of the miners, is not likely to lose his seat in this Parliament. I want the Government to act, and I do not want to prejudice any action it might feel disposed to take. Therefore, I shall Unfortunately, keep to the facts and quote figures which cannot be disputed and can be checked by official records. Although the coal industry is for the most part located in New South Wales, its ramifications exOver tend in soma degree to the other States, all of which are dependent upon coal for industrial development. Mr J. M . Baddeley, as Minister of New South Wales, attempted to bring down a measure to rehabilitate the coal industry in that State. So great is the chaos existing in the industry there that a national plan in which the Commonwealth and the State Go^ vernments should loyally co-operate, is essential to meet the situation. Whilef o r political reasons some honourable members may dislike the text of the bill introduced by Mr Baddeley, the principles underlying it must be adopted ultimately because a beginning w ill have to be made on the basis of the report of the Coal Commission of New South Wales. When the measure was before the State Parliament, the greatest objection to it came apparently from the coal companies -But when the position is analysed, one wonders whether the objection came really from the shareholders who had their money invested in coal shares, or from certain holding companies and banks which by mortgage and interlocking are gradually obtaining, control of every ooal mine in the Commonwealth at bargain prices. The stock exchange quotations reveal the fact that since 1928 over Â£6,000,000 has been lost by shareholders in mining companies.

The invalid's pension, the Boldier's pension, had all been cut. It was essential to impress on the secretariat the need for so ordering its action as to secure the goodwill of the world."" He was strongly in favour of the reduction of salaries. ""When prosperity came, "" he said, "" then salaries could be raised."" It is clear that the' Australian delegation was wholeheartedly in favour of reduced expenditure. The League of Nations budget this year provided for an expenditure of Â£1,335,100, at par, which is less than that for 1932. Australia's expenditure is put down iu the Estimates before the committee at Â£54,000, but that includes the cost of exchange. For 1932, the expenditure, which, I shall assume, was about the same as for this year, amounted to Â£36,401 on a gold basis. For that year the contribution of Great Britain was Â£141,560, but actually it amounted to Â£182,000, because, in the meantime, Great Britain had gone off the gold standard, and the Â£1 sterling was then worth only from 14s. to 15s. in gold. Â£1,335,000 by the members of the League of Nations in an attempt to secure world peace is by no means excessive. After his retirement -from the Secretariat of the League of Nations, Sir Eric Drummond remarked in London that the League had been responsible for settling eight of nine major disputes which had been -referred to it. He is reported to have saidThere we're nine questions, some of which represented a serious menace to peace, and all of which contained threatening possibilities. solved the dispute directly or aided in finding a solution by peaceful means. Had the League not been able to bring about a settlement in these eases, and had other means been sought for their solution, the cost might have made the expenditure on the League look trifling. Lord Snowden, then Chancellor of the British Exchequer, pointed out in February, Mr Hughes is reported as 1930, that the Great War had left Great Britain with a debt of Â£7,000,000,000. He is reported to have said, It takes the whole-time labour of 2,000,000 workers year in and year out to produce the means to pay the annual cost of our debt service. "" We get a total of Â£520,000,000 a year -Â£.1,00 0 a minute-wliic h tlie people of Great Britain have to provide for war purposes."" According to the Manchester Guardian, "" the total war costs are estimated at Â£100,000,000,000."" Compared with those figures, Australia's contribution to the League of Nations, which is seeking to establish and maintain friendly relations between the nations, is small, indeed. Nevertheless, our delegates were justified in pressing for the greatest economy possible consistent with efficiency. In some respects it is difficult to reduce expenditure. For instance, a special committee of jurists appointed to inquire into the. salaries of League officials advised that agreements had been entered into with the officials concerned, which could not be altered unilaterally. But the committee made suggestions in regard to salaries in the future. The New Zealand delegate pointed out the high cost of living at Geneva, and said that he could not agree to the reduction of the salaries of the lower-paid officials. In addition to other expenditure, there is the cost of the upkeep of the Permanent Court of International Justice, An expenditure of comprising fifteen justicesa tribunal which has already given over 40 decisions and opinions. The expenditure on thai court cannot be curtailed to any appreciable extent. also incurred by the League of Nations in connection with health administration, and such matters as slavery, the white slave traffic, and social problems generally. Considering the nature of the work undertaken by the League, the cost to the nations is trifling. The public sliould be informed of tlie smallness of Australia's contribution. When we consider the price of a battleship, we must conclude that an annual expenditure of Â£1,335,000 to preserve world peace is amply justified. is interesting to compare the speeches of champions of the League of Nations tonight with their remarks when a proposal for an increased expenditure on armaments was before us. Some honourable gentlemen have criticized the expenditure of the League of Nations on the ground that Australia's contribution is too great; I criticize it because of the failure of the League of Nations to do what it was constituted to do. The honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom) said that the League had settled eight of the nine main disputes which had been referred to it. In my opinion, those disputes would not have gone beyond the stage they reached even if the League had not intervened, or if there had beeu no League of Nations at all. The one major dispute which the League failed to settle was the only real test of its effectivenessI refer to the dispute between China and Japan. In that disagreement, the other members of the League of Nations, so far from attempting to effect a settlement, actually exported arms and munitions to both China and Japan to enable them to continue the conflict. Those who were responsible for the formation of the League of Nations never intended that it should preserve world peace. In my opinion, the League was an amalgamation of the victorious nations engaged in the Great War, with the object of making the Treaty of Peace sigtied at Versailles more effective. A remarkable feature of Australia's membership of the League of Nations is that last year, although only Â£20,000 was voted towards the expenses of the League, Â£50,323 was expended. In other words, Expenditure is the expenditure approved by this Parliament was exceeded by 150 per cent. No government should expend money in excess of the amount authorized by Parliament. I should like to know whether Australia's increased expenditure under this heading is due to the failure of other members of the League to meet their commitments. On page 33 of the report of the Australian Delegation to the Twelfth Assembly in 1931, the following paragraphs appear under the heading, ""Reports of the Supervisory Commission "":The reports of the Supervisory Commission were presented to the Fourth Committee by M. Osusky, the Chairman, who informed the Committee that, although not critical, the financial position of the League was less favorable than at the corres]>ondiiig stages of the five previous financial periods. M . Osusky dwelt at length on the position due to unpaid contributions. For tlie first year of the League's existence there were no arrears still due. For the second aud third years, the arrears now amounted to about 170,000 Swis3 francs; for the fourth to the ninth year, they averaged 350,000 to 300,001.1 Swiss fra.iies: for the tenth year they were 1.25,000 francs; for the eleventh they were over 1,000,000; and for the twelth, 1,400,000 Swiss francs. A t the moment no State was in arrears for the first year; from the second to the tenth, not more than five; for the eleventh year, seven; and for the twelfth, fourteen, l t was urged that it would materially assist the Leaguei f the various governments could pay at least a portion of their contributions at tlie beginning of each year. As time goes on, the number of unfinancial nations increases. To-day, fourteen nations are uufinancial members of the League. Another anomaly is that one of Australia's delegates to the Thirteenth Assembly of the League of Nationsa body whose main objective is alleged to be the preservation of world peace -is to-day the spearhead of the movement in Australia for an increase of armaments. On one day he presents to this chamber a report of the proceedings at the Assembly, and on another day he rises in his place to advocate greater expenditure on armaments. If the Government believes that Australia must inevitably be involved in another war, why does it continue to expend",51,Fakes To Tasmania
156,Mr Wabd (East Sydney) [9.35],"I tmoney on .the League of Nations? If war is inevitable, the money spent on sending representatives to meetings of the League of Nations is merely a means of providing favoured Government supporters with a pleasure jaunt overseas. Other expenditure under the heading "" Miscellaneous"" includes Â£4,363 for "" Commonwealth representation Imperial Economic Committee "". I should like to know the functions of that committee. A sum of Â£250 is set down in connection with the world conference on the reduction and limitation of armaments. That item seems inconsistent with the Government's decision to increase armaments. Under the heading, "" Commonwealth representation Permanent Mandates Commission, League of Nations, 1933 "". Â£100 is to bo provided. This appears to be a new item, and I should like to hear the. Minister's explanation of it. In order to provide Commonwealth representation at minor conferences, Â£300 is included in these Estimates. The committee is entitled to some particulars of this proposed desire to refer to the proposed grant of expenditure. Commonwealth representation at the Fourteenth Assembly of the League of Nations in 1933 is estimated to cost. Â£1,000. This also is a new item of expenditure, and I ask whether it is necessary, because Australia now has a seat, on the Council of tlie League. The sum of Â£500 is to be voted for Commonwealth representation at the Eighteenth International Labour Conference at Geneva in 1934. The World Economic Conference claims Â£500 for this year. This and the other items I have mentioned shonld be explained in detail to the committee. China and Japan were members of the League when they defied its authority. It would appear tliat a good many of the members of the League accept, its decisions farmer when he is obliged to make reonly when they are favorable to their national aspirations. Japan has been given a mandate over certain territories which formerly belonged to Germany, and now claims that it received that mandate under the Treaty of Versailles, not from the League of Nations, and will, therefore, continue to control those territories the difficulty of securing standardization after 1935, when it will cease to be a member of the League. I should like to know if that is au. official statement by the Japanese authorities and, if so, what is the attitude of the Australian Goverument to Japan's claims. All of the items mentioned should be explained, so that members of the committee may have an exact knowledge of the extent to which Australia is committed, and be able to judge whether it is likely that next year's Estimates will show, as this year's have shown, that the vote has been exceeded by 150 per cent. Many honourable members must feel disgust at the appropriation on one day of an additional Â£1,500,000 for purposes of increased armaments, and on the next day of enormous sums to defray the cost of Australia's representation upon an organization which was established ostensibly to preserve peace, but which has shown itself to be incapable of achieving the results predicted of it. If it were consistent, the Government would withdraw from the League of Nations, and save at least the expenditure thus incurred. Â£3,000 to the Australian Commonwealth Association of Simplified Practice and Standards, particularly in relation to agricultural implements. This is a subject' of which I have no personal knowledge, and I shall, therefore, present to the Minister the case that has been placed before me, in the hope that he will meet the request that I have been asked to make. The Agricultural Bureau of Tasmania, an organization which embraces men who are engaged in different branches of farming operations throughout the State, has informed me that, on account of the absence of standardization, there is such a diversity of patterns of not only agricultural implements, but also the component parts of them, that a very serious additional cost is laid on the placements. I believe that there is a good deal of force in this contention, and I am confirmed in that belief by the opinion which has been expressed by a gentleman of no less eminence than Sir George Julius. From the case that has been placed before me, it would appear that is caused by the manufacturers. Writing to Mr Keam, a prominent official of the Agricultural Bureau in Tasmania, the",53,Fakes To Tasmania

When we sought the views of manufacturing interests, however, knew that the Commonwealth was alive we met opposition all along the line. only is there the fear, referred to by the contributor in the Tasmanian Fruitgrower and Farmer, that the manufacture of standard parts would become an independent industry, West Sydney( Mr Beasley) and Hunter which would deprive the manufacturers of machines of this very lucrative section of their business, but the implement manufacturers themselves arc in competition with each other one of the seven wonders of the world. for this trade.

159,Mr Hutchin,"Results are oftenBut it is idle to expect the Government or anybody else to enable the industry to absorb the 10,000 or 15,000 surplus men. The productive capacity of the mines of New South Wales is '72 per cent, above the market requirements of even a few years ago whendemand was greater than it is now. The industry was once highly profitable, and was treated more like a gold-field than a coalfield. Pits were opened all over the place, and engaged in fierce competition with each other. Therefore the productive capacity, which was much greater than the absorptive capacity of the market before the use of oil reduced the consumption of coal, is very much more in excess of it to-day. This was the cause of the old coal vend, which was formed to keep up prices, becoming shattered. In the struggle for existence internecine warfare developed in the industry, and it is being continued to-day as keenly as ever. The weaker units are gradually being pushed to the wall. We have heard to-day that additional units are either shortening working time or closing down. The ace of spades-o r should it be picks'-is held at the moment by the Abermain-Senham group, by reason of the fact that it has, with the Australian Gaslight Company, a contract for three years at Â£1 a ton, which provides a very good foundation upon which may be built a business of price cutting that' may effect detrimentally others less In my opinion it would be neither posfortunately placed. In 1929 and 1930 a royal commission, set up by the Government of New South Wales in conjunction with the Commonwealth, investigated the coal voluminous and valuable report. It was hoped that, as the result of its work, measures for the rehabilitation of the industry would be taken. But the political situation was not stable, and nothing was done. Responsibility rested primarily with the State Government, the composition of which was altered. The Lang Government, upon its return to power, brought down a bill which professedly was designed to rehabilitate the industry, but its terms were based upon only 50 per cent, of the findings and recommendations of the royal commission. The royal commission said that such and such should be done with respect to the control and management of the owners, and such and such with respect to the hours and conditions of the miners. The Lang Government discarded its recommendations in relation to the miners, but adopted those which applied to the owners. Naturally, the owners exerted opposition to the measure and nothing came of it. No action has since been taken. In Great Britain, after much expenditure of money and lengthy investigations, steps are at last being taken to produce oil from coal on a commercial basis. A plant costing from Â£10,000,000 to Â£12,000,000 is being erected by Imperial Chemical Industries Limited. That plant will provide full time work for about .1,000 miners. It must be remem-. bered that these miners are working in narrow seams, where the output of each man is low. A plant on the northern coal-fields of New South Wales that would absorb from ten to fifteen times the number of miners embraced by the English scheme would obviously involve an enormous capital expenditure. From my experience of chemical and engineering processes, I have no doubt that the present process is far from perfect. Within the next two or three years particularly very substantial improvements will be made with the object"" of reducing costs and raising recoveries. sible nor profitable for the Commonwealth to do anything ' like the Imperial Chemical Industries Limited is doing in England. If any Government here ought to do that, obviously it is the Government of New South Wales, and, industry, and presented a if it proposed any serious step in that direction, I am quite sure the Commonwealth Government, which is just as keenly interested in the citizens of our northern coal-fields as it is in those of any other part of Australia, would stand behind that Government, and render whatever help it was able to give. It is very much to be regretted that the coal industry, before it threw away the market it enjoyed, was characterized by an almost complete absence of any research work. It did not seem to look beyond the next ship which was to visit Newcastle to take away a cargo of coal. It semed incapable of visualizing the necessity for cheaper production or the altered economic position which was confronting the industry. The changes which have taken place did not come with extreme suddenness, and, consequently, the industry should not have been caught unawares. When hewers of coal were less in demand than they had been their troubles ijnmed.iat.ely multiplied, became importunate in their claim for State help, by way of either bounty or subsidy, to enable them to continue hewing coal. Had the industry displayed anything like the originality which the metalliferous industries of Australia have exhibited, and without which the latter would have been dead, the coal industry would be in a much better position than it is to-day. Indeed, it is a metalliferous company which alone has displayed any desire to engage in research work in connection with coal deposits in AustraliaI refer to the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited, whicli has been so roundly abused in this chamber on many occasions. This company has invested Â£1,000,000 in a plant which has just started work with a view to extracting by-products from coal. It is only within the past few weeks that the company blew in the second half of its ovens. It is much to be deplored that the coal industry in its prosperous days did not look to its own salvation. Although the representatives of the coal-miners are justified in urging tlie Government to do something for them, I submit that it is not the job of the Commonwealth to do all that they ask. The developments in England are being very closely watched by the Commonwealth Government, and the information gained there is being made available to it. It is to be hoped that when once the British concern is an established success, similar action will be taken in Australia, and, if that is done, we shall then witness the development of the industry here. But we shall not see that development until two important things are assuredfirst, that the technical process is right, as to recovery and costs, and, secondly, that the continuity of the production of the raw material necessary to keep the plant working is guaranteed. One of the principal evils from which Mr Hutchin. the coal industry has suffered has been the lack of continuity of production. People will not invest their money in an industry which has to erect a plant costing Â£10,000,000 or Â£12,000,000, if that plant may be running to-day, but the time came that the idle to-morrow, simply because of a picnic or a coursing meeting. It is essential that the plant must be run on the best posand they sible lines, and to that end the very best technique is essential and the very best of goodwill between -the employees and employers is necessary. In reply to an interjection by me the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr ""Watkins) stated that Mr Rogers had said that the installation of the necessary plant to extract oil from coal could be completed for an expenditure of a few thousand pounds. Mr Rogers was in America with a quantity of oj.1 recovered from Australian shale. He was instructed to ascertain whether various American firms could crack this oil, whether they could guarantee a plant for similar operations in Australia, and to secure finn j> rices for such plant. But, in that case, the job is purely one of cracking the oil after it has been extracted from the shale, whereas the matter we are discussing is the recovery of oil from coal-a n entirely different proposition, [10.7] -On page 179 of the Estimates, it is proposed that, an amount of Â£150 shall be set aside for the work of an advisory committee on unemployment. That amount, I suggest, is indicative of what is expected from this body. Only Â£150 is to be expended in securing, for the Commonwealth Government, the advice of this committee upon the huge question of unemployment. I have not seen any reports from the committee, tind I doubt whether other honourable members have done so. But I am certain that, if the committee is really functioning, it has never heard of the Northern Territory, because, if it has, it surely could not be responsible for the policy adopted by the Government, in connection with the unemployed there. It is idle to suggest that unemployment in the Eederal Capital Territory and the Northern Territory is a State responsibility; it is the direct, responsibility of this Parlia-",55,Fakes To Tasmania
160,Mr Nelson (Northern Territory),"ment, and cannot be shirked. But, when it comes to alleviating distress amongst the unemployed in the Northern Territory, the -Government adopts an entirely different attitude. Only a few days ago I asked what was the justification for its refusal to grant relief to the unemployed who were not in the Northern Territory prior to 1931. In reply, I was told thatIn view of tlie large influx into the Northern Territory of unemployed men from tlie States, the Government decided in 1932 to limit the granting of unemployment relief to men who had been in the territoiy for a period of twelve months prior to 31st December, 1031. A.t the time, the Government was expending large sums of money in maintaining unemployed men who could not be regarded, in any way, as permanent residents of the territory. The majority of them had recently arrived in the territory from the States, many as stowaways on boats trading to Darwin. There was no opportunity, whatever, of these men securing employment in the territory, as neither government nor private funds were available for developmental works. The Government realized its responsibility for maintaining the unemployed who were permanent residents of the territory, but considered that, in the interests of the men themselves, they should be discouraged from leaving the States and proceeding to the Northern TerritoryIt was decided, therefore, to fix a period which should be regarded as qualifying for being regarded as a permanent resident, and for unemployment relief. twelve months prior to December, 1831, was adopted. The men who were in the Territory on 31st December, .1931, and did not qualify for unemployment relief, were offered, at the expense of the Government, passages back to the States from which they proceeded to the territory. Many of them accepted this offer. Persons ineligible for relief who remained in the territory, and those who arrived since, did so knowing the conditions, and at their own risk. It is not proposed. a.t present, to make any alteration in the existing procedure. It will be noticed that the date specified is twelve months prior to 1931, three years ago. battled through hundreds of miles of waterless country is compelled to seek medical treatment in centres where there i i a doctor available, he is not eligible for relief work unless he was in the Government has helped the unemployed district prior to 1930. We have heard the Minister said that, in addition to the quite a lot about, the so-called sympathy meagre assistance that is being given to of this Government for the unemployed, those who are out of work in the Federal but invariably it shelters behind the Capital Territory, these men are to be excuse that unemployment is the respongiven an extra month's work as a sort of C173] sibility of the States. It cannot resort, to such a quibble in connection with those who are unemployed in the Northern Territory. I deny the statement that there is no opportunity for men in that area, and say that the Government, and not the workers, has fallen down on the job. It is futil e to say that . in such a huge territory, which is urgently in need of development, there is no opportunity to provide employment. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has told the world that Australia is rounding the corner; that prosperity is here. Unfortunately, that is not to apply to the unemployed who come under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government. This Government transferred men who were unemployed in the Northern Territory to the States, a procedure which continued u n t i l the then Premier of Western Australia objected to the dumping of unemployed in that State. It was quite a simple process for the Commonwealth Government to provide secondclass passages for these men from Darwin to the West or to Thursday Island, and so pass all responsibility on to the States. The Government, has failed to do its duty to these men and has informed them frankly that if they remain in the. terriThe period of tory they do so at their own risk. Simultaneously, it, declares that, it is essential to populate and develop the Northern Territory! Hundreds of men of the best type went to that area recently to pursue mining operations, but because of an adverse fate they are now worse off than when they left the States, and they are denied relief by the Commonwealth Government because they were not in the territory before 1931, the Minister for the Interior( Mr Perkins) having stated definitely that he does not propose to make any alteration of the If a prospector who has existing practice. In other words, the unemployed in the Northern Territory are condemned by the Administration to a lingering death from starvation. In an endeavour to show that this Christmas gift. When I asked whether that would also be applied to the Northern Territory the honourable gentleman emphatically said that it would not. Unfortunately, the unemployed of the Northern Territory are too far removed from Canberra and cannot march on Parliament House when driven to desperation. RecentlyI put up a case for a man who had been in the Northern Territory for just three years, and I received the following reply from the Minister:I desire to acknowledge tlie receipt of your letter of tlic 24th October covering a communication received by you from the Secretary, North Australian Workers' Union, Darwin, regarding tlie grant of relief work to Mr W. Morgan of Katherine. As Mr Morgan cannot comply with the residential qualification laid down in respect to relief work in the Northern Territory, it is regretted that nothing can be done for him. Cases somewhat similar to that of Mr vernment to provide more work for tha Morgan have been submitted from time to time, but as a line of demarcation had to he made, no approval has been given for the alteration of tlic arrangements ""no.w in force. Obviously, it is the duty of the Government to alleviate the distress of these unfortunate men, and its callous attitude is merely driving them to excesses, for which they cannot be blamed. The Government has claimed that there are no opportunities to provide work in the Northern Territory. men there would be only too glad to go prospecting if they were given rations. The Government will not even send geologists to examine the rich fields that undoubtedly exist in the territory, which would open up a wonderful avenue for the employment of the workless, who would soon be producing wealth and become valuable citizens. The other day I showed the Minister an account of a crushing that had been sent to Peterborough which averaged 9 ounces to the ton. The Northern Territory also possesses iron-wood timbers which are admirably adapted for use as railway sleepers. In fact, it has been demonstrated that, after having been used for 50 years, only 5 per cent, of these sleepers have had to be replaced. They are better and infinitely cheaper than tlie steel sleepers which are imported.. If a contract were let for ironwood timber sleepers for replacement Mr Nelson. purposes, many men who are now unemployed would be enabled to make a living. As we are approaching the festive season, and it is intended to provide extra work for the unemployed in the Eederal Capital Territory, I hope that the Minister, imbued with the spirit of the words "" On earth peace, goodwill towards men,"" will break down the barriers that have been erected against the unfortunate persons in the Northern Territory by inducing the 'Government to honour its obligations to those who are directly under its control. As this is not a party matter and it is the responsibility of every honourable member to see that unemployed in federal territory are given a fair deal, I move That the amount be reduced by Â£1. If this amendment is carried, it should be regarded as an instruction to the Gounemployed in the Northern Territory, aud to remove the residential qualifications as laid down by this Government debarring those with less than three years' residence in the territory from participating in relief works. Some time ago, the honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin) accused members of the Country party of having Hundreds of failed to emphasize the need for the standardization of agricultural machinery parts; but this Parliament has no power to deal with that matter. Certain machinery parts, the factory cost of which was Â£1,640, were recently imported, and the landed cost of the goods was not less than Â£4,600. This fact shows that useful as standardization would be, there are other and better ways of assisting the man on the land. A number of honourable members apparently desire that Government assistance should be given to those engaged in the extraction of fuel oil from coal. While I agree that the Government should do everything possible to assist research, the work of extraction should be left to private enterprise. I agree with the remarks of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) about the increasing cost of sending representatives to various conferences in Great Britain and at Geneva. While",57,Fakes To Tasmania
161,Mr Gregory (Swan) [10.21],"it may be wise to have Australia represented at the gatherings of the League of Nations, the increase from Â£20,000 to Â£54,000 in the vote for Australia's contribution to the cost of the Secretariat of the League needs explanation, because it seems greater than we can afford. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), referred to the importance of the mining industry. The Western Australian Government has done much valuable work in assisting prospectors, and in many instances, remarkable results have been obtained. Two friends of mine made fortunes in the early days by gold prospecting, and I noticed in the press recently that, on a claim which they had abandoned, another man had picked up Â£15,000 worth of gold almost on the surface, and rich pre is still being found. not even, send a geologist to the mining fields in the Northern Territory. it is futile to attempt to develop the Northern Territory? The allocation of Â£500 for "" Investigations in connection with the development of North Australia"" is ridiculous. The fact of the matter is that developmental work is too costly, because the economic conditions are impossible. Some time ago, the managing director of the Dutch-East India Company reported that he was conveying sugar from Java to Sydney for transfer to New Zealand at 25s. a ton. At the same time Australia was paying a subsidy amounting to Â£3 15s. a ton to one of the shipping companies trading between Sydney and Java to land cargo at Darwin. ment would grant exemption from customs taxation, and relief from the operation of the Navigation Act, and the federal arbitration laws for at least 25 years,' some hope could be entertained of the development of the Northern Territory. I am more familiar with conditions in the far north-west of Western Australia than with those in the Northern Territory. There are fewer settlers in that part of Western Australia now than there were 25 or 30 years years ago, and I believe that a similar remark may be applied to the Northern Territory. One government after another has endeavoured to populate our empty north, but no beneficial results have been obtained, despite the large expenditure that has been incurred. I am interested in a copper mine at Barrow Creek, ancl I have seen specimens of ore from this ""show"" containing SO per cent, of copper; but nothing can be done to develop the mine owing to the high operating costs. We are told that it is of the utmost importance that Australia should be actively interested in the work of the League of Nations, but the people of this country could do something in the direction of protecting themselves by populating and developing our empty spaces in the north. If a motion were submitted for a reduction of the amounts voted for sending delegations to assemblies of the League of Nations and for other trips abroad, I should give it my support. We cannot afford this expenditure. In formation which I have placed before the House on other occasions shows that, while by means of bounties and tariffs we have established industries in this country, action in other directions has tended to destroy them. I disagreed with some of the statements made by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) concerning the Defence Estimates. I supported those Estimates by my voice, but was not required to vote upon them. I direct attention to the increased expenditure on account of the Secretariat, League of Nations, the amount provided this year being Â£54,000, compared with an expenditure last year of Â£50,323. Can the PrimeI f the GovernMinister( Mr Lyons) say if this increase is due to the failure of other member nations to pay their contributions to the League, and if our ratio of expenditure bears any relation to the expenditure of other countries on a population basis ? Although in one material issue the League has failed to do what was expected of it, it should not be entirely discredited, because it has rendered valuable service to the cause of peace among the nations. The fact that it has failed once does not justify our withdrawal of. support from it. To fail is not necessarily an admission of incompetence.

The That is a most disgraceful state of affairs. The Government might be excused' from blame if ample notice had been given of its intention to withhold relief from persons who have not been living in the territory for the period mentioned, because then persons going to the Northern Territory would know what to expect.

166,Mr Martens,"I hope that thewe debated fov nearly 48 hours the question of Australian defence, and this particular item brings out prominently the point which several honourable members tried to make during that debate, aud whicli was touched upon by the honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom) to-night when he read from the Covenant of the League of Nations a particular definition regarding the disarmament problem aud the obligation of nations in that direction. The question of world disarmament arose partly out of the Treaty of Versailles, in which it was provided that, in order to render possible the initiation of a. general reduction of armaments by all nations, certain reductions of the armaments of Germany should he insisted upon. From that began the world move for disarmament, but unfortunately disarmament has not been carried out by a great number of the nations. The idea was that Germany should have a low standard of armaments sufficient for its own defence in a disarmed world, and that the other nations should reduce their armaments in accordance with that standard; but because of international jealousies, regard for frontiers, international distrust and similar reasons, the disarmament, which everybody was eagerly anticipating, was seriously delayed. Nothing much happened until 1929, when a preparatory committee sat to prepare a draft convention for submission to all the nations of the world. After three years' work the representatives on that committee were in a position to submit their scheme. Most of the nations signified their intention to take part in the general disarmament conference, when 33 nations .submitted plans for disarmament; but wo two of them would agree on any one scheme. Each nation thought that its own scheme was super-excellent, and would pay no heed to that of any other nation. Outstanding among the plans was that of Great Britain. Sir John Simon made a most excellent contribution to the discussion, one which might very well be taken as a basis for world disarmament. He saidWc take tlie view that the temptation to resort to armed conflict is obviously reduced as defence is strengthened at the expense of attack. Since our common object is not to increase, but to diminish, the sum total of armaclays Hjgo in connection with the defence ments and their expense, it follows that we must direct special attention to such prohibitions or limitations as will weaken the attack and so remove the temptation for aggression. That scheme was debated at the general convention at which the representatives of many nations were assembled, including our Attorney-General( Mr Latham), Unfortunately, the continental nations with land frontiers feared the British system, aud counter proposals were put forward, principally by the French. Those proposals set up such a discussion among the representatives of the nations that no real progress was made. Fearing a breakdown, the chairman, Mr Arthur Henderson, was able to postpone the conference until the British Delegation submitted a compromise which it was hoped all nations would see fit to accept. That compromise embodied certain portions of the French and the British schemes. The ideas underlying the compromise were that super heavy guns should not be used by any one nation, but should be pooled internationally under the aegis of the League of Nations; that naval craft should be kept below .10,000 tons, certain conditions as to their armament being set out; and that, aircraft, war aircraft especially, should be internationalized, so as not to lie the weapon of any particular nation. However, difficulties arose, and the Disarmament, Conference was postponed from time to. time. It appears at times as if the other nations of the world are not. wholeheartedly in favour of disarmament. They give lip service, but do not seem to make any practical contribution towards disarmament, whereas the British nation has definitely made more than a fair contribution towards disarmament. For instance, Great Britain has reduced its cruisers, which, after all, are the police force which guards the transport of foodstuffs in time of war, from 114 in 1914 to 4S_, and four others in the course of construction in 1932. During that period it also reduced the number of its torpedo boat destroyers by 172. Great Britain has 152 destroyers, the United States of America 259, and Japan 104. Although Great Britain has reduced its monetary expenditure on naval defence since 1924 by approximately"" Â£6,000,000, other naval poAvers have not reduced their's below the 1924 standard. The figures I quoted a feAv estimates show that the United States of America is spending approximately Â£57,000,000 this year, Japan about the same amount, and Great Britain only Â£8,250,000. If all nations disarmed to the point of providing for their own protection, there would not be aggression on the part of any nation. Under the League of Nations, the Oommonwealth has the right, without infringing any disarmament convention or arrangement, to increase its armaments up to the point considered by Australia and other nations as adequate for our own protection. I do not think that it can be said that, with the solitary exception of Great Britain, any other nation has reduced armaments to the limit of safety for its own protection. A few days ago honourable members opposite accused me of Babre-rattling, of war-mongering, and of favouring extravagant expenditure; but. I say most definitely that I welcome theÂ» day when every nation will, by a bona fide act, reduce armaments to such a degree that we can reduce our present defence forces, and still foel secure. Eor these reasons we should make every effort o encourage disarmament. Â£3,497 was expended to meet the cost of our representation at the Disarmament Conference, and this year only Â£250 is to be appropriated. be on the wane. Mr E. F. HARRISON I am afraid that it must be so. The Government may have lost heart owing to the numerous occasions on which disarmament proceedings have been adjourned, and possibly it considers that no improvement will occur this year. I have not lost heart, and I still believe that in disarmament Great Britain will lead the world, as it has led in other great movements. assist. Great Britain along that road until under those conditions. It has been found we have complete disarmament, which may not come in our time, but perhaps during the lives of our children. earnestly appeal to the Government to see if Australia cannot help by providing a larger amount to forward the disarmament movement. -Last year the Government appropriated Â£1,000, and this year it proposes to place Â£3,000 into a trust fund to assist the Australian banana industry. I desire to make a special appeal on behalf of the Western Australian banana industry, for which practically no provision has been made. In the Ottawa agreement, provision is made for the annual importation of 40,000 centals of Fijian bananas at a reduced duty of 2s. 6d. per central. This should provide a revenue of Â£5,000 a year, of which Western Australia is allocated Â£100 foi' assistance to banana growers. In Western Australia we are attempting to establish the industry, but bananas grown in that State will not be competitive with those produced in Queensland or northern New South Wales, as experience has shown that bananas produced in the eastern States cannot be landed in Western Australia in a fit condition to compete with those imported from Java. The product of the Western Australian industry will compete with that of a black-labour country, and will be used solely to meet the local demand. We are grateful for the assistance being given .by some young Queenslanders, who have transferred their Last year, allegiance to the western State, and are_ showing our people how to grow bananas. Unfortunately, as is common in all -tropical and sub-tropical zones in the same latitude, the rainfall on the western coast of Australia is light, whereas that on the eastern coast is heavy. In these circumstances we have to depend upon irrigation, which increases overhead costs. The growers have had to install large pumps, driven by Diesel engines, and that costs much money. The water is drawn from what appears to be the dry bed of the Gascoyne River, but there is an inexhaustible supply under the sand. The growers also have to contend with very strong winds, and The Commonwealth should banana plants will not grow satisfactorily necessary to make brush hedges fourteen or fifteen feet high, and, in order to lace I the hedges together, the seven year bean, which grows profusely, has been planted against them. It is evident, therefore, that a grower must have capital, but the primary producers in Western Australia, as in other places, generally start with little capital. In spite of all these difficulties a determined effort is being made",61,Fakes To Tasmania

There was very little discussion of the budget of the Permanent Court of International Jusrice, which was adopted at 2,660,196 gold francs, a modification of the original estihave lost all enthusiasm for conferences mate by the amount of only 1,100 gold francs. There, as here, those who are doing the most useful work have had to hear the greatest burden of sacrifice. Until in respect of loss of licences by broadcastother nations, which, up to 1931, owed over 3,000,000 gold francs to the League of Nations, are prepared to discharge that liability, Australia should refuse to increase the amount which it paid last year. A smaller matter which requires explanation is the grant to the Australian Oommonwealth branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association. Last year, the vote for this item was Â£160, but the expenditure was Â£250. This year, it would appear that Â£250 is to be spent on this organization. I should like to know why Â£150 was not sufficient last year, and why the estimate this year is based on last year's expenditure. The vote for the relief and repatriation of distressed Australians abroad was Â£200 hist year, but only Â£84 of that, amount was spent. Judging by the amount which tbe department estimates is required to repatriate distressed Australians abroad, it looks as though tliere will be only two successful applicants this year. I have had the greatest difficulty with a number of cases that I have takeu in hand. On one occasion only was some concession granted in connection with the payment of the expenses of repatriation. Although the reasons advanced in support of repatriation by the persons in whom I have interested myself were many aud varied, I have not so far beeu able to glean from the department the exact nature of the circumstances in which a person must be placed to justify repatriation by the Government. Last year, the vote for the Commonwealth contribution to the world conference on the reduction and limitation of armaments was Â£2,200, but Â£3,497. This year, it is proposed to appropriate a paltry Â£250 for this purpose. It may be true that the Goverument has come to the conclusion that disarmament conferences are useless, aud for that reason does not propose to be represented on them. On the other hand, however, the Government may intend to take part in the race in connection with the provision of armaments, and may that are designed to limit them. There was no provision in the Estimates last year for an ex gratia payment ing companies, consequently, the provision of an amount of Â£9,000 for this purpose on the present occasion demands explanation. Tlie subsidy towards the provision of a continuous passenger steamer service between Hobart and Sydney during the winter months is estimated to amount this year to Â£4,154. The expenditure on this item last year^was Â£1,846. It is also proposed to pay Â£10,000 by way of subsidy towards the provision of an improved passenger service between Melbourne and Launceston, upon which only Â£2,700 was expended last year, although no appropriation was made. I do not think that Tasmania is faring badly in connection with Subsidies. About twelve months ago, honourable members who represent Tasmanian constituencies argued that it, was desirable that overseas vessels should be allowed to trade between Australian and Tasmanian ports. In order to satisfy the demands that, were then made, the Government suspended the operation of the coasting trade provisions of the Navigation Act. I understand that that practice has been continued. What, then, is the'reason for the increase of the subsidy by Â£2,000 in the case of the service between Hobart and Sydney, and of Â£7,300 on the service between Melbourne and Launceston? The amount provided for the development of the Northern Territory is paltry. It would appear that Â£500 is the limit of the Government's generosity. I under-, stand from the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) that ihat' sum has already been spent. Perhaps this alleged . wilderness is being prepared for the time when some overseas the expenditure amounted to company will assume exclusive rights in the' territory. The expenditure last year on valuation fees ih connection with the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers amounted to Â£110. I should like to know exactly the valuations for which these chairman of directors of the White Star fees were paid.

The. honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin) dealt very exhaustively with the rise aud fall of the coal-mining industry. He dealt with that industry from the time when it was making huge profits, and he traced its rapid decline until to-day, when many of the collieries arc closed and the mining community numbers 72 per cent, over capacity. I question whether his figures are correct, but I do know that thousands of miners have been unemployed for months and that many collieries have been closed through lack of trade. The honourable member for Denison did not assist us to find a solution of this problem by suggesting that in times gone by the coal industry should have done something which it did not. do. If that argument has any value, we might witli equal force apply it to the wheat farmers. We might urge that, they should have followed the trend of the wheat markets of the world and, as a consequence, should not have grown so much wheat. Indeed, we might apply the same argument to every industry that we subsidize. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby) is in the same boat as the honourable member for Denison. ascribes the whole of the difficulties of the coal-mining industry to strikes. But the difficulties of that industry are not peculiar to Australia. Similar difficulties face it throughout the world. Isi t contended that strikes are responsible for the world-wide condition of this industry? Unless the honourable member applies his standards to the coal-mining industry throughout the world his argument lacks force. The coal-mines of Australia are, perhaps, the richest in the world, but they are lying idle, the capital invested in them lie3 idle, thousands of coal-miners are idle, and their families are in destitute circumstances. It is unnecessary for me to point out how desperate is the plight of those families or how desirable it is again to place the coal-mines in operation. It is all too obvious. While all that regrettable idleness exists, Australia is almost entirely, dependent on overseas supplies for the fuel that it needs as motive power for its industries, aud for defence purposes. Just as coal and steam eliminated the wind-jammers of old, so oil-burning ships have eliminated coal-burning vessels, and we are entirely dependent on outiside sources for the fuel that is used to propel them. Our industries are similarly situated. Honourable members must realize that if Australia were blockaded in time of war, or if, for any reason, in time of peace, supplies were held up, its oil resources would be insufficient to last more than a month. That is a position that should not be tolerated. It has been said that there are well-oil resources in Australia which have never been thoroughly investigated because of the influence exerted by moneyed overseas oil companies. I am not in a position to say whether that is true or untrue, and I shall not speculate on the subject, but I do know that there are private interests which are prepared to spend Â£10,000,000 overseas in an endeavour to obtain oil from coal. member's time has expired. I cannot allow the item ""Broadcasting Companies-e x gratia payments in . respect of loss of licences Â£9,000,"" to pass He without lodging my protest.

186,Mr Gibson (Corangamite) [11.44].,"it clear that that statement was not correct, for at no time did I , nor did Mr Bruce in my presence, make a definite statement that the licences of those companies would he renewed. There were two companies operating independently in Sydney, two in Melbourne, one in Perth, one in Adelaide, one in Hobart, and a government station in Brisbane. It was quite obvious to everybody that broadcasting could not be carried on successfully and economically unless the activities of those stations were co-ordinated, so the Postmaster-General's Department made it clear that the licences of these companies would not. be renewed unless they amalgamated. amalgamate, but two or three boardcasting companies in New South ""Wales and Victoria became associated clearly, in my opinion, in an endeavoiir to hold up the Government until it was compelled to make use of their stations for future broadcasting purposes. That occurred just prior to the expiration of their licences, the first of which lapsed on the 16th July, 1929, and the last, that of the Hobart station, iu 1930. Ry myself and in company with the then Prime MinisterI interviewed a number of representatives of the companies at different times at Canberra and Sydney, and I say clearly that no promise was made that their licences would be renewed. The companies made a claim On the Commonwealth Government for Â£64,000, which was investigated by the Public Accounts Committee. Gounecl was engaged and evidence taken, but I am not sure that the committee submitted a report. Mr SouLt.ni -Its proceedings were interrupted, and it did not submit a report. grat'ia payment is to be made indicates that the Government does not hold itself responsible for the payment of this money, but I feel that it is doing wrong in making this payment, for which there is no legal or moral claim. Had the companies co-ordinated their activities they would have had a claim, when they made application for fresh licences, to cover the whole of Australia; but they did not get that far. They were treated most liberally by the Government, which could have refused to renew their licences with the result that their stations would have been so much scrap iron, superseded, as they would have beeu, by modern stations built by the.Government. At that time their stations were becoming obsolete, having been erected when broadcasting was in its infancy. In the circumstances I enter my protest against this money being paid to the broadcasting companies. I do not think that it is justified. its disallowance? do that. The Government does not accept They did not responsibility and it. should not pay the money. General) [11.50] I confess to a considerable amount of sympathy with the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson) in his remarks on this matter, but the case is surrounded by special circumstances which, I am sure, are not absent from tbe honourable member's mind. The claim as originally made was for Â£64,260, for losses alleged to have been incurred in endeavouring to bring about an amalgamation and combination of the broadcasting companies at the suggestion of the Prime Minister of the day ( Mr Bruce), ancl the honourable member for Corangamite, who was then Postmaster-General. I was Attorney General in the same Ministry. When the claim was first made. I examined-it, and my natural response was, "" If there is a claim, let action be taken in the courts, and the Commonwealth Government will, of course, be bound by the judgment."" But the claim was submitted on a moral basis. It was admitted by the companies that they had no legal claim. In about 1927,. the companies were getting a share of the listeners' fees paid in the various States. The quality of their programmes varied greatly, ancl the Government was not satisfied with it. A royal commission which was appointed to report on wireless broadcasting, recommended that certain changes be made to bring about au improvement of the programmes, and a suggestion was made by the Prime Minister aud the Postmaster-General of the day for the amalgamation and co-ordination of the companies. It was afterwards repre-",68,Fakes To Tasmania

190,Mr Latham (Kooyong,"Attorneysented that a promise had heen given tliat if they agreed to amalgamate they would receive an extension of their licences. The Government of the day contested that statement. The companies, however, based their claim on the assertion that they had been requested by the Government of the day to amalgamate activities. A proposal was submitted foiamalgamation; but the Government was Tiot satisfied with its terms in regard to the capitalization of the assets of the companies, the proposed dividends and other matters, and accordingly a new policy was formulated involving acquisition by the Government of the assets of the companies and the provision of the programmes by contractors who were to be selected after they had put in tenders for the service. The existing companies expected to obtain the service, but they failed in their tender. It was then that the claim was made by them for Â£64,261, and it was pressed, not on legal, but on moral grounds. The companies were invited to take their case to the court, but they were not prepared to do so; they expressly stated that they had no legal claim. It was urged that the matter sliould not. be determined by the Goverument itself, and, accordingly, a. suggestion was made that it should be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Accounts. Both parties concurred in that, suggestion, and the matter was to have heen referred to that committee. A change of government, however, took place, but the new Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Y a r r a ( Mr Government is not dealiug f a i r l y with the Scullin), thought it proper to allow the Public Accounts Committee to inquire into the matter. The inquiry was proceeding, when certain charges were made as to the conduct of some persons concerned, as the result of which a royal commission was appointed. The report of the commission did not support any of the charges. Accounts Committee then asked to be relieved of its obligation to report further, aud the right honourable member for Yarra w ill doubtless agree with me AvhenI have placed his Government in an embarrassing position.. Accordingly, the particular tribunal which had been agreed upon for the purpose of making a report and recommendation on the matter did not proceed further. The Public Accounts Committee had referred the matter to au accountant, who reported that, on a f a ir basis, the stun of Â£26,000 was payable to the companies. The then Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), did not accept that recommendation, but had a further inquiry and co-ordinate their made by a leading officer of the Public Service, who reported that Â£18,562 was the maximum amount that could be properly paid. The matter was not concluded in the term of the Labour Government, and this damnosa hmreditas descended to the present Government, which has agreed to a settlement for Â£9,000. This is an ex gratia paymeut in complete and final settlement of the whole matter, and, in all the circumstances, I suggest that the arrangement might well be agreed to by the committee, though it is an unsatisfactory story. Of course, if I were regarding the matter merely from a legal point of view, I should say exactly as I did at. the outset-that the companies had no legal claim. If there had been such a claim, I think that they would have sued the Government, and would not have adopted a procedure which has resulted in the reduction of their claim from over Â£64,000 to Â£9,000. However, three governments have dealt with th* matter, and each thought that the claim should not be rejected out of hand. [11.58] -! support the amendment submitted by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson). The unfortunate unemployed in the territory. Apparently the Government regards it as a crime for those men. to be out of employment. As the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) remarked, the Government, instead of endeavouring to drive men away from the territory, should try to encourage them to populate that The Public part of Australia. Last year Â£500 was voted for an Australian delegation to the International Labour Conference at Geneva, and the expenditure amounted to Â£287. The amount, provided for the 1933 say that that must conference is Â£250. If the delegate who attended the last conference received his salary in addition to expenses the Commonwealth owes me a considerable sum of money, because in 1925, when I had the",69,Fakes To Tasmania
191,Mr Geoege Lawson (Brisbane),"honour to' attend the conference as a representative of the Australian workers, I received only uy daily expenses. In 1924, the delegate from Western Australia received in addition to expenses, his weekly salary. I understand also that tlie honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), who attended the 1926 conference, was paid his salary, in addition to expenses. On my return to Australia from the 1925 conference, I submitted a report to the then Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), and also a claim for salary in addition to expenses, but this was refused. I hope that the Government will not treat'future delegates in the way that I was treated. All delegates, whether they represent employers or employees, should be treated alike, at all conferences. I am pleased to know that the Government intends to continue sending representatives to the Litci-national Labour Conference, notwithstanding the adverse report subsubmitted by the delegates representing employers and employees at the 1930 conference. It will be recalled that they stated that no good purpose would be served by Australia's representation at future conferences. I am convinced that great good will accrue to Australia from representation at such gatherings. I do, however, suggest that Australian dele;gates should receive 'more assistance. Under the existing arrangement, they are considerably handicapped. Other countries appoint substitute delegates and advisors. Consequently, when the various sub-committees are appointed, they have representation on all of them, wherea9 Australia, having only one delegate representing employers and one delegate representing employees, is frequently unrepresented on some of the committees which sit simultaneously. This was my experience in 1925. I hope that the Minister will be able to give the committee information concerning the expenditure of this vote. Progress reported.

Honourable members who desire to partake of the hospitality of the Governor General this afternoon may do so, but there is no 'reason why other honourable members should be debarred from proceeding with the work of this Parliament. This House has been adjourned far too frequently without adequate reason On a previous occasion the sitting of the House was delayed on the excuse that the Loan Council was meeting in Melbourne and that some honourable members wished to inspect the cordite factory at Maribyrnong, the day of the meeting and the inspection happening to coincide with the date of the Melbourne Cup. I suggest that the excuse offered by the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) oil this occasion does not warrant the delay that will take place in carrying on the work of this Parliament. Honourable members are called upon to sit here until unreasonable hours, such as has happened tonight, and on one occasion last week .we were called upon to sit for 25Â£ hours-.

General) [12.14 a.m.] --It is impossible to announce at this stage precisely to what hour the House will sit to-night.

The report has been signed by the Auditor-General,, aud the commission expects to present it before the t-nd of this week. 2 and 3. The commission states that this is not so. 4. Tlie report will be tabled as soon as possible after its receipt. upon notice1. I i i view of the fact that, by budget proposals and otherwise, substantial financial concessions and remissions of taxation are being made by the Commonwealth and by the States of New South Wales and South Australia, and the further fact that percentage restorations of salary "" cuts"" to public servants and of pension payments are being made by the Commonwealth and/or the States of New South VVales and Queensland, is it to be assumed that the Premiers plan, whicli was based on equality of sacrifice, has now been discarded by the Governments concerned? 2. If not, will the Commonwealth Government, through the Loan Council, arrange the necessary finance to enable those States, whose financial position at present precludes it , _to accord a similar measure of relief, to their taxpayers and public servants, and thus preserve that co-ordination of public finance which is inseparable from the application of the principle of a fair deal all round? orable member's questions are as follows :-1. No. 2. The question of relief to taxpayers and public servants is the responsibility of the respective Governments and not the Loan Council. In June last, the Loan Council arranged finance to cover State deficits for 1033-34, arid unanimously agreed to tbe allocation of the amount to tlie respective States. Budgets have since been presented by OF AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING all the States in which tbe deficits have beeu based on the finance available.

The matter was taken up with the Kailways Department of New South Wales, as the conductors mentioned are employees of that department; and the following advice has now been received from the secretary of the department:Conductors are at times retained in Canberra waiting departure of tlie sleeping car on the up journey. The conductors arrive usually on the Wednesday morning, and arc not required until the Friday evening when Parliament adjourns. This arrangement obviates unnecessary passenger time and tends to more economical working. So far as the statement that these conductors are not, paid for such time, is concerned, I desire to state that in computing the time uf the conductors at the end of the pay fortnight the time lost by them waiting at Canberra is taken into consideration. Clause 0, sub-clause (e) of the traffic employees award of 10th February, 1S20, reads"" Every employee shall be paid in respect to work performed on week days according to the number of days or shifts worked in the period or according to the number of hours worked iu the period, such pay heing calculated upon whichever of these alternatives gives the greater amount."" Iu calculating the pay of the conductors, the days waiting at Canberra are regarded as days on which they are nn duty, aud should the amount of pay be greater ou the basis of the number of days on duty than on the basis of the total number of hours worked iu the period, they are paid accordingly in terms of the award. Owing to the lengthy shifts worked by conductors they have a good deal of time off duty at their home station, consequently they arc usually paid on tlie basis nf the total number of hours worked iu the period, and seldom is it necessary to compute their time on the basis of the number of days or shifts to arrive nt the greater amount.",74,Conductors On New South Wales Sleeping Cars
