Each of those predictions, without fail, has The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill is been proved to be false. So why would before the House tonight in a cognate debate anybody, either within the Labor Party or with the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) outside the Labor Party, and particularly the Bill and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Australian people, give him any credence Bill. Together, as we all know, they are whatsoever for any statement that he would instruments simply of betrayal not only of make?

On another occasion he said, 'We will not increase the overall Following the consultation with the Greens, burden of tax'. On 19 August 1992 he stated, I am a bit surprised that we have not had 'The point is that the tax cuts can be funded more amendments tonight.

Any predictions that he makes will simply not come true. The government went into the election with a clear and unambiguous promise not to We have before us this evening three increase taxes.
