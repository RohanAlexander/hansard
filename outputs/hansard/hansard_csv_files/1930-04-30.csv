Some People Might Say That The Whole Of The Bounty Should Be Paid By The General Taxpayers. Policy The Government Is Adopting In Regard To Wheat. Ber Is Quite Wrong. The Commonwealth Government, In Co","operation with the States, is guaranteeing 4s. per bushel, to be advanced by the Commonwealth Bank. -The repeated interjections of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr for their product. The revenue derived Archdale Parkhill) are most disconcerting, and I ask him to restrain himself. Moreover, the wheat marketing scheme is not covered by this bill, and the discussion of it is disorderly. make suggestions? name the honourable member if he offends again. ment's legacy from its predecessor was an accumulated deficit of over £5,000,000. With the prevailing temporary epres1 sion, where was the Government to get the money with which to pay the increased bounty of Is. 9d. per gallon on fortified wines exported? The Government decided to ask the industry itself to bear the burden During the five years ended 1929, the average amount of revenue received from the excise duty on spirits used for fortifying wine was £354,992 per annum. The Government considered that this was a fair contribution for the wine industry to make to Consolidated Revenue, and that the increase in the bounty from Is. to Is. 9d. should be financed by increasing the excise duty on spirit used for the fortification of wine. Sweet wines are fortified by the addition of grape wine spirit, and it is on these fortified wines that the bounty is payable. Up to the 13th March last, the duty on fortifying spirits made from doradillo grapes was 5s. per gallon, and on spirit made from any other grape, 6s. per gallon. The difference in favour of doradillo srrapes was introduced to encourage wine-makers to purchase those grapes, which were a glut in the market. This concession has substantially assisted the doradillo growers to market their product. By raising the duty to 10s. and l is . per gallon, respectively, the increased amount so derived will be suflicient, at the present rate of consumption in Australia, to pay an export bounty of Is. 9d. per gallon on the expected average export of fortified wine during the period covered by the bill. The consumption of wine in Australia is rapidly increasing, owing to its displacement of other alcoholic stimulants, and, probably, by advertising and other propaganda, wine-makers may be able to enlarge further the local market from the increased excise duty on fortifying spirit will thus be augmented, from year to year, sufficiently to pay the bounty on export. One feature of the bill which honourable members should bear in mind is that the whole of the bounty will be paid by the wine industry itself, and the whole of the revenue at the old rate of duty on spirits for fortifying wines, averaging for the last five years a gross return of £354,992 per annum, will go into revenue, and out of which a little more than half the drawback will be paid. There is room for improvement in the marketing of Australian wines in Great Britain. Hithertp this trade has been entirely uncontrolled, and the wine has been placed on the overseas market in a haphazard manner. Reports have lieen received that wines sent there on consignment have been hawked by brokers and others to be sold at cut-throat prices. Some consignments of wine were sold in the auction room at slaughter prices. Thus the market was injured, and the export business was without stability. The Wine Overseas Marketing Board, which was created last year, has control over wine export, and has power to issue licences to exporters under specified conditions. These regulations will set out the conditions under which the home market is to be stabilized. The board, which will soon be operating, determines such matters as the minimum price at which wine exported is to be sold and the regulation of quantities for export. In the past the export market has at times been glutted, because",29,Setup

6,Mr Forde,"Part of the Governof the non-regulation of supplies, and naturally the action of holders of wine on the other side in selling at cut throat prices, in order to get ready money, has had a detrimental effect upon the whole of the overseas market. Since the Government has announced the proposed increase in the bounty, the wine buyers in Great Britain have cabled to their customers here demanding a re-arrangement of prices so that they may get some of the benefit from the increased bounty. If that were permitted it would largely nullify the benefits that should accrue to the Australian wine industry. Some of the oversea buyers have suggested that the increased bounty should go into their pockets. Unfortunately in the past that has to some extent been the practice, because the growers of grapes and wine makers have not always received the full benefit of the bounty. This anomaly will in the future be rectified, because tlie ""Wine Overseas Marketing Board will take steps to ensure that there is a proper balance maintained as between the exporter and the buyer abroad. The duty of 5s -and Gs. a gallon on fortifying spirit represents Is. 3d. a gallon or 2£d. a bottle. The increased duties raise the impost to 2s. 4d. a gallon or about 4j}d. a bottle, or a difference of 2^d. a bottle or about i d . a glass. Compared with the excise duty on beer of Is. lOd. a gallon or about 3fd. a bottle, the wine consumers are being much, favoured. The quantity of alcohol in a bottle of fortified wine is four times that contained in a bottle of beer, and to put the two articles on an equal basis, so far as their alcoholic contents arc concerned, the duty on a bottle of fortified wine should be from Is. 2d. to Is. 3d. a bottle instead of 4:fd. a bottle. The increase iu excise should not mean an increase in the price to the consumer. opinion of experts in the industry. A few years ago wine makers were receiving 10s. a gallon for the cheaper class of fortified wine. Now they are selling ordinary sweet red wines, or what are termed the bread and butter lines of the wine industry, at from 5s. to 6s. a gallon. Yet the price to the consumeiv has remained practically unaltered. In view of the fact that the retailer is obtaining wine at about half the cost of what he was paying a few years ago, how could he justify an increase in price to the consumer ? suggesting that the retailer will pay the bounty? tailer will be prepared to stand this increase of Is. 3d. a gallon or id. a glass on wine. There is absolutely no justification for increasing the price to the consumer. The previous Wine Export Bounty Act provided for the termination of the bounty in three years; this bill provides for a period of five years. » It will, therefore, give greater stability to the industry by safeguarding the interests of the winemakers, the grape-growers, and the workers in the industry. No change will take place, so far as the export trade is concerned, until 1935, and it is probable that at the end of that period the scheme will be continued. Those interested in the industry can be confident that, so long as the industry itself contributes the amount required to pay the bounty, a case for the extension of the period will be unassailable. The success of the scheme depends to a large extent upon those engaged in the industry itself, and I believe that they are now organising and regulating the industry, aided by the Commonwealth Government through the Wine Export Marketing Board. Although there may appear no reason at present why the term should not be longer-and it has been suggested that it should be for ten years-the position of the trust account may require reviewing at the end of the five-year period. Clause4 of the bill provides for a trust account, known as the ""Wine Export Encouragement Account,"" which shall be kept in the books of the Treasury. This provision has met with the approval of most of those engaged in the industry. The amount of extra duty collected on account of the increase of 5s. a gallon on spirit used for fortifying wine wil! be paid into this account each month. If the amount standing to the credit of the account is not sufficient to pay the bounty, the deficiency will be made up from the",29,Setup

If a surplus is shown after claims for bounty have been paid, it will be applied to repay any amount taken out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and any remainder will be utilized for the encouragement of the export wine trade. It has been found necessary to tighten up the provisions relating to the prices to be paid for grapes and fortifying spirit used in the production of wine for export. Discounts, rebates or compensation given in order to secure sales will not be allowed. It has been the practice of wine-makers to pay for grapes by extended payments, and these sometimes cover a period of one year. In the case of co-operative companies the payments may extend over a much longer period. The bill provides that, a bond, guarantee, or cash deposit may be required to ensure that reasonable prices for grapes or fortifying spirit shall be paid within a specified time; failing that, the Government will have power to withhold the bounty. Provision is also made in the bill to protect not only the growers, but also the workers in the industry. The bounty acts relating to sulphur, power alcohol and cotton all contain a similar provision. It covers all labour in wineries and distilleries as well as that employed during vintage time. In conclusion, I wish to stress the point candid opinion that the people as a whole, that, without this legislation, the wine but particularly the manufacturers and industry would languish, and ruin or untheir employees, would occupy a substanemployment would face thousands of tially happier position without the estabthose engaged in the industry.

17,Mr Gullett (Henty) [4.22],"A thold that view because the alleged benefits that will be conferred upon manufacturing industries and the workers engaged in them, as well as upon the people of Australia as a whole, by the establishment of this industry on the lines proposed by the Minister, will not nearly balance the burdens imposed by this and other forms of assistance to the cotton-growing and spinning industry. In other words, I believe that the price which Australia will pay for the establishment of this industry will be much greater than the benefits that it will confer. with, perhaps, the exception of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr ber tariff schedule, on cotton yarn of the Hughes) agrees that costs of production, both primary and secondary, but particularly secondary, are excessive. The majority of people agree, also, that it is those Consequently the total tax in favour of excessive costs which have landed Australia in its present deplorable economic condition. Therefore, any action which is definitely calculated, as these cotton proposals are, to increase substantially our industrial costs is to be resolutely avoided. The various forms of assistance that have been and are to be given to this industry make up a list which is without parallel under the protective policy of this country. No other industry in the Commonwealth has had assistance covering the range of that given to the cotton industry. Minister wishes to establish it, the conclusion is inescapable that it will be easily the most expensive of our assisted industries. There is, firstj to be payable under this legislation a bounty to the growers of 1-Jd. per lb. of seed cotton. That represents 4.5d. upon every pound of cotton yarn of No. 16 count, which is one of the most popular counts used. Then it is proposed to assist the spinner who purchases the seed cotton and produces yarn from it. The bill provides for the payment of one-third of a penny per count per lb. of yarn spun in Australia. That represents 5.3d. per lb. of the resultant yarn of No. 16 count. It will, therefore, be seen that these two bounties combined represent assistance to the extent of 9§d. per lb. of yarn of No. 16 count. Let us see what that means in the form of an ad valorem duty. The landed price, duty paid, of this yarn £rom the r United States of America is Is. 7d. per Mr Oullett. lb. Therefore, these two proposed bounties are equivalent to an ad valorem duty of 50 per cent. But that is only the beginning of the assistance that this industry is to enjoy. In addition to the subsidy that the producer of the raw material and the spinner of the yarn are to receive, an exceedingly heavy fixed tariff operates against cotton wearing apparel of the kind that will be manufactured out of this yarn. The consumer, therefore, will be subjected to three imposts in respect of goods that are made from Practically everybody, locally grown cotton. The new duty imposed by this Government by its Novemnumber of counts per lb. that will be and is being spun in Australia, is 35 per cent. British and 55 per cent, foreign. cotton yarn spun in Australia from locally-grown cotton is 85 per cent, in the case of imports from Great Britain and 105 per cent, in the case of foreign imports. Approximately 75 per cent, of our imports come from Great Britain, and 25 per cent, from, other countries. Then again, exceedingly high duties operate, in respect of cotton wearing apparel. Any honourable member who takes the trouble to consult the November schedule will see that they are truly prohibitive in character. In some cases there are very high fixed or specific duties with an If it be established as the alternative ad valorem duty, while in other cases there is an additional ad valorem duty. So that, at every stage there is excessive protection of various kinds. I submit that the establishment and the extension of the cotton industry along those lines cannot fail to result in a substantial increase of our cost of living, with in turn a substantial increase of the basic wage, and generally of the cost of industrial production. I do not think that the price of any commodity bears more heavily than does the price of cotton upon the cost of living and the basic wage, and ultimately upon the cost of production. Cotton cloth, as we know, is, in the main, the clothing of the workers of nearly every country in the world, and of this country also. Cotton is to the clothing of the workers of Australia what bread 'and meat are to their diet. It is not possible to tax cotton goods heavily, as it is proposed to do in this bill, without adding substantially to the cost of . living and to tbe basic wage. ( Mr Forde) made it clear that the steps now being taken, although by no means negligible, represent only the beginning of his programme for the encouragement of the cotton industry of Australia. In his second-reading speech, he pointed out that £11,000,000 worth of cotton is imported into Australia annually, besides £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 worth of cotton material imported as part of other commodities. The Acting Minister addedA close inspection of the various items of his calculations? the cotton importations indicates that there should bo comparatively little difficulty in having at least £7,000,000 worth of that £11,000,000 worth of imported cotton goods efficiently and economically manufactured in Australia within a few years. I direct the attention of honourable members to his use of the expression "" efficiently and economically manufactured."" Further, the honourable gentleman anticipated that by 1936 the cotton industry would be worth £4,000,000 a year to the Commonwealth. I have no hesitation in saying that cotton goods produced under the conditions outlined by the Minister will cost Australian wearersmainly the workers-a t least twice as much as would cotton wearing apparel made out of duty-free imported cotton yarn. In my opinion it would pay Australia infinitely better to continue to enjoy the benefit of relatively cheap cotton materials made from imported yarn than to establish this so-called national industry at such an exorbitant cost. It is coming to this with the more fanatical protectionists-that war is being made against anything being cheap in Australia. This is the only nation in the world which is definitely following a policy directed against cheap services or cheap goods being obtained by its citizens. introduced by the present Government is really a disease. If we were following a sane policy we would'select a number of industries to protect. There are many industries for which Australia possesses special facilities. require first of all a sufficient market together with a suitable climate, adequate supplies of raw -materials, geographical fitness, and other favorable circumstances. We should then set out to build up these The Acting Minister selected industries as rapidly as we could, and give them every protection possible, subjecting them only to a proper amount of competition in the Australian market. member think that cotton might be regarded as such an industry? cotton as one of the industries which should be chosen. member leave economic security out of the honourable member means by that. Perhaps he will tell us when he is speaking to this measure. I am sure he will agree that "" economic security"" is a somewhat indefinite phrase. If we were following a sane policy, we would, after having selected those industries which were to receive assistance, take steps to provide for those engaged in them the cheapest services possible in the economic sense. We would make the going for them as easy as we could, and not as difficult as possible by cluttering their path with other industries of minor importance, or industries for which time and circumstances are not yet favorable. Instead of adopting that policy, however, the Government is indulging its mania for having everything we need manufactured in Australia. It is absurd to set it before ourselves as an ideal, that a widely scattered population of 6,500,000 people should make for themselves everything they use. That policy is a reversion to the economic and industrial dark ages-to the old self-contained village life. In regard to many of the articles which we are endeavouring by an unnatural system of protection to have manufactured in Australia, our action is just as foolish, in the economic sense, as The new sort of protection it would be for the Acting Minister to stay at home to make for himself a pair of boots. Indeed, to carry the thing, to a logical conclusion, he would need to run a farm on which to grow the leather to make the boots.

25,Mr Gullett,"I do not know, butcotton spinning mills of first class magnitude. We must remember also that Australia enjoys a much greater measure of natural protection in regard to her industries than does Canada. We Australians have the protection of many thousand miles of more or less expensive transport, whereas Canada has the great cotton spinning mills of the United States of America lying just across her border. Comparisons are sometimes made between this country and Canada. It is sometimes asked why Australia has an increasing debt, and increasing taxation, one iu seven of its workers out of employment, and a large adverse trade balance, with very little prospect of adjusting it, while Canada has little or no unemployment-the position tliere in that respect is normala great trade balance in her favour, prosperous industries that are booming, and a decreasing national debt and decreasing taxation. It is also asked, at times, why of Australia's total exports only between 2 per cent, and 3 per cent, are manufactured goods, while Canada's exportation of manufactured goods amounts to 40 per cent., in value, of her total exports. I have no doubt whatever that the reason for these differences is that the cost of production is very much higher in Australia than in Canada. Yet in spite of this fact we are actually proposing to oblige the Australian wearers of cotton apparel to pay from two to two and a half times as much for it as the Canadian wearers of cotton garments have to pay. This fact has brought me, most unhappily from a personal point of view, to the conclusion that I cannot support this proposal of the Government. The Acting Minister for Customs has prophesied, if not actually claimed, that within a few years from the inception of this great cotton developmental programme, cotton-growing in Queensland, which now provides seasonal employment for merely a few weeks in the year, for between 3,500 and 4,000 workers, will provide similar employment for between 25,000 and 30,000. That may be so, but all the facts make it abundantly clear that in order to provide this additional employment for a few weeks in the year, a definite and embarrassing burden will he placed upon about |'4!f] 1,000,000 Australian trade unionists who wear cotton clothing. We cannot gel away from the fact that if we double the cost of cotton clothing to these workers we shall seriously embarrass other industries in this country. I assert, without fear of truthful contradiction, that more unemployment than employment will be created if this scheme is agreed to. In the last resort, this measure will cause far more suffering among the workers of Australia than it will afford relief or prosperity. aware that the cotton-picking season extends over six months in the year, and not a few weeks? dict that statement.

This caused a number of foolish amateurs and propagandists to dream that it would remain high indefinitely, and that, therefore, it would be possible to grow cotton by white labour in Queensland at world's parity. Many farmers in Queensland were encouraged to plant areas of cotton. Subsequently the British1920.

Persistent political wire-pulling has been indulged in with the object, first, of pandering to the farmers for their votes, and secondly of securing for the shareholders in the British Australasian Cotton Association some return for their excountry and the tropical, low-lying coastal penditure. I am strongly of the opinion that had the Queensland and Commonwealth Governments been wise they would have cut the loss immediately the mistake was discovered. They certainly should have advised those who had embarked upon this enterprise to discontinue their operations. Had that been done a few years ago this unfortunate industrial episode in the north would have been closed and practically forgotten.

The climate in these areas, is comparable with that of any rural district in Australia. It is in no sense harsh. It is not, as a matter of fact;' as harsh as that of Canberra. These' districts are as healthy, livable and congenial as any district in north or north-east Victoria. This is due to the fact that although they lie towards the Tropic of Capricorn, they have an elevation of from 800 to 1,700 feet.

The Acting Minister( Mr Forde) may argue that cotton returns a crop at a very early stage and is, therefore, a suitable product to be grown in country that is being pioneered. Whilei t is true that a crop of cotton can be gathered within a few months of planting, the return from it is not nearly as quick as the return from dairying in similar districts. Tens of millions of acres of less desirable country in Australia have been pioneered without the help of cotton-growing, and without placing a heavy burden upon the whole community. On account of the unsatisfactory nature of the return, or the uncertainty of the crop, or the difficulty of getting pickers, even at the amazing rate of IJd. to 2d. per lb., as against slightly more than a £d. in America is all clone by black labour. Texas cotton picking is done chiefly by Mexican labour which it not black or coloured in the true sense. Do we propose to exclude every possibility of our manufacturing industries cutting down their costs? Would it not be better to have cheap imported cotton in the interests of our industries as a whole than to stimulate Australian production at exorbitant cost? The country in which the cotton is grown has a capital value to the farmers of very few pounds per acre. If it were located in Victoria or New South Walesi t would be worth five or six times as much, because it would be used for general farming purposes, and cotton cultivation would not be thought of. , leasehold. stand that the present Government in Queensland has given the leaseholders the right to convert to freehold. Already, without relying on cotton, the settlers are doing very well. One butter factory is situated in the middle of the area, and other factories are distributed in the surrounding districts. The Queensland Land Administration Board, in its report following an economic investigation of the Upper Burnett and Callide Valley lands, said of the Mundubbera districtFrom a dairying stand-point the district compares favourably with the best dairying districts in the State. Witnesses who appeared before us had previous experience on the land, on the Downs, at Nerajig, Lowood, Laidley, and Murgon. The consensus of opinion was that, with the aid of cultivation, a dairy herd in the Mundubbera district would return profits as good as in any of the other districts mentioned. Elsewhere the boar d r e p o r t e d We have already expressed the opinion that the Upper Burnett and Callide Valley lands are eminently adapted for a closer settlement scheme. Rich belts of country exist which bear comparison with anything to be found in other parts of Queensland, and if closer settlement could not succeed on such an area, the outlook for increased production in Queensland would be dismal indeed. The board recommendedThat the areas for new settlement in the Upper Burnett and Callide Valley be based on dairying rather than on agricultural pursuits. Agricultural pursuits, I remind honourable members, include the cultivation of cotton. The extent to which cotton aids these farmers has been very greatly exaggerated. In 1928-29 there were . 2,278 growers in Queensland, ahd nearly half of them had less than 10 acres under cotton. Presumably they were making a living out of dairying and other agricultural pursuits. As to spinning, I do not agree with a great deal that appears in the Tariff Board's report. With all respect to the board I say that it did not go deeply enough into the accounts of the only two spinning companies in Australia. For some years the George A. Bond Cotton Mills Limited has been the principal spinning enterprise fostered by the bounty. Unfortunately, the Tariff Board's report did not give any indication of the financial position of the spinning part of the enterprise, and while I was Minister for Trade and CustomsI arranged for a special investigation to be made by a departmental accountant. Those inquiries disclosed that the cotton-spinning part of Bond's",36,Second Reading

Had the board discovered as much of Bond's profits on cotton-spinning as was subsequently disclosed by special inquiry it would never have recommended an increase of the tariff. The special inquiry did not show that the Australian Silk and Cotton Mills Limited were making quite such good progress, but the greater proportion of the spinning was being done by Bond. The losses which forced that company into liquidation were due to the weaving rather than to the spinning side of the business. I have the greatest sympathy with the pioneer farmers in the areas where cottoi 1 is growing, and I am prepared, as I was when a Minister, to continue the bounty sufficiently long to enable them to change over gradually into dairying and.other rural industries for which their district is ideal and which would not require any subsidy from the Australian people. bounty and will ultimately disappear. when he was moving the second reading if he would guarantee that he would never be a party to an extension of the bounty, and I am sorry that he did not furnish an answer; he will not furnish it now. In regard to this or any other bounty a Minister's declaration that, it will last only a few years is not worth the ink with which it is printed. Once a bounty is granted no man can foretell its duration. All we know to-day is that the cotton-growing industry is quite small, and should have been continued on a very limited basis until it had proved itself. Unfortunately, the November tariff and this bill are imposing upon industry as a whole a heavily increased burden. T have no hesitation in prophesying that these measures will lead to a great increase in the cost of cotton apparel, which will be reflected in an increased basic wage, and so far from assisting the workers of this country they will indirectly be a continual cause of unemployment.

I support it but regret that the l i d . bounty is not continued, particularly in view of the importance of the cotton industry to the proper development of Australia. Japan is fully seized of the importance of the cotton industry. Since it cannot develop cotton-growing in its own territory it is developing cotton fields in Manchuria and South America. We have by experiment and experience discovered that Australia, and particularly Queensland, can grow cotton which is second to none in the world. Clear evidence of that is afforded by the returns from the sale of our cotton on the British market. Though the price obtained may not pay for production and shipping to Great Britain, still it is always above that of American middling. Much money has been expended by the Commonwealth and the Queensland Governments during the last few years in endeavouring to develop the cotton industry. Although some of the measures passed by those Governments have been of assistance, unfortunately others have been detrimental to the interests of the industry. Probably the greatest setback suffered by the industry during the last few years was due to misdirected legislative enactments by the late Queensland Government originated by interests whose ideas were foreign to Australian requirements and possibilities. A. few years ago the Queensland Government entered into the field of cotton development by accepting an offer of a. guaranteed price. Later the State offered a guaranteed price which was almost immediately subsidized by the Commonwealth Government under agreement.

45,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"and as a result a Commonwealth bill was introduced in 1926 providing for a bounty on seed cotton and yarn. The bill which has now been introduced is based on a further report made by the Tariff Board at the instance of the Bruce-Page Government. The board made certain suggestions which have been embodied in the bill. It provides for the payment, to the end of 1936, of £S00,000 liy way of bounty to the primary and secondary industries. passed by the Bruce-Page Government in 1.926 provided for a bounty of £900,000 in five years, but of that amount £610,000 was not applied for by those engaged in the industry. Therefore only £190,000 represents new appropriation. It is to bo hoped that on this occasion, with the assistance that is being rendered by the Queensland Government, the cotton industry will be developed in the interests, not only of the growers, but also Minister made thatstatement in condemof Australia as a whole. A tariff bas been imposed in order to give the necessary assistance to the cotton manufacturers, but as we produce to-day but little of the requirements of Australia, that tariff will chiefly be revenue productive for some years. It may be argued that; it will hit the worker by increasing the cost of clothing and other requirements of him and his family. But if Australia is to develop, we must encourage new industries. This legislation will be justified if ultimately the industry is able to produce at a reasonable cost the cotton requirements of this country. I certainly would support any measure designed to develop the secondary industries of Australia. I regret that in introducing the bill, the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) made use of party propaganda and misrepresentation concerning the Bruce-Page Government's activities on behalf of this industry. I this' or any other Government due credit for anything that it may do. But rhe growers that the facts should be misrepresented by the Actin'g Minister. All that it was necessary for him to do was to put forward a case in answer to any opposition to the bill. The Acting Minister stated that the first real fillip was given to the cotton industry in 1920, when the Queensland Labour Government fixed a guaranteed price of 5-kl. per lb. for three years. When looking through some of the records of the Queensland Hansard. I noticed that on page 264 of Hansard. -JSTO. 4 of 1922, Mr Theodore stated that an arrangement had been made between the Agent-General and the British CottonGrowers Association whereby that association guaranteed a. minimum price of The legislation Is. 6d. per lb -se a freight and insurance paid by the association-for cotton lint of good quality for five years from the 1st January, 1920. It is, therefore, apparent that the British Cotton-Growers Association, which in many directions has helped the dominions, was responsible for the fillip then given to the cotton industry, although the Acting Minister referred to it as being given by a Queensland Labour Government. The Acting nation of the Bruce-Page administration, and in order to bolster up the credit of the late Queensland Government. He misrepresented the facts, and I consider it my duty to devote some time to explaining the position and the history of the cotton industry. The Acting Minister also stated that it was recognized that n bounty should take the place of the State guaranteed price; it being realized that for many years the Commonwealth and Queensland were working together under an amicable agreement in providing a guaranteed price for the growers for seed cotton. But, he said when the Commonwealth Government took control the price dropped, and there was not the same stability in the industry, and in consequence the Queensland growers asked the Federal Government to provide a bounty instead of a guaranteed price. That statement is not in accordance with fact; because the Queensland cotton-growers, harassed under the legislation introduced by the am quite prepared to give to Queensland Labour Government, found it almost, impossible to carry on. That legislation provided for the banning of it cannot be the desire of ratoon cotton and for certain guarantees to the British-Australian Cotton Association Limited. It gave to that great combine a monopoly of the handling of the growers' cotton; it prevented the growers from erecting a co-operative ginnery, and it provided , for an agreement which lasted until 1926, under the association had the right to gin all the cotton produced land, at a return to the association of lid. per lb. of lint. The association also had the right under the agreement, to 1926, of acting as sole agent for the sale of cotton on a commission from 1J per cent, to 2£ per cent on cotton seed other than that required for planting purposes; all by-products to be the property of the association. I have stated previously that certain State legislation had caused much trouble in the industry, but the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs endeavoured to lay that trouble at the door of the Bruce-Page Actually the late Labour Government of Queensland was responsible for most of the trouble of the cotton-growers of that State and faulty grading was responsible for the balance. It brought about a reduction in the production .of cotton and aroused much ill-feeling against it. only did the Queensland Government give the British-Australian a monopoly of the ginning of all cotton, but it appointed it sole agent for the selling of the cotton in Great despite directors cotton growers for their cotton sold on the market. land Labour Government growers' cotton seed to the tralian Cotton Association. association was to have, under the agreement, all seed free; in 1924 and 1925, seed at £1 a ton, and in 1926 seed at £1 10s. a ton.

Mr Bernard Corser. which and also of the promise of the Government to ban the growing of ratoon cotton, in Queensthe growers became considerably perturbed in Queensland, and resolutions were passed demanding an alteration of extending the conditions. It is not a fact, as the Acting Minister stated in his secondranging reading speech, that the Queensland growers, backed up by the Queensland Government, asked the Federal Government to pay a bounty instead of a guaranteed price. On the"" 20th March, 1925, a meeting was held at Rockhampton of the Central Queensland District Cotton Council, at which the following resolution wa3 carriedGovernment. Tliat this district council, representing 2,000 cotton-growers, endorses the activities of the Cotton Advisory Board and the Council of Agriculture in the desire for the de-control of the cotton industry, and supports the approach to the Commonwealth Government for a flat rate bounty of l i d . per lb. on raw cotton for a period of years; the foregoing Not resolution to be forwarded to the Council of Agriculture, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Home and Territories, the State and New Cotton Association South Wales Ministers of Agriculture, and Queensland senators.

That is one illustration of many that During that period seed in could be given of the fact that up to the was worth up to £13 time of the guarantee the industry was in a precarious condition. The resolumixed tion that I have read cannot be disputed, because it emanates from the city which is the coastal centre of the great cotton growing districts and in the district of Capricornia. Therefore, it is hardly f a i r to say, as the Acting Minister did, of the misthat the industry commenced to suffer that brought about the after the Federal Government had The State Labour assumed control of it . So depressed was also gave to this comthe industry at that time that the Central a monopoly of the handling Queensland' District Council passed which has been a resolutions in which the following pasto the Australian sages occurred:As a. result of that agreement. Despite the weight of evidence clearly favoring ratooning, the interests of the farmers of Queensland have been sacrificed in the interests of a dictatorial combine. That is the British-Australian Cotton Association, which instructed the Queensland Government as to what it should put in. its legislation and what agreement it would require. The following further claims were madeThat the Government has failed in its protection of the farmers' interests by accepting the bald statement that ratoon cotton is not legal tender, and neglecting to make early departmental efforts by way of an independent inquiry following the despatch of trial consignments to various markets of the world . . . That the Government has no evidence tp prove that the ratooning we desire encourages disease and pest infection more seriously than annual planting . . . Under the circumstances this district council pledges itself to exhaust every avenue of endorsement of its protest and desire for a royal commission of inquiry, and seeks the support of the Council of Agriculture and all district councils in furtherance of its efforts to give effect to such desire. Local producers' associations, numbering 30 or 40, also passed resolutions at that time expressing their dissatisfaction, at the state of affairs in the ActingM in ister's own district, and I have copies of these resolutions. Large areas could not be picked because of the harassing restrictions of the legislation which had beeu passed by the Queensland Government. At the request of the growers, Mr Bruce asked the Tariff Board to inquire into the industry. Thati n quiry was held, and the board submitted a report upon which action was taken by the then Commonwealth Government. was for a bounty of l £ d . During the investigation by the Tariff Board, however, a bounty of 2d. per lb. was asked for. The board reported in favour of that amount of bounty, but the late Government made provision for the payment of l ^ d . per lb. In addition, however, it made provision for assistance to the secondary portion of the industry, although that had not been asked for by the growers, the Queensland Government, or any one else. Under the 1926 act suflicient provision was made to give an impetus to the secondary industry. Thus the late Government was the first to give encouragement to that portion of the industry. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) now says that ultimately the whole of the assistance given by the Government w ill go to the secondary industry, and that the bounty to the grower will be dropped. The late Government provided for the payment of a bounty on yarn containing up to 50 per cent, of Australian cotton. This measure provides that the proportion of Australian cotton must be 100 per cent., thus increasing the advantages that are to be derived by the secondary industry. Very shortly no bounty w ill be paid to the grower. years. the bounty for first grade w ill be I d . in stead of l ^ d . per lb. and for second grade i d . per lb. One difficulty with which the grower has always had to contend is that of grading, and unfortunately he has had to be content with the price paid for second grade. In subsequent years the bounty w ill be still further diminished, until in 1936 it w ill be .a half-penny for the higher grade and a f a r t h in g for the lower. It will thus be seen that this Government has seized upon the proposals of the 'last Government; it has adopted the rate of l ^ d . per lb. for one year and then a lower rate, and has even encouraged the idea of looking to our secondary industry for help in the future. That is the proposal which was adopted by the Bruce-Page Government, for which, for political reasons, it received the abuse of a certain member of this Parliament. strangled the secondary industry by not protecting it . never asked to protect it . Such statements are merely good electioneering propaganda. Protection for the secondary industry was asked for only after the first bounty had been in operation. The Bruce-Page Government then referred the matter to the Tariff Board. Before the report of the Tariff Board received final consideration the late Government went out of office. It is on the results of that investigation by the T a r i ff Board that the present Government has based this bill. nine months in which to act, yet it did nothing.",38,Second Reading

It cannot be denied, however, that the whole of the information was available for the present Government when it came into office. what the last Government failed to do in nine months. shows that all tlie necessary investigations had been made; but I make no excuses for the late Minister's handling of the matter. I was hoping daily that he would bring down a measure to give assistance to the industry. AlthoughI support the provisions of this measure, I object to tbe party politiraising £250,000 to be used in helping cal feeling that has been introduced. T had hoped that the Minister would put destroy any opposition to the proposal; people of Australia of the advantage the industry is to them and that we grow the best cotton in the world; that he would acquaint them of the wonderful areas in his electorate, and in Queensland generally, that can grow cotton, of the amount of labour that is employed in the industry, and of its value to not only Queensland, but also the whole of Australia. Instead of doing that, however, he dealt with' smaller issues. The Minister must realize that the Government and people of the'State interested play an important part in the development of the cotton industry. There is in Queensland to-day a government which is assisting the industry in every way possible. The Commonwealth Government can do little other than give a bounty or impose protective duties. The Queensland Government has guaranteed 5d. per lb. to the cotton-growers of that State this year, and this has given an impetus to the industry. During the last few months it has made arrangements for taking over the cotton mills, ginneries, &c, of the British-Australasian Cotton Association, at a cost of £155,000, plus £18,000 for reconditioning the plant, and it will place these works at the disposal of the farmers to work co-operatively.

Queensland Government did not merely guarantee a loan for the 5d. per lb. it has guaranteed the growers. and the honourable member knows it. ing Minister is trying to take away from the Government of Queensland any "" kudos "" to which it is entitled for its assistance to the cotton industry.

Dealing with this aspect of the matter the Acting Minister saidI have interviewed the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and asked him whether he could make arrangements to lend the Agricultural Bank of Queensland on tlie security of an approved debenture to lie issued by that institution, the sum of £250,000 for the financial j'ear beginning the 1st of July, 1930.

Those agreed upon by the Commonwealth and engaged in the industry are confident, we State Governments, on condition that the Federal Government also contributed an extra half-penny per lb. As a matter of fact, the Acting Minister knows that the Bruce-Page Government did not shirk its responsibility to pay 50 per cent, of the extra price agreed on. This is what the late Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, said ou this matter, as reported in the pressMr Bruce expressed surprise at the action Mr Forgan Smith had taken. No representations, he said, had been made by tlie Queensland Government to the Commonwealth Government ou the subject. As the rates of the guarantee for the present season were adopted in agreement with the State Governments concerned (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia), it was most improper for the Queensland Government to have announced its intention to increase the guarantee, subject to the Commonwealth Government taking the same course, without consulting either the Commonwealth or the other State Governments, with whom the basis of the guarantee had been arranged. That statement was made on the eve of a State election in Queensland, and, though the extra guarantee was conceded, the growers, unfortunately, did not receive the full benefit of it. The following is an extract from a newspaper circulating in the Acting Minister's district. I quote from the issue of the 11th June, 1926, as follows:According to our so-called experts, the last' crop, just harvested, was the best in the history of cotton-growing in Queensland. If the best crop is worth only 4-kl. per lb., what is the worse going to bring? Many growers did not average 4-id. The State Government promised the cotton-grower an extra half-penny on the eve of the State election. Many growers here prophesied that it would be taken out of them iu the grading. They were right.

63,Mr Bernard Corser,"The honare told, that if the present proposal goes through, the industry w ill be placed on a sound footing; but they were equally confident of that after the 1926 proposals were carried. The Acting Minister has said that those 1926 proposals were responsible for the present depressed state of the industry; yet after the b ill was passed the then Ministerf or Agriculture in the Queensland Government saidIn view of tlie approach of the coming planting season, tlie Minister for Agriculture and Stock( Mr Forgan Smith) informed the press recently that it was desirable to take stock of the present situation in the light of last year's experience. The prospects ahead of the cotton industry were at the present time bright, and such as to afford encouragement to cotton growers to increase their area. . . . The Queensland Cotton Board, operating under marketing organization legislation initiated by the Government, has been successful in improving marketing conditions generally. . . . . Owing to the establishment of cottonmanufacturing industries in Australia the whole of the 1927 crop has been marketed within the Commonwealth at prices based on import parity This was done under the act which the Acting Minister has so roundly condemned. Mr Forgan Smith also said:The department's officers are available at all times to advise intending growers and in the meantime it is hoped that every opportunity will be taken by farmers to avail themselves of the favorable prospects at present existing in this promising industry. The measure introduced by the Bruce Page Government to which I have referred did a great deal for this industry; and the fact that the manufacturers later discovered that they needed additional assistance was no faul t of that Government. The manufacturers asked, through the Queensland Cotton Board, for additional protection, and Mr Bruce did not turn a deaf ear to tlieir requests. He called upon the Tariff Board to make a complete investigation into the whole industry. It is upon the report that the board made at that time that these proposals have been founded. I sincerely trust that the"" Commonwealth and Queensland Governments will work in harmony, with the object of developing the cotton industry along successful lines, and that efforts will not be made to gain a party advantage at the expense of the growers or the industry in general. Assistance should be given to the cotton-growers in a national Mr Bernard Corser. and not with the object of making party political capital. The industry must be developed on both the primary and secondary side, and because I believe that this measure w ill do something to that end, I shall, while deploring the attitude adopted by the Acting Minister, support it . Like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) and the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Cffrser), I protest against the extraordinarily childish display of political jealousy of which the Acting Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) was guilty in introducing this bill. It was unworthy of the M in ister, and not in the best interests of the industry, and I am certain that it will be"" revolting to the growers, who are f u l l y aware of the assistance given their industry by the late Hon. E . Pratten, when he was Ministerf or Trade and Customs. I believe that the Minister, on reflection, must be sorry for the manner in which he introduced the bill. He should have endeavoured to create a spirit of goodwill, but speeches of the kind he delivered cannot possibly have that effect. I have always done my best to encourage the development of the cotton industry in Queensland, because I believe it to be one of the few remaining big industries which can be developed in Australia on both the primary and secondary side with advantage to the whole community. If the industry is developed along right lines, it w ill provide many new channels of employment. Hitherto, it has had a chequered career in Australia. The first efforts to develop it were made as f a r back as 1860, and ten years later the area under crop had increased from fourteen to upwards of. 14,000 acres. For thirty years it had many ups and downs. In 1903, and again in 1913, fresh interest was shown in the cotton crop, but a determined effort was made to resuscitate it in 1920, when the system of guaranteed prices was introduced by the Queensland Government. The Queensland Government at that time guaranteed the prices of cotton, and continued to do so until 1925 or 1926, when it withdrew its support and threw the spirit,",43,Second Reading

Up to that time the Federal and State Governments had shared the losses incurred in the marketing of cotton at the guaranteed price. It was only after the Tariff Board had, at the request of the late Government, made a thorough investigation into the industry that comprehensive proposals were brought down by the then Minister for Trade and Customs, the late Hon. H . E. Pratfen, with the object of putting it on a firm footing. Prior to that time endeavours had been made to establish the industry in Australia by growing the seed cotton here and marketing it overseas in competition with cotton grown in black-labour countries. A great deal of difficulty was experienced in selling our cotton on the London market. Mr of assisting the secondary side of Pratten devised the scheme of granting a bounty for both primary and secondary cotton .. production. introduced provided for the payment of a bounty of £900,000 over a number of years. Of that amount £600,000 was to be paid in respect of seed cotton produced in Australia and £300,000 in respect of manufactured yarn half of the material of which had been produced in Australia. That policy showed the way to ultimate success. Many difficulties occurred, however, which could not possibly have been foreseen and neither the Minister nor the Government could fairly be held responsible. One of the chief of these was the failure of G. A. Bond and Company Limited, Australia's biggest cotton spinners, which was compelled to go into liquidation. not because of the lack of assistance from the Government, but because of its over-capitalization and bad management. The Chairman of Directors of the company, Mr George A. Bond, drew such exorbitant fees that after the company was forced to go into liquidation, the Courts of New South Wales were asked to decide whether the sums drawn by him were reasonable, and he was ordered by the court to refund approximately £90,000 to the company. Extraordinary and extravagant salaries were also paid to a number of relatives and friends of Mr Bond. It tion under such conditions. There is not the slightest doubt that had the company been conducted on proper lines, the measure of assistance granted to the industry by the Bruce-Page Government would have led to ultimate success and great stimulation of the cotton-growing industry in Queensland. The failure of this company, and the failure of certain large British spinning companies to establish branch factories in Australia, as Mr Pratten was led to understand that they would do, compelled the Cotton Board to sell our cotton on the world's markets, instead of to the manufacturers in Australia. Fortunately a certain measure of success was achieved for some time while the factories operated, but unless some definite method the industry can be devised and more factories set up in Australia, The measure he real success cannot be obtained. The Acting Minister has been touring the country telling the people that a number of factories are to be established in Australia. I sincerely hope that that will be so; otherwise the industry cannot possibly be put upon a sound footing. The secondary side of this industry must be developed simultaneously with the primary side. I sincerely regret the tenor of the speech of the Acting Minister in introducing this bill, and suggest that he take a leaf out of the book of the late Mr Pratten. Mr Pratten's speech, reported in Hansard of 5th August, 1926, is a statesmanlike utterance entirely free That company failed;, from party political prejudice. That honourable gentleman was a very successf u l business man, and a great protectionist. I feel the House should dissociate itself from any statements purporting to blame him or his colleagues. He threw all his energy into devising a policy which would enable the cotton industry to be developed on the primary and secondary side. I should consider it unworthy of me, being continuously associated with him in handling this industry, if I did not pay my tribute to his endeavours to stabilize the industry in Australia. I wish to quote from the official report of a deputation which waited upon the late Mr Pratten to request his assistance for the cotton industry, to show that those engaged in the industry had every confidence in him and appreciated his work. Mr G. E. McDonald, the chairman of the Queensland Cotton Board at the time, in his introductory remarks to Mr Pratten saidBefore dealing with the various subjects I would just like to say that on reading your ' press statement yesterday, one could not help but bo struck with tlie wonderful achievement which seemed to be imminent in regard to the influx of capital in the cotton industry. It appeared to be remarkable iu so brief a time following on the legislation referred to, and I think it will be accepted that that legislation stands as a landmark in the interests of what I am sure will be accepted as one of the most important industries in the making that we have in the Commonwealth. After various other speakers , had expressed their appreciation of Mr £11,000,000 per annum. An industry of the deputation withdrew, said thisAt the opening of this interview I expressed the appreciation of the board at meeting you. At the termination .[ would like to express a greater, appreciation for the manner iu which' you have met the request put before you. ] shall support this measure because I think that we should do everything possible to encourage the development of this industry in Australia, but I believe that it is essential that Commonwealth and State Ministers should work in harmony with those who are engaged in it.. We shall not be able to achieve real success while we have a Minister of the Commonwealth Government expressing himself as the Acting Minister did in introducing this bill. We must do everything possible to create a spirit of goodwill. will save the industry from ruin. I am hopeful that with the establishment of other cotton manufacturing firms in Australia and with the development of cooperation and goodwill, this industry will, before long, be stabilized. I hope that the policy laid down by the late Mr tile industry, and if honourable members Pratten will be vigorously pursued, and that the Government will build on the structure he laid down. I trust that the bill will have a speedy and safe passage. I should not have spoken on this measure unless I had been forced, through my absence from the sitting at which the Minister introduced the bill, to read his second-reading speech upon it. I found in the speech not a helpful explanation of the measure, but a series of extravagant party political statements made for propaganda purposes. These statements were not in accord with the facts, and 1 were certainly not in keeping with the importance of the subject. The textile industry is one of the most important in a manufacturing .country. Great Britain was able to win her supremacy in trade and commerce largely through her textile industries. The Acting Minister( Mr Eorde) himself pointed out that roughly one-fourteenth of our total imports are cotton textile goods. These are valued at about this magnitude should have been discussed with dignity, and not in the manner adopted by the Ministry in introducing this bill. In order to refresh my memory as to the facts of the case, I read the speech made by a former Minister for Trade and Customs, the late honourable H . E. Pratten, in introducing the Cotton Bounty Bill in 1926, and I advise honourable members who are interested in this subject to do the same. That speech was a most statesmanlike utterance, and one of the best that has been delivered in this Parliament on such a subject. It stands in striking contrast to the speech of the present Minister. It was entirely without party tinge. As the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) pointed out, the proposals which the then Government ten on his own initiative; they were not suggested by the Tariff Board, which originally dealt only with the primary industry. Mr Pratten himself was responsible for propounding a scheme to assist and establish the texwill read his speech they will gain some conception of the position which that industry should occupy in the life of the community.

Not only is the speech filled with party propaganda and misrepresentationsof the actions of the previous Government, but it makes some extraordinary claims as to what this bill will do. For instance, he stated that it would give employment to between 25,000 and 30,000 seasonal workers. the Minister suggest? Does he mean that 30,000 seasonal workers will be employed at the end of six years? To-day he said in reply to an interjection that the seasonal workers are employed for approximately six months in the year. season extended over a period of six months. Leader of the Opposition said that the pickers would be employed for not more than a few weeks, and more than once the Acting Minister corrected him. season extends over a period of six months; the period of employment will vary from one month to three or four months. Minister opens his mouth he makes a different statement as to the number of men who will be employed and the duration of their employment. In effect he says that in six years time the industry will have an annual value of £4,000,000, that 30,000 seasonal workers will be engaged in picking the crop, and they will be employed for roughly four months in the year. Presumably they will be employed at not less than the basic wage, which means that they will earn about £100 in four months; 30,000 people will earn £3,000,000 for picking, and this will leave £1,000,000 to cover the whole of the development of the industry between the ginning of the crop and the production of the finished article or fabric. The statement trying to evade is of him. He goes about the country and in the most expansive manner declares that 50,000 men will be employed on certain works. In the next town he increases the number to 100,000, but when he is pinned down to facts his boom bubbles are quickly pricked. If the 30,000 seasonal workers are to earn only £2,000,000 the average earning per man will be about £60 a year. Nothing could do more harm to this industry than the extravagant statements that are continually made by the Acting Minister. In Brisbane recently at a conference where everybody was in favour of his proposals, the chairman of the Cotton Board, and Mr Webster and others, rebuked the Minister for his excessive optimism and extravagant statements. ber is annoyed because he failed at that conference. only because this industry is being misrepresented in the eyes of the public. Great staple industries should not be used as political pawns; they should be recognized as the source of the well-being aud prosperity of our people, and if they are to be exploited for the purposes of party politics, measures for their development, will not receive that general support to which they are entitled. Excessive optimism is 'characteristic of the Minister, and even his very sanguine associates at the Brisbane conference said that his statements were not warranted by facts. When the Minister moved the second reading of this bill, he was ready to put a factory in every district. He told the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) that one might be established at Ipswich and another would certainly he built at Rockhampton, and as a result of his statements the poor deluded people of that port expected wealthy people to come along immediately and start a factory. When he visited Rockhampton, however, he said that they must scour the world themselves for manufacturers who would establish themselves there. If the Minister will confine himself to facts, and deal with broad, general principles in a statesman-like and nonthat he is now partisan way, we shall advance more characteristic rapidly to tlie solution of our problems. All these industries that he is bolstering up are to provide more employment immediately; one day he says that 100,000 more men, and next day, 200,000 more men, will be provided with work.

I ask honourable members to contrast the policy of this Government in relation to cotton with that propounded by Mr Pratten on behalf of the Bruce Page Ministry. proposed, that the Commonwealth and State Governments should each guarantee a proportion of any possible loss that might be suffered by the growers, and the maximum liability of the Commonwealth in any year was in 1925-26 about £80,000. Labour responsibilities and all the growers had unanimously asked for government decontrol of the industry, because of the harsh treatment they had received from the State Ministry, the Bruce-Page Government introduced a bill for the payment of a bounty of £150,000 a year for six years. That is to say, the Commonwealth Government provided a bounty on its own initiative twice as great as any help previously given. Mr Forgan Smith, then Minister for Agriculture in Queensland, -welcomed the proposal, which he said was a better solution of the problem than he had previously dared hoped for. that time the cotton industry had always been dealt with from the point of view of primary production. There was no expectation of the early development of the textile industry in Australia. The bounty was proposed by the then Commonwealth Government to enable the growers to carry on despite the fact that they had to sell their product in the markets of the world. The Tariff Board examined the industry from that angle, .and reported in favour of a bounty on raw cotton. Mr Pratten, however, urged that we should endeavour to ensure that Australian cotton should be converted into the finished article in Australian mills. He propounded a scheme to this end, and a further submission was made to the Tariff Board, which recommended a bounty on yarn at a flat rate of 6d. per lb. It ignored the fact that there are various classes of yarns. This bill provides for 41 counts. In spite of the fact that one kind of cotton may be thick and another thin and thus more difficult and expensive to handle and make, the Dr. Earle Page. board suggested a flat rate. Mr Pratten decided that the best way to assist the industry was to pay a higher rate of bounty for the finer counts of cotton, and only a small rate for the thicker counts, and the principle he thus laid down as a result of his own observation, Originally it was experience, and initiative, is preserved in this bill. He provided that the annual bounty of £150,000 should be distributed in the proportion of £120,000 for the growers 'of raw cotton, and £30,000 for the secondary producers. The manufacturers were to enjoy the bounty only until Yet when the Queensland such time as they were able to supply Government repudiated its approximately .the whole of Australia's requirements, when deferred duties of 20. 30 and 35 per cent, would come into operation. The bounty was to remain at the rate of l£d. per lb. for a number of years. The Acting Minister( Mr Forde), who was then a private member, was always demanding that the bounty should be increased to 2d. per lb. Now that he is able to give effect to his own ideas he still proposes a bounty of 1-Jd., and even that, will diminish. Board and the spinners ask for. Up to champion of the cotton-growers, the honourable member, when a private member, demanded a bounty of 2d. or nothing; as a Minister with an opportunity to give effect to a definite policy he proposes a bounty of l^d. diminishing, to ^d. by 1936, and in respect of lower grades of seed cotton fd., diminishing to i d . Mr Pratten pointed out that his bounty of 1-J-d. on raw cotton and a further bounty to stimulate the manufacture of textiles were worth much more to the industry than the straight out bounty of 2d. per lb. which the honourable member for Capricornia demanded at that time. It will be remembered that at that time the Minister made a definite arrangement with the Australian manufacturers that they should buy the cotton ginned in Australia at a rate equivalent to that ruling at Liverpool, plus the cost of freight to Australia.

In the meantime the industry would be built up by means of a bounty. Under the present Government's proposals, however, there is operating, not only a bounty, but a duty of 35 per cent., 50 per cent., and 55 per cent., even before there is any actual production to wholly meet Australian requirements. increased duty w ill undoubtedly increase the cost of -living of everybody in Australia who wears cotton goods, because it is quite evident that for at least a year or two we shall not be able to supply our own cotton requirements. The increased duty, together with the bounty, means, as' pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition, a duty of 105 per cent, on all cotton goods included in the tariff schedule. No one would accuse the late Mr Pratten of being anything else but a protectionist, and when he was Ministerf o r Trade and Customs he considered that 20 per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent, was reasonable protection to the industry. Canada has imposed a 7-J per cent, duty against Great Britain, and a 20 per cent, duty against the United States of America. It has thus been able to develop an industry which uses 180,000 bales of cotton every year, and in addition it exports overseas. Surelyi t must be evident to every member of the community that the cure for our economic ills is to be found, not in a continual increase of duties, but rather in the correction of the industrial and economic conditions of this country. We must cheapen the cost of production. In 1925 the late Mr Pratten attempted to cheapen the cost of production by removing some 60 items of duty from the tariff schedule. Those duties applied to articles not made in Australia. I venture to say that if we were to remove the duties on the machinery and electrical equipment used by this and other industries not made on a large scale in Australia, there would be little need to impose additional duties on cotton i m portations. I have a strong I support the bill. It does not deal with the question of increased duties. My chief complaint is that it provides of the manufacfor a declining bounty for the cottongrower.

At any increased duties when the tariff schedule is before the House for discussion. ringah) [8.52] -There are some industries in this country which have been protected and from which the benefits to be derived are inadequate compared with the cost involved. I yield to no man in my desire to support and encourage secondary industries in Australia, but I contend that they should be built up This on some scientific basis, and not assisted by duties and bounties devised in a haphazard and slipshod fashion. A recent publication, known as H i e Australian Tariff, contains these wordsOur conclusions on effects indicate that the total burden of the tariff has probably reached the economic limits, and an increase in this burden might threaten the standard of living. It is important, therefore, that no further increases in, or extensions of, the tariff should be made without the most rigorous scrutiny of the costs involved. The following is a further paragraph in regard to bountiesBounties are more economical th..u protective duties, and are preferable on all grounds except financial expediency. They should be adopted as the method of protection when the industry is in an early and experimental stage. If and when the industry is established a tariff duty could be substituted, and the amount necessary more accurately determined. W it h those views I entirely agree. This particular industry, before this bill is passed, should receive the closest consideration and investigation. It is proposed to expend anything up to £1,000,000 of the taxpayers' money, to establish the cotton industry. Let me remind the House that we have already paid bounties of £1,700,000 to the iron and steel industry, of £280,000 to the sulphur industry, of",48,Second Reading

We were told this afternoon that the total payments under the Wine Bounty Export Act have reached the enormous sum of £.1,313,677. There is, therefore, something over £4,000,000 involved in our endeavour to establish some four industries. I submit that those industries do not to-day indicate that they are worth the money that has been expended upon them. Not only is a bounty to be paid to the cotton-grower, but, as has been pointed out by the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), it is to be accompanied by a high duty. mind, cotton will be produced in this country only at a cost which will not allow any of it to be exported, and the secondary industries that use Australian cotton will need to extort excessive prices from the community to pay for the cost of Considerable interest has been displayed in this House in regard to the grower of cotton, but not one word has been said in regard to the hundreds of thousands of . people who will have to buy this cotton in the manufactured state. entitled to some consideration in this Commonwealth Parliament? Arc we not concerned with the cost of the cotton requirements of the working men of this country? Why should they be charged four and five times the price at which similar goods can be purchased in other 'countries? This legislation will mean a good deal to those interested in the cotton industry, but what will it mean to the ' woman who has to drag five or six children around with her while looking for the cheapest shop at which to expend the portion of his weekly wage given to her by her husband? Not one word has been said in this Parliament on her behalf. On the other hand, the Acting Minister has blithely advocated an enormous expenditure to establish an industry which must have only one effect, and that is to increase the costs under which the workers of this country are struggling, and these are excessive. I have done my utmost for many years to assist in establishing industries, but on scientific lines. I am not prepared to ilr. Archdale Parkhill. vote for the expenditure of public money, when the principal effect will be to making increase the cost of living of hundreds of thousands of our workers, who are to-day finding it most difficult to obtain their bare needs with their wages. able member mean when he uses the term "" scientific lines "" ? There are in almost every audienee persons who are only too ready to treat with derision such a statement as that to which the honourable member draws attention. I do not blame him for asking this question; 1 refer merely to the manner in To my which his interjection was received. Any person who does not support an industry which a government backs with the people's money is charged in certain quarters with being un-Australian and unprepared to support Australian industries. Nothings ; simpler than to vote other people's money, manufacture. and it is an excellent means of making a good fellow of oneself. I am prepared to risk being misunderstood when I say that I wish to conserve the interests not. only of the manufacturer and the grower of cotton, but also of that very much larger Are they not section, the great consuming public, Avhich has to buy the finished article, and which is prejudicially affected by the establishment of an industry under unfavorable conditions. When I referred to a scientific tariff I had in mind the establishment of industries in conditions that arefavorable, and in such a manner that the cost of living will not be excessively increased thereby, but on the contrary, reduced. .The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) has pointed out that, on the reports of the Queensland Government itself, the land upon which it is proposed to spend all this money to produce this cotton at an excessive cost is. more suited to mixed farming, and the production of commodities that not only will be of value to the people of Australia, but will also have an exportable value, and thus bring into this country what is needed more than anything else, namely, new money. That is an additional reason why this measure should not receive the support that the Minister has sought for it. It has been pointed out, also, that not only is tbe bounty with which this industry",49,Second Reading
83,Mr Stewart,What does the honor,50,Second Reading

Yet Canada-where , according to the Minister, the conditions are not nearly so favorable as they are in Australia -ha s established its industry without the aid of a bounty, and with a duty of only 7^ per cent. British and 20 per cent, foreign. Under these circumstances we should pause before we commit ourselves to the expenditure of this large sum of money, and ask ourselves whether it is worthwhile to confer a benefit upon only one State and, what is more, upon only the limited number of people who are engaged in the industry in that State, and the secondary industry that is connected with it . Surelyi t is the policy of this Government not to give concessions to little groups, but to consider the citizens as a. whole! Judged on that basis this legislation will be of no real value, except to the growers of cotton and the manufacturers, who will thus be enabled, as other persons engaged in industries that are similarly protected have been, to make profits. Let us consider for a moment the number of constituencies in which not a single elector will benefit. The only interest in the matter that will be taken by, say, a Ballarat elector w ill be the price at which he can purchase his cotton, goods. This bounty will cause a very considerable increase on the prices he has formerly paid. It is the working man with a large family who w ill be most affected by this bounty. If the representatives of the workers in this Parliament heap this grinding taxation on the backs of their constituents, I cannot see how they can escape their wrath when the people become alive .to its significance. Broadly speaking, I have found it very difficult for many years to j u s t if y the general principle of assisting industries by giving bounties. But in this case one cannot overlook the fact that, a critical situation exists. Listening to honourable members opposite addressing themselves to this subject, one would imagine that they had never been associated with either the policy of giving bounties to industries or the policy of fiscal protection. During the last ten years, every action that bas been taken in respect to the granting of bounties to assist a particular industry, or the imposition of duties that necessarily have the same effect, has altered the relativity of every other industry to the particular industry that has been favoured. Fundamentally, 1 do not: see that there is very much distinction between the policy outlined by this bill and that which was laid down by the previous Government. That Government, argued that it was desirable to support the cotton industry, which is located in Queensland, and as the honourable member for ""Warringah ( Mr Archdale Parkhill) has just said, does not. extend even over the whole of that, State. B u f whatever objections may be raised to the support that this nation is asked to give to a particular locality, because of certain circumstances, those objections can be of no force when coming from h i m ; because the honourable member himself supported a Government which considered those objections as of not sufficient, consequence. support any proposals of this character. the Opposition are hopelessly divided upon this bill.

The ground upon which I support this bill is that of national importance and national emergency. I propose to read an extract from a report made by the Tariff Board. I assume that that board, with its customary deliberation, and w i th that judicial temperament which in the last Parliament the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition claimed for its members, investigated this matter very carefully, and quite f a i r l y . Dealing w i th the subject of national defence it saidAs has previously been pointed out, cotton is a most important, in fact an indispensable commodity, in time of such national emergency; seeing that it not only plays a vital part, in the manufacture of munitions, but is also essential in many phases of defence equipment. Having in mind the place which cotton holds in the domestic, industrial, econois to assist in the establishment and demic and national life of tlie country, the Tariff velopment of an important, primary inBoard has no hesitation in expressing the view that the development and successful establishment of the cotton-grow ing industry in Australia is not only desirable but vitally essential to the welfare of the Commonwealth. ""What steps do honourable members opposite propose to take in order to assist the development of this industry, is vitally necessary to the welfare of the Commonwealth? there should be done other than what is proposed to be done by means of this bill? That seems a reasonable and proper question. The bill itself merely extends principles which the previous Government laid down, actuated, probably, by the same reasons as move this Government. tralia imports £11,000,000 worth of cotton goods each year. Our present difficulties are admittedly attributable the fact that we have a gigantic adverse trade balance largely .due to the importation of goods which this country does not produce. Surely the rectification of that evil lies chiefly in the production of goods which we do not now make. Air. Curtin. secondary industries here cannot manufacture for export. our adverse trade balance the first thing to do is to produce for our own market many of the goods we have hitherto imported. Buti t is necessary for a country first to satisfy its own market before it can consider exporting. That is a fundamental principle which has been recognized by all exporting countries of the world. most of the manufacturers never go beyond the point of supplying the home market. our Australian .manufacturers except in so f a r as the industries in which they are engaged are essential to the security of the nation. I regard them merely as agents in the scheme of national existence. As persons they have been lacking in many of the qualities that might reasonably be expected of those who have received so many favours. Thisb ill is designed not merely to stimulate a national industry; its paramount purpose dustry. It has also for its object the distribution of population throughout Australia. It does not aim to provide additional constituents for members who represent great metropolitan electorates. It w ill have a profound decentralizing effect.

It is carried on in one of Australia's tropical States, and in that Do they propose that part of Australia which is most likely to be a danger spot in the future.

The honourable member has been a supporter of many protective duties, and in the course of 1 the speech which he has just concluded he professed to believe in a modicum of protection. Yet even the smallest degree of protection confers a concession upon some one, so that the honourable member's argument is defective. In the past, Parliament has at least tried to assist the cotton industry. The last Government endeavoured to do so through the instrumentality of the tariff, and by the payment of a bounty. This Government is seeking to do the same thing in the same way. The' objection of honourable members opposite seems to savour of that particular kind of party propaganda which the honourable members for Moreton( Mr He may have been more sincere when he Francis) and Wide Bay( Mr Bernard Corser) condemned in their speeches today. Australia needs a cotton industry. It needs a great variety of industries. More than that, it needs to be emancipated from its economic dependence on the great industrial nations of the world. Until that is done we shallhave to face, year after year, the difficulties which arise from an adverse trade balance, difficulties which bid fair to paralyze our national life.

They have for a long time recognized the benefits of a protectionist policy. That policy has resulted in providing employment for hundreds of citizens of Ballarat in industries situated in that city. that those persons have a sufficient sense of reciprocity to recognize the need in other parts of the Commonwealth. When we can establish flourishing industries away from the great metropolitan centres of Australia we shall have goiie a long way towards solving our unemployment problem. I hope that eventually North-Western Australia as well as Northern Queensland, may benefit under this bill. In that way we may build up a thriving primary industry in the tropical areas of Australia, together with an important secondary industry which will give employment to thousands-of persons far from the purlieus of Melbourne and Sydney. honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) pleads for the support of this bill on the ground that it will assist us to meet a possible national emergency; in other words, that it will help us to provide ourselves with munitions of war. I do not think that he is sincere in that argument, or if he is, he does not express the views of his party. The Labour party in office has done all that it could to destroy the defence of Australia. That being so I am surprised to hear from a supporter of that party that the payment of a bounty on cotton is necessary in the interests of national defence. said that previous governments had initiated this policy. For my part I do not regard this as a party issue at all. I do not care whether the last Government favoured this policy or not. I think that the whole system of bounties and ever-increasing tariffs is wrong, and is largely responsible for bringing about Australia's present unsatisfactory condition. Let us consider one or two industries that are being artificially stimulated. The wine industry has been mentioned in this House to-day. To that industry the Commonwealth has paid over £1,250,000 in the form of bounties, yet those engaged in it are wanting more and more. That has been our experience with nearly all these hot-house industries -the more stimulation they get the more they require. The sugar industry furnishes another example. It has cost the people of Australia millions of pounds I am sure to maintain a comparatively few people growing sugar in Queensland. Although Ave have a magnificent outside market for of fostering industries our sugar, particularly in Canada, our exports are negligible, and our own people are paying an extortionate price for the sugar they use. I have no doubt that our experience will be much the same with cotton, only worse. Cotton is used by almost everybody in the community, and particularly by the poorer members of it. It is also largely used in secondary industries. Increasing the price of cotton will have the double effect of makirg",52,Second Reading

Ten years ago practically nobody was engaged in this industry in Australia, but iu 1928 no fewer than 3.500 people found employment in it. In view of the decline in mining in northern Queensland I hope that the Queensland Government will encourage cotton production. I do not believe that the results feared by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Archdale Parkhill) -will follow.

102,Mr Eorde,"The honourable memberwe hope to co-operate in every way to make the cotton industry a success. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) sought to misrepresent my statements regarding the unemployment that would result from the policy of the Government. When moving the second reading of the bill, I pointed out that the cotton-growing industry gives seasonal employment to over 3,000 workers in Queensland, and I stated that the picking season lasts from two to six months. In some districts the crop is later than in others, and pickers, after working out one field, go on to another, and may get five months of intermittent work. Employment is not constant, because an interval may occur between the completion of the harvest on one farm and the commencement of picking on another. The statement of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that picking affords employment for only a few weeks in each year shows his complete ignorance of the industry. He seems disturbed at the thought that this industry will employ a considerable number of men in picking for several months. His attitude is what one would expect of him. If he had his way this bill would be jettisoned; he says that the proposal it contains will be detrimental to Australia, and will be productive more of harm than good. He is the gentleman who,, as Minister for Trade and Customs, went to Queensland before the election, and made academic speeches to the cotton-growers, with a view to convincing them that if they voted for his party all would be well with them. To-day he expressed regret that this matter has not been dealt with on its merits and free of party politics. Those who are familiar with the subject know that the speeches made by the Nationalist candidates during the 1928 election nauseating. In effect, they said to the cotton-growers, "" You have been waiting for some time for the protection of your industry. Vote for the Bruce-Page Government; Parliament will be called together in January, 1929, and shortly afterwards protection will be given to you."" What happened? Early in 1928 the Queensland Cotton Board and the manufacturers sent a deputation to the then Minister for Trade and Mr Forde. Customs( Mr Pratten). I give the deceased gentleman due credit for his fiscal views and his sympathetic hearing of manufacturers and primary producers who were seeking protection; but, with his passing, all semblance of protection in the policy of the Bruce-Page Government disappeared. Mr Bruce looked about for a shandy-gaff protectionist to appoint to the vacant portfolio, and found him in tbe person of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett). The Tariff Board recommended a bounty on seed cotton, increased rates of duty on cotton yarn imported into the Commonwealth, and increased ' rates of bounty on yarn manufactured from Australian-grown cotton, and also an increase of duty on linters, but the late Government ignored the recommendation. The matter was referred to the Tariff Board in May, 1928, and the ' board did not start to take evidence till the following September. It presented its report on the 6th March,. 1929. The last Government had that report in hand for approximately seven months before the general election, and yet took no action. Honourable members opposite say that the present Government is merely carrying out the recommendations of the Tariff Board. That is true, but the last Government failed to do that; it kept the report secret for seven months, and although I applied for it on many occasions it was withheld from me. But immediately after the present Government took oifice we considered the requirements of the cotton industry and decided to act upon the board's report. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett), who was Minister for Trade and Customs in the last Government, opposes this bill which is largely based on the Tariff Board's recommendation, is it any wonder that our predecessors did campaign were positively nothing? When moving the second reading, I stated that at the present time the cotton industry employed approximately 2,800 farmers, 3,000 field labourers and pickers, '200 persons in ginneries, and 1,000 in manufacturing and distribution, making a total of 7,000. I pointed out that the duties imposed in November last affected £3,000,000 worth of the cotton goods imported annually, and if those goods were produced in Aust.is.lia, employment would be given to 5,000 farmers, 8,000 field labourers and pickers, 500 ginnery hands, and 4,500 persons engaged in manufacture and distribution, making a total of 18,000. There is no reason why we should not manufacture a l l our requirements of cotton goods. valued at £11,000,000, and when the Australian industry is able to handle £8,000,000 of that sum, the employment in all sections w ill be about 40,000, apart fro m those engaged in other pursuits in directly connected with the cotton industry. climate to produce cotton superior to American middling. Why is it not doing it? industry has not had a f a i r chance in the past because of the policy of the party now in opposition. All the schemes of the honourable members opposite for the development of the cotton .industry were one-sided; they d id not go f a r enough. They dealt only with cotton-growing, and although they offered a small bounty to the manufacturer of yarn they failed to give h i m protection which would enable him to buy cotton produced in Australia and sell locally the yarn manufactured therefrom. bill based on Mr Pratten's scheme? did not go f a r enough, for it failed to give protection to the manufacturers. The present Government is giving that protection, and it is also offering a bounty to the cotton-grower and the manufacturers of yarn on a diminishing basis, so that it will expire at the end of 1936, when the industry should be able to stand alone. Both, growers and manufacturers have accepted this scheme as the best possible under the circumstances. Another reason why the industry is bound to prosper is that the Queensland growers have taken over the ginning plants and oil mills at a cost of £137,500. ginning costs. The British-Australasian Cotton Growing Association was charging l £ d . per lb. for ginning cotton, whereas the cost approximately .55d. B y co-operation and control of the industry by the farmer from the growing of the cotton to the sale of the cotton lint to the manufacturer, the industry should be put on a more profitable basis. The growers w ill get the profits from the o i l mill, which was the most payable part of the plant owned by the British-Australasian Cotton Growers Association. The right honourable member for CowThe total imports are per ( D r . Earle Page) made much of the fact that two years ago I advocated a bounty of 2d. per lb. on seed cotton. In 1926 the Tariff Board, after a thorough investigation of the industry, recommended a bounty of 2d. per lb. for five years and a diminishing bounty for tbe Australia has the soil and next five years. The Bruce-Page Government would not agree to pay more than l£d. per lb. I then advocated that the 2d: The chief reason is that the be paid as recommended by the board; alternatively, that; a duty be imposed to encourage manufacturers to buy Australian cotton. That was the desire of the Queensland Cotton Board. But the last Government would not accede to it . The manager of the Cotton Board, giving evidence before ihe Tariff Board on the 31st October, 1928, saidIf circumstances render it impossible to make the conditions such as will enable the spinners to purchase the bulk of next season's crop, I would urge that if even for only one year the seed cotton bounty be increased to 2d. per lb.; £120,000 was appropriated for last year, and only £40,000 expended. A further £120,000 was appropriated for the present season, and the amount of bounty Mr Pratten's proposal required will be about £80,000. The Commonwealth Government justifies their action in making the seed cotton bounty l i d . per Ib. instead of 2d. per Ib. as recommended by the Tariff Board by stating that the Australian market would be available. No other reason was adduced in support of this action. Surely, in the circumstances, it is not too much to ask that the 2d. should be paid for one year, pending the definite establishment of the spinning industry. Although this may be digressing from the matters directly referred to to the Tariff Board, it is an aspect of the case to which I think the board, in justice to the industry, might give some consideration. The Tariff Board, however, while recognizing that there was a good deal in the This w ill reduce claim of the manager of the Cotton Board, said that it could not recommend the payment of a bounty of 2d. per lb. on seed cotton for in America is one year and it recommended tariff protection instead.
