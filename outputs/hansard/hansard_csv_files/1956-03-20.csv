It seems to be out of order on both counts. is addressed to the Treasurer, arises out of a list of Commonwealth loans for the last ten years with which he was gracious enough to supply me, and concerns the loans which were not open to public subscription but which were launched in June of 1952, 1953, 1954 and 1955. There appears to have been one in each of those years. What institutions took up those loans? Did such institutions include the trading banks? Were any steps taken to see that these loans were not inflationary in the sense of being new money but were subscriptions in some other way? am greatly mistaken, it has been the practice of ali governments to treat loan subscriptions as confidential as to tbe source and as to the amount. However, I shall look into the matter and see to what extent I can assist the bonorable member. Immigration aware that, at the present time, bibles on wbich candidates for naturalization have been sworn in have been supplied free of charge by the British and Foreign Bible Society. As the cost of this supply is now beyond the finances of this society, it has been forced to charge the municipal councils for the bibles so used. Will the Minister arrange either to subsidize tbe society to cover the cost of these bibles, or to compensate the municipal councils, as it is hardly fair that the ratepayers of these municipalities should bear such expense? company witb other bonorable members, noted with appreciation the action of the British and Foreign Bible Society in making available these bibles for candidates for naturalization at tbe time of their swearing in, and I am sure that tbey are prized by most of the recipients as a memento of a very significant occasion in their lives. This has been a voluntary act on the part of the society, and I learn from the honourable member for Maribyrnong that it now has inadequate funds to continue this practice. I was not aware that it had been pressing the councils to make some payment for the bibles supplied. If my recollection is correct, some months ago a request was made that the Australian Government should provide the finance for this purpose. It was considered by tbe Immigration Advisory Council, wbich came to tbe conclusion that this was not a normal function of government and that the matter of supplying tbe bibles sbould be left to those who had previously been willing to supply tbem-if they wished to continue to do so. It would, I imagine, be possible to consider whether an option should be given to the immigrants concerned to purchase the bibles at a reasonable cost, if they wished to preserve them as a memento of the occasion. If the Government were to supply them, it would naturally have to consider increasing the amount now charged to those undergoing tbe naturalization process. As honourable members may be aware, recently that amount was reduced from £5 to f l as an encouragement to immigrants to undertake naturalization. I should be reluctant to increase that amount. Territories whether there is any truth in tbe allegation that a native star of the film Jedda is at present in Darwin destitute and suffering from ' tuberculosis. Can the Minister give any information as to the conditions under which this man and other natives who took part in the picture were employed? Will he outline the measures employed by the native welfare authorities in the Northern Territory to protect the interests of these people and others who take up similar employment? honourable member for the Northern Territory has raised this matter because it has been the subject of a good deal of",12,Speaker Mr To Tend To Prejudice The Fair Trial Of The

12,Mr Nelson,I ask the Minister for,13,Aboriginal Film Actor Tudawali
13,Mr Hasluck,"I am glad that the public misrepresentation. The question refers to a native ward of the Northern Territory Administration named Tudawali, who played a prominent part in the film Jedda. One point that I would like honourable members to appreciate is that Tudawali, whatever he might have appeared to be in the film, is, as a L.„tter of fact-compare d with the average white man-a n uneducated and not highly responsible individual. That is just something that is due to the circumstances of his birth and upbringing. He vas engaged in this film from the l l t h July, 1952, to the 26th March, 1954. During that period he was paid £249 direct into his own pocket-if he had a pocket-and an amount of £448 l is . was paid into a trust account on his behalf, making a total of £697 l is . Subsequently, an additional £110 was paid into the trust account by the film producer to cover a period of six months following the cessation of employment. that he would be in his early thirties. After his emplovment on the film, he returned to Darwin and on the 1st July, 1954, commenced employment with the municipal section of the Administration at award wages. employment until the lst February, 1956-that is, only a little over a month ago-and for that period received wages totalling £989 Os. 6d. That was the award payment, after the usual tax deductions. Thus, during the period from tbe l l t h July, 1952, until he ceased employment a little over a month ago, he had the use of a total sum of £1,787 lis. 6d., quite apart from some other advantages to which I shall refer later. Now, when he commenced employment with the municipal section of the Administration, he was provided with rent-free accommodation in a former Royal Australian Air Force camp at Winnelli. The dwelling with which he was provided was a cottage with three rooms and a shower, and was quite a decent dwelling, similar to those occupied by Europeans. His fellow-employees who received tbe same wages and worked under the same conditions were able to maintain themselves, and to lead their lives in a responsible way. Unfortunately, however, after a few months Tudawali found that he could not maintain the same standard of living and of responsibility as his fellow workers on tbe same wages as tbey did and, of his own choice, and at his own request, he went back to live in tbe Bagot settlement. This is a settlement which is maintained on tbe outskirts of Darwin for those persons of aboriginal blood who are not citizens and wbo are employed in the town. At Bagot he was again given rent-free accommodation in one of the best huts. Although those buildings have been referred to as "" mud huts"" in some of the stories published, they are of solid pise construction. They consist of two rooms and a verandah, and there are ablution facilities on the settlement. The rooms have .ceilings 10 feet high, and measure rougbly 10 feet by 12 f t . 6 in., and 10 f t . 6 in. by 7 feet. He lived there rent-free, and in addition food was supplied on the settlement for himself and his wife. Last December, again after a rather regrettable failure on his own part to live up to the standard of accommodation provided, he left that hut and went to live in another hut on the settlement. It was shortly after that that he entered bospital for treatment for He continued in tuberculosis. So, on tbe financial side, his position over recent years was that during the period he was at the Bagot settlement he was receiving the wages to which I have already referred, and, in addition, had rent-free accommodation, and food for himself and his wife to the value of at least £4 a week. There was thus no reason why he should have got into difficult financial circumstances. During the same period he was drawing on the money in bis trust account and, without having to pa^ for any accommodation or any food, he went through bis money at tbe rate of about £13 l is . 6d. a week, and to-day is without resources except for the final £55 that we are retaining in the trust account. The most recent payment out of the trust account was a payment of £55 that was made to him this week. So, I suggest that there was no reason why he should have been in financial difficulties except for the fact, which is the regrettable fact of the whole situation, that, not through",13,Aboriginal Film Actor Tudawali
14,Dr. Evatt,Ho w old is he?,14,Aboriginal Film Actor Tudawali
15,Mr Hasluck,"I should imagineany fault of his own, but through the circumstances of bis upbringing, he does not have a sense of nnancial responsibility. Wben, as the result of tbe work of the Department of Health, he was found to be suffering from a tubercular gland in one arm, be went into hospital, and received, in exactly the. same institution as a European would enter, exactly the same treatment as a European would -eceive. During the whole of that period Doth he and his wife were fully maintained, either at the hospital or the settlement. His medical treatment is, of course, a matter on wbich I can make n-o comment; but the one point I want to establish is that, although he is a young man of scant education and of rather primitive upbringing, he has had financial provision over tbe years which would have enabled him to bave lived at the same standard as that of a lowskilled manual European worker in the Northern Territory. It is one of the regrettable facts that because of tbe way be managed bis finances he has not been able to take advantage of the provision made for him. Another statement which has been made is that his wife, at the time of the birth of the baby, was without normal requisites. Although one can admire the public spirit of those who made donations to provide him with things like soap and baby powder and clothes, there was absolutely no necessity for that to be done, because every one of those things would have been available to bis wife for the"" child on the settlement, on request. The published statements, in that respect, are completely exaggerated. They completely falsify the position. Territories a question supplementary to the one that he has just answered. It refers to the case of an aboriginal who is undoubtedly an exceptionally able actor, who is in financial difficulties and who is suffering from the, dread scourge of tuberculosis. Will the Minister, forgetting for tbe moment whether tbe aboriginal has handled his finances carefully-whicl i would be exceptional in the case of any artist-loo k into the case himself to see whether he can discharge his duty as trustee for these Australians to wbom we owe a very special duty, and not just simply say, as he is inclined to do, ""He has had his chance and his money is finished""? I think that the Minister would do what everybody would like to be done if he undertook to do that. I am sure he would do it carefully and efliciently. facts I have recited show that over tbe past five years tbe Native Welfare Branch of the Northern Territory Administration has discharged, with a great deal of care, its responsibility to this ward of the Administration. It has ensured that he received payments commensurate with the payments made to other people. It bas provided him with accommodation. It has ensured that he had food. I think that record of five years is a sufficient earnest that, in the coming period, he will receive no less careful attention and consideration. for Immigration say how many Cypriots have emigrated to Australia? Can he ascertain how many Cypriots bave emigrated to other countries? Is it true that practically no Cypriots have emigrated to Greece? get those figures for the honourable gentleman. I cannot give them offhand. I do not know whetlier I can get the figure for emigration from Cyprus tn Greece, but if it is procurable, T shall get it. the Minister fbr Immigration. At a sugar conference held in Brisbane, tbe Treasurer stated that 800 immigrants would be brought, out as sugar workers for the coming crushing season.

21,Mr Harold Holt,"I shall try togentleman. I think most honourable members are aware that last year we arranged for representatives of the sugar mdustry to proceed to Europe and, in co-operation witb omcers of the Department of Immigration, select suitable workers for the sugar cane-fields of north Queensland. That scheme worked admirably. We were prepared to make somewhat similar arrangements this year, but the representatives of the industry had gained sucb confidence in the selection methods and the capacity of our officers that they said they were quite willing for them to do the work. I cannot say offhand when the men will arrive on the fields, or how many of those who worked there last year have returned for this season. I shall get as much information for the honourable gentleman as I can. deal of bewilderment about the nature of the existing financial malaise and the necessity for corrective measures, will the Prime Minister give consideration to having prepared and distributed a small explanatory booklet for the enlightenment of the public and the clarification of their ceive a report. It may be in my hands thinking about the involved economic problems now besetting us? I have in uiy hand a booklet which was prepared in 1930 during the great depression and which was of very great use to the people at that time. I have in mind tbe publication of a similar booklet now. the honourable member, quite obvious that a good deal of the comment that one reads is completely uninformed. I have given some thought to the possibility of either saying or doing something that might explain some of tbe elements of the situation. At the moment, although I am considering the matter, I am not at all sure how effectively booklets say these things, because my experience of ""booklets and pamphlets is that they remain on shelves undistributed and unread. The topic as a whole is certainly engaging my attention, because, if a booklet would help even to tbe slightest degree tothrow a few rays of light in certain dark minds, it would have great advantage. to the Minister for Labour and National Service. I bring to tbe Minister's attention representations made to him by me yesterday regarding the closure of the works of the Commonwealth Portland Cement Company Limited, at Portland, New South Wales. In view of the desire of the employees to return to work in the industry on pre-stoppage conditions, and in view of the urgent need for cement throughout the nation, will the right honourable gentleman arrange for a conciliation commissioner to bring the parties together without further delay, and thus enable conciliation to work, and encourage the production of cement? when the honourable member tried to communicate witb me yesterday, I was engaged at a Ministry of Labour Advisory Council meeting, wbicb lasted throughout the day. However, I gave instructions for one of my senior industrial officers to examine the problem to which the honourable member had referred, and to give me the necessary information about it. I bave yet to relater this afternoon. When I receive it, I shall consider what action can properly be taken to assist in the manner suggested by the honourable member. to tbe Minister for Territories. Did the Minister see a recent statement indicating that housing loans in the Northers Territory had ceased for tbe balance of the current financial year ? If the Minister bas read such a statement, will he inform tbe House whether it is correct ? raised in the House some time ago by the honourable member for tbe Northern Territory. Since he raised it, I have had inquiries made. The position is that, as a result of discussions between my department and the Treasury, the Commissioner of Housing in the Northern Territory has been assured of sufficient funds to finance all approved applications for housing loans in the Northern Territory for the remainder of this financial year.",15,Immigration Scheme For Sugar Workers

26,Mr Swartz,I address a question,16,Northern Territory Housing Loans
27,Mr Hasluck,"This question wasaddressed to the Prime Minister. Has the right honourable gentleman received from the Cardwell Shire Council, in north Queensland, a request for financial assistance to repair the terrific damage that was done in the shire by the recent cyclonic floods and for immunity from income tax for the forthcoming financial year as a further means of assisting the people who suffered sucb damage? Whether or not the right honourable gentleman has received the request from the shire council, will be inform tbe House whether he has yet received a request for financial assistance from the Queensland Government? If he has received sucb a request, will he say what financial help the Queensland Government has given? Will the Commonwealth, as usual, supplement the assistance from tbe State, and, indeed, is it prepared to go a little further in view of tbe extraordinary damage done by tbe cyclone in question? pretend that I remember the particular communication from the municipality concerned. Many communications have been received but, as the honourable member knows, we deal, by long established practice on these matters, with the Government of the State. There have been communications between Premier of Queensland and myself, in wbicb we bave pursued what is our normal practice on these matters, so the honourable member may be quite certain that we will do, in relation to the cases that arise, the necessary things on the same principles as have been established in the case, of other disasters in other States. I agree with him that the cyclonic damage in Queensland has been quite phenomenalI said something about it in tbe House, I think, last weekbut to some extent the amount of assistance will be determined according to the details wbich the Premier will be in a position to convey to us. He cannot at the moment, in the nature of things, be precise in terms of detail, but whatever it may be, tbe honourable member may be assured that we will completely, fully, and generously, pursue our normal policy. the Minister for Labour and National Service. Having regard to the dispute between the Seamens Union of Australasia and R, W. Miller and Company Proprietary Limited, will the Minister investigate the seaworthiness of William McArthur, as the suggestions made by the judge hearing the dispute would indicate that this vessel is not seaworthy, and tragic loss of life could easily result from continued operation on the coastal services in its present condition? standing of the position is that the judge bas himself investigated the seaworthiness of this vessel, and the matter is in his hands at the moment for such suitable attention as he may wish to give to it. I do not propose to interfere in the matter. directed to the Minister for Labour and National Service. Is it a fact that there is a rather serious strike in the Australian shearing industry at present, particularly in Queensland? If this is so, is it also true that tbe strike is directed against an interim award made by a conciliation commissioner acting under the powers of the Commonwealth Court of the Conciliation and Arbitration for the purpose of determining payment for services rendered in the industry? Has the Minister's attention been drawn to persistent reports that officials of the Australian Workers Union are actively engaged in fomenting concerted activity on the part of other unions, wbich activity is designed to paralyse all the operations from shearing to the final despatch of the wool? Assuming the reports are correct, does not this activity, in face of the fact that tbe strike is against an official award, constitute a concerted act of industrial war against the community at large? able member has mentioned some of the aspects of this important matter. In order to put the matter in its chronological sequence, it should be stated that the first decision of an arbitral tribunal",16,Northern Territory Housing Loans

32,Mr Drummond,My question is,17,Shearing Industry Dispute
33,Mr Harold Holt,"The bonorin relation to the current dispute was made by the Queensland Industrial Court. It had the effect of reducing the rate for shearing by 10 per cent. Subsequently, a conciliation commissioner in the federal field, Mr Donovan, reduced the rate which was applying in the federal field-it was not precisely the same rate -by 5 per cent. Following the decision of the Queensland Industrial Court, I understand an application has been made for some punitive action to be taken in relation to that award. The hearing of that application was granted and, I understand, the decision will be implemented at a later stage this week. The Commonwealth Conciliation Commissioner also placed a ban on any limitation of work, but, since the decision of the High Court in the Boilermakers decision of that character has not the same effectiveness. Mr ""WARD -If the rate is not satisfactory, why should not the men withhold their labour ? gentleman may not regard the rates as satisfactory, but I think most honourable members are aware that at the time of the phenomental increase in the price of wool an agreement was reached, and, on several occasions, awards were made, which had the effect of varying the rates of the shearers according to movements in the price of wool. I am told that in recent times there have been seven upward movements in the rates. I think four were by award and three by agreement on the part of tbe graziers, all having the effect of benefiting tbe shearer. details? Will the Minister take suitable I think this is the first reduction, despite action to protect tbe community against the fact that tbe rate stood at 81s. per 100 in 1949, and the average price of wool was round 60d., and the rate is now over 130s. per 100, and the average price of wool is back to 60d. to those agreements? stand it, tbey were tbe Australian Workers Union and tbe employers. This latest action is a breach of the terms of that arrangement, and is certainly a breach of its spirit by a union which has bad a long record of observance of arbitration processes. award only fixes the minimum rate? course, all awards merelyfixthe minimum rates, and there is nothing to prevent an employer paying above that minimum rate if he so chooses; but I understood the honourable gentleman's question to refer not so much to the consideration that applied there but to the fact that the union itself was not only adopting tactics of intimidation but also attempting to embroil other unions in order to intimidate the shearers and owners wbo might otherwise be anxious to work and pay in accordance with the terms of the award. A more recent development which, I think, should be put before thc honourable gentleman and other honourable members who may be interested, is a report which came over the broadcasting system to-day that Mr Gunn, representing the graziers, had been requested by a third party to confer with Mr Bukowski, of tbe Australian Workers Union, with a view to seeing whether some settlement could be reached in the matter. I understand that both these gentlemen bave agreed to meet each other for that purpose later this week. We shall, however, be watching the position closely to see what we can usefully do.

In view of the fact that, as a result before him at that time, including, posof this decision, interstate road transport is taking more of the creamof railway interstate traffic, will the Prime Minister give consideration to the appointment of a joint committee, composed of members selected from both sides of the House, to re-examine the question of standardization of railway gauges, bearing in mind that standardized railway gauges would make for more economical and efficient railway operations ? advised, I would not think that further information was needed on the subject of standardization of railway gauges. If any information needs to be brought up to date, no doubt the honourable member's suggestion could be considered. Minister for Labour and National Service tell the House whether it is a fact that at the time when the Graziers Association of New South Wales made its application to the conciliation commissioner for a red notion in wages of shearers, the Australian Workers Union also made an application for an increase in wages, and that at thp hparing the conciliation commissioner indicated that he proposed to hear the two applications together, and that he would not give a decision in respect of one until he had completed the hearing of the case for the other? Is it a fact that, despite this decision, the conciliation commissioner finally gave an interim decision in respect of the application by the graziers' association to reduce wages, but did not carry out his undertaking to withhold judgment until he had completed the hearing of the union's case for the increase? Is it also a fact that the present shearing rate represents a smaller percentage of the value of the fleece shorn than did the shearing rate over 25 years ago, under the award of Judge Dethridge, in the depths of the depression? able member has stated in his question, the award of Mr Conciliation Commissioner Donovan was described by him as ever, that in making that award he took into account all the factors that were sibly what the honourable member has just suggested-if such a matter were before him by way of comment or evidenceand also, no doubt, the circumstance that when the price of wool was formerly at about 60d. per lb. the shearer's rate was in the neighbourhood of SOs. a hundred, as against about 131s. a hundred under his present interim award. However, what is clearly before the union and the employers concerned, and, no doubt, before us all at this time, is the fact that an award by the appropriate conciliation commissioner has been given, and I suggest to the honourable member that all of us in this House have a responsibility to support a system to which we have all subscribed in the past, and to encourage those who seek the processes of arbitration to abide by its rulings.

56,Mr Haeold Holt,"If that isam sure that there will be many people in Australia, including many of the erstwhile supporters of that party, who will deem it necessary to reconsider tbeir political allegiance. The great strength that has come to the Australian working man, and the improvement in his conditions, over the years, have been very largely due to the fact that in times when tbe bargaining strength was with the employer, the employer was not able to exercise that bargaining strength unchecked. The arbitration system provided a bulwark of protection for trade unionists in those circumstances. There are many trade unionists to-day who forget all too readily tbe source of strength that the Oommonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was to tbem in those less fortunate times, and the steady rise in living standards that has resulted from decisions given by the court over the years. SoI suggest to the honourable gentleman, when he, in effect, recommends a return to the law of the jungle and a resort to the bargaining strength of tbe parties, that he might bear in mind that there are not always such happy times as exist to-day, in which, because of an over-full employment situation, the unionist finds himself in a much stronger bargaining position tban does his employer. for Labour and ""National Service whether it is a fact that during the discussion on the bank nationalization issue the right bonorable member for Cowper said in this HouseWe will fight this measure by every means at our disposal-political , economic, and, if need he, physical means. If that is a fact, in what measure does the statement by the right honourable member for Cowper differ from the attitude taken up by some of the members of unions in the present dispute in the pastoral industry? the honourable member for Lalor express sentiments, in relation to some of the issues which have come before the House, somewhat similar to those which he has ascribed to the rigbt honourable member for Cowper. If he has correctly reported the right honourable gentleman, then I find no more support for that attitude than I bave found for similar statements made by the bonorable member for Lalor from time to time. I think that those of us who are elected democratically in order to make the laws of the country have a responsibility to see that even if , from time to time, we happen to be in Opposition, the democratic will, as expressed through Parliament, is suitably observed. Labour and National Service consider the reduction of the basic wage by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court by 10 per cent, in 1931 an example of that court's support for the workers in difficult times? If he does not, can he tell us when that court has shown such support ? tion of those days is not as accurate as it miglit be, but I seem to recall that there was a general political and governmental decision taken at that time, believed to be in the interests of Australia as a whole, to effect reductions in various costs, in order to promote a more confident base for prosperous expansion of the economy, and so overcome the difficulties of those times. If my memory serves me correctly, there were Labour governments which not merely reduced wages, but were driven to reducing the rate of pension for age and invalid pensioners in this country. No doubt, tbey took that action with a. sense of responsibility, believing that in. the long run. it would be in the interest, not only of the country as a whole, but of the people directly concerned. In these matters, I think that we merely make more difficult an already difficult situation if, having entrusted to a tribunal the task of determining, impartially and objectively, these industrial questions of wages and conditions, we then try to weaken confidence in the work of the tribunal by challenging its decisions and throwing doubt upon them. The wisest of men will sometimes, perhaps, fail to der-ide as tbey should; but over tbe long term, if one studies the decisions of the oourt as a whole, one will find that it has a-iven steadily rising standards to Australian unionists who bave thereby been enabled to share in the community prosperity and, as at this time, so well bave they ordered their decisions that",20,Sheaeing Industey Dispute

70,Mr Edmonds (Herbert) [3.34],"A tto be harmful and, indeed, it was never intended to be critical. WhatI was concerned about, as I pointed out in my question to the Minister, was that before the last Parliament ended, terrific reports, in fact violent reports, had appeared concerning safety in the use of the Salk vaccine. Indeed, the right honorahle member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), the predecessor in office of the present Minister, made it quite clear to this House that he would not be stampeded into using Salk vaccine until the whole matter had been completely investigated and all .reports upon it bad been examined. Therefore, on the 16th February, soon after the House assembled for this session, I asked the present Minister whether, in view of the reports concerning this matter, he was in a position to allay the fears of parents whose children would be inoculated with Salk vaccine. The Minister repliedAllI would like to say at present is that our ness that to-day we live in a different age. arrangements for providing the vaccine are .proceeding according to our schedule. So far as the safety of the vaccine goes, it is not, of course, possible to give absolute guarantees in -matters of this nature .My concern, and that of honourable members generally, can well be appreciated, indeed, the Minister's statement astounded both the members of this Parliament and the members of the medical world. The Hritish Medical Association immediately decided that it would not use the vaccine until the Minister for Health was able to guarantee its safety. On the 22nd February, the Minister gave this House the information that I sought when I asked my question. able member ask the question? 16th February. On that occasion the Minister stated that he could not guaranexperience of this kind of thing, when a tee the safety of the vaccine. That was baby who was very near and dear to me not what I asked him. If I had been a was inoculated for whooping cough and member of the Government parties and diphtheria. It is only as a result of somethe Minister had given the answer that I thing that we did not expect to happen sought I could have been accused of askthat the kiddy is alive to-day. If honoring a "" Dorothy Dix"" question. I wanted able members want to check on that, the Minister to give me the information they can do so by getting in touch with that he subsequently gave in the state""Mookie"" at my telephone number in ment that has brought on this debate. I Brisbane. That child is alive to-day, but want to make it quite clear that my only if it had died it would not have meant interest in the matter was to allay the that there was anything wrong with the fears that might have existed in the minds of parents whose children would eventually be inoculated with Salk vaccine. I have a personal interest also in poliomyelitis because, although honourable members may not believe it, I was once a sufferer. It was not then known as poliomyelitis. Because of its prevalence amongst infants it was called "" infantile paralysis "". When I was a baby 1 was stricken with infantile paralysis and had quite a lote of trouble getting myself firmly on my feet. For that reason, 3 have a personal interest, in the matter. Fortunately, we now live in a different era. In those days there was no cure and any one who survived infantile paralysis was very fortunate indeed. My parents have told me that all they could give me was castor oil, and by all accounts I had gallons of it. That was all that they could find to give me in those bad old days of medical science. Thank goodA preventive vaccine has been found and for that we should be very pleased and thankful. However, when mass inoculation does take place it will be the subject of much criticism, just as was the introduction of serums for the prevention of diphtheria and whooping cough. The Minister is himself an eminent and highly respected physician, and no one knows better than he that some kiddies may be able to take the vaccine in tbeir stride, showing no ill effects, whilst others may have some aftereffects. That will not mean that there is anything wrong with the vaccine, but it will undoubtedly bring forth adverse but I know that children who are allergic A couple of weeks ago I had a personal",22,Donald Camebo N

They myelitis vaccine prevents even one case of poliomyelitis it will have been worthwhile. However, as I have said, there will doubtless be much adverse criticism of it. The adverse reports tnat have been received upon it from time to time have uot had a good effect. They have not helped the peace of mind of parents, but it is my considered opinion that any risk that may be involved in the use of the Salk vaccine is as nothing compared to the risk that must be run without its use. I am very pleased that the Minister has been able to make tbe statement which prompted this debate. His opinion, of course, has the backing of Dr. Bazeley, a very eminent gentleman who is at present the director of the anti-poliomye-' litis campaign and is in charge of Australian vaccine production. From tbe outset, Dr. Bazeley has asserted his faithful support of the Salk vaccine. His opinion cannot be ignored. In addition, we have had the Minister's statement that about 60,000 children were inoculated in Canada and that not one subsequently became infected. I am not qualified to discuss tbe technicalities of this matter, and I shall be satisfied if something can be done to belp allay the fear in the minds of some people wbose children will be inoculated. Tbe question of inoculating children is, of course, not a matter for the Commonwealth. Tbe Commonwealth will produce the serum and distribute it to the States. Tbe administration of the serum will then become the responsibility of the health authorities in the respective States. But, even so, I believe that immunization should"" be compulsory. I assert that if the parents of a child are so apathetic or so neglectful that they are not prepared to take advantage of the free service offered to them, some government authority should compel them to take that precaution. I realize, of course, that the Commonwealth has no authority to do it, but I believe that the State Department of Health in every State should make immunization against this terrible disease compulsory. Apart from that, I have no more to say, except to repeat that my interest in the matter was not intended to be harmful. My statements were not intended as a crack had absolutely nothing to do with politics. I merely wanted the Minister to do in the first place what he did in the second place, and, now that he has done it in the second place, I am quite certain that all the adverse reports, and all the fears that existed regarding this matter, will now be dead, and that this improved Salk vaccine will prove to be a great boon to the children, and also the adults of this country. -The question before the House is that the paper presented by the Minister for Health (Dr. Donald Cameron) on Salk poliomyelitis vaccine be printed. If it were in keeping with the Standing OrdersI should like the question before the House to be that the paper be printed and approved. I have gone very carefully into what I want to say regarding this proposal, but, before doing so, I should like to say one thing to the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds), who mentioned that some children might be allergic to this "" serum "". I should like to inform tbe honourable member that it is not a serum, but a vaccine, that is used. It is a product made from the virus of poliomyelitis, and does not cause allergic reactions. Therein it is not like many other immunization materials, which are sera, the use of which involves that particular problem. I am delighted to have this statement before the House regarding the supplies, the anticipated use, and the safety of the Salk poliomyelitis vaccine in Australia. I believe that the Government has been very wise indeed in its approach to this problem. It has not been too early in the release of this vaccine for inoculation purposes, thereby showing that it wanted to have the benefit of tbe experience of other countries in determining the efficacy of the. vaccine, and in making certain of its safety for use in Australia. On the other hand, the Government has not been too late in its release of the vaccine. This has been shown by the speed and the assiduity with which our scientists have worked, at tbe request of the Government, in the production and thorough testing of the",23,Donald Camebo N
73,Mr Lawrence (Wimmera) [3.47j.,"vaccines at the Commonwealth. Serum Laboratories and at the Fairfield infectious diseases virus laboratories in Melbourne. The Government is making certain also that there will be assured supplies of adequate stocks, so that it will be able to ensure uninterrupted progress with the vaccination of the first age groups, which are those of children undor fourteen years of age, and of pregnant women. I hope that the House will forgive me if 1 state a few facts about poliomyelitis. I do so because I know there is a great deal of misunderstanding about this disease, and because honourable members cannot be expected to know a great deal about the disease. Unless one has had medical training or has done a medical course, or a very large part of a medical course, one cannot keep in touch with the details of the disease. If we, as members of the Government and members of the Opposition-and I know that members of the Opposition will support this statement-ar e to encourage the people of Australia to use this vaccine, then it is right that the name "" infantile paralysis"" is that we should understand something about the disease itself and of what can be done to prevent the enormous loss of life and limb that it causes, and have some idea of how certain we can be that the immunization programme can be carried out efficiently and with perfect safety. This disease has long been known popularly as ""infantile paralysis"", but is known medically as ""anterior poliomyelitis ""-no t "" poliomylitis "" as so many people pronounce it. The medical name is made up of "" anterior "", meaning ""fore"", and ""poliomyelitis"" meaning "" inflammation of the grey matter of the spinal cord"". The disease is therefore an inflammation of the anterior horn cells of the motor nerves of the spinal cord. Contraction of the disease is dependent on the invasion of the body by a virus. A virus is one of tbose very small germs which are so small that they will pass through the pores of a stone filter. The poliomyelitis virus is one of the smallest of tbe viruses, and it would need to be about twenty times larger than it is now to be able to be seen through the ordinary light microscope. Another important thing about this virus is that it is invulnerable to any known antibiotic drug. The electron microscope has revealed that there are several strains of the poliomyelitis virus, and it is known that immunity to one of tbe strains does not necessarily mean that a person has immunity to the otber strains. Tbose several strains of the virus may occur in both human and mammalian animal communities. Some of the strains can live in the alimentary canal of man for a long time and, during an epidemic of this dreaded disease, the virus itself can be recovered from sewage. Carriers can contaminate tbeir hands and thus spread infection to food, and it is important, tlierefore, that during an epidemic tbere should be practised very thorough hand washing, and that fresh uncooked foods sbould be avoided. Tbe disease is characterized by symptoms .which range from a very mild nonparalytic infection to an extensive flaccid paralysis of voluntary muscles and it is, as tbe honourable member for Herbert has said, by no means limited to infants, so scarcely an appropriate name for it. It is a very old disease, having been recognized for many centuries, but it was not until 1840 that it was first described by a man named Heine. The first recorded epidemic of the disease was in 1887, in Sweden, and even as early as 1896 it was recognized that it was appearing in two forms-namely , the paralytic form and the abortive non-paralytic form. The onset of the disease is often quite commonplace, and the course differs widely. I am happy to say that most frequently it is non-paralytic. The paralysis that the sufferer gets is the result, not of a direct attack by the agent on muscle cells, but of an attack on the motor nerve centres of the central nervous system. It is a notifiable disease, and therefore we bave records of the number of cases that have occurred in Australia. I have taken the records over the years 1947 to 1951 and the average number of cases reported during those years was 1894 per annum, including 4,736 in 1951. The average number of deaths was 110, with 346 deaths in 1951. This dread disease causes not only the loss of valuable lives -man y of those afflicted are young people -bu t also an appalling loss of efficiency by the crippling of the vast majority of survivors of the paralytic infection. At long last we can say that tbe disease can be prevented almost completely. That has been made possible by the use of the Salk vaccine. The vaccine which is to be used is a trivalent one, made from three known strains of the poliomyelitis virus. As outlined in the Minister's statement, it is being produced in Australia under the most rigid conditions and is being double checked for safety. Parents who wish to have tbeir children immunized will naturally want to be sure that tbe vaccine is perfectly safe, not dangerous like some of the vaccine which was used in America last April and May. When the efficacy of the vaccine was established in America, there was a huge, unforeseen demand for it. A voluntary distribution plan was worked out, but halfway through the development oftlie plan there was bad news. There was a series of reports about polio developing in vaccinated children. There were three possible explanations for the illness of tbe vaccinated children. First, it may have been coincidence, since the poliomyelitis season was just beginning in California. Secondly, it may have been provocation, in that inoculation with any material may stir up polio viruses already in the body and cause paralysis. Thirdly, it may have been due to live viruses in the vaccine itself. I have not time to tell the House of the steps that were taken by tbe Polio Surveillance Unit that was set up, but here is a summing-up of the .report, taken from the Saturday Evening Post of the 10th September, 1955, which contained an article, headed "" Where are we now on polio ?"", written by Mr StevenM . Spencer, the science editor. He wroteA summing-up of the Polio Surveillance Unit showed that 131 children vaccinated between the 13th April and the 7th May had Home down with polio within 30 days after inoculation. Of this number, 02 had the disease in its paralytic form. And of the 02 paralytic cases. 11 had received Cutter vaccine. Polio had also struck 103 parents and .brothers and sisters of vaccinated children, the Cutter vaccine being involved in 58 of these Although the risk is negligible, while family contact cases. In Salk pointed to findings which, using made compulsory. bis own words, ""indicate that at least some of the Cutter associated cases developed from the use of poliomyelitis vaccine containing infective virus "". Any doubt remaining on this point was cleared up when virologists isolated living type 1 virus from both of the suspected lots of Cutter vaccine. The Minister, in his statement, referred to this. He saidThe vaccine used for the 1955 United States programme was not always independently tested and was safety tested, for the most part, only by the manufacturer producing the vaccine. Since the Cutter incident, the Tjnited States health authorities have instigated a system of independent laboratory inspections. In America, when five companies, I think, were producing the vaccine, the manufacturers themselves were required to test the product. It was not realized at tbe time that the manufacturers were encountering great difficulties. In the case of the Cutter company, it was proved that living viruses had got into at least two batches of vaccine. In Australia, we have taken advantage.of the Canadian and American experiences. As the Minister bas pointed out, elaborate precautions are being taken here. I submit these will convince us all that an incident like the Cutter incident could not happen here. The honourable member for Herbert said that he would make this type of vaccination compulsory. I do not agree with him. Although the greatest precautions will be taken to ensure the safety of the vaccine, there is still a chance that at some stage some living virus will get through. In that connection, it is interesting to note what the science editor of the Saturday .Evening Post said in the article from which I have quoted. It is as follows :Not all tbe questions about the Salk vaccine have been answered. Xo one can guarantee that it is 100 per cent, safe so long as there is a chance that live virus may at times pass through the inactivation process undetected. Other vaccines we have been using for years, including those against smallpox and rabies, aren't 100 per cent, safe either. But the Public Health Service officials feel that with the new test standards a "" Cutter incident "" can't happen again. tbere is any chance whatever that live a 163-page report on the virus will pass through, despite the checks, polio vaccine, Dr. ScheeleI cannot approve of vaccination being I tliink we should look at the probable ing a scheme of immunization with the effectiveness of this inoculation campaign. We can judge, what to expect from a table printed in a report which was tabled in the Canadian House of Commons on the 9th February, 1956. It relates to Canadian children between the ages of five and ten years. Of 589,716 children who received two doses of vaccine, only five developed paralytic polioto question the wisdom of the delay. I myelitis, whereas of S85,000 children who were not vaccinated, 51 developed paralytic poliomyelitis. In vaccinated children, I considered that the people should be the rate of infection per 100,000 was .84, whereas in unvaccinated children the rate was 5.76. So we see that vaccination is very effective. As the honourable member for Herbert bas said, if it prevents only one child from getting the dread paralytic form of the disease, it will be worthwhile. The extent to which the vaccine is being used is shown by the Minister's statement that it has now been administered to more than 30,000,000 children in many countries of the world. The results bave proved its effectiveness and safety. But, as I have said before, although almost all of the facts known indicate that there is perfect safety in the use of the Salk vaccine, its use should still remain a question for tbe doctor and the parent to decide. I repeat that I would not support a scheme for compulsory inoculation. My medical friends have told me that they are perfectly happy with the scheme as it is proposed. My own faith in the effectiveness and' safety of the vaccine is such that I am perfectly willing to be one of the first to be inoculated with the product of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. In other words, considering the animals used in the tests, it seems appropriate for me to say, "" The Government can make a monkey out of me "". [4.5] I shall not attempt to follow the example of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Lawrence), who delivered what was almost a medical paper on poliomyelitis and the Salk vaccine. I have not anything like the knowledge required to do so. The important question for the Pairliament and the people of Australia is the Government's wisdom in introducSaik vaccine. I agree that it is something for which the people hope. The Government has been, very careful in this matter. When the right honourable member for Cowper (Kir Earle Page), the former Minister for Health, spoke about the delay in making the vaccine available, some honourable members were rather inclined stated at the time that I entirely agreed Avith tbe right honourable member, because able to feel completely confident' of the vaccine when it became available. Very shortly after the former Minister made his statement, we heard about the unfortunate happenings in America following tbe use of one batch of vaccine that had not been effectively tested for safety. I thought at the time that the former Minister was quite right in delaying the use of the vaccine, but tbe information given to us by the present Minister for Health (Dr. Donald Cameron) convinces me that when the vaccine is used it will prove successful, and that the people may bave confidence in it. I do not expect that inoculation with the vaccine will prevent the disease entirely. There is no doubt that chemical or other factors in the bodily make-up of some individuals will resist the action of the vaccine and prevent it from giving them immunity from poliomyelitis. However, generally speaking, tbe use of t.he Salk vaccine is something to which we all can look forward witb hope. When I hear talk of compulsory vaccination, I think back to the days of compulsory vaccination against smallpox when I was a child. My own parents were subject to that compulsion, and I recall that many people would go to any lengths to evadevaccination against smallpox. I am not sure that, if inoculation with the Salk vaccine were made compulsory, we should have tbe initial success that we might otherwise hope for. When we talk about compulsion, we have only to consider the position in relation to the treatment of tuberculosis. In some States, endeavours are being made to introduce compulsory X-rays in tbe campaign against that disease. I found, when I was a member",24,Donald Camebo N
74,Mr Thompson (Port Adelaide),"of the South Australian Parliament some years ago, that immediately there was talk of compulsion, there would be objections to it on every possible ground, not only from members of the public, but also from individual members of Parliament, both Government supporters and Opposition members. have tuberculosis as a result of the compaign against it. sonally should like X-rays to be made compulsory. However, I am merely stating the people's probable reaction to compulsion. Tuberculosis X-rays were initially made compulsory only for persons up to the age of 65 in South Australia. Later, the age limit was increased to 70. It has now been found that the incidence of tuberculosis is greater among persons over 70 who submit themselves voluntarily for X-ray than it is among those aged 70 and under who are compulsorily X-rayed. This fact demonstrates the wisdom of compulsion. However, before we make it compulsory for people to submit to vaccination against poliomyelitis, we must get them to realize the great benent that will result from a successful immunization campaign. It might then be possible, after a period, to make them see the advisability of compulsory treatment. Talk of compulsory vaccination against poliomyelitis calls to mind tbe wonderful benefits of immunization against diphtheria. I suppose no medical campaign has achieved such great success as has been achieved by the diphtheria immunization campaign. We have only to compare the incidence of the disease over the years among immunized persons with the incidence among those who were not immunized to appreciate the wonderful benefit to the oommunity. I have no doubt that, if the people see great benefits from the Salk vaccine over a period of years, they will accept compulsory vaccination as being in the best interests of the community. No disease bas left so much evidence of its distressing effects than has poliomyelitis, or infantile paralysis, as we used to-call it. An epidemic of typhoid fever or rheumatic fever may leave a number of victims suffering from slight, or evon severe-, heart troubles, bnt those afrhVtions are not so evident in the community as are the effects of poliomyelitis. We have only to look about among our friends and relatives to see a child that has suffered from poliomyelitis, and, perhaps, has to carry a withered leg or arm throughout life. These visible effects of the disease have made the people more keen to find some effective method of preventing poliomyelitis than to prevent even the dread disease cancer. It is at present possible to cure many sufferers from poliomyelitis. Honourable members will recall the wonderful work of the late Sister Elizabeth Kenny, who practised her system of treatment in the United States of America. I recall the time, not so very long ago, when she addressed honourable members in Canberra on the subject of poliomyelitis and its treatment. I had the honour to be present on that occasion. Even when Sister Kenny's own life was drawing to its close, she continued to do all she could to interest people in proper methods of treating poliomyelitis victims. However, to-day we are concerned not so much with curing those who bave contracted the disease as with preventing it. Most people are more concerned for the welfare of their children than for tbeir own welfare, and tbey now see the hope that they may be able to have their children inoculated with the Salk vaccine, with almost complete certainty of preventing the disease, as the records show. I do not desire to labour the subject, because I think honourable members generally favour tbe use of the Salk vaccine. T am merely endeavouring to point out how the problem is looked at by the people generally. It is not a auestion merely of cost. The people must feel confident that the Government's medical specialists have tested the vaccine properly and that the necessary apparatus has been obtained for the production of a safe vaccine wbich will not expose any one inoculated witb it to tbe danger of contracting poliomyelitis. The Minister has decided the double check being made to ensure the safety of the vaccine. Although the people are in a position to know, as was stated in the report onoted by the honourable member for Wimmera. that it is impossible to guarantee 100 per cent, effectiveness.",27,Donald Camebo N
75,Mr Edmonds,But fewer people now,28,Donald Camebo N
76,Mr Thompson,"Yes, and I perthey ean feel confident that the Salk vaccine will he almost 100 per cent, effective. The slight risk of failure which may exist in some cases is as nothing compared with the great gain which is achieved in obtaining a treatment which will be efficacious in nearly all cases of this disease. I should like tbe Minister to deal in his reply with the practical application of inoculation. As has been stated, Commonwealth officers will prepare the vaccine, but State and local governing bodies will be charged with its actual administration. The final paragraph of the Minister's statement readsTt is expected that supplies of the vaccine will be available in quantity in about three months' tiine. Federal and State health departments will co-operate in its use, and administrative arrangement's between the Commonwealth and the States are now being finalized. Inoculations will he free and, of course, voluntary. I do not know whether by "" free"" the Minister meant that only the vaccine will be free, or that the inoculation will also be free, nor do I know whether he has been able to obtain an assurance from tbe States that they will be able to make the inoculations without cost, or that they will be able to arrange for private doctors to do so. It may be intended that the State Government or local government authorities will pay for the inoculation. 1 understand that in regard to diphtheria immunization, in Soutb Australia at any rate, in many cases municipal bodies bave accepted some responsibility. In other States they may have accepted further responsibility. In order to make this venture the success which we desire it to be, tbe Government should make arrangements with the States, if it has not already done so, for meeting the actual cost of inoculation, unless tbe States can meet the cost themselves. I think that the medical fraternity will be prepared to do this work at a special low charge, as was the casp with diphtheria immunization. 1 should like some information about that aspect. While the people are keen to have this service, strangely many persons believe that, if it is to be of benefit to the community as a whole, individually they should not be responsible for the cost. I do not advance that view as my own, but T know that it is the view of very many persons. Undoubtedly, every precaution has been taken and will be taken to make this vaccine perfectly safe. I do not recall the Minister having referred, in his speech, to the recent press report of a new vaccine that is being used in England. Whether it is the same as the Salk vaccine, some improvement of it, or a new vaccine altogether is unknown to me. I do not want to question the merits of one vaccine against another, but I ask whether full consideration has been given to what I believe is later work in England than the work in the United States of America, Canada, and other countries. I suggest that the Minister examine this matter with a view to satisfying himself that the action we are taking witb the Salk vaccine is perfectly satisfactory. The honourable member for Herbert referred to the number of children who had been inoculated with Salk vaccine in Canada. He said that he did not remember tbe figure but that he thought it was about 60,000. The Minister mentioned that nearly 1,000,000 children had been inoculated in Canada and that there had been no reports of any unsatisfactory results from those inoculations. That is a very satisfactory position, and it might be said that the vaccine is therefore so satisfactory that there is no need to consider any other. At the same time, we should have the very best.that is available and ensure that everything has been done that can be done. I support the action that is being taken by the Government. We are taking a step forward to deal with a very disastrous disease which we have had in our community for many years and also to allay a dreadful fear in the minds of our people. Last week I had a letter which told how one of my grandchildren had been ill . She is aged about two or three years, and the doctor who attended her had been very much afraid that she was suffering from poliomyelitis, but later was glad to be able to say that she was not. This shows that at timex even medical men are not sure whether an illness is caused by this insidious disease or by something else, and I know the feeling of anxiety that exists in those circumstances. If we can say to the people, ""Here is an opportunity to have your child inoculated with a vaccine which will protect it against poliomyelitis "", a feeling of security will be engendered which has not existed before. I congratulate the Minister on his being able to promise the introduction of this wonderful discovery, the Salk vaccine, in about two or three months from now. should like to add my congratulations to the Minister for Health (Dr. Donald Cameron) on the steps he has been able to take in regard to protection by vaccination against poliomyelitis. It is very refreshing to hear honourable members opposite supporting the Government, as on this occasion, instead of criticizing if. that the present rate of expenditureI should like to congratulate also the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), who, as Minister for Health, took very definite and early steps towards the eradication of this dread disease. In 1936, the right honourable gentleman established the National Health and Medical Eesearch Council with a Commonwealth grant of £30,000. Since then, substantial sums have been granted to this very worthwhile organization. During this Government's term of oflice the amount of subsidy has been increased from £50,000 to £150,000 per annum. The council has done much towards the eradication of disease in our country. The honourable member for Herbert( Mr the mass inoculation of children up to Edmonds) contended that vaccination should be compulsory. In certain Australian States vaccination or inoculation against some diseases is compulsory and the people are gradually being made to realize that diseases are not spread only by those persons who suffer from them, but that in many cases carriers, who are active, and apparently fit, convey the disease to others. That applies to diphtheria, as all honourable members know. Diphtheria, like tuberculosis, is something against which the community should be protected. In Tasmania, vaccination for whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria is not compulsory, but I think nearly all parents now make sure that their children are vaccinated against these dread diseases. Only one injection is needed, as the three types of serum are combined, and children who have had the advantage of this treatment are accorded an opportunity of combating other diseases that follow whooping fough, tetanus and diphtheria later in life. When Dr. Bazeley was seconded to the staff of Dr. Salk in the Tjnited States of America in 1952, it was not apparent that a vaccine could be discovered to treat this dread disease of poliomyelitis. At that time, many people were treated for after effects. Tbey were not having any treatment to stave off the disease. To-day, many thousands of pounds are spent in Australia, and, indeed, many millions of pounds are spent throughout the world, on the treatment of cases of paralysis. The disease has afflicted people of all ages in all parts of the world. 1 have no doubt most of it is incurred by the States, but a contribution is made by the Commonwealth-o n the treatment of paralysis patients would be reduced if we embarked upon a vigorous campaign to persuade people to permit tbeir children to be given injections of the poliomyelitis vaccine. The first experimental immunization work commenced in the United States in April, 1955, which was not so very long ago. That being so, it must be admitted that the Minister and tbe staff of the Department of Health have made tremendous and splendid progress to be now almost in a position to commence fourteen years of age in Australia. That goal, of course, will take some time to reach. I have no doubt that it will take some time, after the first round has been completed, to prepare the vaccine and protect all the children in Australia against poliomyelitis. Each month, 400,000 doses of the vaccine are being prepared in the Commonwealth laboratories, and this alone is a major task. At one time, I suppose, it would have been looked upon as an almost impossible task, but the Government, Dr. Bazeley and the staff of the Department of Health have done a particularly good job since tbe first experimental immunization was conducted in 3955 to bc in the position to announce that the first injections of the vaccine will be given to Australian children within the next month. Plant, equipment and buildings have had to be prepared. These, of course, are in addition to our own Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne, which also provide serum for diseases other than poliomyelitis.",28,Donald Camebo N
77,Mr Luck (Braddon) F 4.22],"II should like to refer to»a matter that arose earlier in this House, when the then Minister for Health, Sir Earle Page, referred to an attack made on him by the Minister for Health in Tasmania. At that time, the Tasmanian Government was prepared to contribute £50,000 for the purchase of poliomyelitis vaccine from outside sources such as the United States of America or any other place at which it was available. That was certainly very commendable, but the Minister for Health in Tasmania indicated at the same time that the Commonwealth was not taking proper steps, was not preparing in time and was not doing the right thing about an anti-poliomyelitis campaign in Australia. The Commonwealth is now providing the vaccine free, whilst the responsibility for the cost of distribution rests with the States. The estimated rraximum cost of treating each child is 7s. 6d.; that is to say, each of the three injections costs 2s. 6d. The Tasmanian Government is asking the municipalities in that State to contribute 3s. 9d. of that cost, whilst the State itself is prepared to pay the balance. The £50,000 which the Tasmanian Government was prepared to contribute towards the purchase of poliomyelitis vaccine from the United States is more than sufficient to cover the whole cost of distribution and treatment in the State. It is estimated that about 80,000 people, or 25 per cent, of the population of Tasmania, will require treatment. That being so, the cost should be between £35,000 and £40,000. Many of the municipalities and shires throughout Australia are short of money, and it will be extremely difficult for them if they are to be required to contribute towards the cost of this treatment. However, I feel certain that if no other course is open, they will pay their share because there can be no doubt that we are all anxious to eradicate this dread disease from our midst. F congratulate the Minister for Health (Dr. Donald Cameron) on the statement he has made. In it, he has achieved clarity and simplicity. The statement is extremely informative, and, I should think, very reassuring to the public. I think also that the House ought to congratulate the Minister's predecessor, Sir Earle Page, for the commendable caution with which be approached this whole subject. It is worth recalling at thi.s stage that he was subjected to a press compaign on a scientific matter, and that attack was both irresponsible and violent. Because he was cautious about authorizing the use of the vaccine, or its importation, there was a quite extraordinary campaign of personal abuse against him. As if the former Minister would have had any personal motive in delaying the use of the vaccine! I sbould like to ask the Minister one or two questions in the hope that wben be is replying, he will be able to clarify tbe position for the benefit of honourable members. In Western Australia, tbere was an epidemic of poliomyelitis in February and March of 1954 and, as I remember it , there were about 178 cases, which is more tban the normal number, in February of this year. I do not know whether tbere has been any investigation into tbe periodicity of this disease, and I am not making any scientific statement now, but it appears to me that this disease visits Western Australia in mid-summer. It does not occur every mid-summer, bin when there is an outbreak it appears to be during mid-summer, and I wondered whether there had been any investigation into that interesting fact. For instance, has there been any investigation into whether the disease is borne by flies, which are probably at their worse at that season of the year? During tbe epidemic in 1954, a press article stated that 399 of every 400 persons had poliomyelitis without knowing it, but that in sucb cases it was not in a severe form. I should like tbe Minister to state whether that is a technically valid statement. Tbe Minister has also stated that inoculations "" will be free and, of course, voluntary "". Will he state whether the vaccination of a large number of people in any way heightens the risk that is taken by those persons who are not vaccinated? That popular statement has been made about all kinds of diseases from which immunity may be had by inoculation. I should like the Minister, because of his medical experience and qualifications, to address himself to that question, too.",30,Donald Camebo N
78,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [4.32],"Mmister for Health) [4.36] -in replyIt was certainly encouraging to hear the comments of honourable members during this debate. I have already made a statement in the House about most of the details of the campaign, and 1 do not propose to go through them again. Rather shall I use the available time to answer the questions that have been raised by honourable members. I should like to refer, first, to tbe opening remarks of tbe honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds). Although we are political opponents, I am quite sure that I can say that we are old friends and that he will not misunderstand me if I say that he might have done me the justice of quoting the whole of my reply to his question about guarantees. ""When the honourable member asked me whether I would guarantee the safety of the vaccine, what I intended to convey was that tbe word "" guarantee"" was hardly one that scientific or medical men would like to apply to a biological process. PerhapsI could have made that plainer to bim at the time. In my answer to bis question, I further statedAU that xny one can say is that every step that is humanly possible to ensure the safety of this vaccine is being taken, and I have no doubt that when it is available there will be no risk attending its administration. SoI hope it will be felt that I have made it clear from the start that I bave no doubts about its safety. I also wish to refer to his remarks about the British Medical Association, l t is true that the journal of the Australian branch of the British Medical Association published an editorial advising medical men not to use the vaccine until it bad been checked by an independent source. I should like to say to the honourable member that that editorial had absolutely no connection whatever with my reply to him in the House, but that in fact it bad been prepared and was ready to be printed long before he asked his question. appear as though they were connected. not responsible for the press. The administration of the vaccine falls under two headings. The first relates to the scientific aspect, which is concerned with the manufacture, safety and efficacy of the vaccine. I have already stated in the House that the mo3t elaborate precautions have been taken at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, where the vaccine is being produced, to ensure that it will be both effective and safe. I have alsa stated that arrangements, which have the approval of the organized medical profession in Australia, have been made for the independent testing of the vaccine by the Fairfield hospital which, as I have pointed out to the House previously, is one of the most celebrated infectious diseases institutions, one might say, in the world. SoI believe that, on scientific grounds, every possible step has Deen taken and that one can be quite sure that the vaccine that will be used in Australia will 'be safe and as effective as it can be. That observation brings me to the question asked by the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) about tbe new vaccine in England. It is truethat reports have been received recently about the production in England of a vaccine that differs from the vaccine we propose to use in Australia. The English vaccine will be of tbe Salk type and almost the same as the Australian vaccine, the only difference being a minor technical difference which involves the use of one type of one strain of the virus. But the English vaccine has not yet been used, and we in this country have no reason to imagine that it will be more effective than ours or that ours will be less safe, so we do not propose to change our arrangements. The honourable member for Port Adelaide and the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) both asked about free inoculations. It is perfectly true that in my statement to the HouseJ said that inoculations would be free, and I intended that statement to mean that they would be free to those persons wbo received them. The position is that this Government wrote to the State governments offering to bear the whole cost of the production of tbe vaccine and its distribution to the States on certain conditions, one of which-these , of course, are not the exact words contained in the letter -wa s that the States would accept responsibility, including financial responsibility,",31,Donald Camebo N
79,Dr. Donald Cameeon (Oxley,,32,Donald Camebo N
80,Mr Edmonds,Tb e press made it,32,Donald Camebo N
81,Dr. Donald Cameron,"We arefor the campaign in the respective States. The Commonwealth's offer was intended to mean that the vaccine should be provided without cost to persons who were to bc vaccinated. Although that position seems to have been accepted by most of the States, in one or two cases a query has been raised about whether the words contained in the message from the Commonwealth conveyed that meaning. We are trying to sort out the position. I spoke in good faith when I made my statement, and I hope that I have noi misled the House in relation to these arrangements. I repeat, that it certainly was the understanding of the Commonwealth that we had asked the States to make inoculations free to the recipients, and that they had agreed to do so. If there bas been any mistake, it has been merely a mistake in the interpretation of the wording of the message. The honourable member for Fremantle referred to the poliomyelitis epidemic in Western Australia and the apparent higher incidence in summer rather than in winter. That is general experience. Quite a lot of research into the periodicity of the disease has been conducted, and it is recognized that it occurs more frequently in the hotter months. How the disease is transmitted is not known fully, but I believe it is not now thought that transmission by flies is one of the major modes of spread. However, a full understanding of the method of transmission has not yet been attained. The honourable member also asked whether members of the population who have not been inoculated are at greater risk than persons who have been inoculated. I do not think that is quite the position. In a community in which large numbers of people have been inoculated against a disease, the natural level of immunity becomes altered, and perhaps also the virulence of the disease becomes more manifest, so that persons who are not inoculated are, in a sense, at greater risk than would otherwise be the case. The mere fact that one person is inoculated does not expose other people to greater risk, except in that sense. The honourable member also asked whether it was true that many people could have poliomyelitis without knowing it. That is certainly so, but to suggest that 399 of every 400 persons are so affected is probably an overstatement. In normal times, when there is no epidemic, quite a number of more or less ill-defined fevers occur, many of which are quite likely undiagnosed mild attacks of poliomyelitis, without paralysis. In fact, in many instances the patient, of the patient's parents, may not have sought medical advice because the attack has passed off fairly quickly, and these cases are, perhaps, discovered afterwards if the antibody level of their blood is examined. I hope that tbose remarks answer bonorable members' questions. PerhapsI can say one or two other things about the administrative arrangements for inoculation throughout the country. The Commonwealtb is making the vaccine available free to the State governments on certain conditions, one of which is that relating to finance, to which I have already referred. Another is the condition that there should be a proper recording and following-up of all the cases, because, as honourable members will appreciate, it is immensely important for us to know whether the campaign is in fact as effective as we would wish it to be, and it is important for us to have knowledge in the future about thc effects of our first inoculations. About the only other condition of any importance is that the States should make satisfactory arrangements for the handling of the vaccine, which requires certain refrigeration and storage arrangements to be made for it in order that it shall be effective. If tbose arrangements are not carried out properly, the vaccine will not be made harmful, but it will be rendered less effective. The final arrangements for administration of the vaccine are at present being worked out and sbould be completed within the next week. I think that those remarks cover all the questions asked by honourable members. us whether many repeat inoculations are necessary? yet known how long a period of immunity is conferred, but the plan that will be followed provides for two primary inoculations at a month's interval. Those are expected to produce a state of primary immunity, and at an interval of not less",32,Donald Camebo N

We are not certain yet as to the period of immunity that will peculiarities about tbe children who are be conferred, but it is expected that those supposed to have died from the effects of inoculations will confer a high degree, of administration of the vaccine? immunity for perhaps three years.

92,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Leade r of the an indirect tax in the ordinary sense.Therefore, I say that, regarded as counter-inflationary measures, the Government's proposals are a mockery. The use of the term "" counter inflationary "" is unjustified. Nobody knows that better than the Government and every honourable member in the Government parties knows it. I think that every newspaper in Australia, uo matter how in normal times it may have supported the Government, has denounced these proposals as adding to the inflation in the community. The nature of the inflation, of course, is a vitally important matter; and I disagree entirely with the Prime Minister's diagnosis of the nature of the inflation. Prices have increased. The right honourable gentleman and his supporters promised, even before their election to office, ment of inflation in the community, but to reduce prices in order to make the Australian f l go further. That attempt has completely failed, and the Government has given it up. Now, the inflation from which the country is suffering cannot be cured by legislaout very carefully. The figures will be tion which simply puts up the price of commodities to consumers and which hits tbe ordinary man and woman and does not hit those who are making great profits out of the present state of the economy. These taxes are directed against ordinary purchasers and consumers, and that is the serious part of it from the point of view of political good faith. If these proposals challenge the facts if they are not relehad been mentioned earlier, at the time of the Prime Minister's speech in September, following the budget speech in August, there would have been a very different reaction from the Australian public. I think that, to-day, the people know that they have been let down and that they have been deceived by these false assertions and false promises. I say that these proposals will add to the inflationary forces in the community. One absolutely certain effect will be that tbe proposals will facilitate the profiteernature of a regressive tax. It will not ing which is the main source of inflationary pressures in this country. The Prime Minister spoke about consumer demand, and I shall refer to that matter in a moment. But what is to happen, for instance, to the financial corporations and the private banks as a result of these proinflationary pressures. The private banks posals? To the private banks there will be a hand-out, as a result of the proposed increased rates, of something in the neighprinciples of the Banking Act 1945, which bourhood of, and certainly not less than, £1,250,000 a year, making due allowance for the increased interest on fixed deposits as well as the increases on the huge advances. This is a conservative estimate, for wbich I am indebted to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean). He says that £1,250,000 per annum will go into the private banks directly as a result of the Government's proposal. That, of course, is just a by-product of the plan. The plan goes much deeper, because if the private banks are to receive such a large sum of money as a direct result of a policy agreed to by the Government, and apparently accepted by the Commonwealth Bank as the central bank, that will add, not only to the elealso to the profiteering nature of tbe inflation. The Minister for Primary jecting, can be quite certain that every detail of that estimate has been worked given to hira to-night. I think, myself, that the estimate is a conservative one. I ask the Minister, if we prove beyond doubt that the figure is correct, will he oppose the proposal? vant? This estimate has been carefully calculated, and I will be obliged to the Ministeri f he will bear the argument, and then we will deal witb him when he makes his speech. Will the flat rate extra charge on companies reduce profiteering? Of course not! The ls. flat rate on all companies, whether their profits are at a small rate or not, whether their prices are fair and reasonable or not, affects all companies in tbe same way. It is, of course, in the stop profiteering by tbose corporations in this country which, during the last two years, have been making profits without precedent in the history of Australia and which have largely contributed to the increase in prices from which stem the main will, by these proposals, be given a fresh charter-no t a charter to observe the",35,Suspension Of Standing Orders

95,Dr. Evatt,"Why does the Ministerwere accepted by the people and have never been openly challenged by the Government, but a charter to gather unearned profits from the newly increased interest rates. What contribution will they make to active production? A purely passive attitude will be adopted by them. That is their business and they are entitled to conduct it ; but tbey are not entitled to receive these favours from the Government just because it happens to be tbeir political friend. That is the truth of the matter. It is no good humbugging about it. Ever since 1949 that has been characteristic of tbe political life of this country. What of hire-purchase transactions? The Prime Minister's speech here last September contained page after page of exhortations to the hire-purchase companies, and those financing them, to restrain their ardour for profits. He wanted interest rates to come down, but we find that some of the private banks are actively participating in the new finance companies, and providing tbe finance for hire purchase. No wonder the Prime Minister has gone cold on any plan to fix tha rates of interest for hire purchase. I want to make this clear: The view of our party is that the hire-purchase system does provide consumer credit for the ordinary Australian. It is most valuable. It enables him to obtain durable goods for the home or, perhaps, a car, on long and satisfactory terms. Without it we would, as I have said before, have to invent something else to take its place. Hire purchase is characteristic of the United States economy to a much greater extent than it is here, and I think that the extent of it even in this country has been exaggerated. What is the reason for that changed attitude of the Government? The Prime Minister said to the hire-purchase companies in September, ""You must make certain alterations"", but I think he was concerned most of all with the interest charges, which are enormous. There are two parts of that kind of transaction. One between the hire-purchaser-the ordinary member of the public who wants to buy a refrigerator on terms-and the seller. The interest charge is much greater than the consumer usually appreciates. It is very high and it should be limited. Secondly, tbere is a further transaction of a more dangerous character so far as finance is concerned, between the finance acceptancecorporation, or whatever it may be called, and the concern which makes the contract with the consumer. Those corporations obtain a great deal of their finance from the private banking system. It does not matter twopence to them if they have to pay a little higher interest to the private banks. The private banks support them. Indeed, some of tbe private banks may be numbered among their membership. In any case, the interest that they pay to the private banks is deductible as a business expense in that type of business. They are on clover. Therefore, here we have an organized system by which profit is heaped upon profit and the only concern of the organizations is to maintain the profit at a rate which we consider the community should not be compelled to stand. lionorable member do about it? be done to stop it. It is quite obvious, is it not, that if tbe finance coming from the private banking system to the acceptance corporations were fixed at a lower rate, that would reduce the rate to the ordinary consumer, and be would be able to get his refrigerator or other equipment at a much lower price? But the point about it is that there is no genuine intent to tackle the problem of interest rates in the community. The substantial increase of interest rates will, I repeat, bring an accretion of wealth-withou t any additional earning effort except bookkeeping -to the private banks of at least £1,250,000 per annum. It is not as though the profits of the private banks are low. They bave been increasing. They are substantial. The official records for the financial year 1954-55 show an increased profit for the private banks, taking them as a group, of approximately £750,000. In some records, notably those of the Commonwealth Bank, one finds profits stated in relation to shareholders' funds. That is most misleading although it is now becoming the customary way of stating the profits of a corporation. Shareholders' funds include, very often, millions of",36,Suspension Of Standing Orders
96,Mr Hulme,What would the right,37,Suspension Of Standing Orders
97,Dr. Evatt,"I am asked what couldpounds of reserves. On the basis of shareholders' funds a profit may be stated to be 5, 6 or 1 per cent., and the average reader will say, "" ""Well, that seems to be reasonable"". But it is not the profit on the capital investment at all, and to get at the truth one has to make elaborate calculations which show an enormously greater proportion of profit. The fact is that the Government has run away completely from the problem of hire purchase. We agree with hire purchase. We want it to be encouraged, but we insist that the rate of interest should be lower. One proposal which could be adopted if the Government were really genuine about it would be that of asking the States for the power to deal with interest rates generally, not continuing to be limited by the power that the Commonwealth already has. I think that that additional power, if sought from the States, would undoubtedly be given. If the States would not give it, an appeal basic wage remains frozen, because the could be made by this Parliament to the people for that power and whatever other powers are necessary to deal with the present inflation. I think that what my honourable colleague, the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) said the other night is correct. An argument has been going on as to what is the nature of the inflation. His assessment was that it is, in effect, a profit inflation. I would prefer to call it a "" profiteering inflation "". I believe that that is the main key to the problem in this country, and that some attempt to curb profiteering wili have to be made. We know perfectly well on whom the main burden of these new taxes will fall. It will fall on the ordinary consumer-tb e salary earner and others on fixed incomes. It will be a heavy burden. Some assess it at 10s. or more a week. Others estimate a higher figure; but the burden will be considerable. What has been tbe position of the wage and salary earner during this period of excessive profiteering? Even to-day, after more than two years, the federal basic wage is still frozen. The freeze has been accompanied by rising prices, and prices will rise further as a result of the proposed anti-inflation legislation. What is tbe use of talking about asking the worker the profits in the last two years, during for a greater effort? He is being made to bear the burden of the excessive profits to which I have referred. It is the same with margins, although the margins position has been alleviated. entirely. honourable member points out. The position of those on margins for skill is that, under the Galvin award, it followed that their margins were frozen. Nothing for skill! After it took six years for men to become fully trained in tbeir craft their margins were frozen by the tribunals, in the national interest. Thai has been altered to the extent that those receiving above a certain marginal rate have had their margins adjusted; but 50 per cent, of those receiving margins have had no adjustments, and that enormous group in the community has to face up to that situation. In addition, their basic wage is just as much part of the salary received as is the margin. industrial disputes. disputes, some of which have involved waterside workers, and, at the moment, the shearers. Behind that, what is tbe just decision from fhe wage point of view? How can there be wage justice and economic justice in the community as a whole if this kind of thing goes on? I say that that is of interest to the great bulk of the employees and people on fixed incomes who are paying higher prices than they sbould. It is from them that tbe profits in this country are derived, for a comparatively few people. Does anybody dispute the position regarding profits? It cannot be disputed. The facts are ascertainable in the White Paper published with the budget, which ought to be referred to again. The fact is that the increase of profits which is referred to in the White Paper is the highest increase in two years that has ever occurred in the history of the Australian economy.",37,Suspension Of Standing Orders

103,Dr. Evatt,"Ah! I am speaking of the very same period that has followed the loosening of the controls by the Commonwealtli, Bank in' connection with the privHtp. trading banks and,, in addition, tbe freezing of wages, the basic wage in particular.. That is the source from which the profits have been derived. That is the source of inflation. The Prime Minister stated in his September speech that this was a consumption boom. That view was contradicted by the Institute of Publie Affairs of Victoria. That institute disputed the Prime Minister's figures, because it argued that rhe base rate taken was wrong. The Prime Minister saidThe present condition is much more accurately described as a consumption boom than as a developmental boom. But the Institute of Public Affairs took the exactly opposite view. We say that the boom, or splurge, whatever phrase may be used, is explained by the budget speech of the Treasurer. He pointed out that a characteristic of the economy of Australia was the enormous expansion of private investment, referring to the private sector of the economy. Putting that into language that is not the language of the economic experts, it simply meant that relatively too little was being spent on schools and hospitals for the people, on roads and on water conservation and irrigation, and too much was being spent by making money available for the purpose of making profits. And tbe profits were so high and so attractive that, of course, profit-making concerns sought more profits. The Treasurer had the active assistance of the private banking system in carrying out this policy. The vicious circle ran in that way. I believe that to be the position, Mr having saidDeputy Speaker. NowI want to refer, as I said I would do a moment ago, to one argument in the Prime Minister's speech, which I think, sums up the situation. He saidTo achieve economic health, we must, clearly, increase our output, or reduce our demand, or both. Now, so far as increase of output is concerned, the Government cannot be heard vernment is acting. He saidto say that the workers of this country have not increased productivity. I shall most revert now to the article published, not pressure is to reduce the volume of purchasing by a Labour journal, but by the Institute powerwhich creates it. of Public Affairs of Victoria, wbich says this about the increase of consumption expenditureWhen account is taken of improvements in productivity over the last four or five years, vvhich have frequently been pointed to with pride by Cabinet Ministers And by no one more than the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt)theincrease in consumer spending indicated by our ngures could hardly be regarded as excessive; The point is that, having mentioned productivity, tbe Prime Minister withdraws from the field, because he has no case whatever against the workers in relation to productivity. Indeed, in a speech the other night, an official of the Chamber of Manufactures in Victoria claimed that 90 per cent, of the difliculties in the processes of productivity in this country were due to inefficient management. The man wbo madethat statement was speaking on behalf of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. I do not know whether that is a correct assessment of the percentage,, but it is sufficient for me, at any rate, to negative any suggestion that the effort put forward by the workers in industry has relevance to any productivity failure. Let me read again to the House what tbe Prime Minister had to say in his statement. It wasTo achieve economic health, we must, clearly, increase our output, or reduce our demand . . . Our output! Our demand 1 To continueWe must clearly increase our output, or reduce our demand, or both. On tbe subsequent page of the Hansard report the Prime Minister is recorded as It seems to be merely academic exercise to try to determine whether the excessive demand and, therefore, the inflation, arises from demand fbr consumption goods or from demand for capital investment. I think it is very important to see what is the cause of that, in spite of what tbe Prime Minister said. Before he announced his taxation proposals he developed the basis upon which the GoBut the truth is that, in the short run, the effective immediate way to relieve the Therefore, our demand must ba reduced! Our purchasing power must be cut down f What does that mean ? Whose purchasing power is it? Isi t the purchasing power of every one in the community? Of course it is not! The purchasing power referred to is an aggregate figure of actual economic power, or credit, or cash, with which to buy things. It is a figure which must be examined. I say that the demand in this country at present is in the hands, not of the ordinary people, but of the same interests to which I have already referred, namely, the great corporations and those who benefit from tbem-the great financial, industrial and commercial corporations. Tbey have possession of the demand. It is tbeir demand. It might be said that the whole demand is too much, but why mcrease taxes, as the Prime Minister immediately proceeded to do, in order to cut purchasing power-imposin g taxes on groups which are not endowed with sufficient purchasing power and, therefore, are unable to exercise sufficient demand? I say that that is the great failure running from beginning to end of the Prime Minister's speech. He speaks of demand or purchasing power, as an aggregate, but he will not divide it up into sectors of tbe people of Australia which have the necessary credit or cash in order to satisfy their demands. Their demands are not excessive. Their demands are demands for an ordinary reasonable standard of comfort. If they wish to add something to the comfort of the home, and buy it on hire purchase, or buy a car on terms, that is not unreasonable demand, and expenditure on such items cannot be condemned as excessive. But at the other end of the scale we see luxury expenditure. The press contains many illustrations of extravagant luxury imports which have disfigured this country for so long. Some cut in tbose imports has been announced, but that is a fact which the Prime Minister has to take into account. I do not think it is necessary for me to examine the Prime Minister's proposals point by point. Every one of the indirect taxes is intended to be passed on, at least to the situation is that support for Commonamount of the tax that the Commonwealth will collect. It is for that very purpose that it, is done in that way. All indirect taxation is. regressive, because an indirect tax. falls most heavily on those who are least able to pay it. The tax on a packet of cigarettes, for instance, is the same for the wealthiest person in the community as it is for the poorest member of the community. That is regressive taxation, which, as far as possible, the Labour party has always opposed. The Labour party says that there has been no diagnosis of the inflationary pressures in Australia during the last two years. The Prime Minister says that it is irrelevant to determine whether inflation arises from demand for consumer goods or from demand for capital investment. We say that tbe extra demand has been created as a result of the possession of increased purchasing power by the profiteering forces to which I have referred. The increase in profits as shown by the white paper presented with the budget proves that beyond doubt. The Prime Minister presented certain detailed arguments at a later stage of his speech, to which I shall refer as I deal with other aspects of the matter. To sum up, we have this imposition ot further indirect taxation, which will fall, in the way that I have described, mainly upon tbe family men, not upon those who are more able to bear it. The view of fche Government is that the demand on resources must be reduced. Therefore, the Prime Minister proposes to introduce his legislation. But he treats the demand quantitatively, as a whole, without examining how the taxation should be applied, and without seeing that the persons wbo will be hit by it most are persons in tbe groups to wbich I have referred. Then he adds, in effect, as though it. were an afterthought, "" I should tell the House that this extra money will be needed in any event"". Eor what purpose ? Eor tbe purpose of contributing to tbe finance that will be needed by tbe States for public works. That is the position taken up by the Prime Minister. It is very important to remember that matter, in examining the right honourable gentleman's speech, because the present wealth loans by ordinary investors has fallen off as a result of this Governinent'9 mismanagement of the bond market during the last five or six years. During'the war arid the post-war period, it was possible for the Governinent to raise money from the public at an interest rate of 3^ per cent. Mr Chifley insisted time and time again that the development of the nation and of our industries would be impeded if interest rates were allowed to reach high levels again. Therefore, a fundamental part of the Chifley'Government's policy, accepted by the people, was that the interest rate should be low. Investors, being appealed to by the Government, contributed to Commonwealth loans. I think the total value of Commonwealth bonds held by individual investors is in the neighbourhood of .£750,000,000. Commonwealth 3J per cent, bonds remained at par, or very close to it, during the whole period of office of the Labour Government, and for a portion of the period of office of the present Government. The policy of the Labour Government was supported by public opinion in this country. That was the position in the bond market until 1952. In 1952, for the first time, a change was made. The Commonwealth Bank and the National Debt Commissioners, acting as government agents, failed to support the market, with the result that the market prices of bonds fell, but tbe yield for purchasers at the reduced prices went up to approximately 4£ per cent. The ordinary investor who held bonds to the face value of £500 or £1,000, sometimes representing bis own savings and sometimes those of another member of his family as well, awoke to find, if he had not been following the market closely, that there had been a decline in the market value of his bonds by 9 per cent, or 10 per cent., or even more in some cases, with a. corresponding sharp increase in the yield for purchasers at the reduced prices. That matter has been treated by the Treasurer in this way. He says that there is no legal obligation on the Government to support the bond market. It is perfectly true that tbere is no legal obligation on the Government to support the market, but surely there is a moral obligation for it do so. That was the view that was always taken previously. It is extraordinary that, just before the the withdrawal should be followed by a Prime Minister made his statement, two general increase of interest rates. That moves were made by the Opposition which had a bearing on the questions of interest rates and the increases announced later by the Prime Minister. In the Address-in-Reply debate, we submitted an amendment attacking the Government for its failure to support tbe bond market. Debate on that amendment-was prevented by tbe Prime Minister, who said that the problems of the economy should be discussed together. But he has not discussed the matter in the way that it must be discussed. The position seems to me to be quite clear. The Bank of New South Wales, through its chairman, demanded that the Commonwealth sbould not continue to support the bond market. His argument was that if tbe Commonwealth Bank did so, tbe effect on the community would be inflationary. Imagine tbe Bank of New Soutb Wales objecting to it on that ground! Then Mr Rickettson, in many articles that he wrote, took the same point of view. He claimed that the Government was bound to withdraw support from the bond market. We found that, in the end, such support was withdrawn. In his speech, the Prime Minister said that the Government had decided that the levels to which the prices of Commonwealth bonds were falling would have to be accepted. That meant, in effect, that he approved of the yield to purchasers of bonds at the reduced prices going up from 4^ per cent, to 5 per cent., thereby reducing still further the capital value of bonds held by the ordinary investor. No doubt that decision of the Government was made with the approval of the Commonwealth Bank Board, because the Commonwealth Bank Board has taken that view before. It took that view in 1952, when the interest rate was increased from 3£ per cent, to 4£ per cent. Now tbe rate has gone up from 4£ to 5 per cent. A capital loss will be sustained by every bondholder who is compelled to sell. If a bondholder has kept his bonds in order to use them as a deposit on the purchase of a house, there will be a very substantial reduction in the value of the bonds for that purpose. The whole purpose of the withdrawal of government support from the bond market was that was the view which this party expressed a few weeks ago, and that view has been proved now to be correct. I have already indicated what it means so far as the private banks are concerned. But there is a broader aspect of the matter-that is, whether increased rates can be justified at all. The attitude of the Labour party is one of absolute opposition to an increase of interest rates. A further increase of interest rates will injure every active element in the community. I have referred, by way of illustration, to the effect on home-ownershirj. The increase of the interest rate3 will be a direct addition to the cost and will delay the completion of homes, whether constructed under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement or by the great co-operative building societies That in itself is a very great objection to the increased rates. Primary producers know that they will be a great handicap to primary production. They will be a great handicap to all productive activity in the community. They will handicap secondary industries, and, indeed, all economic activity except that of the banking system, credit organizations and financial institutions generally, which are not concerned with production. All productive activity will be subjected to an additional burden. I have said that Mr Chifley made the policy of cheap money absolutely fundamental during tbe war and in the early post-war years. The present Government accepted that policy until, in my opinion, the private banks became so powerful that the Government was forced to change it. That change has undoubtedly been one of the prime causes of the profit inflation from wbich Australia is now suffering. ""We are entitled to know all the circumstances associated with tha sudden withdrawal of support for the bond market by the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities. We have not been given a full explanation, and, as Leader of the Opposition, I now ask that the details be disclosed to the House. We know, as I have pointed out, that the private banks wanted that support withdrawn. The hundreds of thousands of Australians who have invested in government bonds are entitled to know that it was due to the ceaseless agitation of the private banks and their oflicials and associates that Commonwealth support of the bond market was withdrawn. The Prime Minister stated that abnormal support was required, and that this would have taken many millions of pounds. But he overlooked the fact that small investors have invested hundreds of millions of pounds. The Prime Minister stated also that the abnormal support required would have caused great inflationary pressure. I dispute that statement. Inflationary pressure would not have been caused in the circumstances, because the Commonwealth bas an obligation to tbe small private bondholder wbich it bas simply to discharge under certain conditions. When war savings certificates were issued, the private investor was well protected under the terms of his contract witb the Government. One of the first steps in the current situation should be the restoration of the confidence of the small investor in the bond market, on which both the Commonwealth and the States depend under the Financial Agreement of 1927. This is important because we cannot have the Commonwealtb always called upon to pay for public works out of taxation. Broadly speaking, public works should be paid for out of loan moneys, although I admit that there are circumstances, especially in prosperous times, in which loans sbould be supported from revenue. However, generally speaking, this should not be required. In order that public works can be financed from loan moneys, confidence in tbe loan market must be restored. My attention has been directed to tbe position in the United States of America, where special bonds, very much akin to the war savings certificates issued in Australia during the war, are issued. The fact is that the small investor in Australia will not invest, not because he doubts whether the full face value of the bond will be paid at maturity, but because, if he has to sell before the bond matures, he will lose a proportion of his capital. The bonds could be issued on terms that would protect the investor against this loss. The series E savings bonds, similar to the war savings certificates, were issued in the United States for that very purpose. They are non-negotiable. Interest is not paid periodically, but accumulates throughout the ten-year term of the bond. The bonds are sold at an issue price of 75 and mature ten years later at 100. This represents a return of approximately 3 per cent, over the life of the bond. I would point out that I am not at the moment concerning myself about tbe precise rate of interest. The bonds are redeemable at the option of the holder at any time 60 days or more after issue at redemption prices fixed in advance and printed on each bond. Consequently, they are not subject to any risk of price fluctuation. During the first year after issue, no interest is paid. Thereafter, the rate rises gradually. The bonds may be purchased' only by individuals, and no investor may buy more than 10,000 dollars worth in any year. They are available in low denominations and are readily replaced if lost. This is a very convenient system of investment in' bonds, and I think no less than 13 per cent, of the entire public debt of the United States bas been taken up by small investors under those terms. A similar scheme should be adooted in Australia in an attempt to restore confidence in the loan market. The lack of confidence in the bond market has made it necessary for the Commonwealth to come to the rescue by supporting State public works. This would not have been necessary bad the integrity of the bond market been protected as it was for so many years by tbe Labour Government and by tbe present Government during its early years of office Unfortunately, tbe lack of confidence bas been made even worse by tbe sudden withdrawal of support, at the instigation of the Government, by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and other Commonwealth agencies in order to bring about an accomplished fact, which would be and must be accepted, as was argued by tbe Bank of New South ""Wales Limited and Mr Ricketson in relation to the increase of interest rates generally. Their argument was that, if tbe yield on bonds were increased, tbe increase of interest rates generally would be as certain as it is certain that night follows day. This is exactly how it has worked out. It has a veiy important aspect. Many passages in the books of the great economists deal with this problem. Lord Beveridge, in his book Full Employment in a Free Society, derides tbe Prime Minister's idea that an increase of the interest rate on advances will control inflation. He concedes that an enormous increase might do so in some circumstances, but be strongly supports tbe maintenance of a cheap money policy and the lowest possible rate of interest. So also do Samuelson, the great United States authority, Keynes, and other great economists. Why is tbe Government retreating on the question of interest rates when, for so many years, low interest rates have been accepted as vital to all productive activity in Australia? primary industries. primary producers know it, of course. Recently we bave heard the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock) and other representatives of tbe Australian Country party telling us how important to the primary industries low interest rates are. The Opposition proposes to seek a special vote of the House during this debate to ascertain whether the increase of interest rates is approved by the House. It is vital that we prevent an increase of interest rates. As I have said, Lord Beveridge, in dealing with this problem, derides the proposition that an increase of interest rates will have the automatic effect, wbich used to be attributed to it. of controlling inflation, He statesAn integral part of a policy of full employment is a "" cheap money "" policy . . . The rate of interest used to be looked upon as a price which adjusted the demand for savings to the supply. He added that that view is now completely exploded as an economic doctrine. So it has been, but apparently it is nowaccepted by this Government. I shall try now to sum up the position. First, the people have given no authority for any of these taxation measures, which are all inflationary in character. The statement that tbey are disinflationary is completely wrong. It can have been made only as the result of the Prime Minister's acceptance of the views of. the many economists, the multitudes of economists, who were engaged in helping in the preparation of these proposals. They speak of the necessity for draining off spending power from the people. Of course, they are not in tbe groups to which draining off will make",38,Suspension Of Standing Orders

105,Dr. Evatt,"Representative s of themuch difference. They wsiut to drain it off-the y sometimes speak of mopping it up-fro m the basic wage-earner and from the ordinary people on small fixed incomes in this country. I say, therefore, that the basis of the proposals is fallacious. Secondly, their real purpose is to raise money for the purpose of loan to the States for public works, and it is necessary to do that only because of the collapse of the bond market so far as ordinary investors are concerned. That collapse was deliberately brought about, not for the sake of producing a collapse, but because the Government was pledged to the private banks to ensure that the interest rate would rise, and pledged to accept the advice of the Bank of New South Wales, which made public demands -som e of them in peremptory languagethat the Government's support should be withdrawn. Honourable members Honourable members must maintain silence. Honourable members on the Oppositiou front benches are included in that injunction. said that this step is disinflationary, but according to those persons who have written on this problem that is just as true as saying that inflation is disinflation, because it actually causes extra prices and is so intended. All these proposals will be resisted and opposed by the Opposition. I think the interest rate proposal is the most important of all. The first thing that has to be done in this situation is to try to restore from the wreck the bond market, trusted by so many hundreds of thousands of Australians for so long. I have indicated a way in which that might be attempted. At the same time, some attempt should be made to meet cases of hardship amongst bondholders already holding securities. Any attempt to solve that problem will be assisted by the Opposition. If higher taxation is to be imposed on companies, instead of applying the flat rate of Is. in the £1, the proper course is that which was indicated by the Labour party at the last election, namely, the imposition of an anti-profiteering tax, limited to compa.Tiif>= -^-bose profits are excessive having R -[37 ] regard to the capital invested and all the other circumstances. That is the appropriate way of getting rid of the inflation, if it is, as we contend, a profiteering inflation. The import policy of the Goverament -is connected, of course, with an inactive export policy. We were pleased to hear, after so many months or years of resistant, that Government representatives are endeavouring to establish markets, as the Minister for Trade China, which is the best market in Asia. We bave continuously pressed for that to be done, but instead of some public servant the Minister himself should go and see if he can do for Australia in the export market what has been done by Canada and India in establishing markets of a similar character. The Government has no plan to deal with hire purchase. I say that the interjecting, interest rate in hire purchase has to be reduced, even if it means asking the States for power to deal with interest, beyond banking, and I think that a great deal can be done without acquiring additional powers from tbe States. The problem is a technical one and can be dealt with in detail later. It is of no use for the Government to talk about voluntary restraint, as tbe Prime Minister did in September. He said, in effect, to the hire purchase organizations, "" I appeal to you not to be too tough with youiprofiteering. We have helped you as much as possible. You have made enormous profits. Be satisfied"". But they are not satisfied. The very purpose of these organizations is to make profit and then more profit. The demands of private investment are to increase the profit still further. I say that the whole of the Government's proposals show a complete absence of plan. It will not tbink of tbe word "" planning "". It will not see that these problems bave to be faced boldly, and its conduct over the last six or seven years as one crisis succeeds another shows that it bas no idea of the manner in which the economic problems of this country can be solved. Later in the evening a specific amendment will be introduced on behalf of the Opposition demanding a vote from the House, in particular against an in«fease in interest rates.",43,Suspension Of Standing Orders

124,Mr Haeold Holt,"On e wouldCrovernment regards it as a very desirable feature of modern community life. We in Australia are attempting to do very many tbings all at once, but we must exercise some moderation if we are to do tbe most important things. One need only look at the movement in hire purchase transactions to see what has happened in that field. At June, 1953, the balance owing on goods purchased under hire-purchase agreements in Australia was £87,000,000; in December, 1955, it was £207,000,000. Moreover, registrations of motor vehicles rose from 7,400 a month as at June, 1953, to 16,475 a inonth as at June, 1955a phenomenal increase. If the States were to give to the Commonwealtb the power to deal with the problem of hire-purchase finance, the Government would be greatly strengthened, but we do not share the confidence of the Leader of the Opposition that the States would give that power to the Commonwealth. Indeed, when tbe Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) last raised the matter at a Premiers' conference, one of the Labour Premiers returned to his State and lowered the deposit rate on hire-purchase transactions. Many attacks have been made on tbe profits of companies. Such attacks constitute a hardy perennial for honourable gentlemen opposite, who have a phobia about profitable investment and profitable company transactions in Australia. Again, time will not enable me to give all the answers, but let me say that the revenue that is raised for the provision of social services benefits, the employment that we are able to give to hundreds of thousands of Australians in the manufacturing industries, the very stability of the Deputy Speaker, one of the most distinnation, our internal security, and our ability to resist aggression, all depend upon profitable industrial investment in this country. Bather than condemning and attacking efficient management for making profits we should be grateful to it. Let us get some competition into the field, if you like. But honourable members opposite are opposed to competition; they want a socialist community. Let me remind them that greater competition is likely to lead to lower prices and lower profits. We believe that a considerable part of increased profits should be passed on in the form of lower prices, and management might well take that suggestion to heart. But I repudiate thestatements of the Leader of the Opposition about the inefficiency of management and the statement that he attributed to an alleged spokesman of tbe Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. Opposition referred to the Victorian Chamber of Commerce. honourable gentleman referred to the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, and that organization has to-night sent me a message entirely repudiating his statement. Tbe Government has set itself certain broad national objectives such as national development, adequate defence, rising standards of living, and ful l employment. It has been the proud boast of the Government that it has had a vested interest in prosperity, just as honourable gentlemen opposite have a vested political interest in depressions. We survive politically at the hands of tlie Australian people because we stand for prosperity, and they know it. Moreover, we are consolidating the prosperity that we have established during the time we have been in office. The measures that the Government has placed before the Australian people have that as their objective and, given a reasonable measure of co-operation by the people, which we confidently expect, we shall attain that objective for this expanding and developing nation, this secure nation, in which the people enjoy not only full employment but also rising standards of living. guished members of the "" first eleven "" has returned to the pavilion without making i a hit.

The suggestion that order to give the trading banks another £1,500,000-it may be £2,500,000; the figure is extremely conservative reminds me of Alice in Wonderland. Tbe suggestion implies that you take a drink from a certain bottle to increase your size, or take a nibble at the magic biscuit to make yourself small enough to enter tbe hole down which the inflationary rabbit went, or stay outside it. I want to get on to the real reason why the Prime Minister wonM not tackle this problem in a tradesmanlike way.

133,Mr Haylen,"Honorabl e membersThe horrible aspect of it is that it has been disguised by a series of statements by the Prime Minister as though he were correcting the economy and putting things in order, when underneath is the fact that a savage battle bas been raging since 1949 to destroy the Chifley policy of cheap slogan was coined, "" It is pretty cool in money, adequate controls and sane development, and the Chifley belief that a man should share in the country's riches and part of its dreams. To-day, the Government has sold out completely to the trading banks, as I shall prove in the time an extraordinary phrase. left at my disposal. In 1953, when the banking legislation was altered, the Commonwealth Bank began this horrible business that has been going on ever since. WbenI attempted to bring tbe matter up in tbe House as a matter of urgency, I was told, again by tbe Lord High Executioner, that I could not speak. That is tbe first occasion in my recollection, after 1953 legislation the trading bank was twelve years in this House, that that sort of thing bas happened to an honourable member who has sought to use the forms of the House in order to discuss a matter of urgent public importance. The reason was given that the Prime Minister did not want the case for economic controls fragmented, that he wanted us to see thc situation as a whole. Well, we are not so silly as that, because if we had gone any further we would have fallen into the "" hole "". The Government's case was to be, to nse a new word, ""unfragmented "". Since tbe Government itself is a coalition and consists of two fragments, and as it has an upper and lower set in its Cabinet-anothe r two fragments-and has brought into this House three differing views on interest rates-anothe r three fragments-tb e fragmentation of tbe Government's case is absolute and I shall touch upon it no further. This is tbe situation and the struggle: The trading banks, if they are to eliminate cheap money from this communitv and this economy, must first get rid of the legislation implemented by the Chifley Government, and tbey will bave to attempt-and tbey did attempt as tbey are still attempting to-dayto do southing with the Commonwealth Bank. RV» the whole heat of the attack, disguised from time to time by statements by Government supporters, is upon the Oommonwealth Bank. Tbe Commonwealth Bank is to do the bidding of its bosses. There is no nimbus of immortality upon any member of tbe Commonwealth Bank Board. I have considered their records. Tbe only one in any way noteworthy is Professor Hytten, of whom the the Hytten pool"". He would be a stalwart advocate of full employment! Would he not mouth that lovely phrase, that desecration of English, "" Over-full employment""! I have never beard such SoI get back to the point that the Commonwealth Bank Board is assisting in this breakdown of the Commonwealth Bank itself, and the breakdown bas occurred in those departments of the Commonwealth Pank that are concerned with cheap interest, and that were instituted by the Chifley Government. In the separated from the other functions of the Commonwealth Bank, and it was. capitalized at £5,000,000. So, immediately, in order to survive, it bad to get more deposits and bad to lend on short terms. As a result, the housing project suffered immediately. No matter what honourable members may say about it, it no longer bad tbe central bank as a bulwark. It was left naked to tbe world so far as its competitors were concerned. Then the Commonwealth Bank Board, urged by the friends of this Government who want to get rid of the cheap money philosophy from the economy before they can move any further in this squeeze, decided to attack two departments of the Commonwealth Bank. BeforeI come to that point, I may mention that it is significant that there is now resolved in the minds of big business, and it is obvious to any one who gives a moment's study to the matter, a determination to make the £1 have value. If the Prime Minister cannot do it in seven years the businessmen believe they can do it now, and tbe battle is joined. Tbe profits that have been made since the war, and the new aggregations of capital gains made during tbe war, have beon very large, but inflation has acted to reduce tbeir value. The only way to make tbem strong and real, and to make the people who possess plenty of money solid millionaires, is to make money scarce and diflicult to obtain. If we have scarcity we have demand; if we have demand we have a further pressure upon that demand; and that is exactly what |hey want. There is the plan. It is quite obvious. This is what occurred in regard to the Commonwealth Bank. The Industrial Finance Department of the Commonwealth Bank consisted of two sections, the advances section and the hire-purchase section. When the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt), who has now left the chamber, was talking about this matter, he referred to how much the worker had. How much has the worker lost through the fact that there is now, in no circumstances, any bank for him to go for cheap money, which is the essence of development of this country ? Because of the pressure upon him resulting from the weakened value of the £1, he has no chance of saving any money. The Prime Minister himself admitted, when addressing the electors of North Sydney at tbe recent State election-and thus ensuring the return of the Labour candidate-that tbe value of the £1 had been reduced by 60 per cent, since he had been Prime Minister. I merely mention that in passing, and I return to my remarks about the two sections of the industrial finance department of the Commonwealth Bank. In my view, deadly attacks have been made on the Australian economy. The increase of 2d. a glass in the price of beer, tbe increase of tbe price of tobacco, and the change in the interest rates, are all symptoms of these attacks, but the real and drastic struggle is taking place in tbe directorates of the trading banks and in the Commonwealth Bank Board. The Industrial Finance Department of tbe Commonwealth Bank has now disappeared. The advances section, created by the Chifley Government, had as its purpose tbe lending of money to young men, returned soldiers, young businessmen, men with ideals and with faith in tliis country, wbo did not bave full security. Tbey may have had some collateral, perhaps in the form of patent rights, and they may have had some money or some stock, but it was essential ior them to obtain extra money. It was the direction of the greatest Treasurer this country has ever had, the late Mr with the wind, as I said before. This Chifley, whose shadow lies heavily over this debate to-night, that money should be lent to those people on their face value. The amounts of the loans ranged from £200 to £5,000. An amount of between £16,000,000 and £17,000,000 was employed in that way, and small businessmen, such as corner grocers, and men with ideas, were enabled to commence in business and to develop their plans. Many big businesses have had to start in that way. After the 1953 legislation the Industrial Finance Department of tbe Commonwealth Bank was abolished, and the operative interest rate of 4J per cent. -the cheap money-wen t with it. Shades of tbe hire-purchase "" interest rates! Shades of the new rise in interest rates! Tbere was the nigger in the woodpile, and it had to be eliminated, and so 4$ per cent, was no longer the opportunity interest rate. All the accounts of the small borrowers were transferred to the Commonwealth Trading Bank under the 1953 legislation. They are now on a reduction basis; they are gone with the wind. The Commonwealth Bank was advised that it must not conduct business of that kind, because it meant cheap money. That was the Chifley economy, and therefore it was abhorrent to the government of the day. We know that people have suffered, and have been hurt. We ask ourselves and the Government: What of tbe £17,000,000 to £20,000,000 lent from this department? Where do people go for it now and what will they pay in interest? The Government will not answer that question. Then we come to hire purchase. It was a concept of Mr Chifley that 4f per cent, should be the maximum rate of interest in respect of motor cars and he provided in this hire-purchase section of the bank enough money to finance tbe purchase of motor cars, and some agricultural machinery. He intended to extend the idea to all the durable goods required in the home. Before the Labour Government was able to implement that proposal, it left office, and, little by little, this department has been whittled down until, on the 28th February of this year, the hire-purchase section of the Commonwealth Bank was abolished. It has gone is why the time-payment firms are flourishing and this is why the trading scope that he cast a few months ago and banks bave time-payment adjuncts in has found to be badly out of reckoning. their offices which are thinly-disguised banks for the getting of high interest Why did. not the Prime Minister tell the rates.

As a memand important, but I see that my time ber wbo is deeply concerned for the future, is limited, so I shall have to read them. I am very tired of this posturing in front hurriedly. I am all the more sorry for of a very difficult financial position. 1 that, because there are a lot of things think that the Prime Minister has "" had that should be said on this issue. But it as far as finance is concerned. He is here are the vital figures. In 1953-54, prepared to let go. He does not know the sum of £14,200,000 was lent by the where to go.

The only way to do that is to return to That is where tbe battle is joined and the Chifley policy of cheap money, wbich that is where the trouble exists. There nroduced in our time the highest level of is no other way of explaining this. The Prime Minister's statement is not within a very small limit over the years worth consideration. As the Leader of of his occupancy of the Prime Ministerthe Australian Labour party said, the Prime Minister pontificated in front of ship and the Treasury. That was a pretty a subject but got no nearer to it. A good example which I commend to the vital struggle is in progress.

134,Mr Hasluck (Curtin,"Minister forWhen, eventually, he came down to recognize that that was the subject matter of this debate, what did he say? In those concluding few minutes, he made two mis-statements which I think I cun refer to, without exaggeration, as gross mis-statement. In the first place, he said that the speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to this House contained nothing but a certain proposal, which he specified. Of course, every member of this House and every person in the Australian nation knows that the Prime Minister's speech began, and was threaded through, with an attempt to analyse the economic situation to-day; an attempt to define the causes of that situation; and an attempt to propose in a logical and practical way the remedies that could best be applied to the situation. The second exaggeration or misstatement that the honourable member for Parkes made was that nothing was said about this subject during the December election campaign. He has only to refer, as every citizen can, to the policy speech and on petrol. Why are we proposing given on behalf of the Government parties by the Prime Minister to know that in that speech attention was drawn to the grave concern that the Government was feeling about the economic state of the nation. Not only was attention drawn to it but we said, without attempting to hoodwink, bluff or mislead the people of Australia, that if returned to office, we duce is that it will cut spending in a would take immediate action to deal, as necessary, with the emergency that presented itself. It is in keeping with that ports. As honourable members realize, policy speech which was delivered in December last, a policy speech which led to the return of the Government parties, that the Prime Minister has now put forward these proposals. I return to the remarks of the honourable member for Parkes in that concluding five minutes of his speech in which he attempted to deal with the economic situation. What did he put forward as a suggestion from the Labour benches as to what should be done in this crisis? He referred to the shadow of the former great Labour leader, Mr Chifley, hanging over this debate. He suggested that Mr Chifley would bave done this and Mr Chifley would have done that. Does not he realize, and do not the members of the Australian Labour party realize, that Mr Chifley was dealing witb the situation wbich existed eight, nine or ten years ago, and not with the current situation ? I would warrant-and I tbink every member on the Opposition benches would readily admit in the privacy of his own mind-that if Mr Chifley were alive and leading the Opposition to-day he, as a man with some realism in economic affairs, would be grappling, not with the situation of eight or nine years ago, but witb the situation of to-day, and he would be proposing measures quite different from tbose which the bonorable member quoted out of his mouth. WhatI want to do in the few minutes available to me in this debate is to take just one section of the Government's proposals and set out as clearly as I can the action that the Government is proposing to take and the reason for that particular action. One of the first of the Government's proposals is that an additional tax should be placed on motor vehicles that particular action? It is not just in order to be vexatious. reason for that action is not simply ""to be vexatious. It is in order to try to produce certain economic effects. The first economic effect which we hope it will proparticular direction, a direction which is helping to promote a high level of imthe high level of imports is leading to our present difficulties in overseas balances. We also hope that that particular action will cut spending in a direction which at the present time is increasing internal capital demand. The second form of action that we are taking in that department of our proposals is the imposition of additional taxes on beer, spirits, tobacco and cigarettes. Wby have we chosen that particular form of taxation ? One of the reasons is that we wish to secure added revenue in order to avoid deficit finance because, as every honourable member will appreciate, deficit finance would have an inflationary effect at the present time. Later in my remarks.",52,Opposition Members Hear Hear
135,Mr Cubtin,You can tell us.,53,Opposition Members Hear Hear
136,Mr Hasluck,"I will tell you. Theif time permits, I will return to that submaintain a higher standard of living; it ject. Another reason why we have chosen that particular form of action is that-to some extent in the case of beer, though perhaps not .in the case of spirits and tobacco-it will, if it results in reduced spending, check a growing internal capital demand. A third form of action that we are proposing is an increase in company taxation. Why have we chosen to do that? We have chosen to do it because we believe that that particular form of taxation will check the demand for investment which it is beyond the capacity of either our saving or our borrowing to provide. The fourth form of action that we are taking is to increase sales tax on a series have in order to do what we want to of goods which have been selected because we believe that an increased tax on these particular goods will produce a certain effect. We believe that it will check consumer demand and will have consequent effects both on the demand for imports and on the capital demand inside Australia. Secondly, it is also likely to have the effect of raising revenue to help us, as will other revenue, to avoid deficit hp reaches the point where there is no finance. It seems to me that a good deal of the situation with which we are dealing in Australia to-day can best be considered by examining the nature of the demands that are present in Australia to-day. [Quorum formed.] The section of the economic problem with which I am dealing can probably best be considered under the heading of demand. The demand that we are experiencing in Australia to-day is, on tbe one hand, a demand for capital goods, and, on the other, a demand for consumption goods. It will be plain to all honourable members that the demand for capital goods results in a higher level of investof Australia and, temporarily-and perment, and that the demand for consumption goods results immediately in a higher level of spending. Both those results interact, one with another, so to produce the sort of pressures that add to the general inflationary situation. Demand is not in itself, I would suggest, in any way bad. The demand for capital goods which we are experiencing in Australia to-day is part of an attempt to develop our country; it is part of an attempt to is part of an attempt to provide a larger measure of services to the people of our country; and, in part, it may be a response to some demands on the part of the customers that are, to put it in general terms, not altogether healthy. Ro long as we want the right things and do the right things, this demand is all to the good, but no government can let demand of that kind run away and take control of the country if it retains any sense of responsibility about either the way in which the country should develop or the way in which tbe economy of the country needs to be protected against unusual influences. That problem of demand comes to a head when we reach the point where the resources that we do are less than the need to do those things. simple terms for the benefit of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). The position is something like that of a man climbing up a rope. When more rope he cannot climb any higher. It is just the same with investment. We can go to a certain point, but if we have no wherewithal with which to continue the investment, we can go no further. The alternatives are either to save more, to borrow more from inside our own country or outside of it, or to do less. I would not suggest for a moment, nor does the Government, that we should take any one of those courses solely, but rather a little of each. We can save more. If it is possible-and at the present moment it does not seem to be-w e can borrow more outside Australia or from the people haps unfortunately-w e can also decide that we have reached the point where we must do less. However, in deciding that, we must be careful not to check development to too great an extent. We must realize that what we are doing is an action of temporary adjustment. It is an attempt to save the economy, and is not a permanent policy. I think that is the point which separates the approach of this Government from the approach",53,Opposition Members Hear Hear

138,Mr Hasluck,"I will put it in morewhicli has been shown by members of tbe some relevance to the situation with whicli Opposition. We believe that we are dealwe are dealing. The expenditure of a ing with a situation which can be a sum of the order of £50,000,000 on beer temporary situation-whic h we hope is each year involves commitments for builda temporary situation-and we are trying ings required by the brewing industry, the to apply to it expedients appropriate to tying up of a labour force for the brewing that particular sort of situation. Tbe industry, commitments for plant and Opposition, on the other band, I suggest, machinery for the brewing industry, .and is seriously handicapped by tbe fact that the withdrawal from other avenues of raw it is hanging on to lots of tag ends of old materials and ingredients for the brewing policies, and lots of imperfectly underindustry and, so far as all those things stood ideas, and is trying to :apply them are tied up by that demand, they are not willy-nilly to all sorts of situations withavailable for something else. I think that, out regard to the exact nature of those at the present time, the situation expresses situations. Now, the other sort of demand to which for capital investment in the brewing I have referred is the demand for conindustry. Brewing is a thriving industry, sumption goods. Tbat is, of course, a and it is responding to the pressure of the consequence of our prosperity. The fact present very great demand, wbich is a that there is full employment, the fact consequence of our prosperity. that people have high wages, the fact that there is a liberal provision for social sercollects revenue which is applied to otlier vices, means that we are in a state of tasks tban those represented by the brewprosperity in which there is a high coning industry. It also checks consumer sumer demand; and in a free country such demand, or it is hoped that it will do so. as we still have in Australia purchasing and thus reduces capital demands from power reflects itself in the idle fancies of that particular industry, and relieves that the people, as well as in their considered area of pressure on our economy.

The second method is non-inflationary. S*o that gives us a third and added advantage in the Government's proposals for raising revenue by selective taxation which will have a non-inflatioinary effect in the financing of our cash deficit. time Ihas -expired. -There are two proposals before the House, embodied in the economic statement presented by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) last week. One of them might be called the fiscal, .or taxing, proposals; the other is tbe proposal to increase interest rates on bank overdrafts, which might ,be called a monetary measure. To begin with, the Labour party disagrees with both proposals in the form enunciated -by the Prime Minister. We do not disagree with tbe Prime Minister's assumption that there is some degree of inflation to-day. We would go as far as to say that that state of inflation tories reads the Prime Minister's statehas existed for a considerable time, and that it has been aggravated only as a result of the policies that the Government has pursued from time to time. We would also say that, rather than abate the evils of inflation as it exists at the moment, adoption of the proposals now before the House will only accntnate it. Thc Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) brushes the whole thing off in a categorical manner by saying that -the issup of -treasury-bills is inflationary, and that the taxation measures that the Government proposes are not inflationary. HP was quite categorical about it. I think tion: The Prime Minister has indicated that, we need at times, to ask ourselves clearly that in .this financial year he will whether we are not becoming bamboozled be £30,000,000 short between his over-al! by certain words and, certainly, by the commitments, taking the State loan works application of those words. As I underprogramme into account, and his expected stand the tax proposals before the House, they do increase tbe price of certain commodities. They increase the price of beer and spirits. They increase tbe price of petrol. They increase the price of motor cars. Now, surely in some definitions, increased prices are regarded as inflationary. But tbe Minister for Territories says, "" No, those matters are not inflationary"". T suggest that the only difference between the tax proposals enunciated by the Government, and the other alternative, which the Minister rejected, of resort to tbe issue of treasury-bills, is that the tax proposals will channel the inflation in particular directions, whilst the issue of treasury-bills would make the inflation bear upon the community as a whole. There may be some justice in the placing of a burden on the community as a wliole rather than the measures proposed by the Government, which are sectional. If some of the contradictions in the speech of the Minister for Territories were disentangled, he would seem to assume that the Government's measures will lead to a reduction of the consumption of beer, spirits, petrol and tobacco. Yet the assumption of the Government is that the present rates of consumption will continue and that tbe increased taxes will yield an extra amount estimated as approximately £30,000,000 by the end of June, and yield an estimated extra amount of £100,000,000 in the next financial year. I suggest that if the Minister for Terriments closely he will find that that is the implication of the measures. Similarly, the additional taxes on motor cars and on petrol are supposed, apparently, to abate the flow of imports. Yet, again, the words of the Prime Minister are <slear. He says that at present levels of clearances of petrol we can expect to get £12,000,000 this year in increased revenue. The phrase "" at present levels of clearances does not seem to me to connote any reduction of the drain on our overseas fund? so far as petrol is concerned. We say this about the present situa-",55,Opposition Members Hear Hear

What we say about those measures is that tbe Prime Minister, the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Eadden) and the other members of the Government ought to have seen at the time of the last budget that there would be an overall deficit. If they ing the last financial year what are called had foreseen it then, they could have brought down measures for taxation that would have borne with justice on all sections of the community. There could have been higher company taxation. There could have been higher income taxation, if necessary. But no! The Treasurer presented bis budget, knowing that shortly afterwards there would be an election. The Government went to the electors on the 10th December of last year. In tbe four or five months that elapsed between the presentation of the budget and tbe election, surely there ought to have been some realization by the Government of the deterioration of tbe nation's finances. Surely the Prime Minister should have been able to tell the electors during the election campaign that they could expect tough measures. But nothing was said about that during the campaign. We were told that never before had Australia experienced such unbounded prosperity. I think' that was the grand term used. Nothing was said then about the deterioration of the nation's finances. But now, three months after the election, we are told that the Government must get £30,000,000 in the quickest possible time. What is the easiest way in which to get £30,000,000 of extra revenue in the quickest possible time? It cannot be done by increasing company taxation, because the returns will not be lodged until the end of June. The Government has already warned the companies in advance of what the increase is likely to be. I suggest that it could be a great deal more, if the Prime Minister's statemend to the attention of honourable memment of what is wrong with the Australian economy to-day is well founded. In his statement, the right honourable gentleman has said that the large growth in capital demand has been in the pritbat. vate sector. It has been pointed out But to-day in this debate that the greatest that cause of aggravation so far as the private that sector is concerned is the size of the incomes going to the large corporations. During the last election campaign, the Labour party said that it wanted an excess profits tax. In support of its contention, it pointed to the White Paper on National Income which showed that durcompanies in this country earned a sum of £700,000,000, taking excess of revenue over expenditure before depreciation was allowed. Of that £700,000,000, the Commissioner of Taxation permitted £200,000,000 to be treated as depreciation allowances. That concession is expected to enable companies to put their plant and machinery back into the state in which it was at the beginning of the year, by means of maintenance or replacement. There was still left an aggregate sum of £500,000,000, out of which company taxation for ihis year will take £190,000,000 and dividend's, estimated on the basis of the previous year, will take about £110,000,000. Of' that sum of £500,000,000, £200,000,000 will be in tbe hands of these private institutions to spend on further capital investmentto spend in a direction in which the Prime Minister says there has been too much spending already. Wben there is £200,000,000 actually in the possession of these companies, does any one in the community say that an alteration of 1 per cent, of the rate of interest charged on bank overdrafts-whic h many of the companies will not need anyway-wil l restrict investment? Surely any one who says that is not being serious. We on this side of the House are concerned with the welfare, not of particular sections of the Australian people, but of the Australian people as a whole. When the last budget was presented we pointed out that, if investment was excessive, there was too much investment, not in the public sphere but in the private sphere. I combers a very excellent diagnosis of public investment in Australia contained in a publication issued in December of last year by the Australian Industries Development Association. It shows that, of the total expenditure on investment in the year that ended in June, 1955, £833,000,000 was on private account and only £412,000,000 was on public account. The items under the heading "" public account"" included the post office, railways, roads, transport, electricity and gas, tax of all is the income tax, which is based coal and briquettes, water supply and sewerage, development, schools and hospitals. Schools accounted for the miserable sum of £14,000,000 and hospitals for the miserable sum of £15,000,000. Miscellaneous items accounted for £26,000,000. The latest year for which a dissection is available is 1954, to be a reconstruction of the income tax when the total investment on public account was £398,000,000. When the last budget was presented, be a higher rate structure in respect of we said that the direction in which the higher incomes. That would be a just economy was going wrong was clear. We method. said that, if there were too much investment, the balance was too much in favour of private development, and that not this Government to the problem is enough money was being spent on essencynical.

The imposition of indirect taxes in not the just way in which to raise additional revenue. The most just on people's ability to pay. When the irrigation, forestry, land Government has taken from the taxdwelling construction, payers what is required by the community, they have a free choice how to spend their money.

150,Mr Roberton (Eiverina,"Ministe rthat the action proposed now should have been taken then. If the Government had taken this action in September of last year, would the honourable member and his Opposition colleagues have supported it then? I suggest that the criticism offered by Opposition members would have been just as fearsome and as nebulous then as it is now. I must confess that I personally am undismayed by the situation, grave as it is, that confronts every man, woman and child in Australia. I wholeheartedly approve the remedial measures that have been taken already by the Government, or are about to be taken, to remedy tbe position. If there is any fault in them, it is surely that they are too temporary and too tentative. They are too temporary because they are expected to remedy the situation in a period of months, and too tentative because, the situation having been remedied, we shall return to the status quo ante. This is the only fault that I can see in the Government's proposals. In this extraordinary age of infinite ease and spurious affluence, it was inevitable that, sooner or later; the tide of the balance of payments would turn against the peopleand the economy of Australia, and that both public and private expenditure would ultimately reach a peak, as they have done. It was inevitable that full employment, which restricts work to a few hours a day and a few days a week, would ultimately l if t our cost structure to dangerous heights, as has already happened. It was inevitable that our money market would become sick to death of controls which limited legitimate trading and gave unbridled licence to illegitimate trading. These circumstances, if they are allowed to go unchecked, can serve only to destroy the prosperity of our people, to aggravate inflation and depreciate our ourrency still further, and to reduce our standard of living to wretchedness and woe. That cannot be allowed to happen under this Government. It must be recognized that there are those who desire to destroy tbe prosperity of our people and our country. There are tbose who hope to profit politically from the misery of inflation, and to cause disaffection in our community. They believe that it is their manifest duty to resist and resent the measures which are now under discussion, but their influence has been shattered in the last six years, and the fragments that remain are no longer of any great importance. Even the bits and pieces lying-ho w appropriate that word is!-abou t this place are of no great importance. It is not in dispute that the tide of the balance of payments has turned against us. Even that was confessed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and, indeed, by the Leader of the Opposition.

158,Mr Roberton,"I regret that whatto happen? Do they want that situation to develop in this country when, by taking appropriate action now, it can be prevented. balances are created when our exports, in terms of monetary value, exceed our imports. That is elementary, but what is not so clear in the public mind is tbe fact that our favorable trade balances are created almost exclusively by our export industries, and our export industries are almost exclusively primary industries. There are some 563,000 persons engaged in the primary industries, including minbut, whereas import restrictions can coning, or, roughly speaking, one-eighteenth of the total population, and they are enfor tbe duration of the restrictions, that tirely responsible for the fabulous production of primary products the value of which £1,131,000,000 in 1950-51, or more than 97 per cent, of our total export trade. Those are the latest figures available to me. Half a million people are belting out primary production aggregating, in terms of money, more than £1,000,000,000 per annum. It is that handful of people, spread all over the Commonwealtb, who engage their energies and resources in bringing to production great areas of our arable land, all our pastoral land, and our mining fields, and wbo make possible uot only our favorable trade balances but also our high standard of living. Quite obviously, the long-range solution to the recurring problem of our balance of payments is to be found in a vigorous expansion of our rural population and of our primary industries. That is recognized by the Government, and year in and year out the Government takes appropriate action to give all the assistance it tb«ur energies by industrial laws, usages can give to those industries. But in order to conserve our national reserves a short range solution had to be found, as a matter of extreme urgency of the kind referred to by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. There is no need for me to dwell on the inducements that have been offered to the valiant handful of country people to remain at maximum nroduction within the primary industries. These include the extension for a further period of three years of the special deprein authority says that be can go to his ciation allowance of 20 per cent, for five years, covering expenditure on plant, machinery, fertility and structural improvements, and residential accommodation for employees; tbe selective differen tial in the overdraft interest rate designed to assist the export industries; the exOur favorable trade clusion of oil fuels from tbe proposed increase in petrol tax; tbe increase to 8d. a gallon of the payment from petrol tax to the States for roads, not less than 40 per cent, to be applied for rural roads; and the continuation of all the Commonwealth services designed to assist the primary industries. The short range solution to our immediate difficulties required the imposition of import restrictions, serve our diminishing overseas balances very measure of conservation tends to increase by a like amount the inflaaggregated more than tionary pressure to spend on the already overburdened domestic market. To meet that situation, customs and excise and sales tax have been increased, covering a variety of goods remote from the necessaries of domestic life and living. That was deliberately designed by the Government to ease the situation for the family and the family man. The policy of ful l employment restricted to a few hours a day, a few days a week, ""with nothing to do and lashings of overtime "", which is a phrase that has passed into common usage, has already forced our cost structure to dangerous levels, priced many of our secondary and tertiary industries out of the market, and reduced many of our public utilities to a stat* that can only be described as penurious. It is a stark tragedy that people who ha e been trained to the trades and prov fessions are expressly forbidden to engage and customs that can only serve to destroy the character of a traditionally resourceful and resolute community. These industrial laws, usages and customs do not apply in this place, nor do they -apLly where people can escape from them, but let the master baker be found in his bakehouse before the appropriate starting time in the morning and he is subjected to a criminal prosecution. Let tbe shoe-maker go to his last before some one last, and he is faced witb a prosecution. Let any engineer go to his bench, let any tradesman go to his workshop, and if be works five minutes before time or five minutes after time, he is liable to be prosecuted. These are conditions that do not obtain in this place, they do not apply to the Leader of the Opposition and they do not apply to any of the members of the Opposition. They apply only to the little tradesman and craftsmen who are valiantly trying to improve their own social position. These conditions have been forced upon an unsuspecting generation that can have no knowledge of the dire social and economic consequences of idleness. Honourable members on both sides of the House have made impassioned references to child delinquency. Child delinquency, and indeed, adult delinquency, are caused by idleness, and by nothing else. The sooner we can encourage our young people and our middle-aged people to engage their energies and to devote what intuitive senses they have to gainful employment, the better it will be for us all. In tbe meantime, Mr Deputy Speaker, all our competitors throughout the world are at work. They are working 40, 44, 48, and even 50 hours a week, in Europe, in Africa, in America, and even in Asia.

In this debate, as in all other debates, in both the United States of America and Oreat we have heard, and we shall hear, the lamentations of the Labour party over measures that are designed to strengthen our economy and stabilize our prosperity for the benent of our people. It has been argued, and it will be argued, that we should use the credit resources of the banking system to meet our difliculties and that we should savage private enterprise by direct taxation and make it impossible for private enterprise to function. The Leader of the Opposition referred to some of the profits made by the private enterprise institutions throughout our country. Erom time to time, the trading banks have come under violent criticism from members of the Opposition. I have the balance-sheet of one of our prominent trading banking institutions, and I want to say, Mr to profession and to some extent from Deputy Speaker, that the total earnings of this private trading bank last year, were £861.396. and its total assets amount to £283,523,000.

It is true that concern has been expressed in the United States of America and the United Kingdom and, indeed, in most industrialized countries, that the demand for technologists and technicians has in recent years heen outstripping the supply. The position in Australia can be summed up in the broadest terms by saying that since the end of the war a substantial increase in the output of scientists and engineers has been accompanied by a still greater increase in the demand. The position varies considerably from profession State to State. Many of the skilled trades have a similar situation in that an increased number of apprentices has been insufficient to meet growing demands.",60,Opposition Members Hear Hear

164,Mr Menzies,"On the 22nd February,In Australia, the expansion of secondary industry, increased mechanization with more emphasis on automatic machinery and controls, new and more complex techniques, developments in new metals, electronics and nuclear energy, the increasphysics in 1954 was about tbe same as in ing application of science in rural industries, and the public works programme and expanded defence research and production activities are all factors which have increased the demand for scientists and engineers in recent years. They may also be expected to require more trained people in future years. The overall increase in demand has been, and will probably continue to be, accompanied by changes in the relative demands for the various categories of scientists and engineers. Since the end of the war there has been a larger output of scientists and engiyounger employees to obtain scientific and neers, as compared with pre-war, from Australian training institutions. There has also been an inflow of migrants in some professions, although against this must be set the movement of Australians overseas, in some cases permanently. In total, tihe numbers in some of the main scientific and technical professions have increased substantially. Whilst the precise numbers of persons qualified in the various professions are not known, the estimates that can be made suggest that the number of professionally qualified engineers bas more tban doubled since 1939 in comparison with an increase of 32 per cent, in the Australian population, and it is estimated that the number of qualified chemists has nearly doubled since 1944. The number of university graduations in all faculties increased by about130 per cent, between 1939 and 1953, and this increase occurred in spite of a 7 per cent, decline in the population reaching the age at which most students graduate. Tbe ratio of total university enrolments to total population increased from 20 per 10,000 in 1939 to 33 per 10,000 in 1953. Of total university graduations, the proportion graduating from science courses showed some increase in the immediate post-war years, but has now returned approximately to tbe pre-war proportions. On the other hand, the proportion graduating from engineering courses in 1953 at 13 per cent, was double the pre-war proportion of 6 j per cent. The changing industrial pattern bas been similarly reflected in the numbers of diplomas awarded by Australian technical colleges. Figures supplied by the Commonwealtb Office of Education show that the number of diplomas awarded in chemistry and 1946. But from 1948 to 1954, while the total population in New South Wales and Victoria increased by 15 per cent., the number of diplomas awarded in these States in engineering increased by 45 peT cent. Since the end of the war the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme and the Commonwealth scholarships have made a substantial contribution to the increased number of university and technical college students, and many employers have schemes for assisting their technical qualifications. Almost one-half of the students at Australian universities are in receipt of assistance, mainly from public funds. It seems that further substantial expansion in the output of scientists and engineers may well prove, as in other countries, more difficult to achieve. There is a limit to the numbers of youths available with the ability and willingness necessary to qualify, and the demands of the non-technical professions and commercial and industrial management for able recruits cannot be overlooked. The need to provide more teachers and instructors is another factor that is causing difficulties overseas. The increase in the number of secondary school students because of the increased number of births after 1940 will itself increase the demands on the educational system, although it will mean that more youths will be available for training in the coming years. Thus, the number of young people aged seventeen is expected to increase from 126.000 in 1956 to about 145,000 in 1960, with a further substantial increase in following years. Apart from possibilities of increasing the number of technologists, increasing attention is being given overseas, and to some extent in Australia, to means of making more effective use of qualified scientists and engineers and especially of employing in some types of work a greater proportion of people with lower qualifications and less demanding training. Thp Department of Labour and National ServiV"" is at present engaged in a 3tudy of these matters in collaboration witb the Commonwealth Office of Education and other interested organizations. HlRE-PUBCHASE AGREEMENTS . the honourable member for Swan( Mr Court of the Commonwealth Court of ConciliaCleaver) asked the following question:I ask the Prime Minister whether the Arbitrator relating to certain public servants, restraint exercised by hire-purchase companies, reduced the amount ordered by the Publir prior to the recent announcement of their Service Arbitrator for Third .Division teleintention to reinstitute lower deposits, achieved graphists and postal clerks, in spite of the the target reduction in this form of investment. fact that those classifications had not received Could he inform the House of the general trend the full benent of the Arbitrator's two and a in the number of agreements completed and the half times formula?

Indeed, does the Prime Minisresentatives of a number of these comter know that the rate fixed by the court in panies was held at which a resolution was respect of one classification waa £5 a year passed to restrain the rate of increase in Board itself in December, 1054?

In respect of the volume of business concerned in order to correct these anomalies ? the Acting Commonwealth Statistician has estimated that approximately 262,000 new agreements were written by finance companies in December, 1955, quarter. This was an increase of approximately 8 per cent, over the 243,000 new agreements written by them in the September, 1955, quarter. When considering these figures it should be borne in mind that the December quarter is normally the quarter in which the greatest increase in hire-purchase business takes place. In 1955, the December quarter showed a smaller percentage increase in the outstanding balances than was the case for the September quarter, ancl only a slightly larger percentage increase than in the March and June quarters. the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) asked the following question:the 6th March, Is the Priine Minister aware that the Full tion and Arbitration, in its decision in respect of the determination of the Puhlic Servic-p since then refused to negotiate with the union concerned, despite the fact that the Full Court that it considered that the rates fixed by it-the court-were or could possibly less than thc rate fixed by the Public Service Broadly the know that the Public Service Board is refusing union in August of last year, to the effect if the Overseas Telecommunications Com the Third Division Telegraphists and Postal Clerks Union on the question of rates Service Board has repudiated this undertaking, the Priine Minister, as the Minister that the information that I have given him is correct, to negotiate with the union Tbe honourable member asks two major questions:-(1 ) Is the Prime Minister aware that the Full Court reduced the amount ordered by the Public Service Arbitrator for Third Division telegraphists and postal clerks, in spite of the fact that those classifications had not received the full benefit of the Arbitrator's two and a. half times formula? The honourable member will be aware of the importance which industrial tribunals attach to relativities in .fixing salaries and wages. The Arbitrator fixed £923 as the maximum annual salary for a base grade clerk in the Commonwealtb Public Service.and he fixed £923 as the salary of a telegraphist in relationship to that of a",62,Technological Tbainino
165,Mr Menzies,On,64,Postal Department
166,Mr Menzies,"On the 6th March,base grade clerk. Tbe Full Court fixed £903 as the maximum annual salary for a base grade clerk and, retaining the relativity determined by the Arbitrator, fixed £903 for the telegraphist. I am aware that prior to the court's decision, the Public Service Board itself fixed a maximum salary of £908 for telegraphists, as part of its interpretation of the marginal increases warranted in the Commonwealth Public Service as a result of the metal trades judgment. Whether or not the Arbitrator was correct in awarding £923 for the base grade clerk, or the Full Court was wrong in reducing this figure to £903 are not questions raised by tbe honourable member. He does suggest, however, that the Arbitrator should not have prescribed this particular relationship between the respective salaries of these two groups of officers. I can only say that tbe Arbitrator acted deliberately. The following are his words, quoted from Determination No. 23 of 1955:I have seen fit to make a slight alteration in the maximum salary rate for a Postal Clerk. The Telcoraphist, Fourth Division ancl Postal Clerk will continue to he classified with a similar salary range. The Full Court said. . . We wish to refer to the particular cases of the Postal Clerks and other officers in Tarts VII . , VIII ., IX., X. ancl XII . of the board is prepared to hear representaDetermination No. 23 of 1955 whose salary ranges coincide with the salary ranges prescribed by the Arbitrator for the Third Division but who have an incremental pattern which does nnt conform to the incremental pattern of the Third Division. We have noted that some of these offirers were prior to the determination last-mentioned, awarded salaries in excess of the corresponding ranges in the Third Division, whereas by the Arbitrator's said determination their salary was fixed so as to correspond with the salary ranges of the Third Division. We have not sufficient information before us to decide whether or not these officers are entitled to a higher salary than the corresponding Third Division range anil leave this question to be decided by the Arbitrator if and when application be made to him. I am informed that the Australian Third Division Telegraphists and Postal Clerks Union has lodged an application with thc Arbitrator and has asked for priority in hearing. Its claim is for more than a rectification of relativity and seeks a higher maximum salary than restoration of earlier relativity would produce. The union has asked that its claim be placed at the top of the Arbitrator's list. At the same time tbe union is seeking to negotiate with tbe board on the special basis of a comparison with Overseas Telecommunications Commission telegraphists' salaries. It is obvious that tbe issue must go to tbe Arbitrator and that the Public Service Board cannot negotiate on a matter so much of which is plainly a continuance of the Arbitration processes described. If the Arbitrator's deliberately fixed relativities are to be tested, it is before the Arbitrator that this must be done particularly as other Unions have intimated that they consider there are anomalies to be adjusted and presumably will also be going to the Arbitrator. (2) Is the Prime Minister also aware that the Public Service Board has since then refused to negotiate with the union concerned despite the fact that tbe Full Court made it clear in its judgment that the rates fixed by it were or could possibly be inadequate? The honourable member asks also about the desire of the Postal Clerks and Telegraphists Union to negotiate salary alterations with the Public Service Board because there has been alteration to the salaries of telegraphists in the employ of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. I am informed that tions from the union on this issue although it has advised the union first, that the intra-Service salary pattern so recently created by the decisions of the tribunals cannot be disregarded in considering telegraphists' salaries, and secondly, that a factor which must be taken into account also is that the Overseas Telecommunication telegraphists are now before the Arbitrator in proceedings which have already commenced with a claim in respect to their own salaries rates. My information is that the discussions between the board and the union under this second head are to occur, if the union so wishes it, within a week. MB.

I assume that the honourable member refers to certain draft amendments to tbe Standing Orders which in November, 1954, were submitted by the Standing Orders Committee to the leaders of tbe various parties for their consideration. None of the parties has yet reported its decisions to the Standing Orders Committee. The proposals may, therefore, be regarded as still under consideration by the parties.

I a3k the right honourable gentleman, as head of the Australian Government, to give immediate attention to the stabilization of this important industry. Will he give the fullest support to utilization research through the Commonorder to arrest the drift of our overseas funds, use is made of coal rather than oil As I promised on the 14th March, I have now obtained from my colleague, the Minister for National Development, the answers to the honourable member's question. The production of black coal in New South Wales for the calendar year 1955 was 14,734,000 tons. This was 349,000 tons, or 2.3 per cent, below the level of production for 1954. These ngures, however, include production from open-cut mines. Production from the underground mines excluding open-cut operations at 13,833,000 tons was actually higher by 129,000 tons tban during the 14th March, year 1954. Since the mines commenced working in 1956 after the conclusion of the Christmas holiday break, production of New South Wales coal has fallen short of the amount consumed by ended on the 3rd March. I tbink that tbese figures illustrate that there could be | a tendency to exaggerate the effect of the \ competition which coal is now facing with other fuels. It is true that this competition has resulted in men losing their 1 employment at particular mines. Tbe position has been carefully watched and all possible assistance to find employment elsewhere extended to those who are so affected. There has been an arrangement operating for some time under which vacancies which occur in mines as the result of employees leaving to take posij tions elsewhere and for other reasons are held open and are filled by men who may be displaced from their employment as a result of the changes which are occurring 14th March, in the coal trade.

In Total It will be seen that nearly all the men out of employment are in the Cessnock district. This is due to the closure a few weeks ago of the Bellbird colliery. A series of negotiations have occurred since this mine was closed, and it is now ready to be re-opened. Employment can be found at the mine in the course of four or five weeks for aDproximately 300 men. There were also 203 retrenched from the Stockrington mine on the 9th March, which is a date later than that at which the foregoing figures were prepared. The information available is that 52 of these men bave not yet obtained employment elsewhere. The rest have done so. Tbere is considerable activity in research upon methods by which the use of coal can be increased.

(d) Forage-if required to camp. (e) Motor car-if required to use private cars on official business. The last three mentioned allowances are based upon the principal of reimbursement of actual costs reasonably incurred on official business. 3. Overtime is payable for duty performed in excess of normal hours of work to any officer whose salary does not exceed £2,053 per annum. Payment is at the rate of time and one-half, except that certain Fourth Division officers receive double rate after three hours' overtime on any one day. The amount of overtime in departments varies, but it is not generally extensive except at certain times of the year to meet seasonal work, e.g., in thc Taxation Department and the Post Office. Bonuses are not paid to any officers. 4. Commonwealth employees in Canberra are, in general, not provided with transport for the specific purpose of travelling to and from their place of employment. There are, however, a number of officers whose duty is such that it is more economical for them to' garage the vehicles they use in their employment at their own homes. These officers include district nurses, health inspectors, post office engineers persons associated with essential maintenance, &c. There are other officers who in certain circumstances are provided with transport between their homes and place of employment: these circumstances include, where there is no public transport to be availed of or where the shifts or periods of duty extend beyond the operation of public transport. In all cases such journeys are authorized on the authority of the chief officer of each department. 5. There are three main transport pools operated by Commonwealth departments. The Central Transport Authority, Department of I Supply, operates 794 cars, 405 of which ari attached to other departments.

174,Mr Leslie Asked The Minister Repre,"12. Are such financial statements and balance-sheets distributed to all authors, composers, and assignees on whose behalf the association claims to act, as well as to every member of the association? 13. In view of the fact that the Association carries on its activities by virtue of statutory provisions, are the financial statements and balance-sheets available for public or government inspection? has furnished the following answer:The questions asked by the honourable memthe Commonwealtb Trading Bank in five ber related to the objects, control and operainstances. tion of the Australasian Performing Bight Association. This company, which is incorporated under the law of New South Wales, is in no sense a government body and is not subject in any way to the control of the Attorney-General. HntE-PUECHASE March the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) asked me a question about hire purchase. He requested information about the rate of profit made by hire-purchase companies on the borrowing of money at 5-J per cent, and 6 per cent, and the subsequent use of this money in hire-purchase transactions. He also asked whether it was a legitimate practice of the Commonwealth Trading Bank to facilitate borrowings from tbe public by hire-purchase companies. The effective charge payable by a hire-purchase buyer usually works out to be slightly less than double tbe "" flat"" charge imposed by the hire-purchase company. For instance, a "" f l a t "" charge of 64 per cent, is commonly imposed on the balance owing on a new motor car after payment of the deposit. This is usually equal to an effective charge of about 12 per cent. To take another example, the "" flat"" charge on domestic appliances like radios and washing machines is usually around 9 or 10 per cent. Depending on the arrangements for payment of instalments, the corresponding effective charge works out at between 16 and 184 per cent. The difference between the effective charges and the rate of interest on public borrowings does not, of course, represent clear profit to hire-purchase companies. Costs of administration and the risk factor have to be taken into account, but I bave no information to show what these costs amount to in figure terms. Begarding the second part of the right honourable member's question, I am advised that when a company offers to the public issues of shares, debentures, notes, &c, it is the normal function of that company's bankers to act as "" banker to the issue "". I am further advised .that, of 25 issues of this nature made by hire-purchase finance companies since January, 1955, various private banks acted as ""banker to the issue"" in twenty instances and notice1. Isi t a fact that over the years, particuAustralian citizens of small means, in some the 13th cases at great personal sacrifice, have, from patriotic motives, subscribed to Commonwealth loans ? 2. Will any of these people who have urgent need of this money and are obliged to sell their loan holdings at to-day's market price suffer a considerable financial loss? 3. If so, will he take action to ensure that in cases where the circumstances warrant it , the Commonwealth will purchase its own securities at their face value even though the date of maturity has not been reached? 4. If he is not prepared to adopt this course will he state his reason for not doing so? -to bonorable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. Bondholders who wish to sell their holdings before the maturity date would have to accept a varying capital loss in present market conditions hut they are assured of the full face value of their bonds if they are held to maturity. 3 and 4. Apart from four loans issued ln 1947 and 1948 and one loan in November, 1952, every Commonwealth loan raised since December, 1939, has given investors the option of subscribins to shorter or longer term securities. The interest rate on the longer term securities was considered fair and equitable at the time taking into account the then current market conditions and the obligation assumed by the Commonwealth to redeem the bonds at full face value on maturity and to pay an unvarying rate of interest during the currency of the bonds. The government of the day, acting as the agent for the Australian Loan Council, gave no undertaking to redeem the bonds at par before maturity and would no doubt have Tevised interest rates or other terms and conditions if this concession had been included in the prospectus.

The honourable member's proposal is not regarded as practicable. honourable member for Brisbane( Mr 1. Is it a fact that patients, due to shortage George Lawson) asked me a question concerning the suspension of the Malaya allowance paid to our troops in Malaya when a member is admitted to hospital. This matter has now been examined in detail as a result of which approval has been granted for payment of the Malaya Allowance of 5s. 9d. per day for corporals and below and ranging to Ss. 9d. per day for colonels and above, to continue to be paid to single members and to married unaccompanied members of the Australian Army Force in Malaya when they are admitted to hospital. This decision is retrospective and in cases where members have already forfeited their Malaya allowance on admission to hospital this will be restored. the Army, upon notice1. Are Australian servicemen in Malaya in receipt of zone allowance? 2. If so, is this allowance suspended immepatient must be receiving hospital treatment. diately a serviceman is admitted to hospital for any reason? 3. Are hospital cases denied this allowance, such treatment should not be eligible for Comexperiencing hardship in tliat they are unable to purchase everyday amenities? 4. Will he examine the position with a view to continuing the zone allowance while servicemen are hospitalized? honourable member's questions are as follows:Australian troops in Malaya are entitled to a Malaya allowance which is intended to compensate for the higher cost of living in that country. The rate of allowance for single members or married unaccompanied members varies according to rank from os. 9d. per day for corporals and below to 8s. 9d. per day for colonels and above. When the Australian force first went to Malaya instructions provided that payment of the allowance should cease when single members or married unaccompanied members entered hospital. This matter has recently been examined in detail as a result of which it has been decided that payment of this Malaya allowance will continue during the period of hospitalization. The decision is retrospective and in cases where members have already forfeited their Malaya allowance on admission to hospital this will be restored. Health, upon noticeof accommodation, are compelled to enter unregistered hospitals or rest homes? 2. Is it a fact that, in such circumstances, a patient who is a contributor to a hospital benefits fund would not receive any Commonwealth benent? 3. If so, will he consider an extension of the scheme so that such patients would receive the same benefits as those received by patients entering registered hospitals? to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Commonwealth is not in a position to know whether patients are compelled to enter hospitals or rest homes which are not registered under State law. The provision of adequate hospital accommodation is a matter for the States. 2. Commonwealth hospital benefits are payable where a patient is receiving hospital treatment in a public or private hospital approved under the National Health Act 19531955. Hospitals and rest homes having acceptable nursing and other facilities fnr the provision of hospital treatment may be approved even though not registered under State law. 3. No. It is a basic requirement that to attract Commonwealth hospital benefits the It follows, therefore, that a patient in a hospital or rest home which does not provide monwealth hospital benefits. senting the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice1.
