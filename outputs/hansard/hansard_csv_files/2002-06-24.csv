The following answers to questions were circulated: National Road Safety Strategy: Cycling (Question No. 105) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 13/2/02: (1) Is the Australia Cycling National Strategy examining the (a) benchmarking of bicycle use, (b) benchmarking of accident exposure and (c) benchmarking of bicycling facilities in Australia using international standards; if not, why not. (2) Has the National Strategy met its December 2000 objective to include cycling expertise in peak transport, recreation and other appropriate bodies; if not, why not. (3) Has the National Strategy met its January 2001 objective to make education about cycling available for pre, primary and secondary school aged students, consistent with curriculum frameworks; if not, why not. (4) What work has been done to enable the National Strategy to meet its June 2001 objectives to (a) improve the services and products delivered by the bicycle industry through the development of partnerships; (b) develop a generic policy that can be adapted by all local governments which outlines their role in creating pro-bicycle cultures and physical environments; (c) ensure that appropriate new and renovated public and private developments include end-of-trip facilities for cyclists consistent with national standards; (d) increase multi-nodal trips involving bicycles and public transport; (e) develop and implement a national public communication strategy to improve the awareness of all road users and path users to better share our roads and paths; (f) ensure that safety initiatives such as safety audits and identification of blackspots include consideration of cycling; and (g) develop and implement behavioural programs/initiatives relating to all road users which improve cyclist safety in areas such as motor vehicle speeds and helmets. (1) Responsibility for implementation of Australia Cycling, a National Strategy (the National Strategy) rests primarily with the State, Territory and Local Government authorities, which are best placed to determine local solutions and funding requirements. The Commonwealth provides the Secretariat to the Australian Bicycle Council (ABC), which is a body that was established to coordinate implementation of the National Strategy on behalf of all governments. The ABC commenced a study of cycling data and indicators in September 2001 under Strategy 5.2 of the National Strategy. The study seeks “to identify data requirements and report on comparable State and Territory data about cycling to provide a national perspective” and includes levels of bicycle usage and cyclist safety. Until this study is done, international benchmarking against international standards is not possible. (2) The National Strategy objective to include cycling expertise in peak transport, recreation and other bodies is an ongoing process. The Australian Bicycle Council has made substantial progress towards meeting this objective. (3) The National Strategy has succeeded in making available cycling education programs in most state and territories. However, the incorporation of education about cycling in school curriculums has not occurred in some jurisdictions such as Qld and SA because it is a matter of discretion for the school principals. (4) (a) The ABC membership includes representation from the bicycle industry wholesale and retail associations who provide ongoing engagement with the industry on developments and promotion of cycle products. The ABC also supports the Cycling Promotion Fund. (b) Work has been commenced under the National Strategy on a national data collection of all local government based actions associated with promoting and facilitating increased cycling activities. The ABC will use the information to evaluate the status of local government policy in relation to cycling issues, identify progress, and areas where further work is needed. (c) and (d) Significant progress has been made by state and territory governments to improve facilities for cyclists who use cycling for commuting to work and to increase multi-modal trips involving bicycles.
