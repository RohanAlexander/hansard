224,Understand Some Of Them Are Manufactured The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r.,"Tuesday, 25 November 2003 ----Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee Report Debate resumed from 24 November, on motion by Mr Hawker: That the House take note of the paper. the Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee today. It represents an opportunity to rejuvenate a great Labor initiative of about 30 years ago when the Whitlam government first began giving general purpose financial assistance grants from the Commonwealth to local government. On that occasion it did so according to need, on the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, and it did so directly from the Commonwealth to local government bodies. In that case, to deal with constitutional issues, the Commonwealth had local government set up regional organisations which made applications for grants that were then paid. The system of providing those grants has changed somewhat over the years since then. In 1975 the Fraser coalition government adopted provision of financial assistance to local government as part of its new federalism policy, so it accepted what the previous Whitlam government had begun doing. Under Fraser, local government received a proportion of personal income tax collections, which gradually grew to two per cent of personal income tax collections by 1980-81. The allocation of grants, however, was changed to a combination of a minimum per capita grant and an equalisation. When the Hawke government came to office, that situation was in place, but in 1985-86 the Labor government decided to change the system of allocating assistance to local government. It increased the quantum of assistance to local government by two per cent plus the CPI but ended tax sharing. Instead, local government was given increases in line with Commonwealth financial assistance grants to the states with a real terms guarantee. That real terms guarantee turned out to be important because in the next few years Commonwealth assistance to the states fell, but the real terms guarantee maintained the value to local government of Commonwealth financial assistance grants. The method of allocation for a time remained unchanged, but in 1986 the Labor government announced that it had accepted certain recommendations of the Self report. Those were: to distribute grants between the states on a strictly per capita basis-which is the situation today; local government grants commissions in each state were to distribute the grants on principles determined by that state; all local government bodies would receive a minimum grant-as is the case today; and provision would be made for remote Aboriginal communities to receive grants. In 1991-92, when the Council of Australian Governments was established, one of the initiatives of the Hawke Labor government was to untie identified road grants to local government. They were added to financial assistance grants and distributed between the states at what have become historic shares that were set in 1992.

226,Mr Cox (Kingston) (4.31 P.m.),"It is a pleasure to speak on the tabling of this report ofIn 1995 the Keating government, following another review, adopted a set of national principles for the allocation of grants within states by local government grants commissions. That Labor government changed the basis for setting the pool for state grants to a real per capita guarantee-an initiative of former Treasurer Willis that I was involved in. At that time State government was also given a real per capita guarantee. So that was an improvement on the real terms guarantee. It was significant because it meant that grants kept pace not only with inflation and state grant levels but also with increases in population. Then the Howard government was elected and at least its policies took a divergent track. In 2000 the coalition proposed that the states assume responsibility for providing financial assistance grants to local government. However, that policy was overturned by an agreement between the Prime Minister and Senator Lees, who was Leader of the Australian Democrats. The coalition government severed the link between grants to the states and grants to local government when it hypothecated Commonwealth GST receipts as payments to the states and, apart from a funding cut in 1996, the coalition government has maintained grants to local government in real per capita terms-the terms that were set by former Treasurer Willis in 1995. So to date the only significant change that the Howard government has made to local government funding arrangements has been to allow local government to claim input tax credits for the GST that it pays. Why is local government funding important? One of the major trends in Australian society is geographical inequality; that is, the pattern of advantage and disadvantage is concentrated on a geographic basis. If we want an egalitarian society in Australia today we cannot afford to have life opportunities allocated by postcode. Local government has a major role to play in addressing equality. However, there are significant inequities between the needs of different communities and the resources available to them. Inner cities, fast growing outer metropolitan areas, regional, rural and remote communities all have different needs for physical services, social services and infrastructure. They also have different capacities to raise revenue and those who live within their boundaries have different capacities to pay. The purpose of Commonwealth general purpose financial assistance to local government is to help meet local needs at an affordable cost to local communities. The concept of fiscal equalisation by providing financial assistance grants on a needs basis according to the relative cost to each community of meeting those needs and each community’s capacity to pay is a fundamental principle on which our federation is based. Because federal funding provides an average of about 20 per cent of local government revenues it is not possible to run a full fiscal equalisation model, as is the case with the states, which receive on average about half their revenue from federal grants. However, it is possible to achieve a much fairer and more effective allocation of local government funding. As of today, Labor are advancing a policy on funding local government that has been developed incorporating some of the principles involved in this inquiry. That commitment is that we will adopt a direct funding relationship from the Commonwealth to local government bodies, move towards a needs based national model of allocation and provide a real terms per capita guarantee to the total funding pool. Labor has adopted the major recommendations of this report. It is a very beneficial report for my own state, which has been at a disadvantage when one considers needs based funding because of the allocation of general purpose financial assistance grants on a per capita basis to MAIN COMMITTEE the states. South Australia has some cost disadvantages and also, by comparison with other states, some revenue raising capacity disadvantages and it will therefore get a better share of this pool of funding. South Australia has also suffered great detriment with its historically set share of local road funding. It receives only 5½ per cent of the available pool, which does not compare either with its population, the length of its roads or any other index which might be a determinant of need. The recommendation in the report to put untied local road money on a needs basis would correct for South Australia an enormous disadvantage. There are basically four factors that distort the allocation of funding on a needs basis: the per capita allocation to the states; the minimum grant of 30 per cent of the per capita allocation-and this report recommends that minimum grants be phased out, which will obviously be a matter for significant debate; the inconsistencies between the equalisation models used by each of the states local government grants commissions-and obviously if it is a national initiative it ought to be allocated according to a national formula; and the local road component, which I have already mentioned, which has been allocated to the states according to a historic share that has been frozen since 1991-92. Another issue in this report which I think is very important is the treatment of infrastructure. There was some suggestion from local government bodies that there be a national survey of their infrastructure needs and their maintenance. I thought that that was an inappropriate role for the Commonwealth. It has been my experience that, when you undertake those sorts of studies, the people who are offering the information will tell you how little infrastructure they have and how little maintenance they are able to do on it. If you are another tier of government, they will probably send you the bill for the difference between what they have, what they are doing and what they would like. If we are going to have a responsible role for local government, it is important that local government bodies come to grips with those issues themselves. This report recommends that a national methodology be developed for local government bodies to assess their own infrastructure needs and their own progress in maintaining them, and that that information be one of the inputs to the Commonwealth Grants Commission in administering the needs based funding formula that is proposed here. The committee very wisely said that, if government bodies were not keeping up to the national standard in terms of their efforts on infrastructure, they should not be rewarded by the formula for perhaps diverting money from infrastructure maintenance to other recurrent purposes. I think that is a sound principle. The formula should not reward a lack of effort. The other issue that the formula would be able to deal with for the first time is the capacity of ratepayers in each local government body to pay. (Time expired) Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (4.46 p.m.)-For me, there are two key recommendations in the cost shifting inquiry report which was tabled yesterday. The first and most important is recommendation 16, which prescribes a national model of funding that is consistent across each local government boundary. It proposes that the distribution of funds be done on the principle of equalisation and on the basis of need. It recommends funds to be paid directly to local government, that the funds should be untied and from one pool, that the new model should be phased in over the next three years and that this should be facilitated by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. MAIN COMMITTEE As members will know, this recommendation had the unanimous support of the committee, as did the whole report. The committee proposes keeping the general purpose pool and the identified road component of FAGs-financial assistance grants-untied and that they all be collapsed into the one pool. The second key recommendation is recommendation 6, which proposes an intergovernmental agreement which recognises cost shifting. It allocates the revenue to local government from the relevant level of government, if there has been a devolvement or devolution of responsibilities, to address state restrictions on local government revenue such as rate capping and also proposes local government impact statements for state and Commonwealth legislation which have an impact on local government. I do urge the new minister, Senator Ian Campbell, to look very closely at those two recommendations, and I hope he will adopt them. I note that in his media release yesterday he welcomed the Hawker report and has announced that the Department of Local Government, Territories and Roads has established a local government task force. Its report will form the basis of a submission that the government will consider. That consideration is expected to take about four months. I would not like to see it taking any longer. I would like to see a prompt response to this report because there are a number of issues, especially in my home state of South Australia, which do require addressing urgently. As the previous speaker, the member for Kingston, pointed out, South Australian councils received $80.5 million or 7.7 per cent of the general purpose grant in 2003-04, which was allocated on a per capita basis. But South Australian councils received only $25.5 million or 5.5 per cent of local road grants in 2003-04. This has been the case since 1991. The state has 7.7 per cent of the population and 10.9 per cent of Australia’s local road length. This is an inequitable situation. I saw recommendation 16 as being the best way to address the problems that we have in interstate distribution. It is an inequitable situation where 5½ per cent of local road grants goes to a state with 10.9 per cent of Australia’s local road length. The 1999 Premiers Conference looked at this issue, but there was no uniform view among the states and territories. So the Australian government gave $100 million or over eight per cent of the $1,200 million in the Roads to Recovery program to South Australia in recognition of what must be much closer to the state’s share. It also established the cost-shifting inquiry which reported yesterday. I now turn to some of the history of why we have got to this position. The 5.5 per cent share of FAGs for local roads is the result of an agreement in 1986 between the South Australian government and the Australian government. This allowed the South Australian government to retain one-third of South Australia’s local road grants for the local roads it maintains. In 1991-92 this arrangement was retained when two-thirds of the grants became untied and were paid to councils as FAGs under the Local Government Financial Assistance Act. The remaining one-third went to the South Australian government as a state general purpose grant and was subsequently incorporated into the GST revenue. During the period 1974-75 to 1997-98, the Commonwealth Grants Commission showed that state assistance as a proportion of local government revenue in South Australia fell from 10 per cent to five per cent. In 2000-01 the South Australian government provided only $1 million in grants to councils for spending on local roads. This compares with, for example, $63 million in Queensland and $62 million in Western Australia. Since then it has been cut MAIN COMMITTEE further so that the South Australian government provided only $700,000 in grants to councils for spending on local roads in 2002-03 and 2003-04. Also, from 1977-78 until 1990-91, the South Australian share of local road grants across the range of federal road programs ranged between 7½ to eight per cent. This was always the proportion. In 1991 it fell to 5.5 per cent and has remained there since. As I said before, the South Australian government provides $700,000 to councils for local roads and claims to fund a very modest 319 kilometres of roads, which it classifies as local roads in incorporated areas. The point I would like to make is that the South Australian state government could do much more. In turning to the issues raised in the inquiry, as I said before, I urge the new minister to adopt recommendations 16 and 6. Significantly, I think recommendation 16 will in many ways address the problems of having a lower ratio of funding for road funding and of having the general purpose grant done on a per capita basis. This will have significant advantages for South Australia. Lastly, I turn to the issue of the minimum grant. The major councils within my electorate are Mitcham Council, Marion Council, Holdfast Bay and part of Onkaparinga. For the established councils such as Mitcham and to an extent Marion and Holdfast Bay the abolition of the minimum grant was an important issue. They supported the retention of the minimum grant. In the end, I could see that on balance there were significant advantages for these councils in an equalisation model in that the increase that they should get in road funding and potentially in the general purpose grant would more than outweigh the abolition of the minimum grant. So it is not a full equalisation model but a partial equalisation model that we are proposing. It will have significant advantages. It will allocate funds directly from the Commonwealth to local government on the basis of the council’s need. able to speak on the tabling of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration entitled Rates and taxes: a fair share for responsible local government. I am very pleased to do that from a number of angles. First and foremost, I used to be in local government, albeit for a brief period, but I certainly appreciated the additional burdens, costs and expectations that were levelled at local government. The second interesting point that came to mind from a quick cursory glance at the report is that I thought it was going to be a state-bashing exercise in order to point the finger at the states and carry on the ideological battle that is taking place at the moment between the federal government and the states. I was very pleasantly pleased-I will not say surprised, looking at the calibre of the people on that committee-that the states came in for a little critical observation, and rightly so, as does the Commonwealth. In essence, it was a unanimous bipartisan report. The third very important point about this report is that it highlights one of the most underrated but overused institutions and important agencies in our democracy and our communities: local government. It was interesting to note that there are about 721 of these local government organisations throughout our states and territories. It is a very important level of government and governance. It is as close as any level of government to the people. This report drives one little wedge into an argument about the future nature of our democracy and Constitution in Australia: the importance of regional governance and government in Australia and the question of whether we should change our Constitution and have a central government MAIN COMMITTEE",114,Committees
227,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (4.54 P.m.),"Like other members, I am very pleased to bedealing with regional governments and phase out state government roles. That is an interesting and controversial point of view which has not been raised directly in this booklet. If some of the recommendations are genuinely sought and put into practical effect based on the recommendations in Rates and taxes: a fair share for responsible local government, I think it will advance that argument a little more as our democracy continues to mature and evolve. But I am talking about constitutional change, and we all know what that means. The mechanism required to bring that about would make this too hypothetical at the moment. When I heard that this investigation was taking place, I was very interested in joining the committee. When you look at the role and practices of local government and the issue of cost shifting in particular, you can see it happening at all levels-directly, indirectly and by, some would say, insidious means and by stealth. I have looked at some of the ways cost shifting has occurred in local government. For instance, there is cost shifting through legislative reform. This is happening not just at the state level-if you want to have a go at the states-but also at the Commonwealth level, particularly with the introduction of legislative issues such as the FBT and the GST. Taxes upon taxes are mentioned in the report and they are particularly related to the GST. Also, legislative changes by state governments to the vehicle and traffic act-I am thinking about my own state-have made local government responsible for roadside vending on state roads. Apart from a state going for a bucket of money, there is nothing as quick as a state trying to offload a road onto local government and this has been very successful in my state. I will give a little history. A little stretch of road coming from Braddon’s Lookout, which is just above my beautiful village at Forth on the north-west coast, to the pub at Forth-it does not go very far; it is about 500 metres-still belongs to the state and do you think the local government will take that on? Not on your Nelly. The reason is that there is not a fair shift of responsibility because the ongoing maintenance and costs are not covered. That basically sums up what has been going on between the states and local government. The Forth road from the Forth pub up to Braddon’s Lookout is exactly what has been going on between states and local government. There is cost shifting through the creation of new mandates. Let us face it, governments mandate lots of things, particularly in relation to the environment, housing, roads and transport, town limits, no-go areas, traffic and pedestrian lights, TV black spots-a great program from the Commonwealth, and I am the first to support and promote it. Even that in itself says, ‘We will assist you to put up your translators, your transponders or whatever else you want to call them but, unfortunately, local government, you’re the auspicing body because most local governments are the only ones who can do this.’ They have the ongoing costs and, if you are looking at, say, the outlay of $150,000 for a translator, set aside $40,000 a year for maintenance. That is a mandated example of cost shifting-albeit for the most positive of reasonsbut local government is expected to take that up. That is one of these cost-shifting mechanisms for taking on these extra tasks that come from the expectation of the community. There is cost shifting through national and international agreements. We know many of the national environmental protection measures and environment protection policies have a tremendous impact on local government. These are part and parcel of our international agreements. But who wears it in the end? Local government wears it in the end. Again, there is cost shifting through short-term funding of projects and programs as there is an expectation by the community that certain programs are presented by local government. In the end, that cost is MAIN COMMITTEE shifted over to local government, such as natural resource management, Coastwatch, Waterwatch, river works and weed management, recreation, the arts and culture, youth and community service programs. My favourite, the excellent Commonwealth TV black spots program, is another example. That is okay, but the ongoing funding does not exist. There is cost shifting through the cessation of state and Commonwealth government activities. Examples at the local level include: inspection of certification of persons and businesses such as milk vendors; the increased role in the inspection of licensed premises-you do not need to watch Faulty Towers to see the increased load on local government, particularly in health inspections and standards-an increased demand on immunisation services provided by the state government but administered by the local government; pressure to install surveillance cameras as police presence is wound back; state road maintenance such as landslips; technical advice to the community such as agricultural land capacity and land stability; health care; community programs; transport; housing; and new services. Local governments, as I mentioned earlier-take the TV black spots program-carry out auspicing roles and responsibilities. In the end, they take on the responsibility of maintaining these. We all know about national competition policy and the demands on states. Indeed, the states then pass these on to local government in a variety of areas. The state governments get the benefit of the national competition payments, but you will hear local governments continually asking the state governments to disburse those national competition policy moneys. Many would argue that that in fact does not occur or, if it does, it does not occur at a proportionate level of the expenditure of local government. There is the shifting of non-performing assets to local government. We have examples of that on King Island where the Commonwealth was responsible for a lighthouse but when they tried to find the deeds to the ownership of the lighthouse and maintenance of it, the Commonwealth had not carried out maintenance for years. The Commonwealth threatened to abandon the lighthouse unless the local government effectively took up some moneys to maintain it and paint it. They only got enough to half paint it, and everybody knows the weathering pressures on a lighthouse. That is an example of the offloading of these assets and the state governments are part and parcel of this too. I have mentioned cost shifting through the cessation of state and Commonwealth government activities and on it goes. There are environmental management obligations on local government and proportional funding is not ongoing for those. When all these pressures for cost shifting are added together, you find local government groaning under the burden of expectations of both state and Commonwealth governments-and of course local expectations. One of the great things about living in Australia is that we are able to travel, and when we go to other parts of Australiaadmittedly most mainlanders are now travelling to Tasmania and seeing the excellent lifestyle that we have and putting greater pressure on our services and facilities-we see the provision of services, particularly in urban centres, so of course people have expectations. The members here who represent rural electorates well and truly understand the demand that people rightfully make for good TV reception. I cannot think of another area-except for taxes-that gets people so upset. The pressure is on local governments to make applications for black spot program funding and then of course they have to deal with the ongoing maintenance and so on. That is just an example of the problems they have. MAIN COMMITTEE I was very pleased to find that the committee has recommended that there should be a major summit where the three levels of government could meet to determine-rationally, carefully, cooperatively and responsibly-the particular roles of government and an equitable way of funding these roles and the provision of services. It is the only responsible thing to do; it is the only common sense thing to do. Isn’t it remarkable that every 10 years we have a recommendation that says, ‘Let us have a summit to determine what our roles and functions will be, and let us have a summit to determine what funding mechanisms we should use’? One of the things that clearly comes through in this report, particularly in chapter 7, the way forward in terms of the framework for cooperation on regional development, is that funding should be direct in many instances and that there should be an equalisation mechanism so that communities rightfully expected to carry out particular services have the ability to be funded for those services. We need to equalise, because they have a lesser ability to raise funds in terms of rates, fees and charges, and that should be taken into account. I think it will lead more and more to the development of regional governments and take the burden off state governments in terms of distribution. But one of the sensible recommendations-amongst many-in the report is that local government must be responsible for auditing its services and its infrastructure. If there is funding for particular things the local government must clearly indicate where it is spent. If you look at the Roads to Recovery program of this government, for whatever the motivation, the local governments have seized upon it because it is an absolutely vital area to most of them, particularly rural and remote ones, and the incredible expenditure and demands on them for the maintenance of roads. I think that program is a good one. We could possibly argue that it could be better targeted, but it is the type of program indeed that people are looking for, and the Commonwealth has every right to make sure that those moneys are properly spent. I congratulate the committee on its recommendations. I would like also to congratulate my local councils-there are nine that make up the Mersey-Lyell or Cradle Coast region. They have together funded and founded the Cradle Coast Authority, which I think is a novel authority in terms of coordinating regional development for my area in particular. They are entering into specific partnerships, both with the Commonwealth government and the state government, for the distribution of funds and for them to be an advisory body in developing programs that have been determined by the region as a whole rather than by individual councils. I think that certainly is the way of the future-a way that is recommended in this report, particularly with reference to partnership agreements in recommendation 14. Congratulations to all involved. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (5.10 p.m.)-I am very pleased to be speaking to Rates and taxes: a fair share for responsible local government, the report of an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration. Cost shifting is not a new phenomenon. I am sure that any day now some archaeologist is going to unearth a tomb painting, buried in an ancient pyramid, of long-dead Egyptians, probably circulating around 1000 BC. It will show in exquisite side-face detail the Pharaoh’s laden grain barge getting progressively lighter as it is rowed down the Nile by three levels of sweating galley slaves, all rowing out of tandem. The closer the trireme gets towards the royal granary and the mouths of hungry subjects, the lighter its cargo becomes. MAIN COMMITTEE Three men in a boat may seem comic but there is an old saying: ‘Two’s company; three’s a crowd’. Nowhere is this more evident than in the workings of a system where three separate and autonomous levels of government coexist. In that situation, ‘three’s a crowd’ takes on a new and highly challenging significance for those at the lowest level of the administrative pyramid in Australian government: local government. As the committee inquiry reported, the states are now shifting costs onto local government of between $500 million and $1 billion per year. That is not so much a cost shift as a tectonic shift, which is costing the Australian community around $20 billion a year. As many previous speakers have said, it is hurting local communities, which are having to foot the bill. And it is hurting Australia as a whole as the system groans under the weight of duplication and constant delivery breakdown. The government’s response to this is framed in part of the title of this report: ‘a fair share for responsible local government’. It would be unrealistic to think that any machine welded together out of three quite distinct sets of engines, steering wheels, nuts and bolts, one on top of the other, is ever going to run completely smoothly. It would need constant oiling; but, with most of that oil coming from just one can, that oiling will be far from efficient. The federal government has poured generous amounts of oil into communities, increasing its spending on local roads under FAGs by $80 million over five years to $445 million in 2002–03. In addition, it has made $1.2 billion available to local government for roads over five years to 30 June 2005 under the Roads to Recovery program. Only this morning, at a Queensland local government breakfast, I was again reminded: ‘Roads to Recovery is one of the most successful programs that the federal government has ever implemented, and could you please, please make sure it continues as long as possible.’ The member for Braddon is indicating that he agrees with this. Cost shifting, in its simplest form, is the most predictable tendency for this oil to disappear on the way down, either pooling in the middle or leaking out of hidden cracks and crevices before it reaches the lowest cogs and flywheels that should be spreading it. And that is what happens; it happens vertically and horizontally. Each level of government in this three-tiered machine also engages in cost shifting in one form or another. Interestingly enough, it appears to have become even worse since the changes to local government acts were passed by the various states. The findings of our report make this clear. The figures revealed in this report are deeply disturbing. No efficient system can afford cost shifts from state to local government of $500 million to $1 billion a year. The system cannot afford to have vital services eroded from local communities, as is happening under current cost-shifting practices. Health is a prime example. How many times have we heard of state health authorities moving more and more services away from rural and remote councils and those councils having to pay to bring doctors to their areas. It also occurs in some federal areas of responsibility-for example, airports. When we travelled around the country listening to submissions, we heard that more and more smaller areas are having to maintain airports. I find this an absolutely crazy situation. No local community should have to maintain an airport, which is essentially a federal government responsibility, and that is something that really needs to be looked at. The honourable member for Braddon comes from Tasmania; four councils in Tasmania have taken over ownership of parMAIN COMMITTEE ticular airports, two of them are municipalities, and they have been subjected to increasing costs. I agreed with the previous speaker, the member for Braddon, when he spoke about amalgamations and councils providing more and more services as a group. He spoke of the Cradle coast as a fine example of efficient use of resources, with councils in the area pooling their resources and coming together as one. While I am on my feet I will talk about the Moreton Bay coast and country area of my electorate, where the four councils there have come together to promote economic tourism and other benefits for the region. I believe that really is the way we need to go. As I mentioned earlier, some councils are increasing their spending on health. They are having to house doctors and are finding that they have to provide travel and pay salaries for medical workers, nurses and dentists. They need to do this because, without those resources, their communities simply will not survive. Our study also found other, more worrying techniques of cost shifting. One of the worse is revenue denial. One cannot deny that this occurs with state governments. They fail or decline to raise statutory fees, fines or charges and employ things such as rate capping, as has happened in New South Wales. This is a negative cost shifting. It is a highly efficient revenue inhibitor that basically disadvantages local governments through a kind of sleight-of-hand and really is something that needs to be looked at further. It is happening at a time where the state governments are enjoying a huge GST windfall from that federal oil can that I mentioned earlier. Our committee laboured long and hard to address these and other issues associated with cost shifting. Amongst the most urgent findings and recommendations is the need for a new funding equalisation principle and the need for more transparency, less duplication and much more equitable and individualised measurements of a community’s ability to pay. This was particularly important in country areas of Australia where there is a huge disparity between urban and regional councils and communities. A community in the middle of Melbourne or Sydney cannot be considered the funding equivalent of a very remote community in the far north of Queensland or Western Australia or the Northern Territory. I strongly urge the states to support the inquiry’s central recommendation for a summit on intergovernmental relations to be hosted by COAG in 2005. Other recommendations include the extension of the powers of the Australian National Audit Office to examine the expenditure of federal specific purpose payments to the states, and through them to local government; closer monitoring of the management of specific purpose payments to safeguard against further cost shifting by the states; a tripartite intergovernmental agreement that will extend the federal Treasurer’s powers from the state to include local government; and better local and state government coordination in infrastructure management. Finally, I would say that I support the committee’s fundamental objective, which is to make the machine work better, as I mentioned earlier, at all levels and thereby deliver more and much more efficiently to the people of Australia. I would at this time also congratulate the secretariat and I see there are members of the secretariat sitting here. I thank them for their fine work. I would particularly acknowledge Susan Cardell and Vanessa Crimmins and thank them for all they have done, their dedication and their efficient work in the secretariat. They certainly have helped us to provide a very detailed report that I am sure will not sit on a shelf; it will be used actively and proactively. I know that the local government minister is already MAIN COMMITTEE working on a plan for his department to start implementing some of these recommendations. I commend the report to the House. House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, to speak to the report Rates and taxes: a fair share for responsible local government. It is appropriate that this report be handed down this week, because the Australian Local Government Association is holding its national conference in Canberra. Indeed, the participants are a reminder of how diverse local government is. There are 721 local government areas around Australia; they are very diverse. In this committee’s deliberations, members travelled the length and breadth of Australia to meet with large and small councils and with urban and regional councils, and that diversity came through. I do not think I will ever forget the hearing at Alice Springs, where first we heard a submission from Tennant Creek. This is largely an Indigenous community; people are literally struggling to get fresh water and basic survival services. Immediately after that, on the same day, we heard from Mosman Council in Sydney. They were complaining about the terror of the premium property tax, which kicks in at a land value-before a brick is put on it-of about $1.8 million for each block of land. The representatives from Mosman did not see any irony in them complaining about how tough it was for them immediately following the representatives from Tennant Creek, but all members of the committee certainly saw that was Australia in all its diversity. This was one of the challenges that this committee faced when dealing with local government and its relations to state and federal governments. It certainly cannot be viewed in a homogenous way. One of the points made in many of the submissions to the committee was the need for constitutional recognition of local government. One of the reasons why states and territories have so much power and influence over local government is that local government is not recognised. There was a referendum in the 1980s to give constitutional recognition to local government. My friend and mentor, Tom Uren, when he was Minister for Local Government and Administrative Services in the Hawke government, campaigned strongly for that referendum. Unfortunately the Neanderthals on the other side, particularly Peter Reith, opposed that referendum and ensured that we did not get that progress. Then again, the same people opposed the republic referendum. Watching the World Cup Rugby on Saturday night, I thought how humiliating it would have been to have God Save the Queen sung twice before the game. That is what the people over there would have as progress. I was in the toilet on Saturday night where I heard English supporters sing a very raucous version of a song. The punch lineexpletives removed-was ‘get the stars off our flag’. We need to remember that progress is quite hard. With regard to the different spheres of government and responsibilities, getting solutions is a challenge which this committee have attempted-and which I think we have done our best to find. The reason why recommendation 17 suggests a national summit convened by COAG is in recognition that you are not going to get the sort of broad change that is necessary simply through the committee process. We looked at the way in which local government functions have increased. They are due to a number of factors: devolution-one area of government has given local government responsibility for new functions; raising the bar-essentially the standard at which local government services must be offered has increased and that, therefore, has led to increased costs; cost MAIN COMMITTEE",118,Committees
228,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (5.19 P.m.),"I am very pleased to rise, as a member of theshifting, which can occur in two ways, including where one area of government stops providing a service and local government steps in to provide it; increased community expectationthe demand in the community for increased services; and policy choice-local government does make choices to go into particular areas and expand the areas in which it provides support. Areas of cost shifting occur when there is a withdrawal or a reduction of financial support once a program has been established. Numerous examples were given of where there might have been a joint state-local government activity or a Commonwealth-local government activity; that activity became vital to a local community, and then the other sphere of government-or perhaps the private sector-withdrew support, thus leaving the local government area picking up the full costs. Assets can be transferred without appropriate funding support; airports were given as one example of that. There is also often a requirement to provide concessions and rebates, without compensation payments. For example, many institutions such as churches are exempt from rates and that reduces the tax base of the local government area. Increased bureaucratic requirements can also lead to increased costs for local government, as can a failure to provide for indexation of fees and charges for services prescribed under state legislation or regulation. It is also the case-and I think this came out particularly at the Perth hearing-that we need to acknowledge that it is not all the fault of the Commonwealth and the states. In some cases the very nature of local government being very close to community opinion can mean that there is political pressure upon local government to provide services that really they have no business providing. An example of that, which we heard about at the Perth hearing, is the provision of police and community security. We had a number of submissions about it, and we hear all the time that Australia is a far more dangerous place than it has ever been before, whereas all the facts tell us that that is simply not the case-that in fact crime by and large is not increasing in our community but has decreased. But candidates running for local government find it politically opportunistic to campaign on these programs and, because it is difficult for them to say no, we actually have examples of local government providing services which, in my view, are not their business. That is another example, in my view, of the need for council amalgamations in New South Wales. Many of the local government areas are simply too small, including those in my area in the inner west of Sydney. The Mayor of Ashfield has been quite courageous in stating the obvious about Ashfield, Burwood and Strathfield councils covering such a small geographical area. I have four local government areas in my electorate which covers 27 square kilometres. I believe we need to build capacity by having councils that are of an appropriate size. But council amalgamations by and large have been resisted. We had the example of the formation of Canada Bay Council from Concord and Drummoyne. The people resisted it and ran on antiamalgamation platforms. But, once it was formed, they all wanted to be mayor, of course; they all wanted to run for the positions. Opportunistic statements have come from right across the political spectrum. There have been meetings opposing council amalgamations in New South Wales. It is very easy to appeal to the lowest common denominator: fear of a loss of local identity. For example, in King Street, Newtown, one side of the road is in South Sydney and therefore does not MAIN COMMITTEE have bins and the other side of the road is in Marrickville. But the Greens oppose amalgamation and oppose fixing up King Street and putting it in the one council boundary locally. cal councillors. They do that for opportunistic purposes and that is just one example. The report also goes into the declining state of infrastructure in the nation. That chapter is very important. It talks about infrastructure not just in terms of roads but also in terms of our social capital-our community based organisations. There are recommendations in there and statements-4.75 and 4.76-where the committee has unanimously declared that it considers that judicious use of borrowing may assist local government to meet some of its financial needs if such borrowing is accompanied by increased revenues to enable the debt to be serviced. That is a sensible statement. I conclude by drawing attention to and coming back to the last recommendation, which is recommendation 17. It recommends COAG host a summit in 2005 on intergovernmental relations. It is very sensible that the three tiers of government should actually sit down and talk about who does what. The ideal in Australia would be a two-tier system of government. That would make sense: a regional form of government. But the truth is that it is highly unlikely that that will occur in my lifetime. Given that is the case, let us have a rational debate about what the role of each level of government is. Local government plays a particularly important role. It is closest to the people. It is able to respond directly to people’s needs. It allows for democratic participation, which enriches the democratic life of the nation. I believe that the federal parliament and we on this committee have taken local government’s role very seriously. To that end, I want to congratulate in particular the chair of the committee, the member for Wannon, David Hawker. He does an outstanding job as chair of the committee, along with the member for Chisholm, Anna Burke, who is the deputy chair. We hear a lot about disagreements in parliament. It took us three or four days to finalise this report but it is a unanimous report. It is a consensus report. It is parliament working at its best. There is not enough recognition out there, in what is a fairly cynical community, of the good work that parliamentary committees such as this committee, which I have been on since 1996, can do. I sincerely hope David Hawker remains the chair of that committee. Well, I hope he gets to be the deputy chair at some stage because I hope we swap sides. But David does a very good job, as does Anna. They in particular, if you look at the attendances, really bore the weight of the work on that committee and that should be acknowledged. I want to also acknowledge the work of the committee secretariat, and in particular the work of Susan Cardell and Vanessa Crimmins. They did a lot of outstanding work. There was a lot of travel to regional Australia during the conduct of this inquiry. I believe that this report is a positive contribution, one which has already been well received by the local government community. I sincerely hope that the recommendations lead to action, because otherwise that work will have been wasted. I commend the report to the House.

231,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro) (5.34 p.m.)-I rise today to also support the report by thewhere the member for Grayndler almost finished, by talking about the good work that is done in the parliament and in the committees. It is one of the constant frustrations, I guess, of members of parliament that out there in voter land they think that parliament equals question time, which occurs for an hour or so each day. Meanwhile, some great work is being done at a committee level. When you look at some of the good policy that is around-and it does not matter which government you talk about-coming from either side of politics, a lot of it starts in the committee process. It starts through an inquiry. An inquiry takes place and more often than not all sides of politics-I should use ‘all’ rather than ‘both’ with the member for Cunningham sitting opposite-get together and nut out something, compromising a little bit here or there to come up with a final result. There is no better example of that than this particular inquiry and the way this committee worked. I was very pleased to be part of the committee and the inquiry. I got to most of the hearings and visits. I missed a couple but I was, along with the member for Cunningham, chasing bushfires during part of that period as well. It was a difficult time and I did miss a very small number of those hearings. But I really worked hard to get to as many of them as I could because it was such an important inquiry. Each member of parliament, with numerous local government jurisdictions in their electorates, clearly had an interest. I have eight local government areas within my federal electorate. Many of those participated in the inquiry and provided submissions. Eurobodalla Shire, Bega Valley Shire and Cooma-Monaro Shire all put in submissions to the inquiry. In addition, Eurabodalla, Bega Valley, Bombala and Yarralumla participated in one of the hearings that was held down in Moruya. Certainly I found the evidence of those various councils extremely useful in the overall context because there are huge differences-and I think this is one of the things that has come out of this report-in local government between the states. That is why this report, over and above the recommendations in it, will be extremely useful as a reference guide. It has accessed information from all around Australia. Each state has a local government act. That is how local government exists; there is no local government act at the federal level in that sense. The creation of local government is done at a state level. But they all then apply it differently. Their acts are different and the way in which local government is treated is very different. That in itself was a challenge for the committee because various things that were working well in one state did not even exist in another state, so to speak. We had to find a way in which to come up with recommendations that can be applicable right across the nation. This is particularly a role for the federal government-to take a leadership role in this. Our recommendations allow that now to occur. In the recommendations there is that element of leadership from the federal government, so we can get state and local government together and nut out some agreements so that we know who should be doing what and who is paying for what. Some of the big differences I noticed between states were some of the funding aspects. In particular, local government in New South Wales is restricted quite substantially because of rate capping, which does not exist in other states. Philosophically, I have a problem with that because if you have a democracy where people stand for election and they stand for election on a particular platform then they should be able to be tested against that. If a local council and local councillors propose to increase rates by a certain amount and to put charges in at a MAIN COMMITTEE certain level in order to provide certain services then that should be able to be tested democratically. That effectively is not happening in New South Wales because councils are forced to do all sorts of interesting accounting exercises because of this rate capping that the state government puts on them. They can theoretically go to the state government and ask for an allowance for one year to go over the rate pegging for specific things. But history shows that that is a very difficult exercise and becomes a very political exercise in the process as well. It works against those councils substantially. One of the councils in my electorate-Bombala Council-made a comment in talking about rate pegging. They said: Without a mechanism for recouping the forgone revenue over the longer term a degree of flexibility has been removed. This has a larger impact in the rural areas as rate increases cannot be put through cycles matching the good and poor agricultural seasons. I guess that is a good indication of the difficulties of rate pegging. The real root of the problem is that a lot of councils, for various reasons, had kept rates down at a certain level and when rate pegging was put in it was then applied to probably too low a level. The difference between that council and other councils has therefore become greater and greater as things have gone on. When you compare the rate pegging with, for instance, the fire levy-something that was of great interest to me in the other committee-and the increase that occurred there, things get out of whack. In New South Wales, for example, the average annual increase in the fire brigade levy between 1993-94 and 2002-03 was 6.9 per cent per annum, whereas rate capping was limited to 2.6 per cent. So councils were being hit with those additional fire levies but effectively the rates that they were able to put up could only go up by a much smaller amount. As an illustration, Eurobodalla Shire Council have commented that the council is paying $100,000 more in levies to the fire brigade and rural fire service while its rate revenues have increased by only $30,000 due to the rate cap. So they are the hard, cold facts. They have only been able to put up $30,000 of the $100,000 that they have been hit with for fire levies. That is one particular aspect where recommendations have been made that ought to be looked at, but it requires some political will at the New South Wales government level to make those changes. If they are so keen on democracy, then they should let the councils go out there and argue their case to their constituents. There is an election in March next year for local government, so let the state government have democracy operating properly. One of the other examples that I will pick up on from one of my councils concerns infrastructure. One of the problems that councils are having is that they will be offered funding that they have to match to set up certain things-to put in place particular infrastructure or a particular service. But, more often than not, that funding-and it happens to come from both federal and state governments but primarily from state governments-to set things up then disappears after a period of time and the council is left holding the project and having to fund the full cost. It all looks wonderful in the first place. Governments say, ‘We’re giving this council so much money to do this,’ but the council then gets into strife a couple of years later. Consequently, some councils are saying, ‘We’re going to have to knock back money,’ which sounds ridiculous. That was one of the things that the Bega Valley Shire Council said. In talking about this issue with respect to infrastructure grants, they said: MAIN COMMITTEE We basically said as a council, ‘It is fine to get the funding for some new infrastructure-a new toilet block or a new boardwalk or whatever-being matched fifty-fifty, but do we really need that or are we better using that $100,000 or $200,000, or whatever the matching figure is, to do something that the community really needs, like fixing the roads or upgrading some old timber bridges?’ We made a conscious decision to reduce the matching grant funding and use it for only stuff we really need rather than stuff that looks nice and maybe has a nice community feel. So that is an example of how councils are being put into that particular circumstance-a difficult circumstance-where it is tempting to say, ‘It would be nice to have that nice new thing,’ but at the end of the day it could mean that they cannot put money into much needed maintenance as well. As a consequence of that, they make difficult decisions. We have tried as a committee to put forward some recommendations to overcome those difficulties, to look at some of the funding formulas. I think there is scope for some specific programs and formulas that can be applied to funding between the federal government and local government-for Roads to Recovery, for instance. Everywhere we went, people said what a great program it was, not only because it was additional money to fix local roadsand, yes, that is right-but overwhelmingly, no matter where we were in Australia, because the actual model worked brilliantly. It was easy to comply with the bureaucracy in administering that program. SoI think there is great scope for that. We have not been prescriptive about that in this report, in saying it should be done with particular programs; we have just said that it is an excellent program. There will be many opportunities, I would think, in the future where that could be applied equally as well so that it can work directly. It was a way of getting taxpayers’ funds right there on the ground, where they were needed, with virtually no loss even in administration, particularly with the money not going through the state government but going directly to local government. It is a great formula, and we have had scope there for that as well. I was pleased to be part of the committee and that report. It is an excellent result. We worked well as a committee, as we always seem to in that committee in the various things we have done, which is terrific. It is very pleasing to be part of this sort of process. As the member for Grayndler said, and I will support him strongly, there was great leadership shown by the member for Wannon and by the deputy chair, the member for Chisholm. We had superb backup from the secretariat, particularly from Susan Cardell and Vanessa Crimmins. Vanessa, having come from the department and knowing a fair bit about local government issues, was of great benefit to the committee as a whole. The whole team worked really well together. I very strongly recommend not only to the House but also to all people who have an interest in local government the report as a resource document and particularly the recommendations, which we would like to see implemented as soon as possible. We always try to do that. I am sure the report will be looked at very closely by government. ber of the committee, I welcome the opportunity to speak to Rates and taxes: a fair share for responsible local government, the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration. This is an important document which the Greens welcome, and its 18 recommendations demand a speedy, considered response from the government. This report is a watershed in the way we look at the level of government which MAIN COMMITTEE",126,Committees
232,Mr Organ (Cunningham) (5.47 P.m.),"As a member of the House who was not a memis closest to all of us-local government-for it has had its roles and functions greatly expanded over the years and is now in a situation where there is no doubt it is doing it tough. As the President of the Australian Local Government Association, Councillor Mike Montgomery, said just yesterday, this report is a solid start to resolving the financial crisis facing local government-and, as we have heard from previous speakers, that financial crisis, at its heart, is the result of cost shifting. In his capacity as chair of the committee, the member for Wannon told the House yesterday that all levels of government have engaged in cost shifting in some form or another and that state governments are responsible for cost shifts of between $500 million and $1 billion a year. In my own state of New South Wales, state funding of local government fell from 14.8 per cent in 1975 to 7.1 per cent in 1998, down a massive 7.7 per cent, whilst over the same period user-pays fees charged by councils almost doubled, from 13.4 per cent to 24.7 per cent of total revenue. It is clear, therefore, that state governments are increasingly pulling back from their responsibilities in the local government sector and, in return, that local governments are being forced to get a greater percentage of their revenue from ratepayers and residents. A disturbing picture is revealed through this report of the effects of the changing funding regimes for local governments, with infrastructure deteriorating and services diminishing. Announcements of ‘quality improvements’ and ‘efficiency savings’ by local government are now recognised in the community as just another way of presenting budget cuts, job losses and service retraction. Long-held agreements and arrangements are falling by the wayside. For example, in 1939 New South Wales local councillors entered into an agreement to provide library services that were to be funded 50 per cent by councils and 50 per cent by the state government. As a former archivist and research librarian, I am very much aware of the important role libraries play in our society, especially the local library, which is used by a wide cross-section of the community, from primary school students through to businesspeople and the elderly. Yet today councils meet 93 per cent of library services costs, costs which are spiralling due to the new electronic information environment and Internet based research. It is no longer just a matter of councils budgeting for staff and books; money must be found for computers, online databases, infrastructure upgrades and training in these new technologies. Our very support for the concept of a knowledge nation is under threat if council libraries should disappear. As the Rates and taxes report reveals, a decade of aggressive cost-shifting has resulted not only in a reduction of funds provided to local government but also in steep increases in fees charged to local councils for services provided by state government entities. One example is EnergyAustralia, one of the New South Wales state government’s most profitable utilities. EnergyAustralia now charges councils for the assessment of customer complaints about public lighting and for the preparation of designs and quotations for improvement to public lighting infrastructure. EnergyAustralia’s infrastructure has been allowed to deteriorate over many years, and now councils are expected to foot the bill for design upgrades. The same applies to transport. Private enterprise in Wollongong may provide the buses, but councils are now expected to provide the bus shelters, signage and furniture for bus stops, road pavement and concrete embankments. They even have to clean up the oil and diesel spill from defective buses. I could go on. MAIN COMMITTEE At the same time as increasing charges to local government, the state government has stymied the ability of councils to generate revenue by pegging rates-the main source of revenue for local government. This might be an electorally popular move on the part of the state government, but it cripples local councils-and we have heard similar comments from previous speakers. Nothing highlights the hypocrisy of the state governments and their Jekyll and Hyde relationship with local government more than rate-pegging increases that fail to keep up with increases in state government charges. In 2002-03, for example, the New South Wales state government permitted a maximum rate increase of 3.3 per cent. Yet, as the report shows, in the same year it obliged councils to increase payments to the New South Wales Fire Brigade by 13.3 per cent. In some years, rate-pegging limits have not even met the consumer price index increases, and they have consistently fallen short due to increased costs being foisted upon local government. The result has been an ever increasing gap between the services councils are expected to provide to their residents and the revenue options open to councils to provide those services. Those who suffer are not the state or federal governments but the members of local communities, who watch as libraries are closed, aged care services are withdrawn and parks and public spaces deteriorate or are sold off as councils frantically endeavour to find the funds to provide the basic services. Such a situation has happened in the Illawarra. It is unsustainable and has led to financial crises among many local councils and a deterioration in the quality of life for local residents. The old mantra of sticking to the basics such as curbing and guttering is being heard more frequently as the community looks around at deteriorating infrastructure and new priorities in council services. The decades of state government shifting responsibility for services to local government, while increasing the fees and charges imposed on councils and depriving them of an adequate revenue base, must stop. Hopefully, many of the recommendations in this report will be adopted by the federal government with this specific end in mind. But it is not just the state governments which are involved in cost shifting. The federal government needs to improve its act as well. It needs to better manage its allocation of funds to local government-and I welcome the recommendations in the report which aim to address this specific issue. The peak local government body which covers my own electorate of Cunningham, the Illawarra Region of Councils-IROC-made a number of pertinent points in their submission to the inquiry. They noted that the Illawarra Region of Councils currently delivers three Commonwealth regional programs and a further three state programs, employing a total of 14 staff. It might not sound like much, but it is significant. Numerous additional projects and brokerage funds are managed by these programs or by IROC core staff for the Commonwealth and the state. Of greater significance is the key role of many IROC staff in the region’s strategic priorities. The services provided include community programs, environmental planning and management, cultural planning and management, and integrated regional, urban and transport planning. Interestingly, the delivery of all of these programs has also been increasingly constrained by cost shifting on the part of the federal government and by a degree of political favouritism in the allocation of grants. IROC pointed, for example, to the failure of funded programs to include annual performance based, or even award based, salary increases for staff in contracted budget allocations and to the lack of recognition of the costs involved in retaining, or more often losing, trained MAIN COMMITTEE staff, vehicle and infrastructure leases and accommodation rentals, for programs constantly under review or subject to last-minute contract renewals. This lack of certainty can be very expensive and must aggregate at the national level. IROC also highlighted a lack of allowances in grant funding for redundancy payments payable to ‘contract’ staff when a long-term program is terminated. Those are just some of the very real concerns facing the people at the coalface, where federal moneys hit the ground via local government. Small wonder then that councils are crying poor, for they are poor. And that is having a major knock-on effect via the drive to amalgamation in the name of so-called greater efficiency. This is very evident in my state of New South Wales and it is not a road I would choose to go down. Indeed, there have been quite determined moves in my electorate of Cunningham to de-amalgamate-in other words, to make councils smaller so they better serve the needs of local communities while still sharing major infrastructure and service provision areas. This is evident from a serious resident push for a return to the pre-1948 days of Bulli Shire Council, and the formation of a new local government body to look after the interests of residents in the northern Illawarra, taking control away from the large, centralised, and ‘citycentric’ Wollongong City Council. There is a widely held view that bigger is not necessarily better, and that small can be beautiful with regard to local governments. This is a view partly reflected in the committee’s report by the recognition of the need to get rid of duplication and to make better use of limited federal funds. Honourable members would do well to read Michael McGirr’s impassioned article in today’s Sydney Morning Herald about his local government body, the shire of Gunning on the Southern Tablelands. Gunning Shire Council is under threat of merger with seven other councils to form two super councils, one based in Queanbeyan and the other in Goulburn. McGirr says: Under the proposal, part of Gunning Shire will go to one and part to the other. Gunning Shire will no longer exist. This new plan would put the centre of our local council about as far from Gunning as Campbelltown is from Point Piper. And that is a long way! But it is not all doom and gloom in local government, as the same people who identify various problems have also provided some of the solutions that have been taken up in the report before us. For example, the Illawarra Region of Councils said in closing their submission to the committee: IROC is a successful model of regional co-operation, partly because it was resourced and supported in its infancy by Commonwealth processes, and partly because it has successful and committed members who undertake a diverse portfolio of local government activity. It achieves efficiencies for its members and delivers results for State and Commonwealth governments. I am sure that many councils throughout Australia would similarly view the importance of their role, for the services that councils provide are many and varied. As we know, local government provides both core and in-kind support supplemented by fee-for-service chargeslibraries, roads, rubbish collection, swimming pools, lifesavers, public toilets, development control et cetera. MAIN COMMITTEE IROC pointed out that they would benefit from national coordination of regional initiatives, increased recognition, and easier access to Commonwealth processes and funding. They are obviously seeking a closer relationship with the federal government, and the Commonwealth would benefit from more frequent use of the diverse and accountable frameworks that only local government can offer, both locally and regionally. I am therefore pleased to see that the Rates and taxes report makes a number of recommendations which address these specific issues, and I look forward to its recommendations receiving the government’s early attention. In closing, I would like to note that this report is especially timely, as the National General Assembly of Local Government is meeting in Canberra as we speak. Yesterday I met with councillors Carolyn Griffiths and Trevor Mott from Wollongong City Council, and I was informed that there was a lot of concern over the future of federal funding for the Roads to Recovery program, which has proven to be so successful. A headline in today’s Sydney Daily Telegraph proclaims that ‘Councils face losing control of their destiny’, with moves by the New South Wales Labor government to have more control over council boundaries and governance. In this somewhat volatile environment, I hope that the many worthy recommendations in the Rates and taxes report-which I believe has the best interests of local government and ordinary Australians at heart-see their way through to implementation, and that politics does not become the overriding instrument in setting the agenda within the local government sector. Local government has enough problems in protecting local environments and maintaining the quality of life of ratepayers and residents. Local government above all needs financial security and stability, and I hope that the federal government is truly committed to this goal. The Rates and taxes report sets out a possible way forward, and I look forward to discussing its recommendations with my constituents over the coming weeks. I congratulate the committee on its preparation of the report. which has just concluded, has resulted in one of the most important reports that has been submitted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, at least since I joined that committee. As a former Mayor of Woollahra in the electorate of Wentworth, which I now have the honour to represent, and as a councillor and chair of several council committees, having been involved in several local ratepayer and other action committees and groups and having advocated a bigger role for the Liberal Party in local government affairs in New South Wales, I am a great believer in local government and its role in the three levels of government in this country. This report is indeed very significant, and I consider it an honour to have participated in this inquiry. The committee was very ably led by its chair, David Hawker, the member for Wannon. We went right around Australia. I remember visiting, in particular, Barraba, which is said to have the lowest per capita income of any part of Australia in the most recent census and which is near where I was born, Bingara, which is only some 50 kilometres away. So it was of great interest to me to hear the views of those involved in local government in that part of Australia as well as in the remote areas and in the big cities and to read the various submissions and hear the evidence. It seems to me that there are three critical outcomes of this report that need to be addressed. Firstly, the time has come for a complete revamp and review of the relationships that the MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Committees
233,Mr King (Wentworth) (6.00 P.m.),"The inquiry into local government and cost shifting,Commonwealth and the states have with local government. One of the reasons for that is that since 1996, when the Howard government was first elected, a fundamental dysfunction in respect of Commonwealth-state relations has been resolved-namely, vertical fiscal imbalance, which had plagued Commonwealth-state relations at least since the Second World War. That has been resolved by the A New Tax System, through levying the goods and services tax and referring those revenues to state governments. So it can never be said fairly by any state administration that they do not have the wherewithal to address their basic responsibilities and that, ultimately, it is a decision for the Commonwealth. That vertical fiscal imbalance having been addressed, it seems to me that, in the same way, the imbalance between what has been happening to local government and the Commonwealth needs to be addressed. That is why this report is very timely and why its substance is of great importance for the future administration of the Commonwealth as a whole and, most particularly, for ensuring that amenity in local areas and the quality of the lives of people who reside in those areas is improved and addressed, that no part of the country is left behind and that an equitable financial relationship is established between the third tier of government and the state and federal governments. The first recommendation sets out to address that by proposing that there be set in place a federal-state intergovernmental agreement clarifying and specifying the roles, limits and boundaries of the three levels of government. That is important, as is the third recommendation, which proposes that this House recognise local government as an integral level of government of Australia. I have to say to some extent that looks a bit like tokenism, and the fact that two previous referenda on this topic have failed suggests that the real question to be faced by legislators with respect to local government is not one of recognition-even though those involved in local government think it is-but rather one of addressing the core issue which is at the heart of this report: the proper financing and proper responsibilities of local government. It is the cost-shifting issue that is the key to the resolution, it seems to me, of both the problem of recognition, which recommendation 3 is all about, and the structural flaw, which is at the heart of this report. Recommendation 8 calls for the Minister for Finance and Administration to issue a direction to all federal agencies to ensure that negotiated and future federal-state specific purpose payments describe clear federal government objectives and measured outcomes. There are also other proposals specifically in relation to the FAGs arrangements and a proposal that a body along the lines of the UK IDeA to address capacity building be established. It seems to me that if those measures are adopted, as they ought to be as a result of the intergovernmental agreement referred to in the first recommendation and the subsequent agreements that would follow from that, then the sorts of outcomes that we are all looking for-and which were at the heart of the proposal brought forward by the minister-will be addressed. As I put in a motion to the House this week there is a basic problem of infrastructure reform in this country at the moment. It is not just a question of addressing the problem of the rural areas specifically in relation to water and the myriad issues that concern that great national problem-not only in the country but also in the city. In our cities, where most Australians live, there is also a real problem with respect to infrastructure reform, stretching from basic issues such as roads, public transport systems and alternative transport systems to infraMAIN COMMITTEE structure issues such as the ageing of infrastructure-sewerage, drainage and so on-that need to be addressed now. That is the second reason why this report is particularly timely. I am pleased that the report seeks to address that basic infrastructure question in the way that it does in recommendation 9. It seems to me that the idea of tied specific grants directly from the Commonwealth to local government or, alternatively, general purpose grants which come with a covenant to the states so that infrastructure questions of the type that I have referred to are addressed in the longer term is the way forward. I know that there are some people who argue that untied money is what is required by local government and that people on the ground can make these decisions. But the evidence that came before us suggested that that leads to inequities. That means that the basic infrastructure questions, which the Commonwealth through its leadership is best able to address in terms of national issues, would not otherwise be addressed. The measures for capacity building and the measures for funding of local government that are set out in the other recommendations are the way forward, it would seem to me. The COAG summit in 2005 on intergovernmental relations, if pursued as a result of the intergovernmental agreement that is referred to in recommendation 1, will establish a comprehensive program that is meaningful and effective. At the end of the day, this report is about addressing inequities-the fact that over the last 20 or 30 years local government has been required to do much more than ever before. Some shires and councils are even delivering security services now. Some are delivering fire services, and others are not. Some of them are being asked to deliver family benefits and family services. So the scope of the work of local government has increased dramatically. If that is to continue and if local government is not to crumble under the weight of these added responsibilities, proper financing and a dedicated role model are needed; otherwise, we are putting off, as it were, the evil day. This is a very important report. I commend the staff who prepared it. I thank those who made contributions by way of a submission and I particularly thank those who turned up to give evidence. Finally, I thank our chair, the member for Wannon, who did a sterling job, along with the deputy chair, the member for Chisholm, who also worked very hard on this inquiry to get such an important outcome. I also want to commend the opposition for taking a couple of deep breaths and addressing some of the issues. The spirit of the outcome is going to be supported by both sides of politics, because that is how important this issue is. It illustrates that there is a general understanding at all levels of politics in this country that the issue of cost shifting is real and that governments at all levels must address it. I think that state governments in particular are at fault and have been for about the last 20 to 25 years, but the Commonwealth government also has had some involvement in the problem. In conclusion, I hope that this report is acted upon by government and I look forward to supporting the outcomes through this parliament and through the work of the government. Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (6.12 p.m.)-I rise today to also welcome the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration report into cost shifting onto local government and to further the remarks I made in the House. At the outset I want to read into Hansard what is I think a rather remarkable thing that the chair of the committee, David Hawker, the member for Wannon, and I have just witnessed at the 2003 National General Assembly of Local Government. It is the 10th anniversary of the assembly. The chair of the committee MAIN COMMITTEE made a very fine presentation about our report at that hearing and then answered some very difficult questions, I thought, exceptionally well. They were fairly tough questions, but I think he did the committee proud. At the end of that presentation the assembly moved an urgency motion, which I would now like to read into Hansard: That the 2003 National General Assembly of Local Government: Congratulates the Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Members of the House of Representatives Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee on the bipartisan support in the Federal Parliament and the conduct of their Inquiry into Cost Shifting onto Local Government; 2. Applauds the Committee’s finding that cost-shifting is imposing a serious financial burden on Local Government; 3. Supports the recommendations that call for: a. formal recognition of local government by resolution of the House of Representatives; b. a COAG summit on intergovernmental relations in 2005, and c. an intergovernmental agreement between the three spheres of government on the roles and responsibilities of Local Government and funding sources to meet those responsibilities; 4. Notes that some recommendations are complex and will require further analysis, but that Local Government is committed to working collaboratively with the Australian, State and Territory Governments to fix cost shifting and the inadequate funding of councils in a timely manner. That motion has just been moved at the National General Assembly of Local Government. I do not think that in my five years in this parliament, which is short compared to some, I have seen a report welcomed and endorsed so unanimously, particularly by the body that is the recipient of the report and on which the findings will have the most impact. That was very heartening for all members of the committee, and I did want to record that in Hansard. The other remarkable thing about this report is that-while yes, it is bipartisan-it has been welcomed by the minister and the shadow minister and both sides of the parliament have endorsed it and stated that they are committed to working towards the resolutions in it. I want emphasise that, because I have never been involved in something that has raised expectations as greatly as this report has. Again, having been at the local government’s national assembly, I think it would be traumatic, to say the least, if the government were to walk away from this report without a response-and it could be either side of the parliament in government post the election; of course, I am hoping it will be us. There has been far too much work put into this report. There have been far too many expectations and far too much hope pinned on it for something not to happen. I want to emphasise that we do not want to see this report-like a lot of others which I have been involved with-sit on a shelf and not responded to. That would just be too tragic. I think it would destroy the faith that local governments have placed in the federal government to deliver on some of the issues that they raised with us. At the outset I will say a very big thank you to the members of the secretariat, who are really the driving force behind all committees. Anybody in this place who works on committees knows that that is the case. I want to thank Susan Cardell and Vanessa Crimmins for the amazing amount of work they put into the report. I also want to place on the record my thanks to Ryan Crowley, Katie Hobson and particularly Richard Webb from the Library who did much of the research and historical background that went into this report. This is a phenomenally thick report; there were over 400 submissions and there was a lot of detail to go into. If MAIN COMMITTEE anybody gets a chance to read the report, chapter 6 has a fine historical line about the funding that goes to local government. Richard from the Library, who is a terrific resource, wrote that. Ryan and Katie had the terrific job of getting us on and off planes. At times we were very unhappy with them getting us on and off planes, particularly the day in Tamworth when we were meant to be somewhere else. We ended up on six very small planes that were getting smaller. When I asked Ryan, who was looking out the window, where the tarmac was, he replied, ‘It is the grass verge down there.’ That day I figured I really did hate the secretariat a lot because they were taking me to far-flung places that I did not want to go to. We were going into Barraba at that stage and we were running very late, not because of anything we didcils represented there, members of which had driven some phenomenal miles to meet with us. The day we went to Longreach the CEO of the Diamantina shire told us that he had driven for seven hours to meet with our committee-but it was okay because his wife needed a haircut. That spoke volumes to me about the importance of this inquiry and the importance that local government was placing on the committee to listen to them. I will be honest, on some occasions I did not want to listen to what was being told to me, and some local councils did not want to listen to what I was telling them. But at least there was a full and frank exchange of views, and it was fairly entertaining at some stages. My favourite hearing, I have to admit, was in Perth where the CEO of the Shire of Yalgoo managed to get the word ‘shagging’ recorded in the Hansard. He is probably the only man in the history of this parliament to do that. He gave us a fascinating insight into local government when he said that local government in Yalgoo is the last man standing: federal departments have gone, state departments have gone and the local government is the only one there. I would like to read from his presentation at the hearing. I think it sums up a lot of the problems that people were expressing to the committee. Mr Olsen, the CEO of the Shire of Yalgoo-anyone who can still tell me where it is, congratulations-says: The problem with specific purpose grants is that they fall into programs that are usually designed by someone somewhere else, largely in Canberra or Perth, many of whom probably could not point to Yalgoo on the map. Occasionally, a program comes along that we take advantage of and when it fulfils our needs it is really wonderful-a lot of the time it does not. For example, we have a small community in the southern end of our shire, Payne’s Find, which has very poor water. The supply for the water has been there for 90 years; the plant is at the end of its economic life and the water is rich in faecal coliforms and also in arsenic. There is a community water program, which I was told on inquiring about it that it is meant primarily for farming communities and not for mining communities. The majority of people there are very small miners; it is not a big company. Presumably whoever designed the program thought that arsenic was better for miners than for farmers. That is the sort of problem that we face. SoI think that was the sum total of what we saw time and time again. The programs were there but they were not designed specifically for the people receiving them. Time and time again we heard that program delivery is wonderful but in particularly small regional remote communities-I think 80 per cent of Yalgoo’s population is Indigenous-it is not specific to them. We kept hearing that local government is about local expectations. I took exception to this. If anybody wants to go through the transcripts, I said that a lot of what local council is MAIN COMMITTEE",133,Committees
234,Mr Barresi,The poor people of Barraba!,137,Committees
235,Ms Burke,"The people of Barraba were delightful. There were about six or seven counabout is about managing those expectations; that they are the ones who know those expectations. General purpose funding is the way to go for most of these councils so that they can use that funding on the ground for themselves. But it should come with strings attached. One of the distressing things about the inquiry was discovering that money goes into a large pot, whereas the federal sphere of government actually have no way of accounting for that money. I find that quite distressing, so the report does say, ‘Yes, here is a radical new form of funding model, but that funding model must have an appropriate acquittal mechanism so that we can actually audit that process.’ In yesterday’s Herald Sun, there was an article called The age gap grows. It talked about a report that ALGA commissioned and just handed down and, again, it highlights the issues we were finding across the countryside. I would like to quote from Kate Jones’s report. She says: The growing generation gap between the city and the country will put councils under a huge financial burden, a report has found. … … … Alga president, Mike Montgomery said the ageing balance was a financial threat to country councils. “We will be faced with sharply increasing demand for human services, growing pressure to provide more sustainable age-related infrastructure, such as aged care facilities and community amendments,” Councillor Montgomery said. “And there will be a restricted ability to raise revenue through rates and users charges.” We also found that communities are providing more and more human services. They have moved from the traditional rates, roads and rubbish and have gone into human services, predominantly in aged care. In my state of Victoria, councils are the major providers of home and community care packages. The financial shift from both state and federal government onto local councils is becoming a huge impost upon them. We need to find ways forward to resolve these problems. As I said in my address to the House when we tabled the report, it seems a bit absurd that the report’s major findings-considering we were talking about cost shifting-concern developing a new, and I would say radical, form of funding. But that is where the evidence led us. That is where we have gone. We have not ignored cost shifting. We have put in parameters that hopefully will ensure that cost shifting is a thing of the past, because we cannot afford the duplication and we cannot afford the waste; nor can we afford communities saying no to funding because they know in three years time that someone will pull the pin and they will be left carrying the can. Local government is fairly averse to saying, ‘Yes, we’ll take on a road safety officer,’ having the position funded for three years and then saying to the community, ‘We’re terribly sorry. We’re now getting rid of the road safety officer.’ What happens then is that they bear the cost, and they cannot continue to do it. But councils need to get smarter. They need to take more responsibility. Just because your community says, ‘Let’s do something,’ does not mean they have to do it. I was mortified to hear at one of our hearings-and I will not name names-that a council had bought a private school. They had purchased a private school. I have now been told subsequent to the hearing that they have purchased another private school, because the community was up in arms that this private school was going under. That is commercial reality; I am terribly sorry. But the good people of this community put so much pressure on the council that they have now bought two private schools that are not functioning. They are not making MAIN COMMITTEE money. They are losing council money. I would not say it is the council’s responsibility to run private schools but the community expected it, so the council did it. In another place I was again taken aback to be told, ‘We had to roll SBS out to everybody in the town, because everybody in metropolitan areas has got SBS.’ Did you actually do an analysis of who would be watching SBS in your predominantly Anglo-Saxon community? Did you do an analysis of the take-up rate? Did you do an analysis of cost sharing? ‘No, we just decided everybody should have it, and so we went and purchased it at a massive expense to the local council.’ SoI think councils need to take more responsibility for the actions they take. We heard a lot about infrastructure rundown. This is true, and it needs to be addressed. The report makes some significant recommendations in that area. But, again, councils sometimes make choices to let infrastructure run down. Having a nice community festa is a wonderful thing, but not at the expense of your drains going down the tube or roads not being sealed or graded. It is difficult; it is hard. Some of these costing choices are not glamorous because people do not see them, but they certainly see them when their drains and sewerage areas are blocked up to kingdom come and everyone is crying foul at the council for not spending money. We are all working off a finite financial resource, but we must find the means of doing it. AgainI would like to quote from some of the committee’s transcript. Councillor Chong, the Mayor of Whitehorse, one of the municipalities in my electorate, said at the introduction to the Boxhill hearing: Past state and Commonwealth governments of both political persuasions are responsible for this. that is cost shiftingSignificantly for local government, the damaging effect of cost shifting has been to make councils a service delivery arm of other spheres of government. In so doing, it has reduced the discretionary capacity of local government to fund local priorities and has placed impediments to a council’s ability to get on with the business of community capacity building and developing its local community. I think that is true. In some respects, councils are buying into funding rounds and saying, ‘We will now run a drug/alcohol program because we think we can do it, or we can do that because funding is offered.’ That is not the way to go. We heard from very brave council CEOs who have now rejected funding and particularly in-kind funding. They say, ‘We will give you $100,000 if you are prepared to match $100,000.’ It is all nice and good, as one councillor said on record, to have a beautiful functioning and attractive toilet block but, if it is not what the community needs, then why should we go there? The money could be better used elsewhere. I recommend the report to the House. I hope everybody reads and digests it. We have raised an enormous number of expectations through the good offices of our country. Local government is a genuine arm of government and we have recognised that. We have said to them: ‘You are not some add-on or some second-rate group of individuals; you are performing a specific role of government.’ I hope some deliberate and genuine action is taken in respect of this committee inquiry. I recommend the report to the House and place on record my thanks to the chair, David Hawker, for all the excellent work he has done in ensuring that we have a MAIN COMMITTEE bipartisan report. Either side could have taken cheap political shots in this but neither party did. Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration has been to investigate the serious problems of cost shifting onto local government and to provide some solutions so that that particular sphere of government is appropriately, effectively and efficiently financed so that it can continue to serve the community. I commend the members for Wannon and Chisholm for their excellent report entitled Rates and taxes: a fair share for responsible local government. This report has long been required. WhatI liked about the report was the obvious air of bipartisanship, which is excellent, and that it does not make 40 or 50 recommendations which advocate more reports. This report makes 18 recommendations, many of which are very hard hitting. The committee has put on the record its disappointment at the lack of input from state governments, one of the seminal areas that we should be looking at. I am not surprised that the Queensland government has failed to make a substantial contribution to the debate. There is no doubt that our local government authorities are carrying a greater load in providing services to the general population. It goes well beyond the traditional local government areas of spending on roads, water, sewerage, rates, parks, gardens, theatres, halls, libraries, sporting facilities, show grounds and public health-all the things that we have generally associated with local government-and gets into areas of health, aged care, transaction centres, TV, mobile towers, community policy development, social services, tourism and, in some areas, even community policing. It is a very diverse field. The member for Chisholm made a very good point: some of these things have been thrust on local government but some have been accepted in a voluntary way. I think councils need to take a step back and look at the areas in which they are expert and make sure they do those well first-the old dictum of stick to your netting so to speak. By anyone’s standards local government’s responsibilities represent a serious and significant undertaking which directly affects the social, economic, environmental and cultural life of 20 million Australians-in my case 3½ million Queenslanders. Councils large and small play a vital role in contributing to the lifestyle of their communities and maintaining the level of service expected by ratepayers. Sadly, though, whether it be tick inspection services or health services, it would seem that our local councils are bearing a greater brunt of the shifty fiscal practices of many of the state governments-and I include my own state government amongst those. For example, these practices, although not cost shifting as such, are part of the rigmarole that the Queensland government has been going on with for the past year or so. One of the best examples of this is the Beattie government’s attempt to offload to local councils the responsibility for collecting $88 per head ambulance levy. This move was vehemently opposed by the Local Government Association of Queensland, and quite rightly so. To the credit of the local government authorities throughout the state, which objected to the state government’s blatant actions, they raised merry hell and managed to have the decision overturned. In the face of damning headlines, Mr Beattie soon backed down, although his Treasurer, Terry Mackenroth, contended that there was no doubt that using local government rate systems was the most efficient way to collect community ambulance cover. I say to Mr Mackenroth that I for one credit our councils with being more than a collection agency for higher authorities and a mere conduit for carrying out MAIN COMMITTEE",137,Committees
236,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (6.27 P.m.),"The main objective of the inquiry of the House of the policies of state and federal governments; they are a tier of government in their own right and need to be respected as such. In the end the Beattie government capitulated on the collection of this unfair, unequitable and wholly unpopular levy. But, just as capriciously as it had tried to pass this on to local government, it passed the responsibility on to the state’s electricity providers, with residents having to pay an extra $22 per quarter on their electricity bills. The desperation of the Queensland government to pocket this extra revenue has been demonstrated against by angry residents, who simply refuse to pay the levy and thus face having their power cut off. But what is more concerning is the ethos behind the whole implementation of the levy to keep the Queensland Ambulance Service afloat. This service was once financed partly by the state government and partly by ambulance committees. It is now down to the average Joe in the street to fund this service over and above the taxes and charges he already pays. The ambulance levy is expected to raise $110 million in the first year of operation. This in effect is a shift of the cost from the state government back to the public. But at least our local councils have managed to win the argument that they are not merely a collecting agency for an increasingly remote state government. It is quite telling that the LGAQ, in its own submission to the inquiry, estimated that the overall financial impact of devolved discretionary and compliance requirements from other levels of government amounted to $80 million per annum in outlays. With $33 million being received in revenue from grants, fees and charges, this cost shift was estimated to be about $47 million, which is a lot of money. When you divide that by 150 councils, it is a lot of money that filters down to ratepayers. This cost shifting onto local government authorities is not solely down to state governments, but the findings of the inquiry point to the majority of incidents occurring between these two levels of government. The major areas of cost shifting reported were the withdrawal or reduction of financial services or support once a program is established, thereby leaving local government with the choice of continuing the program or suffering the political odium of cancelling the service; the transfer of assets without appropriate funding support; the requirement to provide concessions and rebates without compensation payments-a typical example is a seniors card, where the state government say, ‘The council will give you 10 per cent off this and that,’ but no compensation comes back to the council; increased regulatory and compliance requirements; and failure to provide for indexation of fees and charges for services prescribed under state legislation or regulation. I am quite aware that these practices are taking place within my own electorate and the electorates of most members who are in this chamber today. One specific sphere which seems to be slipping from the hands of the Queensland government into the lap of local governments is the provision of health services. I am all too familiar with this in my own electorate. The Discovery Coast Health Service at Agnes Water, which is midway between Bundaberg and Gladstone, obtained a Commonwealth funding outlay of $2 million to be spread over three years. This was made available by the then minister, the Hon. Michael Wooldridge, in the form of recurrent expenditure. An approach was made to the state government just to provide the headquarters for this particular organisation, and my state colleague the member for Burnett announced in parliament that a $600,000 health centre would be provided. MAIN COMMITTEE This did not occur for some time, so I went to see the member for Burnett. I said, ‘What’s happening about the health centre? A $600,000 health centre would be marvellous.’ He said, ‘There’s a bit of a problem there,’ and I said, ‘What’s that?’ He said, ‘We are going to build a $600,000 health centre, but we were hoping you would put in $500,000 from the Regional Solutions Program.’ So when the state government failed to deliver on this promise of $600,000, the federal government had to provide another $165,000 towards the capital costs of purchasing leased premises. Although there were some budgeted rent savings from these leased premises being purchased, it meant a notional capital outlay of $200,000 to the Miriam Vale Shire Council. Miriam Vale Shire is the fastest growing mainland shire in Queensland, as identified in the 2001 census. It has a relatively small ratepayer base but a rapidly expanding coastal strip in and around the twin boom towns of Agnes Water and Seventeen Seventy. Miriam Vale Shire is already struggling to provide core services like water and roads to its ratepayers, and there have been growing pains in the form of annual rate rises. However, the Miriam Vale Shire is shouldering, in addition to the money given to it by the Commonwealth, a further $250,000 a year to keep the Discovery Coast Health Service running. Bear in mind that that is in addition to the capital outlay of about $200,000, which was the shortfall from the state government not providing the centre. I have also been told-and I have not been able to verify this-that the Bundaberg District Health Service, which as a state government instrumentality is supposed to cover this area, not only does not provide the services but actually charges the Discovery Coast Health Service for the services that it does provide. There is no question that the council and the local residents value the service and see it as a high priority for the community. But, in the words of the local CEO Lindsay Thomas, the Queensland government has contributed sweet BA to the centre and its ongoing costs. Another case in point is the provision of tick inspection services, which are within the domain of the Department of Primary Industries. In its wisdom, the Beattie government is in the process of transferring the responsibility, plus the cost of collecting the fees, to accredited commercial operators. The user-pays service is now being phased in and will be fully operational by 2004, with the promise of more flexible and wide-ranging services to property owners. SomehowI doubt that. I envisage that a system which relies heavily on local government authorities will have to fund additional staff and will come at a massive cost to the user. What will happen in many areas is that, where there are no local providers, vets or other people in animal husbandry, the local shire council will have to provide that service. I fail to see any justification for this cost shifting by the Queensland government, but I suppose fiscal responsibility has never been a strong suit of the ALP in Queensland. Let us not forget that the state government has delivered its third successive deficit budget to Queensland. In his lead-up comments to the release of this year’s state budget, Treasurer Terry Mackenroth sounded very confident about providing more support for health, education, disability services and the like, but instead he brought down an operating deficit of $350 million. I find that difficult to comprehend considering that between 2000 and 2004 Queensland will receive around $20 billion in GST revenue from the Commonwealth. For 2003-04 alone, Queensland is due to receive around $6.2 billion in GST revenue, which is $197 million more than the state would have received under the old formula. MAIN COMMITTEE To sum up, let me quote from some of the responses in this very excellent report. They include the idea that subsidy levels should be commensurate with the level of responsibility devolved to local government in meeting the requirements of other levels of government. Another quote is that ‘state road funding along the lines of Roads to Recovery would be appropriate. Current levels of road expenditure do not meet the depreciation expense of roads’. And most tellingly-and I end on this point-‘abandon the states and have the money directly from federal government to local government’. Sadly, therein may be the only solution. Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration and this report in the main. I think, as many speakers have already indicated, a significant amount of effort was put in by the members of the committee, and therefore it should be acknowledged. I think members on both sides would agree that this report was long overdue. It is a significant effort and will assist us to work out what is a rather complex problem-namely, cost shifting. I want to add a number of things to the discussion on this report today. I certainly was not privy to all of the evidence before the committee members, and I have certainly not had the time to delve into the depth of the evidence provided. But I do agree in the main that the recommendations make some sense. Local government is the tier of government closest to the people. Local government provides very important services, and our elected representatives in that tier of government are subject, one might argue, to the demands of their constituents in a way in which state and federal members would sometimes not fully understand, given how close local members are to their body politic-their constituent base. There are reasons why, historically, there have sometimes been administrative problems with local government. Local government by its very nature does not have the wherewithal to undertake certain financial and administrative procedures. Of course, that is mitigated when there are mergers, and there are indeed larger organisations with more professional application to these matters. WhilstI commend much of the report, I do think it is important to note that cost shifting is a complex matter. There is no simple solution to it. Each state is different. The creature of local government in each state is formed differently, and municipalities in each state provide different services and operate in different ways. I come from Victoria. I have a long standing historical involvement with local government, having worked for the Australian Services Union and, before that, the Municipal Employees Union and having been very much involved in the funding arrangements from Commonwealth to local government and from Commonwealth to state to local government. Those things therefore matter to me. They matter to me because I quite often represented working people, employees of council, who were providing on the ground services. Their livelihood and employment conditions were directly affected by funding from other tiers of government. SoI am mindful of the need to resolve this issue. One might argue that it would be easier to resolve these issues if we had a two-tiered system. From time to time the old chestnut is brought out about the abolition of one tier-but not the federal tier. Clearly, most would argue that in an ideal world, if you were to look at removing one of the tiers of government, it would be the state tier. But the fact is that that is not likely to occur in my lifetime-or even well beyond that, if ever-so we do have to resolve the problem. MAIN COMMITTEE",140,Committees
237,Mr Brendan O’connor (Burke) (6.42 P.m.),"I also rise to commend the House ofI make the point that there are differences in each state. For example, in Victoria the home and community care workers, the HACC employees if you like, are employed directly by local municipalities. That is the only state, I think, in which that takes place. Therefore, Victoria has about 8,000 to 10,000 people-employed directly by councils-looking after up to 100,000 recipients of aged care services. That is not the case in any other state. For example, Commonwealth HACC funding provided to municipalities in any state outside of Victoria does not go to local government. Therefore, I think there has to be some concession that the state government of Victoria, of whichever political persuasion, has a greater responsibility, at least in that area, when it is dealing with local government. Indeed, the Commonwealth government, again regardless of the political persuasion of those in government at the time, has to be more cognisant of the fact that local government in Victoria provides more social community services than does local government in any other state. I know that councils that have been asked to undertake responsibility for aged care services in Victoria, or indeed family day care services, are not always provided with sufficient funds to comply with federal awards. To deliver the services to the community they are compelled to work under a federal award system-indeed, now they have no choice but to work under a federal award system in Victoria-but the Commonwealth has not always provided the funding under the relevant award for those many thousands of employees. Of course, that means that the council has to do one of two things: find extra money to undertake what is effectively the responsibility of the Commonwealth, not the state, or reduce the services provided in the municipalities. I raise that example as an indication that it is not one size fits all when it comes to cost shifting from the Commonwealth to the states; there are variations to the theme. I also think it is important to note that, whilst there may well be a windfall to the states from the GST arrangements, that certainly will not be the case for about four years. It is important to put those things on the record this evening. Finally, I note that I only had a good look at this report today. I have gone through most of the recommendations. I find that the committee has exhaustively looked at the broad areas of this crucial issue of cost shifting, and I think in the main the recommendations are wise and correct. But it is important to note that the Commonwealth has to also look at the way in which it operates. It is not just a matter of states shifting costs onto local government. In certain circumstances it can be the other tier of government doing that. Therefore, we should be mindful of that when we are deliberating on this matter. I congratulate the committee, and indeed the secretariat of that committee, for the fine effort they have put in, because overall it has been a fantastic report. Speaker Hawker, for your fine efforts in steering this committee through many days of evidence. I congratulate you personally. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. Procedure Committee Report Debate resumed from 13 October, on motion by Mrs May: That the House take note of the paper. MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Committees
238,Mr Price,What about the chair?,144,Committees
239,Mr Brendan O’connor,"I should, in particular, also congratulate you, Mr Deputythe way the House deals with the budget, the budget debates and the estimates. It is called the House estimates. I think it is a win for the government because it will guarantee that a motion that the House approve the budget will get the budget appropriations through the House earlier than would otherwise be the case. It is a win for members because they will have a far greater role in the budget and estimates than they have hitherto had. This will occur in two ways. Firstly, the detail stage will be guaranteed and timetabled, and opportunities for members to contribute will be there. None of those things currently occur. Moreover, the debate will be much more extensive. Secondly, an estimates committee type process is again proposed for the House. It is not a new idea. The Fraser government had an estimates process and House estimates committees. It did not sustain them in the long run, but I think this set of proposals is better framed. Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, I could say to you that, with the Procedure Committee having consulted widely, having spoken with committee secretaries, having spoken with committee chairs and having published its report, it is desperately disappointing that no-one but the members of the committee are speaking on this report. But I think that would be grossly unfair, because the public at large just have no understanding of the time pressures on members when parliament is sitting. We are increasingly trying to do more in less time whilst we are down here in Canberra, so it does not come as a surprise to me. I do not think it is a reflection on the report, nor should we say it is disappointing that only members of the committee are speaking to this report. I am glad that I have the opportunity, which I did not have in the four minutes the selection committee allocated to the opposition when presenting the report, to make special mention of the honourable member for Mackellar. It is true that she deserves much of the credit for the committee taking up this issue and presenting the report and I commend her for her efforts. That in no way detracts from other members of the committee. Again, I can say that this is a bipartisan report of the Procedure Committee. I have to put my cards on the table and say that I have long held the view that members of the House miss out because we are not involved in an estimates process the way senators are. We miss out because we do not get to know the minutiae of portfolios. We do not have the opportunity for members who have special interests, like the member for Burke present here, to actually pursue those with the top officials of the departments-relentlessly, as he would. It is a great deficiency and burden that members have. We are rectifying it. But let me not be overly optimistic about these things. It is true to say-and you would be aware of this, Deputy Speaker Hawker-that when the Howard government came to power and the parliamentary departments were cut back by some $10 million that the area in the Department of the House of Representatives that received the most severe cutbacks was the committee system. You, as a distinguished chairman of committees-I think you have well and truly earned that title-would know that the secretariats servicing the different committees are utterly stretched. At the end of the day we pretend that, as members of the committee, we can make up for any shortfall or deficit. That is wrong. A committee of the House of Representatives or a joint committees serviced by the Department of the House of Representatives is very much dependent on the skill, expertise and dedication of the secretariat. If you start cutting back as MAIN COMMITTEE",144,Committees
240,Mr Price (Chifley) (6.52 P.m.),"This is a report that proposes to fundamentally changesavagely as was done in 1996, you run some risks. I believe that, with the addition of three committees in this parliament with not one extra staff member being employed, we are pushing people beyond endurance. One of the critical recommendations in this report is to require the Clerk to undertake a review of the staffing and the resources of the House committees and the joint committees serviced by the Department of the House of Representatives. It is subject to that review that we would seek to have that additional workload and I presume resources, both financial and human, added to committees so that they will be able to undertake it. Secondly, I would to say that, in trying to meet this deficit that I referred to earlier in relation to members of the House of Representatives, I have always thought it might be an attractive proposition to join with our Senate colleagues-without wanting to destroy the Senate estimates process or indeed outnumber them or change in any way their current structure. That would afford members of the House the same opportunity to serve and seek the same information that senators have. I have to say that in the process of the report it became quite clear that it would be significantly difficult, if not an impossibility, to overcome the concerns of the Senate in it wishing to preserve its current prerogatives. I have, if you like, had to back down and have backed off from that particular suggestion. The appendices to the report are very interesting, and I particularly draw members’ attention to current appendix B. This details how the budget appropriation bill went through the parliament and the Main Committee, and how we might do that in relation to implementing the recommendations of this particular report. The honourable member for Mackellar had the view that if we were only subjecting House ministers to scrutiny-and that is what is proposed-then that would substitute for the Senate’s scrutiny of House ministers and their departments. Deputy Speaker Hawker, you will appreciate there is a long-standing convention that House ministers will be represented by their Senate colleagues, and I am sure that can be uncomfortable at times for the relevant House ministers. I do not believe that scrutiny will happen but, even if it does not, the report and its recommendations are still very important. In the detail stage of the debate, Recommendation 2 suggests: … the Selection Committee be responsible for arranging the timetable and order of business for the consideration in detail stage … But in doing so, the Selection Committee will need to consult with the Leader of the House on the availability of ministers. There will be a timetable published in the Notice Paper that lists the times and the ministers. In particular, if there is no minister present or there are no members wishing to speak in the detail stage then the debate is collapsed. We have one of the government whips in the Main Committee right now, the member for Gilmore, and I am sure the whips on both sides will ensure that people are available to take advantage of that detail stage. Recommendation 3 suggests: … that the standing orders provide that if the Chair notes that no Minister is present to respond to matters raised during the consideration of the estimatesthat is the detail stagethe Chair shall suspend proceedings until a Minister is available. MAIN COMMITTEE The other thing is that either the minister responsible or the minister acting on their behalf shall actually make an opening statement when we come to the detail stage. That certainly does not occur at the moment. In fairness to some ministers I should point out that they are very religious in ensuring they are present during the detail stage and respond. I do not want to create the impression that no minister has done that or currently does it. The difference is that this committee is mandating it. I am delighted to say that, under our proposals, even the Department of the House of Representatives will be subject to scrutiny, for the first time ever. It is an absolute abominationand given your important committee duties, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, I know you will have a concern about this-that no department of state, no authority of state-even the Department of the House of Representatives-should not submit itself to the same scrutiny, questioning, accountability and transparency required of all other departments. It is a matter of record that historically-I am not suggesting it is happening today-expenditures were buried by the Presiding Officers in the Department of the House of Representatives because it was not subject to scrutiny. This is no longer a tolerable situation and it is important that we are seen to be not only saying what should be done but also making sure that we are seen to comply with the very standards that we are imposing on others. I digress briefly to say that I have had, for a number of years, on the Notice Paper-and I am pleased to say it is now party policy-that there should be a staffing and appropriations committee for the House of Representatives. That would go some way towards overcoming some of the issues I have raised. It certainly would give ordinary members of the House a greater say as to proceedings. I am looking forward to the day-when the Labor Party win the next election-when we see a staffing and appropriations committee formed. It follows along the same lines that I have been talking about. In relation to which committee gets which department, that would be a matter for the Speaker, as it is already in relation to annual reports. The estimates process does require some extra sitting hours and one day of extra sittings, but it does not take away any government time. No bill, no legislation, will fail to go through the House because we have set up an estimates committee process. These estimates committees will consider matters on two Thursday nights and on two Fridays. That is an extra commitment by everyone associated with Parliament House and an extra commitment by members of parliament, but no government time will be eaten into. I am aware that other members of the committee wish to speak on this matter. I apologise that I have not covered it all. But I really think that this is a very important report. It is a report that I would urge all members of the House, whether on the government side or the opposition side, to read in order to understand what is being done-what is being done in the interests of democracy and greater accountability and to improve the functioning of the job that we are supposed to do, which is to scrutinise government expenditure. I do not think that we can completely say, with 100 per cent satisfaction, that we are doing it adequately now. I commend the report to all honourable members. (Time expired) gency this Procedure Committee House estimates report. When I first entered the parliament in 1987 as a senator and was asked to serve on an estimates committee, I thought, ‘What on earth is that, and what is the purpose of that?’ I set about learning what the purpose was and MAIN COMMITTEE",145,Committees
241,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (7.07 P.m.),"I rise to support with a sense of urseeing how estimates committees could operate for the benefit of eliciting information which could be shared and which would give transparency to government, which I thought was important. I suppose in a way I am in a rather unique position, having been very active in Senate estimates and then going to the House and, as a minister, experiencing being represented by another minister in Senate estimates hearings, as I was unable to deal with it myself because I was in the lower house. It seemed to me that there should be estimates hearings in the lower house. Many will say that the government will shy away from that, that ministers would not want that to occur, and yet I would put the reverse case: the fact of the matter is that estimates can be of great use to ministers themselves. It is very often the case that you can find out things about your own department that you are never going to find out simply by asking questions from time to time of people in the department who come and see you. Estimates give you a unique opportunity to take a snapshot of what is happening in government at a particular point in time. But the practice whereby the greater number of ministers are in the lower house and are unable to be present when their officials are answering questions from senators makes the system, I think, far less efficient than it could be. I was very grateful to my colleagues from both sides of the House on the Procedure Committee who agreed with my suggestion that we do indeed look at the question of having estimates in the lower house. I am very grateful for the kind remarks that the member for Chifley made earlier. This report does more than just put forward the notion; it is quite detailed as to how it should be done, and I think that is a very good aspect of the work that the Procedure Committee did. The real value of estimates is the eliciting of information which would otherwise not be public information. When I think of the time that I spent in the Senate on estimates committees, I can think of many issues that were aired that otherwise would never have been aired. I can remember ministers such as former Senator John Button, who would always be present for what was a very rigorous testing of his department and his policies. I particularly remember the multifunction polis, which was one of the greatest follies we ever saw in this country-but we were able to expose it as such, simply by asking questions. Former Senator Button, to his credit, was always there to answer for himself as well. I must say that I very much enjoyed being able to answer questions that were put to me concerning either the Defence portfolio that I had or the aged care portfolio that I had because I believe that as a minister you should not keep the public servants who are with you quiet but let them give the answers to the questions that are being asked and then take it on board-use it. You can enhance your own ability to deal with information in the process. I do hope that people will read this report, because it does lay out a good modus operandi, it does take into account that government does not want to lose time from its own business and it does take into account that there are already established committees. We did look at the proposition that we have joint estimates committees with the Senate; I do not think that is workable. We did make it quite clear that there would be no duplication-that the Senate estimates committees would ask questions of ministers who were ministers in the Senate and that the House of Representatives estimates committees would ask questions of ministers in the House. In putting forward the detailed report that we have, I hope that the people who will ultimately make the decisions will see that governments are always better governments if there is MAIN COMMITTEE transparency. If there is an ability to ask questions and to have matters aired, you will get better outcomes for ministers, departments and, most importantly, the electorate at large. In a working democracy, the more information there is available to people, the better the government is for it. I always said in opposition that when I went into government I would not change my mind and I would continue to believe that transparency-making information available to people-was a fundamental tenet of a working democracy. I do recall there was a push that said the Public Service should be interested only in outcomes-never mind the process; it was minutiae-and we should only be looking at the big picture; those words were starting to become the parlance of the day. I took a very strong stance then, and I stand by it today, that process would always be important because if process is corrupt so is the outcome. It is interesting that one of the people who used to join me on a podium sometimes to argue in favour of looking at all the processes was none other than Mike Keating, who went on of course to be head of Prime Minister and Cabinet under former Prime Minister Keating. So there is across many aspects of government a belief that governments will always benefit from transparency. I feel quite passionate about the fact that introducing an estimates process into the House through the committee structure, with ministers in the House answering to those committees, would enhance government, not detract from it. It would not make it more difficult for people but in fact bring about a situation where ministers, members and the general public could all benefit from having greater access to knowledge and information. House on a proposal to establish an estimates process, I want to place it in the context of a range of reports that have been prepared by the Procedure Committee in recent years. I feel privileged to be a member of this small committee. I think in some ways, in the overall operation of the House, it is a committee that is often forgotten among the big debates that sometimes occur about taxation, changes in education and health care and other topics. I want to remind the House of the terms of reference of the Procedure Committee. They are: ... to inquire into and report on the practices and procedures of the House generally with a view to making recommendations for their improvement or change and for the development of new procedures. Those terms of reference are fundamental to the nature of the democratic system that we operate under in Australia in the 21st century. I firmly believe that in recent years the Procedure Committee has gone out of its way to try to improve the operation of the House and, in doing so, to try to make it more accountable to the Australian public. The committee has also sought in its workings to try to make the House more worker friendly by facilitating better working practices, not only for the members of the House-in respect of issues such as sitting hoursbut also for all the wonderful people who work in Parliament House and keep the House and the operations of the Australian democratic system going. The reports of the Procedure Committee, the most recent of which was only tabled this week, have also included an endeavour by the committee, after a long drawn out process, to revise the standing orders to make them more user-friendly and understandable not only to the members of the House but also, more importantly, to those who pay a lot of attention to the operation of the House. The committee has also had occasion to review the conduct of divisions, the opening of parliament and, more recently, the operation of the estimates committees. One of the other issues the committee is currently considering is how to encourage more MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Committees
242,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (7.15 P.m.),"In addressing the report before theinterchange in the operation of the Main Committee and the House of Representatives. There is a proposal, for example, that the speaking time of members be limited to 15 minutes and then, in an endeavour to encourage interchange, members on both sides be given the opportunity to question the speaker for five minutes. That brings me to the context in which I see the report before the House this evening. It goes to the nature of the democratic system we operate in. I note that a number of other members who have participated in this debate, such as the member for Chifley, have sought to explain to the House in a detailed way the proposal on the development of an estimates system in the House of Representatives. That proposal in many ways flows from two earlier reports, entitled Balancing tradition and progress and It’s your House. Chapter2 of Balancing tradition and progress clearly states at point 2.1: In one sense Parliament is an enduring institution. Its operating procedures change over time and periodically the body of representatives who serve in it is refreshed through general elections. It then goes on to point out that, as part of the parliamentary system that exists at a Commonwealth level in Australia, there is the other House, which we refer to as the Senate, and that the life of a parliament is determined by section 28 of the Constitution. It says: In effect, a Parliament ends when the House of Representatives is dissolved, that is, at the end of three years of its first meeting or sooner by action of the Governor General. That clearly states that the House of Representatives is a very important institution in the operation of the Commonwealth parliament. Governments are formed in the House of Representatives. That raises very serious questions, in terms of the operation of the budget, about the accountability of government to the House of Representatives. It is not just ‘the other house’, because in essence the government is formed in the House of Representatives and the budget is delivered in the House of Representatives. Surely as the people’s house there should be an opportunity for members of the House of Representatives to question the government about the nature of the budgetary process in a detailed way through the estimates process. By way of information and actually dealing with this report, I also want to note in passing this evening that, whilst the report was presented to the parliament before the last election, in 2001, there are a number of outstanding recommendations embodied in that report which have not to date been taken up by the government of the day. I want to remind the House of the importance of these recommendations because they actually go to the nature of the issues that I am touching on this evening with respect to the fact that this House is the people’s house. This House therefore ought to seriously consider recommendations which concern the operation of the House in the opening of a new parliament in terms of how we bring into the parliament ordinary Australian citizens and open it up to those citizens. Clearly one of the most important recommendations in my mind is a recommendation that representatives of the ACT Indigenous community be consulted to advise on a suitable Indigenous ritual to be included in the opening procedures. Another recommendation is that the Australian of the Year be invited to take part in the opening proceedings on each occasion to present a formalised message on behalf of the Australian people. That is about bringing Australian citizens into the opening of a new parliament. It is a message to the parliament, to the people who have the privilege of being sworn in on that day, that, yes, we are representatives of the Australian community and here is the person that we have selected as the Australian of MAIN COMMITTEE the Year to remind us of our responsibilities. There is also the suggestion, for example, that maybe it is about time we changed the form of oath and affirmation to recognise the fact that we are representing the people of Australia and that that ought to be why we are here. One of the other recommendations is that we basically try and work out how we take some of the formality out of the opening of the parliament. That then takes me to a further report which goes to the issues that I have touched on about the operation of the people’s house and why an estimates committee process is so fundamentally important to our future. I refer to the House of Representatives Procedure Committee report entitled It’s your House. This goes to the nature of a representative democracy and accountability and transparency with respect to government processes. No government process is more fundamental than how we spend taxpayers’ money. That is what the report before the chair this evening is about. It concerns the new standing orders which create the capacity for the Australian parliamentary representatives in the House of Representatives to consider on an annual basis the estimates. When we talk about the estimates we are talking about decisions by government with respect to government policies on how they are spending the hard-earned dollars of Australian taxpayers. That brings me to why these reports are so fundamentally important for the future operation of the House of Representatives. I go to chapter 1 of the report It’s your House by the Procedure Committee. I note that the report at paragraph 1.2 very clearly states: Among the functions of the Parliament are law making, monitoring government activity and feeding community views into the processes of government. When you think about it, that is what the report before the House this evening is about. It is about House estimates. That fits very squarely into the operations and functions of the parliament. In essence, it is clearly about our creating a better process rather than retaining the existing process, which is treated with contempt by government, to monitor government activity with respect to budgetary matters. It also rightly points out that the House is the master of its own affairs. It operates independently and it establishes, often through recommendations of the Procedure Committee, the rules of operation of the House, once approved by the House in session. What we therefore need to make sure of is that through the procedures and the standing orders of the House we clearly send a signal to the people privileged to serve in the House that it is their responsibility to open up accountability in the expenditure of taxpayers’ money. That reminds me of other issues touched on in that report going to the operation of the House. It not only squarely states that under the Constitution the House is the master of its own affairs but also refers to the fact that we have to try and guarantee as members of this House that we create opportunities for the community to view its operations and see the impact of policy decisions by the government, in terms of both legislative action and budgetary action, on the Australian community. Having dealt with the nature of the parliament and the strength of our democracy and our requirements for accountability, I turn to chapter 2 of the House estimates report of the Procedure Committee. Paragraph 2.1 states: Section 83 of the Constitution requires all government expenditure to be authorised by an ‘appropriation made by law’-that is, by an Act of Parliament, which is introduced into the Parliament as an appropriation bill. MAIN COMMITTEE Paragraph 2.3 then goes on to state: An appropriation is the authorisation of expenditure. Any bill which authorises expenditure, or which would have the effect of increasing, altering the destination of, or extending the purpose of an already existing appropriation, is an appropriation bill. This is why we as the people’s house, the House in which governments are formed, should have the capacity to consider the nature of a government proposal with respect to the expenditure of taxpayers’ money. It is only in this House that appropriation bills can be initiated-only in the people’s house. If that is our constitutional requirement, why then should the House shy away from opening up a capacity for the House to consider appropriation bills in detail? That is the crux of the report: appropriation bills can only be initiated in the House, yet in this very House there is no capacity to consider them in detail. It is in that context that I very firmly urge all members of the House to consider in detail-yes, in detail-the recommendations embodied in this report. The committee is to be congratulated. It took the reference seriously because all the committee’s work is about facilitating the operation of the House for the members who are privileged to serve in the House on behalf of the Australian people. So my message to the government and the opposition-as both from time to time, because of the nature of the political process, have the opportunity to serve on the Treasury benches-is that just as in the past on odd occasions the House has had the capacity to have estimates we should now take this report and run with it. It is about genuine parliamentary reform. This is about a modern parliament in the 21st century saying to the Australian people, the people who elect us, ‘Yes, we take your views seriously. Yes, it is a difficult process to actually represent you because of the size and breadth of the Australian continent, but in our endeavours to make sure that we are accountable we as a parliament are going to subject ministers to a questioning process. We will say to whoever is in government that in terms of spending your hard-earned dollars’-because it is your taxes that the government applies government policies to in respect of the services it is going to deliver-‘we are going to subject ministers, with a strong independent bureaucracy at the same table, to a questioning process which will hold them accountable. We will make sure that in Australia in the 21st century the Commonwealth parliament is a clear example of transparency, honesty and integrity in government.’ I recommend the report to the House and thank the Procedure Committee for a job well done. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers Debate resumed from 8 October, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the following paper: Resolving Deadlocks: A discussion paper on section 57 of the Australian Constitution. line and speak to the report tabled on behalf of the Australian Labor Party titled Constitutional reform and the resolution of parliamentary deadlock. It is a submission, dated October 2003, by the Hon. Simon Crean. I had the honour of participating in the authorship of that document. MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Committees
243,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (7.30 P.m.),"In addressing this report, I would like to outEssentially, the position of the Australian Labor Party is that we are prepared to look at reform of the powers of the Senate. We recognise that the position which was assumed by our constitutional founders-and they were fathers; there were no women among them-was that the Senate would be a house of review that would operate according to the interests of the separate states. That is why, to get the federal compact up, there are equal numbers of senators in each state. But we recognise that the reality is that the Senate has practised as a chamber that is essentially divided along party political lines, although certainly since 1949, which saw the introduction of proportional representation, there has unquestionably been greater opportunity for minor parties to be represented. Because of the participation and influence of the minor parties, the party with the majority in the House of Representatives has on very few occasions had the corresponding majority in the Senate. I think it can be assumed in Australia’s political system that for the foreseeable future minority parties will have the balance of power in the Senate. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Those in the majority parties are inclined to say that the minority parties can perhaps run interference, but the reality is that the existence of minority parties can compel both major parties to negotiate through proposed legislation and consider various checks and balances with a view to satisfying those interests represented by the minority parties. There has been a range of legislation-for instance, the security legislation in respect of ASIO powers-on which an excellent outcome has been achieved through that process. On the other hand, there is an argument that, if you want efficient government as opposed to, perhaps, democratically pure government, then you need to ensure a mechanism for the will of the House of Representatives, which unquestionably is a far more democratically elected House. I say that because each electorate in the House of Representatives represents 83,000-odd voters, whereas in the Senate, Tasmania, for instance, which is marginally greater in size than the Australian Capital Territory, has much more substantial representation than the ACT. This inequality of representation has been commented upon by a number of people, in particular the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. He referred to the Senate as ‘unrepresentative swill’, perhaps overly harshly in the context of the constructive role they can play in the negotiating process. I suppose that is the balance. At what point do you sacrifice democracy for efficiency? This is essentially the subject matter of the current debate. We say there are dangers in giving unrestrained power to the House of Representatives, and there do need to be appropriate checks in place. The Prime Minister has said that a way of achieving a balance is by having the capacity for a joint sitting-a sitting of both the House of Representatives and the Senate-to occur after a bill has been rejected on two occasions. That is one proposition. The second proposition is that which is referred to as the Lavarch model, whereby such a joint sitting can occur after an ordinary general election which was obviously held in circumstances where the subject matter of the anticipated joint sitting would have been canvassed during the course of the election campaign debates and considered by the Australian people when they cast their vote. The trouble with that model is that, although it would obtain a contemporaneous expression of the will of the electorate, it is limited as only half the Senate goes to a ballot at any time. While there are six-year terms for senators, only half of the Senate retires at each general election, so it would be the House of Representatives and half of the Senate that would reflect the will of the electorate, but not the other half of the Senate. That is one point that I note at this MAIN COMMITTEE point in time before I discuss the issue of concurrent elections. The Lavarch model-a joint sitting after a contemporaneous expression of the will of the electorate-is a model which we are prepared to consider. That is a legitimate issue to put up. But we then say: are you not only partially addressing the issue of the power of the Senate, bearing in mind that it is unlikely in this day and age that the government of the day-that is, the party with the majority in the House of Representatives-will also control the Senate? In the foreseeable future the opposition parties will, through the combination of their numbers, most probably control the balance of power in the Senate. Therefore, if you are consistent in your concern about the abuse of Senate powers, to what extent should you permit the Senate to exercise its ultimate sanction of denying supply to the government of the day? By so denying supply, because of our constitutional restrictions, the government literally would not be able to fund the Public Service for the ordinary purposes of government-public service, schools, contributions to medical services, the defence forces and telecommunications. It would deprive the government of oxygen, forcing an election to occur. To what extent can the Prime Minister or government speak of Senate reform without addressing that crucial issue of the power of the Senate-the opposition parties combining-to bring down a democratically elected government? This frequently resorts to a historical consideration of 1975. But I am saying: move beyond the merits of the party political arguments as to a Labor government being dismissed and look at the issue. If you look at it in terms of that ultimate power being left with opposition parties to bring down a democratically elected government, I think you will see that it is a far more extensive and dramatic power than simply the Senate obstructing the passage of a single bill or, indeed, several bills. Clearly, if we are talking about Senate reform, it is an issue that needs to be addressed. If you look at the 1975 crisis, you will see that it was not section 57 that resolved the deadlock. Section 57, which deals with joint sittings occurring after a double dissolution to resolve deadlocks in the passage of legislation, had no relevance to the denial of supply because it was not a double dissolution trigger. It was simply that, in 1974, the opposition in the lower house indicated an intention to reject supply. On that basis the Prime Minister of the day, Gough Whitlam, said, ‘Having announced that, we are therefore going to go to the people,’ and relied on a series of bills that had been backlogged for the purpose of calling a double dissolution. But it was the coincidence of a backlog of bills that enabled the Prime Minister of the day to do that. Equally with respect to 1975, there was never a rejection of supply by the Senate; there was a refusal to pass supply. Hence, there had never been a single rejection of the supply bill, let alone the three-month gap and then a second submitting of the supply bill. In other words, section 57 was quite irrelevant to that. The crisis of the deadlock with supply not being delivered to the government and hence the potential to freeze those essential services resulted in unquestionably a constitutional crisis. But the irony was that the power was withdrawn from the Prime Minister and given to the Leader of the Opposition on the basis of an undertaking by Mr Fraser that he would call a double dissolution, ironically with respect to a significant number of bills that had been opposed by the opposition. The opposition was installed as the caretaker government, but again because of the coincidence of these backlogged bills. In summary, section 57 is not capable of resolving deadlocks in the Senate in respect of the issue of supply. We say that, if you are fair dinkum about reforming the powers of the Senate, MAIN COMMITTEE the issue of the Senate’s ability to block bills is of significance but, equally, you cannot sensibly address that unless you address the power of supply. So you say, ‘All right. The Senate should not have the power to reject supply.’ Why? Because it is the opposition determining when the government of the day goes to the election. Equally, if you are consistent, you have to say that the government of the day should not be able to arbitrarily or propitiously for their own political advantage call an election simply because of their majority in the House of Representatives. If you accept that the Australian people are entitled to certainty, if you accept for the reasons of political stability that the Australian people are entitled to certainty, you move into the territory of the need for fixed terms. In terms of what an appropriate quantum of that fixed term should be, going back to 1929-as we refer to in our paper-there has been discussion of the appropriateness of four-year terms. That comes back to the very first proposition that I made in terms of the so-called Lavarch model about the appropriateness of the joint sitting occurring after a general election. If you are talking about fixed terms, they should be both for the House of Representatives and the Senate. That would result in a synchronisation of the houses, with all members and all senators facing the people were there to be a contemporaneous expression of the will of the people. Essentially that is our reasoning. What are the prospects of these or even the government’s propositions getting up? I have to say my hope and Buckley’s. Why do I say that? If you look at the 44 referendum propositions in Australia, only eight have been successful. In only one of those eight was there success in the face of a no case. That was a 1946 proposition in respect of social security. For the rest there was no no case conducted. Clearly, the prospect of success is very remote when there is opposition in the form of a no case being conducted. As we have said in our paper, it would be far more constructive for the government to look at propositions that would secure some institutional reform, such as facilitating cooperative arrangements between federal and state governments. If that were done, we think it would be far more likely for all political parties to come to a unanimity of opinion that it is good for federal and state governments to break down the barriers created by our federal system. Essentially we say that we are prepared to discuss, but we think there are other priorities for constitutional reform. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (7.45 p.m.)-Section 57 of the Australian Constitution provides for the resolution of disagreements between the House of Representatives and the Senate. That there should be conflict between the two houses is a reflection of the inherent tension between the competing traditions of responsible government and federalism. The founding fathers were well aware of this tension and, despite the reservations of some, it was seen as desirable. The framers of the Constitution saw the Senate as a bastion of states rights and, more importantly, as a bulwark against any democratic excesses from the executive in lower houses. The protection of states rights was crucial in convincing the colonies, with their own constitutions and parliaments, to hand over power to a new level of government. Shrewd observers at the time recognised that the protection of states rights would be less of an issue. Indeed, the battleground for states rights was never in the Senate but rather in the High Court. The advent of national disciplined parties meant that the Senate would never be a states house. Crucially, the framers also saw the Senate as an important check on power. The MAIN COMMITTEE colonial legislatures had upper houses with in-built conservative majorities, usually through electoral systems with property qualifications or later weighted to regional areas. The intent was to dilute any excesses from social democratic governments in the lower house. Liberals and conservatives alike feared de Tocqueville’s tyranny of the majority. The argument followed that power should be divided-an idea reflected both by accident and design in the US Senate and the House of Lords. Suspicious of power, the Australian liberal and conservative parties defended upper houses and state rights, seeing them as a check on political power. Power divided is power diluted. The ALP took a different view. The tradition in social democratic parties, like the ALP and the British Labour Party, was towards unitary systems with unicameral parliaments. The argument was that the people would elect the lower house, which would house the executive which, in turn, would make the laws. Such a system was often described as an elected dictatorship; power was to be centralised. The most pure form of this was found in New Zealanda unitary state with a unicameral parliament. This system lasted some 70 years, before a backlash prompted the introduction of proportional representation. After 50 years of Federation, there was some tempering of philosophical positions. Ben Chifley, aware that he would lose government in 1949, advocated a change to the electoral system for the Senate to proportional representation-a system first mooted in 1901. Chifley supported PR because it would prevent the Liberal Party gaining control of the upper house. Chifley wanted a check on the lower house. Having had power, Chifley was clearly reluctant for the ALP to relinquish too much. In any event, Menzies called a double dissolution election in 1951 and Chifley’s plans came to nought-but PR was here to stay. The introduction of proportional representation sparked dramatic changes in the function of the Australian parliament. As Professor Campbell Sharman, one of Australia’s foremost experts on bicameralism, has argued, changes to electoral systems often have profound and lasting impacts far beyond and often completely different to the intent of the instigators of change. Chifley, for example, could not have envisaged the rise of minor parties. There can be no doubt that minor parties are a beneficial component of Australian democracy, ensuring a healthy pluralism. But there are some caveats: I note the first Greens member in the House today. Originally, the intent of minor parties, like Don Chipp’s Australian Democrats, was to ‘keep the bastards honest’-that is, to hold governments to electoral promises. It would be difficult to argue that minor parties keep governments to their promises; instead, they hope to see them break them. This is, naturally, a source of tension between the executive and minor parties; each claims a mandate. Senator Brown, whose Greens won 13.79 per cent of the vote in Tasmania, claims a mandate; and the Australian government, winning 51.03 per cent of the vote right across Australia also claims a mandate. It is not hard to see frustration develop. Senator Brown has stated that since 1973 the Senate has passed 97 per cent of the 5,400 government bills. Senator Faulkner, in his speech to the Sydney Institute, stated that the Senate has passed 1,269 bills, negatived 29 bills and laid aside 11. Proponents of the current model are quick to point out that the overwhelming majority of legislation passes without controversy. This is true; the majority of government business does just that. However, this ignores the importance of the bills that were rejected. Those negatived or laid aside bills may actually define the agenda of a government and define its vision for Australia. They may also MAIN COMMITTEE represent the fulfilment of election promises. Elected governments can claim some measure of a mandate. People vote for a particular party with a view to seeing various policies enacted. The extent to which the Senate can block various pieces of legislation may thwart a government’s mandate. There is also the potential economic cost and unnecessary delay of urgently needed legislation. The situation facing the Howard government is worsened by the obstructionist nature of some of the minor parties. There are currently six double dissolution triggers. They are the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002 [No. 2], which would give effect to welfare reform initiatives announced in the 2002-03 budget; the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2], which would expand the definition of ‘excised offshore place’ to include additional territory; the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits-Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2], which would effect savings in the PBS by increasing general and concessional copayments and safety nets; the Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2], which would allow the ACCC to take representative actions and intervene in restrictive trade practices proceedings; the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2], which would exempt small business from federal unfair dismissal provisions; and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 [No. 2], which would require industrial action to be endorsed by employees through a secret ballot before it could become protected action under the act. There are a further two bills which have been blocked by the Senate a first time and which may become double dissolution triggers. These are the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2], which would change foreign ownership and some cross-media ownership limits, and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2], which would expand the scope of federal unfair dismissal laws and exclude state unfair dismissal laws and reliance on the corporations power in the Constitution. These bills constitute significant elements of the government’s electoral agenda. The blocking of these bills has gone beyond constructive finetuning of legislation and is closer to undermining the mandate of the government. Discussion over section 57 of the Constitution has occurred in some form since 1901. The constitutional crisis in 1975, which I notice the member for Barton mentioned, provoked a great deal of debate over resolving the deadlock between the two houses; it has periodically reappeared since then, especially when the Senate appears intransigent. The Prime Minister’s discussion paper considers two additional models for resolving deadlocks between the two houses. The first model would allow the Governor General to convene a joint sitting of both houses without requiring a double dissolution election; the second model allows for the Governor General to convene a joint sitting of both houses following an ordinary House of Representatives election. The two models would augment, not remove, the existing double dissolution provision. Significantly, the models require Senate rejection, the passing of unacceptable amendments or failing to pass a bill twice over a period of more than three months-and only if the House of Representatives is not due to be dissolved within six months. I strongly encourage debate and discussion over these two models. There can be no doubt that some level of conflict and tension between the two houses is both healthy and desirable. However, that tension must not be allowed to unnecessarily obstruct key platforms in a government’s MAIN COMMITTEE agenda. The proposed models have the potential to remove the obstructionist elements of the existing system while retaining the productive friction between the two houses. leased to the House Resolving deadlocks: a discussion paper on possible changes to section 57 of the Australian Constitution. I was somewhat amused by the now predictable choice of language by the Prime Minister when he spoke to this discussion paper in the House in the following terms: The purpose of releasing this discussion paper is to initiate a widespread debate throughout Australia regarding a very moderate and reasonable proposal for possible amendment of section 57 of the Australian Constitution. Moderate and reasonable-I remember the PM’s very conciliatory tone at the time. However, after a year in this place, I am getting used to the very blatant misrepresentation and twisting of the facts by our Prime Minister. This is yet another example. This proposal is not ‘very moderate and reasonable’; it is a very blatant attempt to severely curb the power of the Senate. In fact, if the Prime Minister had his way the Senate, a legitimate and important arm of our democracy, would no longer have any real or effective power; that much is clear. So, from the outset, I contest the Prime Minister’s assertion that this proposal is ‘very moderate’, because it is far from being that, and the Prime Minister should be honest about that. Also, it is not a ‘reasonable’ proposal, and the Prime Minister should not dress it up as such. This proposal is in fact quite extreme and its consequences very serious. In his speech on 8 October the Prime Minister went on to say: The first point I would make is that these proposals do not represent an attack on the powers of the Senate. They do not represent an attempt to remove the fundamental role or the fundamental influence of the Senate… Yes, they do actually; and the facts show that. Let us just look at some of them. Analysis of legislation debated in the parliament since 1973 shows that less than three per cent of government legislation is blocked in the Senate. The argument that reform of the Senate is essential to ensure a workable democracy is contradicted by the facts. During the term of the Howard government, of 1,305 bills presented for a vote only 36 have been voted down or laid aside. In fact, over 98 per cent of the 5,467 bills voted on in the Senate over the past 30 years have been passed. In correspondence received by the Greens from Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate, the truth behind the government’s supposed ‘very moderate and reasonable’ reform proposal becomes very clear. For example, in that correspondence Mr Evans says: Mr Howard’s proposal is that, whenever the Senate fails to pass government legislation, the government should be able to hold a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament to pass that legislation. The flaw in this proposal has been readily identified: it would allow the government (except in the unusual circumstances of a government majority of only one or two seats in the House of Representatives) to pass any and all legislation without regard to the Senate. With this power, a government could pass legislation to avoid scrutiny of its actions and to perpetuate itself in power, for example, by altering the electoral law. This sounds anything but a ‘very moderate and reasonable’ proposal to me. My own viewand the term of this government so far has driven this point home very strongly for me-is MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Ministerial Statements
244,Mr Organ (Cunningham) (7.55 P.m.),"On8 October this year, the Prime Minister rethat the Senate provides a crucial stopper, preventing the complete power of one political perspective from dominating our Australian democracy. PeopleI have spoken to in my seat of Cunningham have expressed similar concerns and see the PM’s moves as an attack on the very heart of our democracy. Proposals from any government must be moderated when they are too extreme. The Senate prevents one party or a coalition of parties of one particular political persuasion from completely dominating with their legislative agenda. As has been demonstrated by research carried out by the Australian Greens, the Howard government has never received more than 47.2 per cent of the vote at a general election and usually very much less than that in the Senate. The most extreme legislative plans of the government have been moderated by the Senate, and I am sure many Australians have been very relieved by this. We live in a community where we accept and embrace a plethora of opinions. We embrace diversity. To effectively remove the power of different voices who have been legitimately elected to represent Australians of a variety of persuasions flies in the face of the Australian democratic tradition. Howard’s way would effectively enable one political persuasion to dominate and would diminish the power of Australians to determine whom they want representing their views. It would prove a savage blow to our assurance of a workable, lively democracy. The Prime Minister has stated: I make the point that when you are looking at the behaviour of the Senate, or sections of the Senate, you do not look at the number of government bills that have been passed; you look at the number of important government bills that have been passed. Of course, most legislation numerically described is passed by the Senate without demur, because most legislation is uncontroversial and does not produce any kind of political divide within the Australian community. Here, the Prime Minister is talking about the creation of a political divide within the Australian community. The Senate ensures that a variety of political views must be considered when legislation is presented to the Australian parliament, and no political party will dig their heels in unreasonably, because of the electoral disadvantage that they will necessarily endure come the next election if they do so without reasonable political justification. At present, different sections of the Australian community are represented in the Senate and in this House, ensuring that one political persuasion cannot dominate. In a democracy they should not be entitled to. It is precisely the exacerbation of the political divide-that is, a situation where one side of the political divide is able to dominate completely-that the Senate currently guards against. The Greens are firmly opposed to the Prime Minister’s plan to take away the legitimate power of one of our houses of parliament, and we will fight this plan in the community and ensure that the Australian people are aware that the Prime Minister wishes to deal a perhaps fatal blow to our assurance of democratic representation. I was fascinated to read a paper presented by Senator Helen Coonan, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, at the Australian Davos Connection Leadership Conference held on Hayman Island on 23 August 2003. This paper, I believe, best outlines the government’s underlying aims and objectives with regard to their proposal for Senate reform. In her speech Senator Coonan presented a very sound justification for the existence of an unfettered house of review in our federal parliament. She said: Let there be no mistake. An efficient and hard working Senate, scrutinising, criticising and examining legislation and keeping the government accountable, is a great institutional safeguard for all Australians. MAIN COMMITTEE It is no surprise that Senator Coonan blotted her copybook somewhat by then drifting into emotive bleating about obstructionism. Apparently, for Senator Coonan sometimes the Senate does its job and sometimes it does not. On the one hand, it is an essential institution but, on the other hand, it is at times a pesky obstruction. I guess it just depends on whether you are in government or not. Senator Coonan stated: But when the Senate crosses the line and acts as an obstructional competitor to the democratically elected government of the day, frustrating or substantially delaying urgently required responses to national problems or insisting on its own policy, it is no longer a House of review but a House of obstruction. This sounds very much like a subjective critique rather than a reasoned opinion. It sounds like the senator is having two bob each way. Or perhaps she is just following orders from the Prime Minister in order to support an unsupportable position. The Prime Minister was very keen to argue when he spoke to his constitutional reform paper in the chamber that this was not about the minor parties and that he did not wish to curb their power in any way, because that would be undemocratic. He said: The first point I would make is that these proposals do not represent an attack on the powers of the Senate. They do not represent an attempt to remove the fundamental role or the fundamental influence of the Senate within the Australian bicameral system of government, nor are they an attempt to extend the power of the executive. There is nothing in these proposals that represents any attempt to extend the power of the executive, nor do these proposals represent an attack on the minor parties or on the Independents. This is all very interesting in the context of what Senator Coonan had to say to her friends on Hayman Island back in August-or perhaps the government has got its wires crossed. Senator Coonan stated: The reforms that have been implemented have only been achieved with the support of minor parties or independents. This provides minor parties, who command only narrow electoral support with the opportunity to exploit the balance of power and to renovate the legislation to better reflect their own policy preferences. So there you have it-the government’s agenda is clear: limit the power of the minor parties and the Independents. And yet Mr Howard, in his speech on this ‘Resolving deadlocks’ discussion paper, said: We can make partisan comments about this, and no doubt they will be made, but I do think this is important if we are to achieve any sensible change in something-and this is pretty modest. We are not dealing with overturning 100 years of ingrained practice. We are just recognising that, in the modern reality, the public wants to elect small parties and Independents into the Senate and we must respect that wish. I think the worse thing would be for the major parties to gang up and try to change the system to squeeze out the small parties. That would draw very deep resentment in the Australian community. I totally agree; any attempt to minimise the influence of the minor parties and the Independents would draw a deep resentment from the Australian community. Based on his own comments, we hear that the Prime Minister is deeply committed to preserving democracy and the wishes of the people. But actions speak louder than words, and the Prime Minister’s actions in presenting this discussion paper suggest just the opposite. Realistically, I wonder what real power minor parties and opposition parties will have if the government can request the Governor General to hold a joint sitting whenever there is a gridlock. As the Prime Minister has said: MAIN COMMITTEE Let us be realistic about these things. You need realism when it comes to constitutional reform. That is the most important ingredient of all. We all know that politics is ultimately about numbers. If the opposition parties cannot effect a vote, they will not get a say. The government is being either grossly naive or grossly manipulative in suggesting that their presence will matter under its proposed Senate reforms. I would say it is more likely to be the latter. Opposition, Independents, minor parties: it would not matter under these proposed reforms. What this proposal is really about is curbing the power of the Senate and ensuring that the government has no opposition in implementing its current reforms that it cannot presently get through the Senate. The government is hedging its bets. The government thinks it has a good chance of winning the next election and wants a mechanism whereby it can get all its legislation through anyway, even if it does have a hostile Senate. This is another example of the government’s predictable, short-sighted political manipulation for its own political ends. In summary, over time it is crucial that our parliamentary system be allowed to evolve and not be undermined as the current government is attempting to do via these possible amendments to section 57 of the Australian Constitution. The Australian Greens will campaign strongly against the government’s Senate reform proposals and we encourage the opposition to do so as well. In closing, I would just like to reiterate a comment I received from one of my constituents while discussing this ‘Resolving deadlocks’ issue and plans to weaken the power of the Senate. As he said to me, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’ paper on possible changes to section 57 of the Australian Constitution, which was presented to the parliament in October, is a transparent attempt to stem the tide of alternatives that, as the major parties would say, have infected our parliamentary system in recent years. I would say it has refreshed our parliamentary system. We have seen the arrival of the Independents and minor parties-particularly the Independents-in numbers in the state legislatures around the country in recent years. We also see that trend continuing. In fact, votes for candidates who are not members of the major parties consistently sit at about 21 per cent of the vote for the House of Representatives at a federal level and at about 30 to 33 per cent in the state legislatures. That is surely saying something. The Australian people are looking for those long-term alternatives. They have found them in the Senate, where that house best represents the kaleidoscope of the Australian electorate in all of its variations of political pursuit these days. They are looking for that sort of representation, and they are securing and cementing it. They do not want it tampered with. If either of these so-called models-the PM’s model or the Lavarch model-were put to the Australian people, they would be rejected outright. Even with a coalition of the willing of the Labor and coalition parties out there spending millions of dollars promoting one or the other of those models they would be rejected, because the Australian people want their Senate to be a house that has not only a review role but a veto role if the circumstances warrant it. Once, while in opposition, the Prime Minister said-and no doubt other opposition leaders of any colour have said-that the mandate view of politics is a nonsense, or some words to that effect. Of course the mandate view of politics is a nonsense. The Australian people in this modern age do not accept that the two-party model is the only model or that the side that wins MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Ministerial Statements
245,Mr Andren (Calare) (8.08 P.m.),"This document, Resolving deadlocks: a discussionthe lower house has an absolute mortgage on common sense and its list of policy options are to be adopted without question because of some mandate which is cobbled together in this day and age by a reluctant allocation of preferences from, in many cases, people who are forced to see their vote trickle down to the options which they least want-the major parties. The Australian people do not accept that that in some magic way delivers a mandate to a party that may enjoy at best 37, 38 or 39 per cent of the vote. What a nonsense to argue then that the upper house, the Senate, is blocking and rejecting the will of the Australian people. The winner take all days are over. Let it sink in. Let the major parties ponder that: the winner take all days are over. There has to be a realisation that not only is proportional representation attractive to the electorate for the Senate, but people want it more and more when they understand its processes in their people’s house-the House of Representatives. They realise too, more and more, that democracies around the world, apart from those that grew out of the British model, have proportional representation. The critics throw up the Italian argument and talk about 55 governments since the war. Let us look at some of the other governments that deliver democratic outcomes in Europe, such as Switzerland and others. Why do we need an opposition or a Senate if the mandate is to be realised unchallenged? The PM said that the mandate view of politics is a nonsense. I wonder whether he holds to that now. I suggest that the proposed changes included in this document would completely override the will of the founding fathers, for they wanted a balance between the people’s house and the Senate. So it is not a problem of the Constitution that we should be debating; it is a problem of the parties and the lack of a conscience vote-the tight control of those party members. A person came up to me at a function in Orange the other day-I will not put his name on the record, but he is a very prominent member of a prominent party who was once a candidate-and said, ‘Thank GodI didn’t win. I could never sit down and not be able to cross the floor, because for one I would want to vote against the full privatisation of Telstra.’ He said, ‘I can appreciate what you have been saying for these seven or eight years’. It was all of a bit of a mystery trip to me when I got in and started looking at this thing and realised that people were absolutely fed up with the party structure and that they wanted that choice-and they are going to want it more and more. That is particularly showing up in our state legislatures. Let us look at just a few of the points in the document. There is this complaint: ... the election of an even number of senators at a half-Senate election, combined with proportional representation, has meant that it is virtually impossible for a government to obtain a majority in the upper house, no matter how large its majority is in the lower house. I weep for the major parties over that point! What about Telstra? What about the GST? What mandate was there for them? Yet a mandate is argued, and the Senate somehow is obstructionist! WhatI would love to see is a cross-bench in the lower house, like in those European parliaments and like New Zealand has now. My orchardists, who once were rusted-on National Party members, are now confronted by the realities of free trade agreements and globalisation impacts which may mean they will have to dismantle their quarantine protections. We have had an ongoing struggle with New Zealand for many years over the fire blight issue, and that surely will also be on the table for debate, and perhaps we will have to water down the restrictions that keep that dreaded disease out of our apple and horticultural industries. But members of the major parties seem to be compliant to-and I see them succumbing to-the forces of MAIN COMMITTEE the agenda that insists that we give away those trade advantages and those very real and important protections for our industry. HereI have my orchardists, once rusted-on but no longer National Party supporters; at the other end of the spectrum, we have the Berlei workers of Lithgow, who for generations worked in that factory, only to see their jobs exported to Indonesia-and for what purpose? To improve the dividends to the shareholders, not to improve the price of undergarments-not that I buy many foundation garments-for the people who wander into your Grace Bros or wherever. Indeed, they are dearer than they were when they were made in Lithgow. These guys in Lithgow and my farmers in Orange are soul mates now. They know they have not got an answer from their political representation over the years that has answered at least those most basic of concerns. That is why they are fed up. That is why they are voting for not only a check and balance but a watchdog that will toss out, revolt against and reject legislation that has not got a mandate. They know it is a nonsense to talk about that. Get real. This is the new reality of modern politics. The report talks about experiences in the last century when section 57 has been invoked and has not worked. But the deadlock dissipated with the change of government in several cases, and in other cases the legislation was not even reintroduced. So how serious was the government of the day in bringing on that double dissolution? The fact that after a double dissolution the government has been defeated three times and a bill passed only once shows that the will of the people was not being reflected by that bill, and that a double dissolution was in fact called for. The double dissolution, as we have it now, is an option for the government of the day. But to argue that we should have a double sitting automatically, in any form, even after a general election, is not what I believe the people of this nation want. They are happy with the system as it stands in the upper house. It is the representative kaleidoscope of the electorate. They are happy with that. That is why we have the Independents. That is why we have the One Nation representation-because they got eight per cent of the vote at one point. If they get 30 per cent of the vote on the back of Pauline Hanson’s martyrdom, so be it. Let them prove themselves in the House and get tossed out if they do not prove themselves. Why do these glorious parties that have been around for 30, 40 or 100 years believe that they have the mortgage on democracy in this place? They do not, and the people realise it. What the people do want is for proportional representation to show up more and more in their representation in the people’s house. I know that the member for Cunningham is working on a piece of legislation that will call for a royal commission into proportional representation for both houses of parliament. I do not expect much support for that out there in ‘politics land’, but I tell you there will be a lot of support out there in ‘voter land’ for it. Unless we reconnect with the voters who want that sort of mandate recognised, we will just muddle on and see documents like this-aimed at doing nothing more than shoring up a declining vote. This is a panic document; it is not a democratic discussion document. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 8.21 p.m. MAIN COMMITTEE The following answers to questions were circulated: National Security (Question No. 1295) Mr Rudd asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) Further to his comments of 1 December 2002 about Australian support for a doctrine of preemption against somebody that he believed was going to launch an attack against Australia, is it the Government’s view that Iraq is going to launch an attack against this country. (2) Is it the Government’s view that a terrorist organisation supported by Iraq is going to launch an attack against this country. (1) and (2) The Government’s reasons for action against Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq have already been extensively explained. Telstra: Infosys Technologies (Question No. 2386) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 11 September 2003: (1) Can the Minister confirm reports in the Herald-Sun on 9 September 2003 to the effect that Telstra has redirected a $15 million contract to the Indian IT provider Infosys that will have the effect of sending up to 180 existing IT jobs at IBM Global Services offshore to India. (2) Was the Government aware in advance of this move by Telstra. (3) Can the Minister confirm that Indian workers at Infosys are paid $40,000 per annum less than their Australian counterparts. (4) Is the Minister able to inform the House about Infosys’ comparative Occupational Health and Safety standards. (1) Telstra has advised that it recently approved a group of IT applications currently supported by $15m per annum. I am unable to advise where Infosys employees undertaking this contract will be located. Telstra earlier advised the market that it has commenced a strategic restructure of its IT services to introduce a new operating model aimed at consolidating and integrating its IT systems and operations to achieve greater efficiencies and improved services and products from its IT providers.

(3) Can the Minister state categorically that all Telstra’s service performance statistics over the past three year’s are accurate. provided by Telstra and the Australian Communications Authority (ACA), is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes, the allegations have been investigated. Telstra has advised that it is unaware of any basis for these allegations and is disappointed that these allegations can be made in the absence of any supporting evidence, particularly as they in effect question the values of some of its staff. Telstra has since responded to crikey.com calling for evidence to support these allegations which Telstra characterises as union driven and without basis. Telstra has indicated that it believes that there are no systemic problems in the accuracy of its service reporting and that any individual training or compliance issues would be identified and addressed by the regular audits on field service conducted by Team Leaders and Managers. Telstra has advised that its field staff have never had the ability to input a job (service restoration or installation) into Director Telstra’s Work Management Field Despatch System. Telstra has indicated that new fault repair jobs received are input initially into Telstra’s Service Plus order receipt system for any necessary line qualification or testing prior to them being input into Director. It is not possible for field staff to somehow input a customer's job into Service Plus and direct that job back to them via Director for their action. Fault volume analysis shows that variations in fault levels prior to, during and after the implementation of FuturEdge (Connect) Telstra’s latest Work Management System are well within seasonal variations that Telstra plans for. Further, Telstra has advised that there is simply no incentive for field staff to create ‘fake’ jobs. Telstra field staff do not have a quota of Customer Service Guarantee (CSG) jobs that they are expected to complete or get measured on. Telstra has indicated that all CSG jobs are linked to a customer telephone number, and that systemic abuse or inaccurate reporting on CSG volumes would become evident in audits Telstra conducts from time to time and the compliance and governance arrangements Telstra has implemented regarding CSG reporting. For example, if Telstra staff created a fake CSG connection order, an actual Telstra customer would receive a connection charge. In the case of service faults, the test desk process used to confirm the nature of the fault would highlight any false reporting. Systemic abuse would also be detected through other Telstra systems and process including customer complaints and compliance training audits. (3) All monitoring and performance processes are subject to human error, and it is impossible to categorically state that such a complex procedure is fault free. Telstra has indicated that it performs approximately 2.8 million CSG jobs each year. At various points in the CSG process human intervention is required.

248,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question, based on informationinput errors may occur, however the level of human error is minute and any systemic abuse, as alleged in the crikey.com article, would become evident to Telstra customers, Telstra’s internal reporting, and the ACA. Telstra has advised that its performance and reporting is subject to an extremely high level of scrutiny from the ACA, ACCC, TIO, Senate Committees and numerous inquiries and is supported through internal audits, checks and compliance reporting systems. Telstra has indicated that its reporting systems continue to evolve in response to changing regulations, technologies and market conditions. For example, in 2003 Telstra had to modify existing reporting systems to accommodate the new measures of Priority Assistance reporting, NRF and CSG Extreme failure. It is illogical to claim that Telstra’s older Director system is ‘inaccurate’ when it had not been designed to report on these new measures. In its role as the industry regulator, in addition to regular monitoring of data received from telecommunications providers, the ACA has undertaken a program of audits to verify industry performance data, test compliance with statutory obligations and assess the operational and recordkeeping practices of carriers in their implementation of CSG performance reporting. Specific performance audits include: Telstra data relating to its Priority Assistance for Individuals Policy (report completed); use of CSG exemption notice provisions by Telstra and Optus (report completed); interim and alternative services, (currently being scoped); and CSG data (currently being scoped). Telstra: Mobile Services (Question No. 2421) Ms O’Byrne asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: In respect of Telstra Pre-Paid Mobile services, is the Minister aware that customers have had difficulties accessing the network when the network is busy; if so, (a) when and how was the Minister advised of the problem, (b) what is the total number of reported instances of this problem, (c) what is Telstra doing to fix this problem, (d) what is the projected cost of addressing this problem, (e) how much has Telstra expended to date on addressing this problem, (f) when does Telstra expect that they will have this problem resolved in all areas, and (g) since the problem was discovered, which ten electoral divisions have reported the highest incidence of this problem as a percentage of all Telstra mobile telephone customers in those electoral divisions. Telstra advises that mobile networks are designed to ensure that sufficient capability is available to handle all reasonable traffic demand. Telstra advises that it has introduced special promotions, such as a 1 cent per minute promotion on the Communic8 Pre-Paid Mobile plan, in order to better utilise the network during periods when traffic is light, such as in the late evening and early morning. Telstra further advises that the promotion has been popular and resulted in network congestion during the peak period of the promotion between 9pm and 11pm. Telstra informs me that the terms and conditions of the promotion state that the offer is subject to network availability. (a) Telstra advised me of the problem in response to this question on notice. (b) Telstra advises that from time to time it receives complaints regarding congestion during promotional periods on the prepaid platform. Where it receives a complaint, Telstra examines network capacity in the area to ensure that it is sufficient to handle reasonable demand.",165,Questions On Notice
249,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(c) Telstra advises that it continually monitors mobile network performance to ensure a high standard of network availability and call quality and, where necessary, upgrades its network to meet increasing call demands, as part of its normal network management practices. (d) Telstra advises that the projected cost of network upgrades in 2002/03 and 2003/04 is $19.5 million. (e) Telstra informs me that it spent nearly $10 million on network upgrades to its prepaid platform in 2002/03 and that it expects to allocate a further $9.5 million in 2003/04. (f) Telstra advises that its network capacity has recently been increased in Queensland and Tasmania, with further works planned in Victoria and New South Wales. Telstra reiterated that it upgrades the network as required, to meet increasing call demands. (g) Telstra advises that it cannot disaggregate customer complaints by electoral division, as its systems are not configured in this way. Government Departments: Legal Services (Question No. 2466) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 17 September 2003: Further to the answers to questions Nos 1620 to 1635 and 1637 (Hansard, 12 August 2003, page 18283) what are the Chief Executive Officers of the Minister’s departments and agencies doing to ensure that they do not retain the services of any barrister or solicitor who has previously been made bankrupt. Austrade’s legal department would only engage a barrister or solicitor via external law firms engaged to conduct Austrade business. External firms would discuss the suitability of any such engagement and alert Austrade to any matter that may prevent Counsel from properly representing the interests of the Commission. Government Departments: Legal Services (Question No. 2472) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: Further to the answers to questions Nos 1620 to 1635 and 1637 (Hansard, 12 August 2003, page 18283) what are the Chief Executive Officers of the Minister’s departments and agencies doing to ensure that they do not retain the services of any barrister or solicitor who has previously been made bankrupt. With the exception of the Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO), agencies in the Environment Portfolio normally use the services of solicitors employed by, and engage counsel through, the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) which has policies and procedures in place in respect of the engagement of suitable counsel. These policies and procedures accord with Commonwealth policy which is directed toward ensuring that Departments and agencies do not engage counsel who use insolvency as a means of avoiding tax.

(2) In what year was the money paid to the City of Greater Bendigo and for what purposes. (3) Has the Commonwealth undertaken to pay the City of Greater Bendigo the $2 million originally promised for the development of the Bendigo Art Gallery; if so, when will this sum be paid. the honourable member’s question: (1) to (3) The Australian Government was to provide $2 million to the Bendigo Art Gallery but when the Council advised that the money was not required for the Gallery it was, at their request, directed to the Bendigo Performing Arts Centre. To date, $500,000 has been paid to the Council under the terms of the Deed of Grant signed on 23 May 2001. The first payment of $200,000 was made on 24 May 2001 and the second payment of $300,000 was made on 5 July 2001. However, in May 2003, the Council advised that the project was to be abandoned due to significant escalation in costs. The Council requested that $1.5m of the grant be used to upgrade the existing Capital Theatre and $500,000 be put towards meeting costs associated with the abandoned project. The Council has been advised that it can use $1.5m of the grant to upgrade the existing theatre. However a decision on contributing to costs of the former project will not be made until advice is received on the Victorian State Government’s willingness to also contribute to those costs as it was a partner in the project. The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in consultation with the Bendigo City Council, is now preparing a new grant deed in relation to the upgrade of the existing theatre. Payments will be made in accordance with the agreed schedule of works. An initial payment will be made within 28 days of the Date of the Deed and it is anticipated that the greater part of the funds will be paid before the end of the 2003-04 financial year. Subject to work progressing in accordance with the schedule, all payments will be finalised by July 2004. Environment: Solar Power (Question No. 2537) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 7 October 2003: (1) Is the Government examining the implementation of a national solar cell policy for the installation of solar cells in all new buildings. (2) Is the Government aware that the world’s largest photovoltaic manufacturing plant has recently been completed in Spain using Australian developed technologies; if so, is he able to say why developers were forced overseas in order to commercialise this product. (3) Does the Government support the establishment of a photovoltaic manufacturing plant in Australia; if so, what action if any is the Government taking to encourage the mass production of consumer grade solar cells in Australia. (4) Has the Minister investigated the potential for solar cells to be installed on Australian roofs. (5) Is it the case that the principal challenges facing traditional solar cell farms are the transportation and storage of electricity and that these issues are overcome by installing solar cells on roofs.",167,Questions On Notice
252,Mr Williams,"The Minister for the Arts and Sport has provided the following answer to(6) Has the Government conducted any estimates of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions which could be saved in Australia through the widespread installation of solar cells on buildings; if so, what is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions which could be prevented in this way. (1) The Australian Government is supporting renewable energy through a combination of incentives, however building regulation is the responsibility of State and Territory Governments. (2) The Government is aware of BP Solar’s facility in Spain that utilizes Saturn photovoltaic cell technology developed by the University of New South Wales. The right to manufacture cells using this technology was purchased by BP Solar, a multinational company, that chose to deploy the technology in their plant in Spain. The Australian Government does not seek to impose restrictions on the sale of Australian-developed photovoltaic technologies. (3) There is already a photovoltaic manufacturing plant in Australia, and three pilot manufacturing plants have been supported by Government grants. The Australian Government recognizes the importance of building a robust high growth renewable energy technology industry with strong export potential. A number of Australian Government programs support the growth of renewable energy in Australia. The Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) was introduced in April 2001 requiring electricity retailers to source an additional 9500 Gigawatt hours per year of new renewable energy by 2010. Also over $300 million is being provided through grant programs to support the commercialization of technologies, standards, training and utilization of renewable energy. For example, a remote property can receive up to 50% rebate on the cost of solar power, a suburban home can receive up to $4000. To date $11,222,000 in grants have been approved to commercialize Australian solar photovoltaic technologies. (4) The Government is supporting the installation of solar power systems on Australian roofs through the range of measures outlined in (3) above. (5) No. Solar farms are not necessarily located in remote areas where transportation of electricity may be an issue. (6) No specific study has been undertaken, however, the Renewable Energy Regulator who determines the credits given to renewable energy generators under the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target, has deemed that 1 kilowatt (peak) of solar panels installed on a roof will generate between 1.185 and 1.622 megawatt hours of electricity per year depending on the part of the country where the solar panels are installed. Each kilowatt (peak) photovoltaic system would thus abate up to 2.0 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year, depending on the system’s location and the emissions intensity of the electricity it was displacing, with the maximum abatement achieved by displacing brown coal or diesel generated electricity. Environment: Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Environment Policy (Question No. 2538) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 7 October 2003: (1) Was the Department of Environment and Heritage consulted in the preparation of environmental guidelines for projects supported by the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC). (2) Is the Minister satisfied that the environmental guidelines approved in 2000 are adequate to ensure the environmental sustainability of projects supported by the EFIC. (3) Is the Minister aware of the proposed Sepon Copper and Gold Mine in Laos and the EFIC’s planned role in granting political risk insurance for this venture. (4) Does the existing national environmental legislative framework in Laos meet the EFIC environmental guidelines.",168,Questions On Notice
253,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) Does the impact of the proposed new project on water quality and fisheries satisfy the environmental guidelines. (1) The Department of the Environment and Heritage provided a submission as part of the general consultation for the development of Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) Environment Policy. (2) EFIC’s Environment Policy is based on the World Bank Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook, which is aimed at ensuring environmentally sustainable development. I understand that EFIC Environment Policy is widely recognised internationally as being among the most stringent of any export credit agency. (3) Decisions by EFIC are not subject to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. I was therefore unaware of the Sepon project at the time of the question. EFIC has since advised that both the gold and copper developments at the Sepon project have undergone a comprehensive assessment process in accordance with the World Bank’s Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook. Further, EFIC sought and considered public comment on the gold project environmental assessment documentation before approving the EFIC facility for the gold development, and is currently providing public access to environmental impact documentation associated with the copper development. (4) EFIC’s Environment Policy sets out a regime for the identification, assessment and mitigation of any significant environmental impacts of proposed transactions for which an EFIC facility is sought. The assessment undertaken by EFIC examines the impacts of the particular development project, not the adequacy of the legislative framework in the relevant country. (5) I have been advised by EFIC that the gold project as proposed was in compliance with the World Bank Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook that underpins EFIC Environment Policy, including in relation to water quality and fisheries, and that EFIC has put in place facility conditions that will be monitored by EFIC for the duration of the EFIC facility. Trade: Free Trade Agreement with United States (Question No. 2549 amended) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 7 October 2003: (1) Does he have any involvement in the discussions or negotiations surrounding the proposed Australia-US Free Trade Agreement. (2) Is it the case that the proposed agreement contains a dispute settlement mechanism enabling any proposed investor to take action against any Australian environmental law which restricts trade. (3) Would such a provision diminish Australian sovereignty and, in particular, diminish Australia’s capacity to protect its environment. (1) I have been working with my Ministerial colleagues on aspects of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement as appropriate. My Department is working closely with officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on relevant elements of the proposed Australia-US Free Trade Agreement. (2) No such mechanism has been tabled in the negotiations on the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement, although the US has foreshadowed they will be putting such a mechanism forward for negotiation shortly.

(2) What was the expenditure on family day care centres in 2002-2003. (3) What was the level of Commonwealth funding for each of the family day care centres in the electoral division of Prospect in 2002-2003. (4) Is the Government aware of analyses that estimate the return on Government investment in child care is twelve times the value of expenditure allocated; if so, will he guarantee that funding for family day care will not be reduced or abolished. (1) Total expenditure on child care in 2002-03 was $1692 million. (2) The total amount of Commonwealth child care broadband funding paid to family day care services in 2002-03 was $67 046 306. The amount of Child Care Benefit (CCB) expenditure paid to families using family day care services in 2002-03 was $243 874 074. This amount excludes CCB received as a lump sum payment and is based on pre-reconciliation amounts paid to families during the financial year. It does not take into account Centrelink CCB advance/acquittal processes to services. (3) There was one family day care service operating in the electoral division of Prospect in 2002-03. The amount of Commonwealth child care broadband funding received by this service in 2002-03 was $438 820. The amount of CCB expenditure paid to families using this service in 2002-03 was $1 695 356. This amount excludes CCB received as a lump sum payment and is based on prereconciliation amounts paid to families during the financial year. It does not take into account Centrelink CCB advance/acquittal processes to services. (4) The Government is aware of this analysis. It was undertaken by a Departmental official and the findings were presented to the Australian Early Childhood Association Conference Children The Core of Society on 13 July 2003. The Australian Government is committed to child care and has maintained an unprecedented $8 billion allocation over the four years to 2006-07. This amount has substantially increased in recent years, particularly with the introduction of CCB on 1 July 2000 and now supports an unprecedented 759 000 children using care. The Government also recognises family day dare is highly valued as a child care choice for many families and has provided it with long and substantial support. The Government continues to support family day care together with other forms of quality child care to meet the child care needs of families.

257,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s questions is as follows:(1) On1 October 2003 I received a letter from Mr Michael Fendley, Director, Victoria National Parks Association. Mr Fendley, on behalf of the Yorta Yorta Elders Council, provided me with a copy of the ‘River Red Gum forests – Our Natural Heritage’ fact sheet and an extract from the Riverina News ‘Red gum protection derailed’. (2) I have responded to Mr Fendley. In my response I referred to the listing of the Barmah-Millewa forests as wetlands of international importance listed under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. I indicated that the purpose of listing sites such as Barmah and Millewa forests under the Convention is to ensure their ‘wise use’ and to conserve their ecological character for future generations. At the time of listing, the Barmah and Millewa group of forests were managed for multiple purposes, including recreation, grazing, forestry, honey production and conservation. In designating these sites, the Australian, New South Wales and Victorian governments accepted that these practices were sustainable under the existing management regime. The forests provide a good demonstration of the Ramsar Convention’s ‘wise use’ principle and I am confident that, under current management arrangements, they are being managed in accordance with Australia’s obligations under the Convention. On 14 November 2003 the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, of which I am member, took an historic First Step decision to address the declining health of the River Murray system. One of the key elements of the First Step decision is a focus on maximising environmental benefits for six significant ecological assets, including the enhancement of forest, fish and wildlife values in the Barmah-Millewa forest. My Department will continue to work with the relevant management authorities, the community and the Barmah-Millewa Forum to ensure the forests are being managed appropriately. Fisheries: Management (Question No. 2585) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 13 October 2003: (1) Is he aware of a report by scientists from the University of Canberra and CSIRO Resource Futures which found that almost 60% of Australia’s fisheries are over-fished and that this could increase to 68% by 2020. (2) Is he able to say whether this assessment is correct. (3) Does the report identify the WA Snapper Fishery as being under particular threat. (4) What action is the Government taking to address the issue of over-fishing of these fisheries. (1) Yes, I am aware of the report. The report is entitled “Modelling Australia’s Fisheries to 2050: Policy and Management Implications” by Drs. R. Kearney, B. Foran, F. Poldy and D. Lowe. The report makes preliminary projections on the future status of fisheries and capacity to satisfy seafood supply demands to 2050. (2) As in any predictive modelling exercise the accuracy of the report depends on a great number of variables and availability of further data. The report findings are generally consistent with the overall assessment by the Commonwealth Bureau of Rural Sciences Fishery Status Reports 2003 on the current status of 70 principal species in Commonwealth fisheries. (3) There are a number of fisheries identified as of concern. The WA Snapper fishery is one example where increased attention is warranted in order to ensure sustainability of the resource.",171,Questions On Notice
258,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) Management of fisheries in Australian waters is the responsibility of the Commonwealth and the States. My Department is undertaking a comprehensive assessment program on the ecologically sustainable management of all Commonwealth managed fisheries and export State managed fisheries. These assessments address strict guidelines developed by the Commonwealth to meet the requirements of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Fisheries: Seabird Bycatch (Question No. 2633) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 14 October 2003: (1) In respect of the Longline Fishing Threat Abatement Plan for Albatross, (a) what has been the outcome of the targeted observer program, and (b) has the by-catch of seabirds during oceanic longline fishing operations been reduced. (2) Does the Government have estimates of the number of albatross killed by longline fishing for the years (a) 1998, (b) 1999, (c) 2000, (d) 2001, and (e) 2002; if so, what are the details. (3) Will he provide details of the resources involved in this program (eg. funding, staff and time etc) since 1998. (4) Why was there a delay between recognition of the Threat Abatement Plan Observer Program as a necessary action and the commencement of the program in September 2001. (5) When will trials of mitigation measures become standard practice. (1) (a) I understand that a routine observer program for pelagic tuna fisheries commenced in the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery, and Southern and Western Tuna and Billfish Fishery, in August 2003. Prior to this, there has been significant observer coverage south of latitude 30°S since 2001, primarily established to assist in development of seabird bycatch mitigation measures. An observer program has also been in place in the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Fishery since 2001, and the Antarctic Fishery operating around Heard and McDonald Islands since 2002. However as management of these fisheries and collection of fisheries data is a responsibility of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, your question should be addressed to the Minister for Fisheries, the Hon Senator Ian Macdonald. (b) The introduction of mandatory measures south of latitude 30°S, such as night-setting of longlines and retention of offal, the number of seabirds killed in Australia’s pelagic tuna fisheries will undoubtedly have been reduced significantly. (2) The introduction of measures outlined in the answer to question (1)(b) will have led to a reduction in albatross bycatch of around 90% since 1998. (3) If this question relates to the fisheries observer program, it should be addressed to the Hon Senator Ian Macdonald. (4) Implementation of an observer program for Australian pelagic longline fisheries was delayed pending the results of a trial of an underwater bait-setting chute. This device showed great promise as a seabird mitigation measure in initial trials, but failed to reduce seabird bycatch significantly when it was tested extensively. When this became apparent, the observer program was implemented. (5) Trials of mitigation measures are already a standard practice. The TAP provides for the trialling of new mitigation measures. The TAP advisory group is working to further develop effective approaches to minimise the capture of seabirds in longline fisheries.",172,Questions On Notice

Acquittal of investments against the commitment to spend at least $350m of Trust funds ‘directly on measures to improve water quality’ 1. In the 2001 election, the Prime Minister committed to spend at least $350 million of the Extension of the Trust directly on measures to improve water quality. 2. The Framework for the Extension of the Trust notes “investment under the Trust will be available for salinity and water quality measures across Australia, including NAP regions. At least $350 million of the Trust funds will be invested directly on measures to improve water quality”. 3. The Bilateral Agreements for the delivery of the Trust note that the joint Commonwealth State Steering Committees will identify expenditure against this commitment. National Water Quality Management Strategy (NWQMS) 4. The NWQMS provides a national framework under which all stakeholders can contribute to better water quality outcomes. The Strategy provides a consistent approach to water quality management through guidelines that promote a shared national objective while allowing flexibility to respond to regional and local differences. 5. The NWQMS defines water quality as “the physical, chemical and biological attributes of water that effect its ability to sustain environmental values”. Environmental values are the agreed ‘beneficial uses’ of water, and the NWQMS specifies five values, as follows:",173,Questions On Notice
260,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(i) Aquatic ecosystems (general ecosystems, production of edible fish, crustacea and shellfish; water associated with wildlife); (ii) Recreational water quality and aesthetics; (iii) Raw water for drinking water supplies; (iv) Agricultural water use (irrigation, livestock, farmstead water supplies); and (v) Industrial water use. 6. The guidelines under the NWQMS provide a set of scientific criteria for water quality to match each environmental value. The set of criteria that satisfy all of the environmental values selected for a particular water body become its water quality objectives. These objectives are the numbers to aim for in water quality management programs. 7. The states and territories have agreed to the approach to managing water quality, which includes the determination of environmental values and water quality objectives, set out in the NWQMS. Water Quality and Salinity 8. The National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAP) clearly distinguishes between salinity and water quality, as reflected in the two specific goals for the Plan: (i) to prevent stabilize and reverse trends in dryland salinity.... (ii) to improve water quality and secure reliable allocations for human uses, industry and the environment... 9. While salinity targets may be established as primary water quality targets (eg instream salinity concentrations) where the primary process driving deterioration in this aspect of water quality is dryland (ie non-agricultural induced) salinity, a distinction has been made between the issues by the Prime Minister. I SSUES 10. There is a clear expectation from the NH Ministerial Board that there will be periodic, and probably public, reporting against this commitment. 11. Operational guidelines are therefore required to assist in the acquittal of Trust investments against this commitment at all levels Envirofund, regional and national. 12. Given the number of managers overseeing Trust investments, there is a need to ensure that any guidelines are applied consistently by different managers, and across investment levels. 13. All Trust investment managers must assess their investments to determine whether or not the constituent activities (or parts thereof) can be acquitted against this commitment. 14. Where activities are identified as contributing to this commitment, both the assessment, and the subsequent level of funding acquitted, must be recorded on Program Administrator within 30 days of the Ministerial Board or relevant Minister approving the investment.

The screen that appears will have a section on the bottom called “Water Quality Commitment”. (ii) Select yes from the “Yes/No” drop down box. Each funding year with approved dollars will be automatically populated on the screen. (iii) Calculate the percentage of each years funding that you are attributing to directly improving water quality, and type this in the actual quantum of funding will then be automatically generated. Alternatively, if you know the exact quantum, you can put this directly into the relevant field. Save. (iv) Click on the “Assessment” tab and insert a new assessment.

Save. These instructions can also be found in the PA User Guide. 16. Review of assessments The activities identified as contributing to this commitment will be reviewed periodically by an expert group appointed by the AFFA / EA NRM Forum. 17. The expert group will also review the Assessment Advice from time to time, as appropriate. 18. Definitions Water quality is defined as “the physical, chemical and biological attributes of water that effect its ability to sustain environmental values”. 19. There are five environmental values (beneficial uses) as follows: aquatic ecosystems, primary industries, recreation and aesthetics, drinking water, industrial water and cultural and spiritual values. 20. Assessment criteria The marine or aquatic ecosystem and/or waterbody that will benefit from the water quality improvements arising from the Trust investment must be clearly identified. 21. The Trust funded activity (or part thereof) must contribute: (i) to directly improving one or more of the physical, chemical or biological attributes of the identified marine or aquatic ecosystem and/or waterbody; or (ii) to establishing specific management plans and baseline data for, and/or monitoring of, marine or aquatic ecosystems and/or waterbodies. 22. The projected water quality improvements must be ascertained with reference to: (i) the water quality objectives and associated environmental values identified through the (ii) marine and aquatic targets established in the accredited regional NRM plan under the National NRM Standards and Targets Framework: or (iii) management action targets which have a water quality output. 23. Water quality improvement activities The key question to be asked in ascertaining whether or not an investment contributes to this commitment is “will the investment bring forward a water quality output”? The following list is illustrative of activities which would be consistent with this commitment: (i) salts and nutrient discharge reductions from irrigation areas; (ii) acid and heavy metal discharge reductions from acid sulphate soils; (iii) sediment discharge reductions from river banks and streambeds; (iv) pollutant discharge reductions from industrial or urban areas; and (v) nutrient discharge reductions from agricultural activities (both intensive such as diaries and feedlots; and broadscale such as cattle ranching). 24. Typical water quality improvement projects include activities that: (i) prevent erosion and soil loss in actively eroding sites; (ii) repair and restore riparian vegetation; (iii) exclude stock from waterways; (iv) prevent discharges from oxidized acid sulphate soils; increase the area and water quality functions of wetlands; (vi) treat, reuse or recycle wastewaters from intensive agricultural or urban sources; (vii) implement effective treatment technologies for industrial point sources; (viii) implement water pollution source controls; (ix) implement water sensitive urban design practices; and (x) establish water quality baselines and monitor water quality. 25 NAP investments cannot be acquitted against this commitment. 26. Matching funding contributions from states and territories (as required under the Bilateral Agreements), and any other investment leveraged through Trust investment (for example from the private sector), cannot be acquitted against this commitment.",174,Questions On Notice
