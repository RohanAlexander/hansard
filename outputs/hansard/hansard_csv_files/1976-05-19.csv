112,Mr Brown,"Indeed, as my colleague the prepared to work and improve their positions.Treasurer together with the Bill, the investment There are a number of reasons why this should allowance is explained in all the necessary detail. be so. The first is the fact that there is much plant It is a wide-ranging scheme. As the House would and equipment which would otherwise be eliknow, in essence it is a taxation deduction of 40 gible under this scheme and which in fact costs per cent, or 20 per cent in the long term period, less than $500.1 think for instance of some of the of the cost of certain denned plant and equipmachinery that one would find used in small facment, purchased or leased and put to productive tories, such as spinning equipment. Quite often, use. As I have said, it is an attempt to restore even despite inflation over the last 3 years, it still investment confidence in the country. The costs less than $500. It would seem to me that honourable member for Reid and other honourthis is an area where more incentive should be able members on the other side of the House given to acquire plant and equipment costing less seem to have some doubts as to whether it will than $500. The second reason is that there are work. To cite one example of the way in which it many deductions which are claimed for taxation is already working I refer to a statement in the purposes which are very small indeed and cerAustralian Financial Review of 28 April 1976. It tainly much smaller than $500. The whole range is a statement of a report given by Mr Harry, who of taxation deductions is open to those who can is the chairman of Vickers Australia Ltd. He establish that the deduction has been incurred. praised the investment allowance that is being There is no normal $500 bottom limit so far as introduced by the Government for this reason: taxation concessions are concerned. It encourages us to give priority to a feasibility study to see I fail to be persuaded by the argument which I whether we should not compress into the next 3 years capital gather is advanced as to why there is a $500 expenditure on machine tools which would normally be limit, namely that of administrative convenience. made over the next 6 years. It is said, I understand, that there is an adminisAustralian engineering industry would benefit sigtrative difficulty in calculating the allowance on nificantly from such a program on our part, for we know items costing less than $500 and that for that from past experience that quite extraordinary productivity reason the limit should be $500.

It would seem to me no more That is the sort of sign that we want to see from difficult to calculate the allowance on items costindustry. It is the sort of sign that we will see from ing less than $500 than on items costing more. industry, more so when the investment allowThe other argument which I put forward quite ance becomes more widely known and when it is seriously-and I am sure Mr Deputy Speaker used by people to acquire, whether by purchase that you would have had the experience that or by lease, new plant and equipment, and when most other people have had-is that the taxation they start to put that to productive use. Commissioner himself is not renowned for ignoring items of income which happen to be small. InI said that like most programs this one is not fact these days there seems to be a concern to without blemish. I want to make some construcplace a very close scrutiny on all sources of tive comments about some of the defects in the income-al l items and heads of income-n o matscheme which I hope the Government will have ter how small they may be. It would seem to me a further look at with a view to amending or that if we are concerned with a situation as we changing them at some later stage after the are with taxation as it is in Australia where we scheme is in operation. The first is that when the calculate all sources of income then calculate all scheme was originally proposed by the areas of deductions, then what is appropriate so Treasurer, there was a bottom limit of $1,000, far as income is concerned is equally appropriate that is to say, plant and equipment costing less so far as deductions are concerned. Accordingly I than $1,000 would not be eligible for the investhope that the Government will have another ment allowance. A number of us on this side of look at this matter, if not before the legislation is the House who are concerned about the state of passed then at a later stage after the scheme has small business and concerned that there should been in operation for sometimeto see whether be more incentive and encouragement given to there is not some way of reducing the limit small business made representations to the further or indeed of abolishing the bottom limit Treasurer, as a result of which that $1,000 limit of $500.1 believe that to do so would be a very has been reduced to $500. There is a shading-in powerful incentive so far as small business is stage between the $500 and the $ 1,000 limit. But concerned. with respect, it would seem to me that there is a very strong case for abolishing the $500 bottom I mention another of the areas which I think limit altogether. I hope that the Government will should be looked at more closely. It is certainly consider this. an area which does not require amendment at this stage before the legislation is passed, but it is economy of the country as a result of that abolan area which should be looked at very closely ition. It must be very comforting to him to know indeed when the scheme is under operadon. That that this prediction, like a number of his predicis the very commendable provision of the Bill, tions on economic matters, have come true. Mr extending the investment allowance to plant and Deputy Speaker, I trust that you will convey this equipment which is leased rather than purchased to him when next you see him. The then Leader right out. It is a recognition of commercial reality of the Opposition said on that occasion: that these days companies and businessmen A funher disincentive directly affecting the manufacturing lease much plant and equipment rather than buy industry is the discontinuation of the investment allowance it straight out.

I put this very ance was just one illustration of the way in which seriously to the Treasurer who is not at the table the previous Government launched that wholethat the Government should give very close scrusale attack on the private sector. tiny to this matter to ensure that the scheme is implemented properly. Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence I should like to make a few brief remarks about an area of taxation which is not directly I return to one principal matter so far as the related to the investment allowance, but which is substance of the investment allowance is conrelevant because we are concerned with a Bill on cerned. The investment allowance has had a very income tax. The proposition that I would make chequered history. It has been introduced, it has in the very few moments left to me is that there been taken away and it has now been restored on are many areas of taxation which are in a more generous and long term basis. I venture to desperate need of urgent attention and reform. suggest that the predictions that were made by We are to introduce tax indexation, and that will the present Government when the investment albe of great benefit. But let us not fool ourselves lowance was abolished by the socialists have in that that is going to be a solution to many of the fact come true. In the Budget in 1973, the former problems and many of the hardships imposed by Treasurer, that is to say the most recent the present system and structure of taxation. The Treasurer's predecessor twice removed, announfirst matter that will have to be attended to is the ced that the investment allowance was to be iniquitous system of provisional income tax.

The present Speaker of the the system of provisional income tax.

It is very significant to the next appropriate occasion, a defence, if there read what the then Leader of the Opposition said is one, to this indefensible system of taxation. about the abolition of the investment allowance I want to give onefinalexample of the way in and the consequences that were in store for the which personal income tax is adversely affecting people. This afternoon I received a letter from a most politically dishonest Government that this constituent of mine who has a part-time teaching country has ever seen in the whole of its history. job.

Some individual Taiwanese and Japanese vessels may have been identified in more than one month or one area. Accordingly, to show total figures in each column for these boats would give a misleading interpretation of the total size of the fleets operating. However, every Indonesian fishing boat operating over the north-west shelf was boarded and identified, the total fleet size being 36. Notes(a) Indonesians are operating within the areas specified in the Memorandum of Understanding between Australia and Indonesia. (b) The figures for Japanese vessels identified combine data from surveillance reports with data of Japanese tuna long-liners entering Australian ports for replenishment purposes.
