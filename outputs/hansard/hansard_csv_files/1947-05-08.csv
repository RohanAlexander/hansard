3,Mr Pollard,"I shall refer the-complaints from farmers and produce merchants, because of their inability to -obtain adequate supplies of pollard and wheat for stock feed, mostly in the -dairying and pig-raising industries. Is the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture able to take action through his department with a view to alleviating the position? the honourable member has in. mind the position in Victoria. The output of bran and pollard in that State is at a very high level, but so is the demand, due. to the capacity of wheat farmers and poultry raisers to use this class of feed, because of the remunerative prices they are receiving for their products. I do nol know that anything can be done to overtake the shortage. During the war, under delegated national security powers, the Government of Victoria supervised the distribution of bran and pollard in order to ensure oriority of supplies to those who needed them most. Durinsr the debate on the financial statement, members of the Opposition clamoured for the removal of control primary production. In the circumstances, I am afraid that it would be impracticable for the State of Victoria to exercise control of the distribution of these products, as it did formerly. However, I shall be very glad to make an inquiry with a view to determining whether distribution can be accelerated. There may have been a temporary interruption of distribution during the recent unfortunate industrial disturbance in Victoria. the Prime Minister been drawn to the statement of the Commonwealth Statistician that, at the end of February last, 550,100 of' a total of 2,193,400 persons engaged in civilian' employment in Australia are on the Government payroll? If so, with respect to persons employed by the.Commonwealth .Government, is the right honoraible gentleman able to indicate the Commonwealth departments in which employment has increased since the end of the war, what, justification there has been for such increases, and what steps, .if any, are being taken to ensure that rigid economy shall be practised in the staffing of Commonwealth departments ? figures cited, but I heard references to the matter by the right honourable gentleman or some other honourable gentleman during the recent debate on the financial statement. I have had a report prepared on the subject showing the number of persons employed by the Commonwealth Government at the present time, as compared-with the peak period of the war, and showing also what has been done in regard to staffing in the various departments. It is a very long report. I would not like to embody it in Hansard, because it would involve too much work at the Government Printing Office, but I will make it available to the honourable member and to the press.

In regard, to Nuremburg Jews, I have established, in co-operation with the proper authorities, two committees to represent persons of partly Jewish blood. One of these committee's will concern itself with those who Britishers at Australia House for free profess the Protestant faith, while the other committee will represent Catholics. The committee' to represent the Protestants is in Melbourne and is presided over by Professor Woodrow, the secretary being Miss Margaret Holmes. The Catholic committee is located in Sydney, and the secretary is Mrs. J. Harcombe. I think the honourable member is misinterpreting the news item if he thinks that the Jewish people have been given advan-. tages over other persons of Christian faith who are partly of Jewish origin. Tliat, of course, would be a very un-Christiaii-like attitude to adopt. for Immigration. (1) How many British people have come to Australia since the cessation of war in the Pacific? (2) How many of these were new British migrants and how many migrants other than British came? (3) How many ex-service men and women who were British received their discharge in Australia? (4) How many allied servicemen received their discharges in Australia, and what were their nationalities? (5) How many applications from British people have been lodged in Australia House, London, by persons 'who wish to come to Australia? (6) What are the terms upon which British migrants can come to Australia in the future? member was good. enough to tell me that he intended to ask a series of questions on this subject. The number of British people' who came to Australia, between V-P Day and the 31st January, 1947, was 38,41.3. Thatfigureincludes temporary visitors and returning Australians. The number of new British migrants to come to Australia between V-P Day and the 31st January, 1947, was 22,274 and 2,605 foreign migrants, of whom about 700 were refugees, were admitted up to the 31st December, 1946. The number of British ex-service men and women who received their discharge in allied ex-servicemen who received their discharge in Australia was 917, of whom 812 were American and 105 Dutch. Approximately 196,193 applications have been lodged toy and assisted passages to Australia and for the right, as it were, to enter Australia of those willing to pay the fares of themselves and their dependants. There are two agreements with the United Kingdom under our migration schemes. One provides for free passages to Australia for suitable ex-service men and women of the United Kingdom armed forces and merchant navy, together with their dependants. Under that scheme, the whole of the passage money is paid by the United Kingdom Government as part of its rehabilitation scheme. There is also an assisted passage agreement whereby the approved migrant is obliged to pay: (a) £10 sterling if nineteen years of age or over, (6) £5 sterling if fourteen years and under nineteen years, and (c) nothing if under fourteen years of age. The difference between these rates and the amount charged by the shipping companies is met by the United Kingdom and Australian Governments. The actual amount paid by the governments varies on different ships inasmuch as the rates charged by the companies vary. 1 answered this question in this form because I did not desire to take up the time of the House by asking for leave to make a statement. honourable I have always understood that the time allotted for asking questions in the afternoon is an occasion when honourable members have the right to ask questions without notice, and that if questions are asked upon notice, they must be placed upon the notice-paper. Therefore, I ask you, Mr Speaker, at your convenience, to investigate whether a practice is to be introduced under which an honourable, member may give privately an intimation to a Minister of his intention to ask him a question, and the Minister subsequently produce a typewritten statement from which he reads the answer, I submit to you, Mr Speaker, that if this practice is",13,Immigration

There was a growing practice-and I have to admit that it was a growing practice before this Government took office-of Ministers making lengthy replies to questions asked the previous day. In view of that growing practice, 1 ruled that a Minister, in order to reply to a question asked the previous day or some period before, would have to obtain the permission of the House. In my long experience of this House, the practice has been for some honourable members to indicate to Ministers what they intended to'ask, and the Ministers would then give either a short or long reply. I do not think that there is anything to prevent an honourable member from doing that. In the Senate, it is the general custom to do so. It does not offend against any standing order.

I emphasize that Great Britain will not suffer as the result of the reduction of output referred to by the honourable member, because any wheat not shifted from Victoria for milling in New South Wales will be milled in Victoria, in which State there is sufficient capacity to process it. With regard to the latter part of the honourable member's question, some inquiries were made regarding the practicability of bringing wheat to New South Wales in hulks.

How many ships destined to carry food for Britain were delayed as a result of the Sydney waterfront dispute, what was their cargo capacity, and for what periods were their sailings delayed. 2. What effects will the engineers' dispute in Victoria have upon the shipment of flour and other food to Britaiu. 3. What delays to ships sailing to Britain have been caused in the last six months by labour shortages on Sydney wharfs? tions of that character involve a great amount of work and investigation. I am always reluctant to make promises that involve officials in weeks and weeks of work, particularly as honourable members complain about the number of people in the Public Service. However, I will with the Minister for Supply and Shipping examine the honourable gentleman's question to ascertain, whether it is possible to supply him with a reasonably short answer that does not require too much investigation. serious plight of Great Britain in respect of meat supplies, and to a statement in to-day's press by the British Minister of Food, Mr Strachey, that the shortage in the second half of 1947 will be worse than it is now. In the light of this situation,' I believe that the honourable member was will the Minister for Commerce and. Agriculture give to the House the information which, so far, he has persistently refused to give, as to the nature of the scheme submitted to him by the chairman of the Australian Meat Board, which,, in a prepared statement to the House on the 1st May, he said that he had endorsed, and to publicize which he had authorized the expenditure of government funds? This scheme, it was stated, called for the co-operation of graziers and stock-owners. Will the Minister tell the House in what manner the co-operation of graziers and stock-owners is sought, and what is expected of them? He has refused to answer the question on each occasion on which it has been asked. state whether the reason for his refusal is that there is no, practical scheme to announce; that the proposals under the scheme are of such an unfair and sectional character that he hesitates publicly to state them; or that he is so indifferent to the British people's food problems that he can treat with evasion and levity any request for information? viously drawn the attention of the honourable gentleman to his use of language that is not permissible. asking whether the Minister is so indifferent to the British people's food problem that he can consistently refuse to give information? different to the honourable member's stupidity. On a previous occasion, the nature of the answer that I .furnished to him was governed by my belief that he was fully aware of the scheme that had been propounded by the Australian Meat Board to assist Great Britain. The honourable gentleman knows full well that the graziers, backed by organizations of ex-servicemen in New South Wales, have, I refer to the agreed to co-operate with the Australian Meat Board in a scheme whereby graziers may consign their stock to works indicated by the board, aud that stock is to be . earmarked specifically for consignment to Great Britain at the ruling export prices. fully aware of that fact when he facetiously asked the questions that he submitted to me quite recently. about to ask is prompted by to-day's report that there is a. serious lag in the shipment of meat and other foods to Great Britain.

Information seen the statement of Mr Mungo MacCallum in last night's Sydney Sm, that when the honourable gentleman stated in Parliament on the 5th March last that no report had been submitted to him by Mr Ralph Foster, formerly National Film Commissioner, he had been misinformed, as the report was made tp the board when he wa? its chairman? Mungo MacCallum's further statement that if the Minister reads the report he will see that all is .far' from well with Australian propaganda film policy, that, Mr Foster never had the confidence of the officials in the Department of Information, and the fact that the Minister's advisers were keeping the report to themselves makes it certain that it was critical?

If the honourable member assures me that a report in my department is a very critical one, I shall certainly take early opportunity to examine it. There is nothing to hide about the activities of the board.

It was concerned more with opposing defence in Australia that with Hitler. Speakers' Notes for Lhe Communist Party (193S) on Conscription. This was printed by Forward Press, a printing business then owned by the Central Committee of the Communist party, through a nominee, and taken over in 1940 by the Government when the papers which it printed, were suppressed. In this document it was suggested that there was no danger from Japan and that the real objective of those who demanded -compulsory military training was to secure trained forces to aid the Imperialist aggressors of Britain to attack Russia. Another publication was Who Owns AvjitvaliaV This was a 64-page pamphlet of Communist propaganda directed against big Australian concerns, particularly those such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which assisted the defence of Australia to a material degree. It was part of the propaganda by which the Communists sought before the war to assure that if a crisis came this country would be defenceless.

He seems to have been the originator of the idea which led' to the Young Communist party changing its name to Eureka sent the whole literary output of Mr Rawling, as recorded in the Mitchell Library. His qualifications as an interpreter of the life of an Australian poet are entirely negative, since, for twenty years, he has been steeped in the viewpoint of Russian Communism. ' On the 26th March, 1947, 1 accordingly asked the Prime Minister a series of questions. I ask honourable members to note carefully their wording, because they constitute a. contradiction of everything that has been said about me in regard to this matter. The questions wereW ill the Prime Minister inform me whether Mr J. M . Bawling has been granted a fellowship valued at £400 by the Commonwealth Literary Fund, to write the life of the poet Charles Harpur? Is this Mr Bawling the same gentleman who was chief publicity officer of the Communist party for some years, and who wrote"" the Communist party's official history of Australia, which was published by the official Communist publishing house? What qualifications does Mr Bawling possess to write the life of Charles Harpur? Are his qualifications superior to those of recognized authorities on the poet who have no association with tlie Communist party? . W ill the right honourable gentleman lay upon the table of the House all recommendations, reports and papers relating to the granting to Mr Bawling of this fellowship?

I should be grateful if , in answering Sir Earle Page's questions, you would not dwell nn niy association with the Communist party, but be content to deny his allegations. I ask this because I and mine have suffered enough because of that association and feel that any further publicity will militate against my being employed again as a teacher in a G.P.S. after expiry of my fellowship.

My questions were not based on hearsay, but on the official records of the Mitchell Library, which I have since checked at the National Library, and Mr Rawling himself admits his past connection with the Communist party in his letter to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister replied to him on the 1st May, 1947, stating that he was aware that Rawling had been awarded a scholarship and that, in a question directed to himThe right honourable member for Cowper at Joust insinuated, if he did not directly say. that Mr Rawlins was a Communist or assoMinister's Department made inquiries.

I had supposed, and until to-day it had been thought, that all parties were in favour of this plan, and were carrying it out for the encouragement of Australian authors. I desire now to deal with the references .to Mr Rawling. The right honourable member for Cowper stated accurately the question which he had asked in the .House, namely, was Mr Rawling a publicit y officer of, or was he otherwise associated with the Oommunist party? The fact is that he had been associated w it h it There is no question of that. But the manner of his leaving the Communist party was a matter of such public, notoriety during the early stages of the est inquiry would have revealed to the right honourable gentleman the fact that, attacked Finland, Mr Rawling broke of its most bitter critics. I believe that it is f a i r to say that the CommunistNo. 1 enemy. now. In 1940 Mr Rawling made a broadcast over the national stations giving the reasons why he considered that he should dissociate himself from the Communist party and its war policy. Ever since Mr Rawling has been an active omission of that fact from the right honourable gentleman's question was calculated to cause very .irave in j u r y to Mr Rawling, who served in World WarI .",24,Cameron Let The Rest W F Flexmore Hudson Th E Writing Of A

56,Dr. Evatt,"It is what he saysChifley), he stated that he had been sympathetic with the experiment of Soviet Russia, had joined the Oommunist party and had been active in it. All that is correct. Mr Rawling also wrote certain material to which the right honourable gentleman has referred. Then, in May, 1940, he made a complete break with the Communist party, not privately or by resigning from it, but as the result of an open public controversy in which his articles appeared in leading metropolitan newspapers, probably throughout Australia and certainly in New South Wales. That raises the very important question which, after all, is the only point that does arise lowship on such .a subject? The right from the subject associated with the motion submitted by the right honourable member for Cowper. Should the fact that a person has strong political views, and has been a member of the Communist party, act as a perpetual bar against his being qualified to write on some aspect of Australian literature and history? authors are available. proving whether other qualified authors are available. That was not the contention of the right honourable member for Cowper. was preferred to other authors. the right honourable member for Cowper submitted is that Mr Rawling should be disqualified. If no other authors are available, and he is chosen, the same result is reached. The object of Commonwealth assistance to Australian authors is not to encourage political propaganda, but to foster good literature, and reward literary .merit. If the House agrees that that is the object of the fund, I contend that.the political views of the author do not and should not enter into the matter. Imagine what kind of a standard would have to apply if, in determining whether the fund should assist authors in Australia, we were obliged to make a preliminary investigation of the political views, past and present, of every candidate! Apply that to what is the chief glory of Englook back at the history of English literature, and at the great procession of poets and authors who have made the name of English literature famou; throughout the world, and apply a political test to them! The right honourable gentleman is carrying this matter further than I have ever heard it carried before. The book which Mr Rawling is to write is not a Communist publication, and will not have a seditious or subversive tendency. The man who is writing it has chosen a literary subject, namely, the life of the Australian-born poet, Charles Harpur. Is this author to be excluded from competing for a felhonorable gentleman's contention cannot be accepted as a principle. It is completely wrong. One has only to refer to great names in English literatureShelley, Byron, Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge, Robert Burns, the great Scottish poet, and William Blake, and ask oneself, "" If a literary fund had been in existence in their day how would they have scaled the first barrier?"" Tbese great men of genius, whom every body acknowledges to-day, wrote in the early portion of their careers under the influence of the Trench Revolution, and were somewhat sympathetic towards it. Wordsworth and Southey later became Poet Laureates of Britain. We cannot apply this rule of exclusion to people simply as persons. Yet that is what the right honourable member for Cowper is attempting to do. He admitted that Mr Rawling is not writing on the subject of communism, or present' political trends. There is nothing political in the biography of Charles Harpur. Why, then, should Mr Rawling be disqualified? If literary merit is to be encouraged, it should be encouraged as literature and not as propaganda. Political opinions have nothing to do with the matter. It would be different if we ""were considering a political work. That might be a relevant factor. When he makes, as a test of literary merit, conformity to political or social stand-points the right honourable gentleman is adopting the policy of the Hitler regime.

61,Dr. Evatt,"The contention whichMay, 1933, the Nazis decided to show that a new regime had been introduced into Germany under Hitle r and Goebbels. The occasion was celebrated by the burning of the books of 160 authors. The subject matter of the books did not mat'.er; the Nazis who burnt them had probably never read any of them. But the books had been written by people who, as persons, were regarded as antipathetic to the Nazi regime. Theyi n cluded some of the greatest German poets, such as Heine, and their works were burnt in a bonfire. One commentator wrote at the timeAnd as the ingenious ceremonies wore on hour after hour, before a crowd of fortythousand celebrants, the world outside may well have sensed that a new spirit, and a new age, had begun for Germany, an age of Brown Darkness. . . The .request for information by the right honourable, member has nothing whatever to do with this point. The fund is of a non-party character. If the political views of candidates are to be considered in relation to authorship, we shall have a new form of censorship which would be as intolerable as any the world has ever known. The works in the list to which I have referred include biographies of the Australian writers by Tom Collins, works by Ernestine H ill , Marjorie Clark, Marjorie Barnard and others. The new rule suggested by the right honourable member for Cowper, to the effect that the personal political opinions of applicants should be taken into account when considering the granting of fellowships, and not their purely literary work, would be so intolerable that I cannot believe that the right honourable gentleman himself would wish to see it applied. Sir Earle Page honourable gentleman that the honourable member for Parkes is well able to look after himself. What the right honourable member had to say in derogation of Mr Rawling was, in effect, that he had been a Communist, but it has also been f a i r l y and openly stated that he had broken with the Communist party publicly in circumstances in which the hatred of the Communists was being visited upon him. Mr Rawling, I understand, is carrying .on his work as a school teacher. He is a distinguished graduate of an Australian university, and has written historical works. Apparently he has excellent qualifications for a fellowship. He has been chosen to write the life of Charles Harpur. Sir Earle Page interjecting, right honourable member has changed his ground. The point now being advanced is not the issue that was raised between the right honourable member and the honourable member for Parkes. It was alleged, first, that Mr Rawling was a Communist, had engaged in. Communist propaganda, and had written Communist articles, and that, therefore, he was debarred from writin g a work of any value to Australia. I suggest to the House that there is no substance in that contention. If honourable members w ill examine the records of the authors and poets, of this country they w ill discover that very few of them could successfully withstand the application of such a test: Henry Lawson was associated with Australian workers and Australian unions in his early lif e and he wrote for the Australian Worker. Practically all the early poets who contributed to the Bulletin had strong radical tendencies, and some of them were even republican in their outlook at certain stages. Rawling is an Australian, as f a r as I know. My point, at the moment, is that the test that has been proposed by the right honourable member for Cowper would have, proved fatal even to Australian writers like Henry Lawson, and interjecting, some of the best of our writers of days gone by. for Balaclava shows, by his interjection, his incapacity for analysis. The point is whether a man's political views shall, or shall not, be taken into consideration, and in certain circumstances be regarded as disqualification for writin g on literary subjects insofar as' the Commonwealth Literary Fund is concerned.

72,Mr Archie Cameron,"I shouldI am not interested in .the case of Rawling.' If this man has "" seen the l i g h t ' ' , as the Attorney-General has suggested, there has been a lapse of seven years in which he has not produced one pamphlet to put in the Mitchell Library in contradiction of the stuff that he wrote previously. When a man finds that he has been following a wrong principle for a number of years and has been politir-ally converted, one naturally expects that, having "" seen the l i g h t "" , he w ill be prepared to give his testimony in writing, and let it go . on record alongside the misleading statements which he formerly made. This man has not done that. His good f a it h can be tested by his failure to do so. The Attorney General has asked whether the political views of an author should be taken into consideration. The Australian taxpayer has a very strong objection to providing money for the subsidizing of communism. [ contend that the views of a man who. writes a story on the life of Charles Harpur or anybody else w ill be coloured by whether he is a Communist or a tory, or has any other background. The Attorney-General has written a work entitled Labour Leader. He gave me a copy of it , for which I thank him. Can it be said that the right honourable gentleman would have described the l if e of Holmani n the terms that he has used in that work had he'not been a Labour man? Would the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) or the honourable member for Kew England( Mr Abbott) take the same view of Holman's life as has been taken by the Attorney-General? Would the honourable, member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) or the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adermann), if they became authors and wrote The History of the B u m Rebellion, adopt the same attitude towards it as has been adopted by the Attorney-General? It has been proved up to the hilt that immediately a man becomes an author his views of another man, whether that man be associated with literature, politics; science, industry or anything else, are coloured by that man's political outlook. My objection is, that the Commonwealth -Literary Fund is being used in too many instances by men who, if not -ed or pink, aire at any rate "" fellow travellers "". judges of the Arbitration Court whom the honourable gentleman's party appointed < arguing that for the moment. If the honourable gentleman cares to engage in this debate, he can say his piece in thespitfire fashion that he usually adopts.. He ought to have been a fighter pilot. Something has been said during the debate about the burning of books. I believe that the Attorney-General referred! to that matter. There have been notorious instances of the burning of books.' Adolf Hitler did not start the practice. The Attorney-General is sufficiently an historian to know that a good part of the great library of Alexandria was burned by Julius Caesar, and the rest of it by the first Mohammedan conqueror, who took the viewa very political viewthat if anything in -the Alexandria Library was in conflict with the Korani t was dangerous, and if any of it was in agreement with the Korani t was superfluous. On that point, I am giving to the Attorney-General a first-class cue as to the line that should be taken when it comes to an argument concerning dominion governors: There is no view except that of the man in authority. I close on this note: An y man can take a part in the writin g of articles. He can be a litterateur. He can write a play on' Eureka, or a work on the life of Charles Harpur;. but if his political views are such as have been disclosed today by the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page)-and disclosed under pressure, I may state-the n that man has to remember what Longfellow wrote about ""footprints on the sands of t i m e "" . Also, he has to remove those footprints, those stains, by proving his loyalty to the new cause which he has taken up. In this instance, such proof has not been furnished. a very sad spectacle indeed to see Australian literature being dragged through the cow-yards of the Australian Country party.

Any honourable member who attempts to cause disorder will be named. of members of the Australian Country party for Australian literature, is amazing.

The then Prime Minister appointed Mr Thorby. I should not suggest that that gentleman had a very true appreciation of literature.

Would he suggest had been honest, he would not have waited for a radio audience before which to make his answer. Yesterday, I asked him to speak on the motion for the adjournment of the House. AlthoughI told the Whip of his party that I intended to mention the matter in the course of my remarks in another debate, he deferred his reply until he had a radio audience. That is characteristic of the sanctimonious humbug and hypocrisy with which he decks nearly every statement that he makes in this House. The classical example is his contributions to the subject of food for Britain. This man, who is known as "" the tragic Treatwo and two to make four; yet, when the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) had announced to his Cabinet the proposal to make a gift of £25,000,000 to Great Britain, he quickly added that up, and made a story of it to suit himself politic-ally, and brought the matter into the field of party politics.

77,Mr Haylen,"This sudden concernthat the Librarian of the National Library, Mr Binns, is a Communist? Would be suggest that Dr. Mackaness, of Sydney, who I am sure would not mind being called a tory, would be a Communist, and would spend the whole of his time and voluntary effort in encouraging the writing of Communist tracts? The idea is ridiculous. The germ of it, of course, is not to be found in any of the statements of the right honourable member, but must be sought outside this House. Surely members of the Opposition, including members of the Australian Country party, will not accept the proposition that there should be political censorship of any literary fund. That would be intolerable and impossible. The. AttorneyGenpntl has shown why the Commonwealth Literary Fund has had to be free and unencumbered. It would be a shocking thing if a gestapo were to be employed against the writers of this country, because some members, of the Australian Country party are timid of the prospects of holding their seats in the future and seek a little brief publicity at the moment. The criticism that has been launched on this occasion cannot be sustained, for the reason that the Commonwealth Literary Fund could not exist if a censorship were imposed on the politics of the men concerned. By reason of the intelligence of the advisory committee, and later the revision of the literary committee, some consideration can be given to the subjects discussed, and it has been .the law that politics cannot enter into any serious writing by persons who receive fellowships. But the real story, if it must be told, is that a disgruntled man outside this House has related in strong terms to the honourable member for Barker( Mr which to make my speech. The whole of Archie Cameron) and the new recruit, the right honourable member for Cowper, the story of his disappointment in failing to secure a fellowship himself. On every occasion on which the literary committee has made an appointment, he has come forward with a fresh lie. We have had to stand up to a vendetta by this man Ellis and his employer, the Sydney Bulletin, who are haters of Labour and of the Communists. Mr Br.ArN -That is the man who wrote the life of Macquarie. a liar.. the Chair waits for an honourable member to object to the use of unparliamentary language, but on this occasion intends to depart from that practice.

88,Mr Haylen,"In deference to thethat we have tried to build up in 150 hard, brutal years, by putting policemen in charge of those who select our literature. A final word: The Attorney General has said that it was on the 10th May of a certain year that books were burned by Hitler. . To-day is the Sth May. The Australian Country party has .two days in which to complete the task that it has begun. Tlie honourable member for Parkes( Mr sponsibility for a Communist receiving Haylen) is so completely on the defensive that in the very first words he uttered Literary Fund. I make no charge against in reply to the speech of the right honorthe literary committee of the fund, able member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) he sought to insult and throw dirt at members of the Australian Country party because the right honourable riiember for Cowper is a member of that party. His reference to the cowyards of the community will not escape the attention of those people who are producing food for Britain, and who sometimes have to wallow in the mud not referring to members of the Australian Country party. ab'e member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) must not abuse the Standing Orders by seeking to raise a point of order when no point of order is involved. which you, yourself, Mr Speaker, have often used when rebuking honourable members, the honourable member for Parkes can hand it out, but he can not take it. When he makes a personal attack on an honourable member on this side of the House, he must be prepared to take what comes to him in reply. This time,'he has been caught flat-footed. He took advantage of the absence of the right honourable member for Cowper to make a personal' attack on his character. Now, when the right honourable member has substantiated all his assertions by quoting chapter and verse from the records of the Mitchell Library, and the records .of this Parliament, the honourable member for Pa'rkes, .who does not hesitate to asperse the sincerity of good faith of members of the Australian Country party, needs to be told a few things about himself. The other day, he rose in his place in this House and asked a question about the trip abroad of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender). able member must return to the subject. What the honourable member for. Parkes said about the honourable member for Warringah has nothing to do with the matter under discussion. member for Parkes must accept, some rea fellowship from the Commonwealth which consists of the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), whose integrity is beyond question, the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), but I point out that the literary committee merely adjudicates upon the claims submitted to it by the Advisory Committee, of which the honourable member for Parkesis a member. It is obvious that the Prime Minister, for instance, has. not the tune to read all the works published in Australia in the course of a year. For guidance in this direction he must rely upon the members of the advisory committee, and the member for Parkes, a member of that committee, digs up as an applicant for a fellowship some one with a Communist background. I had never heard of Mr Rawling until this incident occurred, and it is unfortunate that he should receive such publicity now if it is true that he has recanted his Communist views. However, the whole incident wascreated hy the attempt of the honourable member for Parkes to make political capital at the expense of the right honourable member for Cowper. The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) quoted a long list of English authors, including "" Bobby"" Burns, Tennyson and Shakespeare, and appeared to be trying todraw some sort of analogy between them and Mr Rawling. The only point for us to consider is what qualifications had a certain Mr Rawling, who was recommended by the advisory committee to the Commonwealth Literary Fund for a fellowship to be chosen to write the life of Australia's first notable poet.

The only writings of Mr Rawling of which there is any record are not unbiased productions; they are Communist propaganda. the Australian People is not propaganda. propaganda. If we are to judge a person's qualifications and sincerity, or to decide whether or not he is biased, we can only go back to what he has written or said. If he has not repudiated the opinions expressed in his writings or utterances, we must assume that he still holds those opinions. In a letter referred to by' the right honourable member for Cowper, Mr Rawling has stated, I understand"", that he no longer holds Communist views. If that is so, good luck to him, but the mere fact that he has recanted his Communist ideas does not of itself qualify him to write the life of Charles Harpur, or to receive a fellowship wort!) £400 from the Commonwealth Literary Fund. matter should have been raised in this way, and that the history of Mr Rawling, if he is no longer a Communist, should be made the subject of debate in this chamber. However, as I have said, the responsibility for this lies on the honourable member for Parkes, who sought to take advantage, of the absence of the right honourable member for Cowper to score a political point. I hope that the information which the right honourable member for Cowper has placed before the House will be taken into account by the members of the literary committee. I believe, as I think does every honourable member on this side of tlie House, that the Commonwealth Literary Fund is an excellent institution. There is a long list of persons of merit who have been assisted from .the fund. There may be some who received assistance without meriting it, but it is notable that the only case upon which -doubts have been cast has occurred since lihe honourable member for Parkes became a member of the advisory committee. When the .honourable member for Parkes -talks about the cowyards and the Aus[73] tralian Country party he had better look to himself. Minister and Treasurer) [4.20J I think it is necessary that I , as chairman of the literary committee of the Commonwealth Literary Fund, should say something about, this matter. The committee consists of the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and myself, as chairman. I always believed that the Commonwealth Literary Fund had been created-no t by this Government, but by a previous onefor the purpose of assisting in the development of Australian literature, and to render financial assistance to those who might have the ability to produce worthwhile literature. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) said that the real question to he decided was the capacity of Mr Rawling. As a matter of fact, the original question asked by the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) had nothing to do with the literary capacity of Mr Rawling. It was the right honourable member who introduced politics by referring to comI t is unfortunate that the munism. Rawling was better qualified than two other men to write the life of Charloi Harpur. that it was the right honourable membe.': himself who raised the issue of Mr Rawling's political beliefs. I am sure that the right honourable member for Yarra and the Leader of the Opposition will agree with me when I say that the literary committee takes full responsibility for the awarding of fellowships, no matter what recommendations may have been made by the advisory committee. As a matter of fact, many applications and recommendations have been rejected. Our decisions are made, rightly or wrongly, according to what we believe to be the literary capacity of the applicant. If the literary committee is to turn itself into a gestapo to inquire into the political history of every applicant for a grant, the sooner the committee is abolished the better.

I go further than did the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) : If the committee is to continue -and I hope i.t will, because it has been of considerable valueI will never be a party to the proposition that when an application or recommendation comes before the committee, it should dredge the sewers to find out the political views of the person concerned. statement. extreme it may be. The purpose of the committee is to assist the development of Australian literature, not to turn themselves into policemen in an effort to find nut the political views of writers. I lay down two rules which I suggest the commiitee should follow in considering applications for assistance from the Commonwealth Literary Fu.nd : First, that applicant* shall have a. literary capacity to warrant the granting of assistance; and secondly, that when assistance is given, tile recipient shall not use the money to engage in political propaganda on behalf of any party, whether it be the Labour party tlie Australian Country party, the Liberal, party or the Communist party. When the present Leader of the Opposition was Prime Minister he issued an invitation to the Australian Country party to nominate a representative for appointment to the committee; but so great was the interest of that party that its representative attended only one meeting. Since then the Australian Country party has not taken the slightest interest in the committee. have ever heard of such an invij-.ation being extended to the Australian Country party. tion was written by the then Prime Minister to the right honourable member for Cowper,. then Leader of the Australian Country party. The Attorney-General has a copy of it and if the right honourable member so desires he may read it. I shall not go into the question as to what Mr Rawling is, or was. I have stated the two principles which guide the committee. If they were departed from there would be set up immediately a sort, of political gestapo which would concern itself more with the political philosophies of writers than with their literary capacity. , I do not propose to depart from these principles and if they'were departed from I would disband the committee at once. principally to endorse what the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has said in. conextremenexion with this matter. As a member of the committee I take iny share of responsibility for its actions. Whilst1 appreciate the personal references made to the members of the committee, I am not prepared to allow it to be said that we had no rights, that the committee merely did what it was told and accepted the recommendations of the advisory committee without question. Anybody who says that knows nothing whatever about the workings of the committee which has been in existence for eight, years. The advisory committee is composed of literary men who inquire into the merits of the work of those who seek assistance from the fund. The advisory committee sends its recommendation, together with all appropriate .information, to the literary committee for consideration. The committee examines the recommendation and the facts surrounding tlie application, and decides either to accept or reject the recommendation. It is true that we have accepted the majority of the recommendations of the advisory committee; but it is also true that we have rejected a good many of them. Sometimes the members of the advisory committee feel somewhat hurt by our rejections, but we have our own reasons for our decisions. The literary committee is composed not merely of three busy parliamentarians who meet and say, "" We shall endorse this or that recommendation "" ; on the contrary the commi'.tce goes into the matter very thoroughly.

I agree that some journals were giving assistance to men of letters, notably the Biill.et.in. which did more for Australian writers than any other publication, particularly in earlier years. That journal had provided opportunities for literary men, particularly in the early days of its publication, which was of the greatest national value; but the need for assistance to Australian writers was completely ignored by the Australian Parliament. If I had thought that, because of my association with the committee I would have been dragged into a party political fight or accused of sponsoring communism I would have ceased to be a member of the committee immediately and the other members would have done likewise. Can one imagine the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition or me sponsoring and subsidizing the propaganda of communism, and using the Commonwealth Literary Fund to foster the breeding grounds of Communist propaganda? Does not that stretch the imagination too far? Since the fund was established it has grunted 33 fellowships, and it has been responsible for the printing of a number of manuscripts which otherwise would never have seen the light of day. Some of them, I am glad to say, have not only been published but have also paid the costs of publication out of sales. regret that the Commonwealth Most of these were of a kind which ordinary commercial publishers would not touch. About S6 of these publications I have been sponsored by the fund and this is the first occasion on which criticism of the kind voiced by the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) has been levelled at. the fund. Suppose thai, every thing thai; has been said about this case is correct. The committee is not. infallible; it is capable of making mistakes. Why besmirch the fund and the great ideal.* that lie behind it by dragging theui into a party political fight? 1 endorse what the Prime Minister has said, and I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition will do likewise, and say that never once have we asked what were the politics of any person whose work was submitted to us. All we were concerned about, was the subject of the work and the way in which it was treated. I . have not seen in any of the publications that, we have sponsored one line of political propaganda. I do not claim to have read every line of every work submitted for our consideration, but I have read a great deal; J. have burned the midnight, oi! in going through them. I would not. think of saying that an applicant for a fellowship should hold the same political opinions as I do. One has only to look at the list of fellowships granted to see that this fund has not been used as the nursery of Communist ideas. I implore honourable members to look at the list. Here are a few name? that, appear on it : Mrs. Ernestine H ill , for the completion of her'work Matthew Flinders-Lover; E. J. Brady, for the compilation of a. book entitled Tiro Frontiers; S. J. Baker, for his Dictionary of Australian Language; I . H . M . Abbott, for his volume on Newcastle Packets and the Hunter River District. Mr Abbott has, I understand, a friend in this House. tains the names of Dame Mary Gilmour, for her biography; J. S. MacDonald, whowrote on Australian art. Mr MacDonald was a great art critic, though many people do not agree with his criticisms. The list also contains the name of Mr Frank Reid, author of History of HIP.

They are well known in literature. They read the manuscripts and give us all tlie particulars. Sometimes members of the committee re-read manuscripts. I have often presumed to re-read a manuscript. We all do it where there is a doubt. The manuscripts are passed around the members in order that they may read thein and decide whether to endorse the recommendations of our advisers. I do not claim that we set ourselves up as greater literary students than they are. 1 take my share of responsibility for our decisions, but would lake no responsibility for examining the political opinions of men whose literary work comes before us. It is a poor outlook if it is claimed that a man who has committed an offence, even though he has repented, shall not be forgiven. Mr Rawling is the only man whose fellowship has been attacked. The honourable member . for Barker Cameron) made a few points about other things, but lie cannot set himself up as the last word on literature. It cannot be said that the experts who advise us have no literary knowledge. If any member of the Australian Country party feels that his presence on the committee would improve it and the work it does, I shall be glad to have him joi n us, but I decline to agree that the committee must examine a man's political conscience before deciding that lie. be granted a fellowship. When I proposed the present system I had in mind a number of Australian writers who had not heen given the opportunity to develop (heir talents. I pointed out that when they were worn out as writers and no longer capable of giving of their best they were pensioned, but that when they were young and vigorous and capable of fine work, given the opportunity, they were made to fend for themselves. One man among many I had in mind was working on jobs in the bush and in brickyards and was going blind. He was writing beautiful Australian poetry.

I think the right honourable member for Cowper, himself, made that plain in his concise statement. Constituted as it is, the literary committee obviously has to depend on the advice of experts on the advisory committee.

The right honourable member for Yarra, exercising his shrewdness and great ability in debate, sought to distract honourable members from the main issue.

Notwithstanding the speech of the leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Eadden), the issue before us is not the'martyrdom of the; Australian Countrv party, but a straight issue of civil liberty, it is on that basis that I propose to discuss the matter raised by the. right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle' Page).

Therefore,"" to .assort, without a. tittle of evidence, ae the honourable member for Richmond did. that there is no evidence merit is to assert something totally ii n true. Apart from whether he was, or was not, a Communist, or whether any one else, who has been given a fellowship, is or is not a Communist, there is another question. liberties. No one knows who speaks for the Liberal party, because the tune sung by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) different from that, of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), and I am glad to see the honourable member for Barker nodding agreement. The Leader of the Opposition made a clear statement after the last general elections that the policy of the Liberal party was not to ban the Communist party but to prosecute it for any overt, or illegal act done by it . It would not ban the Communist party on political philosophy as such. Therefore the policy of the Liberal party is to ro'.cognize the Communist party as a legal party. On what, grounds, then, would the Liberal party exclude Communists from receiving fellowships from the Commonwealth Literary Fund? Obviously, if it made the Communist party illegal, it would have the right to exclude Communists. The policy of the Australian Country party is at least consistent. It declares that it will ban the Communist party; hence, its objection to Communist authors or those accused of being Communists, ' is coherent and But that is not the policy of the Liberal party, and I should like to know just how deep is the concern of members of ihe Liberal party for civil liberty because ititside this House they want one thing, and inside the House, they either sit in silence while the Australian Country party goes through its usual opening gambit, or certain of its members, like the honourable member for Barker, if he can be described as a Liberal, support them. In my mind, fJie word ""liberalism "" is associated with Oampbell-Bannerman and Lloyd George. To call the honourable member for Barker a liberal is as j a r r in g to my sense of the fitness of things us it would !>e to put coronation robes on an orang-outang. Among the authors who have received a grant from the.Commonwealth Literary Fund, there is one who, I understand, of Mr Rawling's literary is a Communist. I am not following the usual practice of smearing people, under the cover of parliamentary privilege. She is Katherine Susannah Pritchard, or Mrs. K . S. Throssell. I understand, that she has never sought to conceal the It concerns civil fact that she was a. Communist. She received a grant to write a .novel set in the gold-fields of Western Australia. I presume that the novel, is her recent, is entirely work, The Roaring Nineties. I read the novel with great interest. W it h her political views, I disagree entirely. I have heard her speak publicly, and I disagree entirely with what she stated; but if the Commonwealth .Literary Fund had deprived Australian literature of the novel which she wrote, it would have done a disservice to Australian literature. I consider that nothing could dramatize the whole issue which is before the House better than this clear separation of her political convictions whatever we may think of them, and her literary ability."" The list of persons who have received assistance from the f u n d is very extensive. Some of the authors are Frank Dalby Davison, Xavier Herbert, Stella Miles Franklin, Mrs. Ernestine H ill , M a r j o r i e Clark, Marjorie Barnard, of Barnard Eldershaw fame, E . J. Brady, and Roy Connolly, who wrote a novel dealing with freakishness in heredity. Looking at honourable members opposite, I believe consistent. that this book is probably a very valuable piece of research. Other well known names in the list of distinguished authors are-S . J. Baker, Mrs. K a f e r in e Susannah Pritchard, J. H . M . Abbott, Dame Mary Gilmour and Mrs. Daisy Bates. Summing up, I desire to make certain comments on Mr Rawling himself. I heard a broadcast that he gave over the national stations. IfI remember aright, the broadcast took the form of an interview with an announcer. Mr. Gladstone, Rawling broke with the Communist party over the Russian invasion of F in land. He considered that the habit of the Comniunist party of apologizing for every item of Russian foreign policy was Beazley) were entirely unwarranted. If reprehensible -He stated that Russian actions, as he saw them, had nothing to do with the philosophy of communism. In that broadcast he accused the Australian Communist party of being not Communists but Stalinists, who might aptly be described as they were drawn in Low's cartoon. AH the little boys were in bed with "" Eather Joe "", and if father burned, they all turned. That was his description of the Communist party at this time; not that the fact that he might be a Communist or was once a Communist has anything to do with the question whether he should be awarded a grant to enable him to write on a li'.erary subject. But since his literary ability has been impugned, it is necessary for me to state these facts. . If the evidence of Mr his remarks to the subject before the Rawling's literary ability is provided in his Short History of the Australian People, then the committee, in deciding to make this grant to him, had good grounds for so doing. When the Minister for Transport, ( Mr Ward) objected yesterday to the right honourable member for Cowper being granted leave to make a statement, I personally disapproved of his action. orable member voted for it. cause I have no intention of behaving as an individualist, as the honourable member for Barker has done sonal liberty now ? that the Minister did object, because his action has led to this debate, which has revealed how contemptuous is the attitude of the Australian Country party towards civil liberty. I am glad also that the Australian people have had this revelation of how there is in their midst a party of Junkers, who would drop their jackboots squarely on Australian literature. ever else may be said by honourable members opposite about the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle been said by honourable members on both Page), the concluding remarks of* the sides of the House about personal liberty, honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr honourable members will recall 'the .facts they will remember that the right honourable member for Cowper accepted the statement made by the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), and did not press the matter further. In that way, he avoided causing any embarrassment to Mr Rawling. It was not until the right honourable gentleman himself had been savagely attacked in this House, in his absence, and then denied the right to make a personal explanation by those who now claim to uphold the right of personal liberty, that he raised in the matter again. Now that the honourable member has made that comment. I ask him to address Chair. Deputy Speaker, I'have heard honourable members opposite roam all around this subject, and if we are not given the same opportunity, what, rights -are left to us?

144,Mr Holt,"A t any rate, enough hasbut the issue implicit in the submission of the right honourable member for Cowper is this: Is there, by .some accident or through inadequate vigilance on the part of the committee controlling the Commonwealth Literary Fund, a danger that some of this money, which is provided by taxpayers, will be used to enable certain people, who themselves would deny to us (lie right of free speech, to undermine and white-ant the democratic institutions of fins country? One of the most remarkable features of this debate is that, although members of the committee presumably investigated the literary record of Mr Bawling, the only person to submit to the House to-day evidence of those activities was the right honourable member for Cowper. No one has suggested that Mr Bawling has written matter other than that contained in the list provided by the right honourable member for Cowper. We are told that although Mr Bawling has written on the subject of communism in the past, he is now a convert, who is so moved to continue his literary activities that he has applied for a Commonwealth Fellowship. However. T point out' that he has refrained from producing, during the last seven or eight years, any literature which would give a denial to the views which he previously expressed in print. Why, if he has this consuming desire to record himself in print on one subject, has he not been prepared to publish statements which would undo any damage which his previous utterances had caused? The fears of the Opposition go beyond the issue raised in this particular instance. duced by the Government in connection We are concerned, because we find on tbe part of this Government a reluctance to bring to the light of day the activities of people who are conspiring to undermine the Commonwealth. The Government refuses to say where the funds are obtained that enable four publications to be carried on by the Communist party in Australia. We hear that certain persons are no longer members of the Communist party. How many of them have gone underground because they look to the day when the activities of some of their comjades might deprive them of the opportunity to carry out their foul work in white-anting our democratic institutions? If the Government desires to repudiate the charges levelled against it on this occasion, and wishes to allay the concern and misgivings which the Opposition and many people throughout Australia feel on the subject of communism, let it face this issue as a real challenge! Let it examine the activities of the Communists in Australia, and bring into the light of day the source of the funds which enable the Communists to publish those journals! Mi-.

Tbe Minister, in bis second reading speech, saidThe present validation hill does not preclude tln> individual items in the proposals being debuted by honourable members!, as a tariff debate is necessary before such items can be permanently included in the schedule to the Customs Tariff Act. A tariff debate will be held as soon as circunistances permit. That, however, does not give any indication that a tariff debate will be arranged at an early date. Moreover, the Minister pointed out that the validation now being sought is for an unspecified term. We may therefore be precluded from engaging in a tariff debate for many more months, or even, in. some circumstances, for years. Other tariff validation bills may follow this one. This procedure does not do justice to tbe responsibilities of honourable members in relation to tariff policy. In view of tbe great development of our manufacturing potential during the war years there is every reason for requesting an early tariff debate. It .ma.v be that. some of the industries which are at present receiving protection may not need it, or they may not. need such high duties as are at present being applied. Other manufacturing industries now in their early stages of development may require a greater degree of p.rote -;.ion than they are receiving. It may be that at this moment, some of our newer industries are having the headman's axe applied to thern in the overseas discussions to which I have referred.

149,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [5.21'|.,"our tariff policy is necessary in the interests of Australia. We ought to know where we are heading in our customs tariff policy. It will doubtless be of interest to honourable members and to tbe country at large to be reminded that tariff receipts for the first eight months of the present financial year show an increase'of £17.000,000 over the estimate. The total is made up of £11,000,000 from customs duties and £6,000,000 fro m excise duties. Tho estimated budget collection for the full financial vear is £89,000,000. The revenue for ""the ten months ended the 30th. A p r i l, totalled £34,224,860. The collections up t ill the SOthA p r i l were £21,858,600 more than the corresponding ten months of the previous financial year. The total collections for A p r i l alone were £8,377.900 which was £1.807,000 more than for A p r i l of .last year. There will probably be a continually increasing revenue from customs and excise duties until the depleted .stocks in the stores of this country have been replenished. It may suit the Government to have a "" r o c k e t in g "" customs revenue and that very circumstance may prove an incentive to it to defer a f u l l consideration of customs policy for as long as possible. In that event we may expect a continuation of the policy of introducing validating bills of this description; hut the abstraction of money from the pockets of the people by such means is not justifiable. That is another reason why there should be a prompt review of customs policy. I cannot fathom why the Government should wish to continue to abstract money from the people in the way that it is doing by both direct and indirect means. It is thereby imposing a financial burden, on tbe people which I am sure they will not be willing to carry much longer. 'Ihe Government's policy is impoverishing industry to an extraordinary degree and it is hindering f u l l recovery. I consider, therefore, that it. is incumbent upon me to impress upon the Minister and his colleagues the need for an early tariff debate so that, to use an expression of which Government members are fond, we may '-streamline"" our 1:(riff policy. The present policy of the Government is undoubtedly having an adverse effect on some worthy importing enterprises. with interest to the two speeches that were made on the validating bill which the House has just passed, and I was somewhat surprised that, the Minister who introduced the measure ( Mr Pollard) did not give an explanation, to honourable members of the need for it . Everybody knows that anything done in validly is illegal. Consequently when the Parliament is invited to pass a bill to validate something that has already been done,, it may be assumed that the invalid action was illegal. If something illegal has been, done honourable morn hers should be informed of the f u l l facts. Tbe bill now before us contains the expression, "" a l l duties of customs demanded or collected "". That means, I presume, that duties which have already been collected have been illegally collected. Therefore the illegal action needs validation. Presumably, duties to be collected . in the future under the tariff proposals to which this bill relates would also be illegal if ibis validating bill were not passed. I submit therefore that the Minister should explain the reason why such a. measure as this is necessary. desire to refer to tbe points"" raised'by the honourable member for Reid( Mr. Lang). The action taken by the Government in relation to these tariff matters was not illegal. Under legislation passed by this Parliament many years ago duties specified in tariff schedules that were tabled became operative at once. Tbe reason for such action is clear. If the duties did not become operative immediately they were notified there would be a temptation for people immediately to rush forward prospective -imports, or to remove goods from bond. Eor that reason duties .become effective immedia.telv schedules are tabled. Another law passed! by this Parliament provides that tariff schedules which have been laid on the table must be validated within a given t i m e I believe within six months. That period, in respect of these schedules, will expire in a. few days, and unless the'Parliament passes a validating bill covering a further period, the duties w ill .lapse! I remind the honourable member for Reid that while I was Prime Minister numerous tariff schedules were introduced, by",42,Second Reading

Eventually, the Parliament validated those schedules. Now, because the law has been amended, the period during which tariff schedules can continue to operate without validation is only six months. It. does not matter what may be the number of schedules, they have to be laid on the table of the House, and should a majority of the Parliament, so decide, any one or all of them may be disallowed. Such action is not taken, becati.se the Parliaing bill in those circumstances, and ment always approves of them. This proposal is rather unfair to the Cabinet with a view to having all tariff House, even though the matter may be schedules debated in this House. It is urgent.

I frankly admit that all sorts of considerations in u-qgard to exchange, preference and so forth, are associated with this matter. If we are to be guided by press statements bearing upon the attitude of the United States of America in regard to wool duties which have appeared within the last few days, then the outlook is rather a murky one. Nevertheless, it may became clear. I put it to tlie Government very firmly that there s'liould be a full-dress tariff debate before 'the end of this year. Let us arrive at an understanding of what is to be the tariff policy of Australia for tlie next few years. to add.a brief comment to those of other honourable members who desire that there shall be a .full review of our post-war tariff policy. I concede, with them, that there are very great practical difficulties in flic way of a complete review by the Government to-day. But surely the Government recognizes that both primary and secondary industry is in a state of uncertainty as to future possibilities! The question is not one merely of tariff -protection, or of .the degree to which ex.cise duties, imposed to meet the erncr,g.ency needs of war, are likely to become .a ^permanent >part of our revenue-raising methods of the future. There are also administrative developments, which have occurred during the war and are continuing to-day, and in respect of those .developments .the commercial and industrial community of Australia needs some guidance if it is to be enabled to plan efficiently for the future. One of those developments is governmental control of the importation of goods, sometimes for tie .purpose of conserving exchange, and at other times, perhaps, with the object of -enabling Australian industries to .obtain an abnormal share of the markets -that are offering for their products. During the war there were security lieasons which made reasonable the im-position of these abnormal restrictions. But we are now .approaching ,the second full year of peace, and some of those emergency provisions are in line for :i-e\iiew. What is true of the restrictions on -the importation of goods is also true ijn like degree of the restrictions which operate to-day on the export of many, of rthe-products of Australia.. Far too much responsibility has been left with depart-mental officers, and too little with the body which should safeguard the interests of the community as a whole-the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Perhaps that was inevitable during the war years. But tbe time is long overdue, for the rea.sserti.on by this Parliament of its financial authority, its right to control what are really great policy issues in respect of these commercial -matters. Within recent months, and even years, tbe determination of the right kindof policy to pursue in -relation to the importation of goods and the .restrictions which should be imposed on She export of goods has beeu left to departmental officers. Their decisions may have .been, in the main, sound. Nevertheless, in the past decisions of that kind have rightly been veserved as being among the most important of those which this Parliament should make. SoI suggest to the Government-and here T somewhat cut across what has been said by my colleaguesthat before the conclusion of the discussions at Geneva we should have a clear indication of -the Government's future policy in relation to these administrative procedures. I hope that, if .the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) does not feel fully equipped to deal with the .issues at this moment, -he -will have them -in mind as the subject of an early-statement to the Parliament.",44,Second Reading

I wishCommerce and Agriculture) [5.48] in for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) has asktid to be assured that the Parliament will have an early opportunity to discuss tariff problems generally. That is a perfectly reasonable, request, and I assure him that it will be so considered. Immediately the circumstances reasonably permit an opportunity .will be afforded for a debate on tariff and excise policy generally. On the other hand, as the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) has pointed out, it is impossible at the moment to state specifically when, that event will occur. The honourable member for Barker has referred to the conversations that arc proceeding at the International Conference on Trade and . Employment, at Geneva. It would be impracticable for the Government, to bring down revigionary tariff or excise proposals nefore the outcome of those conversation** and of the conference discussions bad become known, bec-iinso it would, not know whether there would be an almost immediate need to make a. further revision j and the time of the Parliament would have been wasted, whilst tbere might ensue a state of chaos in industry generally and a state of industrial disturbance all round. In the circumstances, I hope that the Opposition w ill accept my assurance that a tariff discussion will take place immediately the circumstances make if, reasonable. I do not know that it is desperately urgent; because, as the result of war activities, and of the fact that, Australia has come out of the conflict less injured in regard to its industrial capacity than has any other country, our secondary industries, in particular, are happily in a rather sound position. It is a rare thing to receive from the representatives of any secondary industry a request for additional tariff protection, and as for rhe primary industries, insofar as they are affected by the country's fiscal policy, it is seldom that any coinplaint is heard. I agree substantially with Fawkner( MrH o l t ) , who argued that export and import restrictions and prohibitions should be reduced to a minimum. I hope that the International Conference on Trade and Employment at Geneva will be successful, and that when, the agreements reached there eventually come reply-Tlie. honourable member before this Parliament for ratification they w ill be discussed in a non-party manner', and that honourable members, when considering them, will be actuated only by a desire to raise the general standard of living in this and other countries.

I understand that, by the exercise of certain powers during the war, without reference to this Parliament, the Commonwealth commitments have been increased. Under the original arrangement, New South Wales was to provide 25 per cent, of the capital for the enterprise, the proprietors of Davis Gelatine (Australia) Proprietary Limited were to provide 25 per cent, and the Commonwealth was to provide 50 per cent. I should like to know what are the financial coiniuitments of the three parties under the existing arrangement. What losses have heen incurred by the Commonwealth on this interesting enterprise, and how much crude oil has been produced at Glen Davis? I have no authentic information on the subject from government sources, except what I have gleaned from the Auditor-General's report, and such reports, although sometimes very revealing, are in many respects unsatisfactory. It is doubtful whether the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard), who is in charge of this measure, is .able to give the information which I seek. Therefore, I suggest that when the hill gets into committee further consideration should be postponed until the information is available. I understand that excise duty is to be its projects for the distillation of power collected on spirit distilled from wheat, alcohol, and the productiono f oil from just as it is collected on spirit distilled shale. from sugar-cane products. A great deal of Commonwealth money has been exHouse pended on the erection of power alcohol distilleries in Australia. Some of us believe that there was a good deal of party much debate; but this bill, which provides political influence exercised in determinfor the collection of millions of pounds in ing the location of the distilleries, even so though we might believe that, in no circumstances, would a government stoop to placing a distillery in a particular what the bill really involves.

Thedistilleries erected for the purpose of making spirit from wheat are still in existence. There is one in the electorate of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull), and another in the electorate of the honourable member for Grey( Mr Russell), while others are scattered in various places throughout Australia.

I purposely said that we were endeavouring to debate the bill because honourable members had been reduced to complete inability to do so intelligently because of the absence of information regarding the items on which the duties are to be validated by the bill. Just bow meagre was the information given to tbe House may best be illustrated by a perusal of the notice-paper fcr to-day in which, nnder government business, we find notice of motion No. 3, which readsto briny in a'bill foe an act to provide for the Obviously, no honourable.member opposite validation of collections of duties of excise under Excise Tariff Proposals. All honourable members will agree that that conveys no more than that some proposal was to be brought, before the House relating to an excise tariff. Just what the proposal was to be we were not told. Honourable members thus bad no opportunity to give it serious consideration nor to decide how they should vote upon it. It was upon that foundation that the Minister made what, by courtesy, I must describe as a second-reading speech. It was so brief that I might be permitted to read it in full. The honourable gentleman saidThis bill seeks to validate the collections of duties of excise imposed by Excise TariffProposals No. 1 of the 14th November, 1940. The bill has a similar effect to that of the preceding validation bills. Upon that comprehensive array of information the House is invited to record its vote. I do-not know whether the Minister himself knew what it was all about. It is obvious that he must have known because when I asked, by interjection, what items were involved, the honourable gentleman replied that they embraced petrol, petroleum, shale products, coke and coal distillates. I ask the House, and tbe wider audience which the Government has been good enough to make aware of our proceedings, if it is not complete abrogation of the purposes of the Parliament to bring down a bill of this kind and without any explanation of its purpose expect honourable members to vote on it?

As I have said, its objective, which was to make this country to some degree self-sufficient, was of the highest national importance. Mr Davis and his associates have not received a penny in return for their investment, and are no doubt in jeopardy of losing the whole of it. HadI been given time to consider this legislation properly I probably should advocate that the excise on the product of tbe National Oil Proprietary Limited, might well be abolished, instead of reduced by only i d . a gallon, because the Commonwealth Government owns 90 per cent, of the shares. But, having been denied tbe opportunity of considering the implications, I do not commit myself to that. The House is entitled to time to consider all proposals that come before it..

This proposal refers also to excise on petrol produced by The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. invested in the company is £750,000, as near as I have been able to discover in tbe little while I have had available to me since the bill was brought down. The Commonwealth Government holds 5 per cent, of tbe shares,, and an overseas company the remainder. The balance sheet for 1946 shows that this government-controlled enterprise sold its produets at such high prices as to reap a net profit of nearly £224,195 after paying £690,000 tax. The company is half-way towards socialism. told by members of the Labour party that the object of converting an enterprise from private ownership to government ownership is to protect the people against exploitation by great companies and Socialized enterprise is supposed to be Mr Mem wen. non-profit making. Labour 'claims that financially most of the terrible things that afflict mankind spring from tbe profit motive. Yet that company in 1946 made a gross profit of nearly £1,000,000, which, after payment of taxes left a net profit of £224,195, on which it paid a dividend of 12 per cent. This legislation may or may in the venture. not, be approved, but tbe Parliament is at least entitled to be told its implications by the Government. Yet the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pollard) made a second reading speech of only five lines. Private motorists and people dependent on petroleum products for industrial purposes in this country might well consider that the Government could do with less revenue from the company of which it is the parent. Under ho previous administration has it been able to exploit the people as it must have exploited them last year. Casting my eye over its profits I find that in recent years, in round figures they were £224,000 in 1946, £156,000 in 1945, £197,000 in 1944, £95,000 in 1943, £15,000 in 1942, £13,000 in 1941 and £93,000 in 1940. I have not been able to ascertain the profits in 1939, but they decline on a steady curve to £57,000 in 1936.. If an enterprise established on governmental capital is to be used to exploit the people to that degree, it should be understood that that is the way that the Labour policy operates. This has a far-reaching effect not only on the people that buy the proThe capital ducts of The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited but also on the profits of its competitors. 'Sales of The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited are incomparably smaller than of other petrol companies. Who sets the tune? Do the great British and American companies, the Shell Oil Company Limited and the Vacuum Oil Company Limited set the price level or does The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited? If last year the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited which made a gross We have been profit of £946,000 and a net profit of £224,000 is as inefficient as most governmental enterprises how much higher must have been the profits of its competitors with their vastly greater turnover and more efficient management? The Labotir financial organizations. party has something to answer there. I hope the G overnment does "" not think that we are so inept that it can get away with this sort of thing. We -will not let it. It is time the cynicism of the Labour party towards parliamentary government was brought to a halt. Every time the Government treats the parliamentary in stitution so cynically as to introduce an important measure like this with a. fiveline second-reading speech we w ill expose it. the Parliament being made a rubber stamp to endorse, tbe decisions of the Labour caucus. We will bring that policy to an end or expose it to the public gaze whenever it is applied. The bill proposes to validate the collection of an excise duty of Sid. a gallon on petrol. Perhaps when the petrol duty was originally imposed, it. was of importance mainly to private motorists, but, increasingly, petrol is becoming a. highly important factor in industry, both primary end secondary. It is of immense importance to men on the land, on whose behalf ! spvak. been tricked into missing the opportunity ol expressing opinions on the maintenance of a punitive tax of 8-id. a gallon on petrol, which is only I d . less.than the wartime rate. That small reduction has been made when the Government is embarrassed, not by a shortage of revenue, but by the excess of revenue pouring into the coffers of tbe .Treasury. When the Federal Aids Roads Agreement B ill is introduced I shall have something to say. about the distributionof revenue from petrol. I content myself now by condemning the Government, for the manner in which if is treating the Parliament. We w ill oppose, and expose every instance of that sort of treatment of the Parliament by the Administration. innocently raised the question why this and other like bills were brought down. On the face of it. this is a bill to validate collection.'of excise. It aroused my curiosity. W h y does the Government want to make legal something that is illegal? Tho first, measure which tbe Ministe'r introduced was the Customs TariffV a l idation B ill . No t knowing the procedure of this House thoroughly, I looked on and marvelled.

Then the Minister rose to enlighten me f u r t h e r ; We will, not tolerate but a discussion developed on another matter, and he overlooked me. Tbe House is now considering -the Excise Tariff Validation B ill , and it has aroused my innocent curiosity. During the suspension of the sitting. I examined the tariff proposals which the Minister laid upon the table of the House last November. He explained that, those proposals must be validated before the 14tli May next. If they are not validated, they will become in operative. Even so, the Government should not attempt to rush this legislation through the House. The Government should not say. "" Time is pressing, and Yet. we were to have we must pass this legislation as a matter of urgency. "" Froin the stand-point of the Government there is no urgency, because it controls tlie sittings of the Parliament,.

The plain fact is that the schedules to which, this bill and the two associated measures relate were tabled in the House last November, and at that time. I not only explained the purpose of tbe schedules, but also circulated memorandums in relation to them which gave f u l l information regarding both the customs and excise duties. sard report of the Minister's remarks on that occasion and there is no reference in it to tbe item to which I referred. Mir. POLLARD planation, and that is the plain truth. The honourable gentleman's mock indignation is the more remarkable seeing that lie was absent from , tbe House this afternoon when I introduced the first of these measures. this afternoon. gentleman was present and could not understand the import of the bills that is no fault of mine. He quoted from Omar Khayyam this evening. I shall also make a quotation from that source. Minister does not intend to bring tbe jug of wine here. Speaker. I direct attention to these words:Myself, when young, rlicl eagerly frequent, Doctor and saint and heard great argument, Abouti t and about, but evermore Went out by that same door as in I went. T h a t robs my That applies to the honourable member for In d i . Hud be been present in the House when I introduced the first of these vji.lidfi.ting bills this afternoon he would have realized .that the schedule referred to therein provided for a reduction of customs duty of I d . per gallon on petrol. Tbe measure now before the House validates a reduction of excise duty of I d . a gallon. The first-mentioned amount, relates to oils and petrols imported in refined condition : the' second-mentioned, to oils and petrols refined from shales in this country. The reason for the reduction of I d . in each case was to preserve existing margins. In that respect the Government is honouring an undertaking given by previous governments, including the Menzies Government. The margin operating in respect of imported refined petrols and oils is 5J;d. a gallon, and that in respect of petrols and oils refined from .local shales is 7.5d. a gallon. When tbe original proposals were introduced an undertaking was given by the Menzies Government that the margins would be preserved until .1.955. Tbe introduction of this measure, therefore, I have read the Hanhonours a. promise of the Menzies Government.. In these circumstances, I am astonished that the honourable member for In d i should have spoken in opposition to I made a f u l l extbe bill. I am surprised, also, because the reduction of excise is beneficial to the users of tractors in primary-producing industries, as well as, of course, to other people. It is for the reasons that I have given that I consider that the honourable member for In d i has been responsible for a display of mock indignation.

244,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"last November. In those proposals, there is a reference to the imposition of differential duties on the products of National Oil Proprietary Limited. view of the statement that, for each gallon not exceeding 10,000,000 gallons produced in any one year commencing on the 1st, day of January the duty shall he 3d. a gallon, and for each gallon exceeding 10.000,000 gallons in each year comrnojncing on the 1st day of January the duty shall be Sid. a gallon, it would appear that a differential duty of 5£d. a. gallon operates as soon as the production exceeds 10,000,000 gallons a year. I.should like to know whether the Minister has been good enough to obtain the information for which I asked before the suspension of tbe sitting, with a. view to enabling the committee to have some idea of how this imposition of excise is affecting the production of oil from shale at Glen Davis. T am deeply concerned about this matter because, as the Minister will recall, I was severely critical of this project when it was first brought down by the Government. I have noted from the Auditor-General's report that the Government's commitment has increased from an initial amount of £334,000. To-day, the capital invested is £334,000, but there have been additional loans from "" the Commonwealth amounting to £2,246,000. Tbe losses are rather staggering. This duty may be affecting the ability of the company to pay dividends. Up to date, the company has not paid a dividend. The committee should have before it information which would enable it to decide whether the rate of duty is affecting the ability of National Oil Proprietary Limited, as it is now called, to pay a dividend to its shareholders. The losses would not be so great were it not for the undisclosed amount of duty which the company is paying. Those losses have been: On the , first year's operations in 1940, £1S0,000; in 1941, £177,000; in 1942, £263,000; in 1943, £296,000; in 1944, £303,000; and in 1945, £343,000. One is . led to ask what is the effect of the differential duty upon the profit and loss account of National Oil Proprietary Limited. What strikes me most forcefully is that the annual loss becomes greater with every Wales. . I do not know whether the State increase of Government advance. The Mr Archie Cameron. committee is at a great disadvantage in arriving at a decision,, because of a complete lack of information. The Minister In has not been prepared to take us into his confidence, and tell us w hat is the annual 7 rate of production -at Glen Davis, how much of its production is bearing an excise duty of 3d. a gallon and how much a duty of S-Jd. a gallon, either during his second-reading speech, or on that other famous occasion last November to which he has referred in such forceful terms in reply to tbe honourable member for had that information, it would be in a position to arrive at a decision. This is not tbe end of the Commonwealth's commitments. The Auditor-General has shown that the Commonwealth Bank loaned the company £250,000. The Commonwealth Government must have repaid thatamount to the Commonwealth Bank at some time in 1944. It would appear that the Commonwealth Bank considered that the duty imposed was a little too "" hot"", and that the security was not, sufficiently . good. Therefore, the Commonwealth Bank came to the conclusion that the financial ""baby"" had better be carried by tbe Commonwealth Government rather than by itself. That is another important point. The Auditor-General has stated that the loans advanced by the Commonwealth for the purpose of this undertaking amounted to £3,091,000 at the 30th June, 1946. Since then, the company has bad another advance of £325,229, and a. bank guarantee of £100,000; with what bank has not been stated. It is estimated that a further amount of £250,000 will be necessary to finance tbe undertaking to the stage of production. An advance of this amount was approved by Cabinet in June. 1946, and £200,000 of it had been paid to the company when this report was being compiled. Interest accrued, but unpaid from the 1st January, 1942, to the 30th June, 1946, on advances made by the Commonwealth, amounted to £287,000 a year, in addition to those duties that are due to tbe Commonwealth, which are very definitely affected by the amount of excise which the company will have to pay on whatever the production may be. There is also tbe interest that is due to the State, of New South is receiving that interest or not. The",55,Excise Tariff Validatio N

Minister and Treasurer) [9.20] -There i> no desire to hide 'from Parliament any particulars regarding the operation of National Oil Proprietary Limited. Honourable members are aware that this enterprise was embarked upon during the term of office of the Lyons Government, the idea, -being to produce from shale petrol that might be available in case of emergency. I have no quarrel with the original objective. I was not in Parliament at the time; but I was always very doubtful of tbe prospects of success, even, though the Newnes shale deposits happened to be in the electorate which I hoped to represent. The technical advice submitted in tin; first place was apparently very bad. As a result of this advice, retorts of a kind used in Scotland and Czechoslovakia were installed, but at Glen Davis they did not produce the expected results. Newnes shale has a very high oil content,and the retorts at first used were not capable of recovering much more than. half , of it. Mr Keith Butler, manager of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited in Newcastle, is chairman of directors of National Oil Proprietary Limited, and he has great faith in tbe ultimate success of the enterprise. He is giving his services absolutely free in this capacity, not even drawing expenses, and he has been able to give valuable advice on the technical side. His confidence in the undertaking is so great that the Government is prepared to continue its support, in position is the the hope that this confidence will be justified. I do not believe that all the capital which has been put into the project can be recovered, but if a reasonable amount is written off it might be economically successful. As Treasurer, I should have liked to make a statement to Parliament setting out the financial position, but I have been asked by those associated with it to let the matter stand over until the.y can prove that the reorganization now being effected is cap-able of producing results. I am responsible for the Commonwealth money being used, According to the but, as Mr Butler is so confident of ultimate success, we are prepared to give him an opportunity to justify his confidence. annual production? 10,000,000 gallons a year. I repeat that there is no desire on the part of the Government to conceal anything, and I am not withholding a statement because the enterprise is situated in my electorate. .1 believe that tlie experiments now proceeding will be successful. ments take? the production of oil per ton of shale has already improved greatly. With the old retorts it was approximately 50 gallons a ton, whereas it had originally been hoped to recover between 90 and 95 gallons a ton. The new retorts, I believe, are recovering about 80 gallons a ton. A full statement regarding tbe enterprise will be made in due course. I am grateful for the explanation offered by the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley). As a Minister of the Government which was in office in 1941, I remember that we were very much concerned over the losses being sustained in this venture. It was originally proposed that the deposit? should be worked by a private company, which would receive assistance from the Government of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Government. The company contributed £166,000, the Government of New South Wales a similar amount, and the Commonwealth Government £334,000. However, as time went on, the company more or less disappeared",57,Excise Tariff Validatio N

257,Mr Anthony (Richmond) [9.25],"from f l it picture been use it found that its finances did not permit it to carry, ou. The Commonwealth, being committed to the project, was compelled to go on, particularly as war had broken out. and it was necessary to get petrol at any cost. Iii 1937-3S the Commonwealth Governiiie:ii't advanced £334,000; at the present rime, its total contribution to the enterprise amounts to .C2_.500.000. The Prime Minister said he was hopeful that, as a result of receiving new technical advice, and installing new retorts, some success would be achieved. That was the story told us in 1941. It was then said, "" Only give us time. The original company made a great mistake in installing obsolete retorts, which were uneconomic in tbe production of shale oil. Let us get new retorts from the United States of America. W the Commonwealth will only put in a little more money, we will make good."" That was in .1942. Since then tbe losses have been as follows:Wiir. 104 2 V.I4S 1044 1.0-10 Those are the Auditor-General's figures, and thoy show that every year the loss has been increasing. The Treasurer is the custodian of the taxpayers' money, and I should like to know how innc.b patience ho has in the expenditure of that money on an enterprise which is not giving a f a ir return. I realize the immense difficulty of making a decision in a case like this, but there must be some point beyond which tbe Government will not continue to advance money for unproductive work. Tbe old story of the retorts being obsolete has bad a fair trial. I . hope that the Prime Minister, who has close, personal knowledge of tbe Glen Davis project, will inform the House of the latest costs, because the figures supplied in the Auditor-General's report bring us up to 1945 only. We do not know what losses were incurred last year or this year, or whether the company has yet turned the corner towards success. Honourable members are entitled to up to date information on these matters. The Minister might also furnish figures relating to production. a, formality to impose an excise duty on the product of tbe company and at the same time recoup it for its losses. Excise of 3d. a gallon levied on 10,000,000 gallons proilucts a ' revenue of £125,00(1. an amount less than one-half the loss sustained by the company in one year. The excise charge, is merely a bookkeeping entry which, as far as. excise revenue is concerned is misleading. The Treasurer should look into the matter with a view to relieving the company of the excise charge until such time as the venture Decom.es a profitable undertaking. Coniuierce arid Agriculture [9.32] -The honourable member for Barker( Mr. Archie Cameron) and the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) requested information concerning the production of oil from shale and other aspects of"", the great undertaking at Glen Davis. The Labour Administration first took office in 1941 and cannot be held .. .. . . 2fix.oof i responsible for the situation that existed .. ' . . 2'lll.i'UO. prior to that year. The company's . . -iOM.OOO figures show that for 1.94.1 -42 the quantity H42.000 of oil produced from shale was 1,769.000 gu 11 on s. a n d 111 a t the re veni I e. collected thereon in the form of excise was £29.483. In 1.942-43, under the direction of a Labour government the output was so improved as to read a total of 2.142,1 Si gallons, the yield of revenue in the form of excise amounting to £35,C9S. By 1943-44 there was a'substantial drop in.production, due to lack of man-power and the fact that we were then in the most critical stage of the war, and also, no doubt, to some deterioration of tbe plant. In that year production dropped to 1,322,000 gallons, and the revenue from excise to £22,000. In .1944-45 production improved slightly, the output being 1.492.000 gallons, the excise being £24.000.' In 1945-46 due to the factors referred to by the Prime Minister to-night, and no doubt, to the very efficient, management supplied gratis by the BrokenH ill Proprietary CompanyL i m i ted, and to improved plant and better methods of operation, the output increased to 2.032,000 gallons and tbe excise to £34,000. It may appear strange, as the honourable member for Richmond",58,Excise Tariff Validatio N

260,Mr Pollard (Ballarat,"Minister forlias said, that, notwithstanding that the losses incurred by the company are still being met by the Government, excise duty is still imposed on the company's products. That is possibly due to the fact that some machinery has to be established for the collection of the excise from I Itu consuming public. That is a matter for the financial wizards of the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Cus-' toms to work out. If excise duty were not imposed it would be difficult to collect the full price from the consuming public. Another factor which must be borne in mind is that a small quantity of oil from shale is produced elsewhere than at Glen Davis. The honourable member for Indi( Mr When the Minister points with pride McEwen) very pertinently asked what theseproposals meant in relation to benzol which is used by tobacco-growers in various parts of Australia, particularly in bis own electorate. Like the honourable member for Indi, I have always been very interested in tbe welfare of' the tobacco-growers and it has been my constant aim to do every thing possible to assist them. The use of benzol for tbe prevention of diseases that attack the tobacco plant is a new development and the bill proposes"" a reduction of Id a gallon in respect of excise duty levied on benzol used for that purpose. Leader of the Australian Country party) [9.37] I was interested to hear the Minister( Mr Pollard) point with pride to the. advances made by the Glen Davis project under the sympathetic administration of Labour Governments. The honourable gentleman failed, however, to relate the true financial results of that venture. General's report, in the year 1941, before a Labour Government became responsible for the undertaking the loss sustained was £177,219. In 1942, after Labour had assumed office, the loss increased to £263,123; in 1943 to £296,981; in 1944 to £303,788: and in 1945 to £342,055. The results for 1945 arc the latest available figures. 1 draw specific attention to the comments made on this venture by the Auditor-General. In his report for 1945I object to the Minister merely telling 46 the Auditor-General saidBetween. 1st January and 30th June, 1940, the Coimnonwea.lth advanced amounts totalling critical. I remind the right honourable £185,918, increasing the amount of Commonwealth funds advanced for the purposes of this undertaking to £3,091,735. This amount includes £325,22!) for the Pish River Water Scheme, and £150,000 for working expenses, but does nut include a bank guarantee of £100,000 also for working expenses. It was estimated that a further amount of £250,000 was necessary to finance the undertaking to the stage of production. An advance of this amount was approved by Cabinet in June, 194(i. £200,000 of which had been paid to the Company when this report was being compiled. Interest accrued hut uivpaid from 1st January, 1942, to 30th June, 1.940, on advances made by the Commonwealth amounted to £2S7,009. So, in addition to the losses I have outlined, tbere is an accumulated loss of £2S7,069 in respect of unpaid interest. to the increase of the output of this venture, he also should say that it has resulted in great financial loss to the taxpayers and the nation. Repatriation) [9.40] -This measure has relation to the excise on oil from shale processed at Glen Davis. When, in 1937, the National Oil Proprietary Limited Agreement Bill was introduced into this House by a. former Minister for Defence, Sir Archdale Parkhill, the honourable gentleman in glowing terms predicted a very bright future .for the venture, stressing the great advantages it would confer upon the nation. I believe that the only honourable member supporting the government of the day who opposed the measure was the present honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), and he offered trenchant criticism of the proposal. In introducing the measure, Sir Archdale Parkhill paid a great triAccording to tbe Auditorbute to the former honourable member for Macquarie, Mr John Lawson, for the important part he had played in the negotiations which led up to the establishment of this industry. It is true that the venture has not measured up to the high hopes held by the government responsible for it. What does the Leader of tbe Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) suggest should be done about it? half truths about the undertaking.",59,Excise Tariff Validatio N

263,Mr Fadden,That is not the point.,60,Excise Tariff Validatio N
264,Mr Barnard,"It is easy to begentleman that he was a member of the Government responsible for the establishment of the undertaking and that its management has not changed during the period that Labour governments have been in office. Though we are searching assiduously for flow oil in this country, .1 believe that we shall have to depend to a great degree on oil from shale to meet a portion of our future requirements. It is too early yet to form an opinion as to whether flow oil will be discovered in sufficient quantities to meet our needs. Up to date the prospects of obtaining oil from that source are not hopeful. Shale is to be found in'fairly substantial quantities, not only at Glen Davis, but also at Latrohe, in the electorate of tbe honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Dulhie). The deposits at Latrobe are said to show a high oil content. Expenditure on the production of oil from shale during the war years, when oil was so badly needed in Australia, may have been costly, but the war-time experiment has been of great value in showing us how best we can produce oil from shale in the future. I rose to make that point. I should like the Leader of the Australian Country party to say what be would have done. Would he have cut the loss and closed Glen Davis and ceased investigations? Would be have said that the undertaking cost the taxpayers too much? I think so. That has been the policy of the Opposition parties for years. 'They have never persisted in investigations in any field. They cannot deny that they established the Glen Davis project. This Government was clothed with' the responsibility of pursuing investigations there. I hope we shall lie able to continue them, for I believe that -ultimately they will be fruitful. discussion has centred on shale oil at Glen Davis. I rise to correct tbe Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Barnard) about bow the Glen Davis project was estab-' Iished. It was established purely as a defence measure. I know, as a member of the Cabinet at that time, that it was never expected to be economical. Development was delayed for years. The proposal to re-onen it was brought down by the then Minister for Defence, not by tbe Minister for Commerce, because it was a defence measure. It . is certainly not in the same category as the Labour Government's distilling of power alcohol from wheat. That was a criminal thing to do in a world starving for food. The petrol from Glen Davis is produced from shale of which there is an abundance. It was intended to be used if our supplies from overseas were cut off. It was valuable in that it did produce some petrol whereas wheat did not produce any. Mr Por/LARD -It did. Warracknabeal distillery did not produce any. will not go into that any further. Ministers know tbe facts. Mr Davis, a subscriber to the capital of the company, made his investment largely out of patriotism. I remember fhe correspondence. He did not expect to make any money out of it. Anyway, the Glen Davis project must be regarded as a war measure. We hope that wars are finished, but we suspect not. The question is whether it is worth preserving as a defence auxiliary. If we still think that we are in danger, as we well may be, there are three courses to consider. One is to discontinue operations and keep the plant in good repair for use in an emergency. If employment is a factor and it is considered that to close down the plant would create unemployment, other measures must be examined or operations may continue but it is ridiculous to levy excise on petrol produced at Glen Davis and it must be lifted. Confusion has existed on this bill. One would think from the discussion that it was brought down to validate an agreement on the enterprise at Glen Davis. It is nothing of the kind. That is incidental. It is a bill to validate the collection of excise. An act of the Lyons Government included an amendment moved by a member of the Australian Country party and accepted by the then Government, although it had the necessary numbers to reject it, to ensure that schedules of customs and excise must be ' considered by the Parliament within six months of being tabled.

278,Mr Holt,"If the Minister for Postprosperity, it is obvious that tbe claim must fail. Therefore, I suggest that Ave apply a similar test of genuineness to the Government's claim that it is now 'making the substantial concessions of tax that the Prime Minister has indicated. The right honourable gentleman is a remarkable mana financial wizard. He reminds rue of a celebrated juggler who was able to keep eight balls in the air at the one time. The right honourable gentleman keeps about eight taxes in operation at the one time. Directing our attention to one of the taxes, he says that that, as the Treasurer reduces the he has substantially reduced it, and hopes that by a rapid movement of tbe remaining ones he will distract our attention from the fact that we are bearing heavier imposts-in other taxes. I put it to the House that the real test of whether these concessions have been made in the time that the Prime Minister claims is to ask ourselves, "" What is the quantum of taxes still being collected by the Commonwealth Government, and what number of taxpayers are represented by that quantum ?"" I propose to go back to the end of hostilities, which is the period to which tbe Prime Minister referred. changed substantially since then, and we can take it, for tbe purposes of this argurapidly. Now we see them, now we do ment, as being a static figure. In 1944-45, not. They are here, they are gone. He just before the end of hostilities, the actual collections from income tax and indirect, taxes amounted to £345,000,000. In the following year, 1945-46, although we were given various tax concessions, the estimated' collection of £343,000,000 proved, in -the result, to be £358,000,000. number of people and are getting, broadly In 1946-47, again despite these tax concessions, which were to give much relief to tbe people, the estimated collection was can we claim that we have reduced taxes? £348,000,000; but we know that, on the Government's own figures at the end of nine months of tbe financial year, tbe estimate will be greatly exceeded. Therefore, let us test the claim of the that Australia Treasurer that remissions of taxes, amounting to £71,000,000, will have been granted, against the collection of '£345,000,000 at the conclusion of hostilities. The remissions of £34,000,000 which the Treasurer now proposes to make will give, on his claim, a total of £71,000.000. That leaves tax remissions of £37,000,000 that he claims he Mr Bolt. has already given to tbe people. So, if we take tbe £37,000,000 from tbe £345,000,000, which was. the figure at the conclusion of hostilities, it is reasonable to suppose that we are paying £308,000,000 in taxes to-day; However, I remind the House again that the Government, on its own admission, estimated that it would collect £348,000,000, or £40,000,000 more than the figure which should be collected if the remissions are genuine In the result, it will collect very much more. Quite obviously, what is happening is rate of income tax, but retains >heavy indirect taxes such as sales tax, excise, customs and pay-roll tax, he is more than able to recover his losses. The real test is: How much is the Commonwealth taxpayer paying to-day compared with what be had to pay during tbe war? The remarkable thing is that a government which claims to have given substantial tax relief is to-day collecting from taxes as much as, if not niore than, it was during the war. reduction. Our population has not able gentleman is trying his powers of mesmerism. He juggles his figures very makes a reduction of one tax and invites us to watch it closely. While we are doing that an increase is made elsewhere-^not an increase of tlie rate of tax, I admit, but an increase in quantum. After all, if we are dealing with the same speaking, the same quantum of tax from them, how in the name of-all that is holy The realistic test which tbe country must apply is: What do we still pay? Last night the Treasurer, in replying to the debate on the financial statement, dealt with the claim which I have made , able member will not be in order in referring to a debate which has concluded. linked with this bill.

Tbat has been the experience of the Government in recent months. When the Treasure:' supplies flie table I. suggest to him that be should not merely show the rates of tax in Great Britain. I agree with him that taxes are very heavy in that country. At this distance 1 do not presume to criticize the domestic policy of the United Kingdom Government; but I am not prepared to accept as a guide for proper governmental policy in Australia what the Socialist Government in Great Britain is doing to the people of that country. I should like tbe Prime Minister to inform us bow our rates of tax-and in rates of tax I include not only rates of income tax-compar e with the. taxes per head of the population in the United States of America, Canada, South Africa, and even New Zealand. I believe that it will be found that rates of tax in those countries are very much lower than they are in Australia. Karlier this evening, the. Treasurer said, on another matter, that be wguld like to be fair to every one. He has been thoroughly unfair to Australian taxpayers in the manner in which he has allocated these remissions of income tax. To establish this particular point, I bring to the notice of the House the proportion of the national income which is still coming into tbe hands of the Government by way of revenue collections. If my overall figure' property in which he invested his money. of £1,200,000.000 for the national income is roughly correct, then it is also broadly Commonwealth is a gold mine for the true to gay that the Government is now collecting approximately one-third of the total national income. We do not have to think very deeply in order to appreciate what sort of. a burden that is for any producing economy to carry. In reducing taxes, the Trea[74] surer has seen fit to remove a substantial burden of the tax from a very large proportion of the Australian public. That has much to commend it. One can make a powerful argument in terms of social justice in favour of reducing taxes on the lower incomes to an absoluteminimum, if not to vanishing point. That is not merely a matter which gives risepolitically very popular. By tbe same token, it can be economically unsound if it is carried to such a point that the burden of taxes remaining on tbe rest of the taxpayers is such that thenceforth the. community does not give the production of which it is ca.pable. That can easily happen. The goose that is laying the golden eggs might, lose its appetite for the task; and those with the job of carrying production for the rest of the community might find that the task has become too onerous. Then tbe total volume of production, might decline. No government can consider that it has handled this problem successfully if it. keeps production at the same level. In a country which is developing, as Australia is, we should be able to point to a steadily rising volume of production, a steady growth, of the national .income, and, in consequence, a progressive improvement of pur standards of living. BecauseI havo found repeatedly a complete failure on the part of honourable members opposite to realize just what the impact of this tax burden can mean to tbe small business, or small country property-holder, I suggest that it would be a very good thing if every honourable member upon his election to this Parliament were given his three years' salary in advance and compelled to invest it in either a business or a property. If he did so, I am . certain that he would realize just what the impact of excessive tax rates can mean to the development of the small business or Every business which is carried on in tlie Commonwealth Government, whether it lie successful or not in the long run. or whether it returns reasonable profits to those whose money is invested in it. I shall comment briefly upon the experience of a small business. Eirst, it has to pay tax on the pay-roll of its employees. The Income Ta, employees themselves pay tax on tlie wages they draw .from the business. If ol income should get what they are the business purchases capital goods in justly entitled to from our economy, order to continue in production it pays but quite frequently tbere is loose thinksales tax on those goods. All petrol used ing on the part. in. the conduct of the business, and every telephone call that is made, or every tinnlv that because persons earn' good instamp bought in the business, yields addicomes on paper they are to be shot at tional revenue to the Commonwealth. And when the goods, themselves are manutrmng such uicomes-so often retards some factured and. purchased by the genera! Australian industry which would be cappub he, the sales tax paid on those goods ""be of giving additional employment and further helps to swell tbe revenues of tbe helping to improve the standard of HvinGovernment. Finally, if f a t e r tributed all this to the coffers of the on tins.matter I direct, the attention of I reasury, some profit, remains to those unorable members to the experience of who have invested their monev and put tlie United States of America, and their work into the business, the GovernSoviet Russia. In the United -States of ment, steps in again and levies further W n c a, where ta , e s prior to the tax on those profits. That, of course nes-eTIT is not. something I attack as a point of criticism; I am merely trying to impress upon tbe Government and its supporters (he need to encourage all industry great or small, primary or secondary.'Everv Sm-ie. 1?, . industry conducted in this country, and every property from which production proceeds, is a source of revenue and wealth 10 the people of Australia. If the Government is going to ask a steadilv diminishing number of taxpayers-because the Government, is removing a great countries which still rely upon body of the wage-earners from tbe income tax field-to carry indefinitely a burden of tax which was imposed ""under the .

Therefore, I again ask tlxPrime Minister to consider that request which was made to him, not only by members of the Opposition, but also by honourable members opposite who were formerly members of the War Expenditure Committee, and which they believe proved its usefulness by being able to apply a brake nn extravagant expenditure, and even by its very existence acted as a curb upoi'. reckless and unwarranted departmental expenditure. It is commentary not merely on the apathy of the Government, but, also cm the apathy and lethargy of the Parliament as a whole that honourable members have not. insisted upon the appointment of suc.li a body. Finally, I wish to deal with th simplification of our taxation legislation. I know that all governments set themselves the goal of simplifying the taxation law, so that not. only the Parliament but also private citizens cau understand it . I read during this week that in Prance recently a. man. who had wrestled with his income tax return for three weeks had hanged himself. I am sure that many of us have often felt like doing that when we have had. to wrestle with the returns that we are required to make periodically, a.nd the tax assessments that we receive. If that is tbe situation in connection with the filling in of returns and the study of tax assessments, what situation is caused by the mass of tax law that is now embodied in our Income Tax Assessment Act? Although this is merely an amending bill, the explanatory memorandum in connection with it consists of 100 pages. Wc have placed before us a bill of somewhat similar proportions almost every year. Speaking frankly, as one who has had some training in the law and some experience in this Parliament, I have not begun to understand one-tenth of what is contained in our Income Tax Assessment Act. If that is true of me, it is also true of most honourable members, and certainly of 999 of every 1.00.0 members of the community generally. So. as ive have 1 passed through tbe emergency period of the war and can reflect on some of the I claim problems that were then created, I ask the Government to give real consideration to the simplification of our tax laws. Many amendments are proposed by the bill, and other desirable alterations have doubtless been brought to the notice of all members of the Parliament by in terested organizations and parties. I. .'-hall not refer to them at this point, because I. can do so at tbe committee stage of the hill. But I do put it finally to the Prime Minister and his colleagues, that they cannot expect to maintain a healthy national economy if they continue indefinitely a burden of tax collection which represents one-third of the national income. No country, particularly one that has an ageing population and vast resources to develop, could hope to carry on with such a burden and provide tbe reasonable standard of living which can lie given if development is allowed to proceed as it should. Wc fc have to get, out, of our minds the matteT of political expediency and get into our minds a realization of what is sound for the economy of this country, not merely that which is popular with the electors at any given time. If that be done, not merely will a greater measure of justice be meted out to all sections of the community, but in addition Australia will advance as it should. marks will be devoted principally, not to the bill itself, but to tbe resolution on which it is founded. I invite honourable members to study that resolution. A t one time, our tax law embodied the sound principle that he who pays tax should be able to work out his own assessment. To the present-day income tax experts, that has become an old-fashioned idea. The position has now been reached at which even the experts have lost themselves in the maze which they have created. The act, its various interpretations, and the rulings upon it , have become so complicated that no two tax assessors are likely to arrive at the same conclusions. We must depend more upon their interpretation, not of the act but of the interpretations of the act, and much more upon their ability to understand departmental rulings"" in respect of",64,Skconjj Beading
283,Mr Lang (Beid) [10.29],".My reit. Because of the way in which the matter is handled to-day, a tax assessment has become a kind of lottery. Identical returns by two different taxpayers with the same amount of earnings in the same industry, and with tbe same claims for exemption, produce two different assessments. The returns are alike in everyway, but when the assessments arrive they are entirely different. The average taxpayer has given up attempting to work out what be ought to pay. Until this new school of tax experts undertook the work of the taxpayer, each individual made out his own ta.x return and knew what his assessment would be. When he had lodged his return, be knew to the penny what be would have to pay. liis exemptions were fixed. He deducted from those his gross income, and. the calculation of tlie amount which he had to pay was a matter of simple arithmetic. It has now reached the realms of higher mathematics. It is about as easy to understand the theory governing atomic energy as it is to understand tbe tax tables. Even when the mathematician has finished his calculations, there is the unknown factorthe Commissioner's discretion. [Quorum formed,.'] Tbe Commissioner has discretion over everything, no matter what the law may be. Instead of introducing this measure which, no doubt, will make confusion the more confounded, tbe Treasurer would have been much better advised to have brought in a bill simplifying taxation procedure. Surely it is possible to reduce the amount of tax payable to a matter of simple-calculation. The present practice is to regard every taxpayer as a potential crook, so taxation law has been 7 devised to close every possible loophole against, evasion. But what has been the net result? The big tax evader has been able to find plenty of methods to outwit the experts; but the majority of taxpayers, honest, conscientious, and anxious to meet their just commitments, need no such refuge. Under tbe present system, they have no way of knowing what their commitments will be. So they are all placed in the position of being probable law-breakers. How many members of this House could.work out their own tax assessments by applying tbe provisions of Mr Cong. (he resolution upon which this measure is founded? Yet we are called upon to approve that resolution. The taxpayer is not even in the position of having tbe act or this bill before him.' I draw tbe attention of honourable .members to paragraph a of the resolution, which states(a) It -the taxable income does not exceed £1,000 tlie rate of tax for every £1 of taxable income up to and including £250 shall be nil and the rate of tax for every £1 of taxable income in excess of £250 shall' be 25.032 pence increasing uniformly by .032 of one penny for every £1 hv which the taxable income exceed* £251. Mr Xuoaii'SOS -That is not very difficult to understand. departmental mumbo-jumbo. To arrive at tbe amount, of tax to be paid it is then necessary to' make separate calculations applying altogether different formulas to the exemptions and concessional rebates allowed. . Then tbere are these strange innovations-strang e to me and to most people who bear them -calle d notional income and average income. Paragraph a of the resolution states(c) For every £.1 of the actual taxable income from personal exertion of a taxpayer deriving a notional income, as specified by sub-section (1.) of section eighty-six. of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1030-1947,, the rate of tax shall be ascertained by dividing the tax that would be payable under DivisionA upon a taxable income from personal exertion equal to his notional income by that notional income. That is part of the .proposals now before the House and on. which honourable members will have to vote. I have to admit that, I have read the paragraph over and over again and cannot understand it.

289,Mr Fuller,"The honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller) has finished interjecting, I shall proceed. This House will shortly have fro vote on the taxation proposals that I have quoted, and of course they will become law; but I still say to honourable members, in. a friendly way of course, that an effort should be made to introduce some reforms. That criticism is not aimed at the Government but at the officials who are responsible for these things-the men who make governing and the task of members of Parliament difficult. How many people know what a ""notional income"" is? I do not know, let alone understand, how tintax on a "" notional income "" will be w orked out. I have not heard of "" notional income and I doubt if any other honourable member has heard of it. How in tbe name of all that is good will this tax be worked out? The purpose of income tax legislation is surely not to produce a race of taxation experts, or to create mathematical wizards. In the past) it has always been believed that the purpose of such a measure is to raise revenue. is realized and taxpayers are treated justly, taxation law should be as simple as possible, and that is what I am putting before the House. The stage has now been reached where the taxation law has become so complicated that the only way out, appears to be an entirely new approach, and a new set of taxation principles. Every Treasurer knows bow. much money he needs, and how much can lie released in the various income groups by applying different scales of taxes. Should it not be possible to raise the revenue required by some simple formula ? If the Government's present 1 experts are unable or unwilling to understand this elementary necessity for a reform of our income tax laws, then this Parliament should undertake the task. A committee of members of this House should be able to provide a practical set of taxation rules that would provide as much revenue as the present complicated system. That is what I am asking should, be done. The same amount of revenue would be raised, but it would be done by a simple system easily understood by the people who have to pay. It is now provided in tbe act that the odd pence in an assessment, are to be ignored. If a man's tax works out at £25 7s. 7d., he is required to pay to .the nearest Is., yet, on the way to the final figure, it is necessary to make twenty or more involved calculations, some of them to three places of decimals, not of a Is. but of a Id. Then, when all that is over, the department wants the tax to be paid to tbe nearest Is. Tbat example demonstrates better than anything else the need for clarification and simplification. This Government should again try to evolve a system under which a taxpayer can work out his own assessment, and know just how much he has to pay. While the Income Tax Assessment Act is in its present, chaotic condition we shall always have to be tinkering .with it. When one taxation formula is tested in the courts, and found not to produce the results desired, a new formula has to be substituted. The Government will be well advised to examine the whole position without calling in the experts. A taxpayer, under the present system, may employ a taxation expert, even one who has come-froin So long as that purpose the Taxation Department itself, who will make out his return from books accurately kept, but he will not be able to say what the assessment will be. That is wrong and unjust. Tbe act should be simple, honest, and straightforward. If it'were simplified, as I suggest, it would prevent a lot of ill feeling which at present exists. Most people are prepared to pay their taxes, but they resent, the hardship and inconvenience now associated with making returns. adjourned.

294,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [10.57].,"who would be able to give more time to the treatment of ex-servicemen. Over 800 ex-servicemen are attending outpatient clinics of the Repatriation Department already, and the number is steadily increasing. Honourable members will appreciate the difficulties experienced by these men when they have to travel considerable distances from tbe city and move from one place to another in order 10 receive treatment.. Tbe Government now has an excellent opportunity to centralize the whole of the out-patient branches of tbe Repatriation Department in one clinic. Everybody interested in this matter expected that it would take advantage of tbe opportunity. However, 11 branch of the Taxation Department now proposes to take over the office space which ought, to be reserved for tbe needs of disabled ex-servicemen. It appears that, if there is a clash of opinion between ex-servicemen's interests and those of some government department, tbe Government is prepared, in the main, to allow the ex-servicemen's claims to go by tbe board. and privileges of ex-servicemen are not very important in the eyes of tbe Government. It receive bundles of telegrams protesting against the proposal. Ex-servicemen's organizations are protesting that their members will be inconvenienced to an extraordinary degree. Men who have already had clinical treatment are vociferous in their appeals for our assistance. They have had to tolerate a great deal of discomfort, and they have made many sacrifices and rendered valuable service to the community. I do not know what the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr readily available to them. Before public Barnard) thinks about this matter. In the past. Ministers for Repatriation have been ""game"" to stand up for the rights of ex-servicemen against Cabinet opposition. Some of them were prepared even to res'gn their posts in the defence of tbe rights of ex-servicemen. The present Minister for Repatriation is entrusted with a very special duty. Apparently, some Ministers are prepared to overlook their obligation to ex-servicemen. Such Ministers, of course, have no personal knowledge of tbe difficulties experienced by ex-servicemen. They arc prepared,when pressure is applied to them in Cabinet, to say: ""Yes, let the Repatriation Department be housed anywhere. What does it matter if ex-servicemen suffer? They have fought for tbe country, but their period of service is over; they are broken and maimed, and they can be of no further use to us. Let us push them into -wiie corner, no matter where, and we shall find some excuse, for doing so"". Tbe Minister is charged with the definite and onerous duty f pre0 serving the interests of ex-servicemen. His task is to make -sure that, their needs are not neglected and to interpret tbe wishes of a grateful country with regard to ex-servicemen. If pressure has been brought to bear upon him by his Cabinet colleagues on behalf of some revenue-seeking department, his duty is to resist such pressure and to ensure that ex-servieemen secure tbe maximum amount of consideration that can. be given to them on behalf of a very p'-ateful community. The Government, Apparently the rights which is supposed to represent the community, should bo no less grateful than are the people. It will be a standing disgrace to the Government if it refuses to .yield to the pleas of those who ask that U not -surprising that we medical services of the Repatriation Department be established at a central position in Sydney. If it fails to do as we ask. it will be revoking a definite undertaking by yielding to pressureexerted on behalf of a revenue department to the exclusion of the rights of disabled ex-servicemen, who will be forced to travel great distances at considerable inconvenience in order to secure clinical attention which is their right and which, in common justice, should be made opinion becomes so overwhelming as to force the Minister to change his attitude on this matter, I ask him to take action to grant ex-servicemen the just treatment that is their due. to make a persona] explanation.

That is a.' wilful and deliberate misstatement and is in keeping with tbe falsity of other statements made by tbe honourable niemher for Reid. As I pointed out previously, when the Bavin Government went to the country in. New South Wales, that honourable gentleman promised the electors that he would abolish the unemployment relief tax of 3d. in the £1, but when he was returned to power he increased tbe tax to Is. in the £1.

His party went to the country in New South Wales last Saturday with ton or twelve candidates; but I doubt whether it will be represented by any candidates in the new Parliament. I . think tbe people of this country are fully alive to the honourable member and tbe game be is playing in attacking the Australian Labour party. The honourable member's stooges fought for him for years. I do not propose to say any more about him. AgainI give a full and complete denial to his suggestion that during my business life of over twenty years I sought a moratorium of any kind. My business has always been solvent, but, if I had followed the standards of the honourable member perhaps I should not have needed to take cover. Repatriation) [11.8] I a.m somewhat amused by the attitude of some members of the Opposition. I do not include the honourable member for Calare( Mr Howse) in this category, but I do include the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison), who has for a long time past, and particularly during the war years when accommodation, in Sydney was so difficult to obtain, accused the Government of ""spreading out"" all over tbe city and needlessly occupying space which could have been made available to ex-servicemen who wished to re-establish themselves in business. Now, when if, is proposed that the Taxation Department should occupy portion of its own building and vacate other premises which might be made available to the ex-servicemen that is wrong. The plain fact, is that in the view of the honourable member the Government is never right and never can be right. Possession was taken of Grace Building in August, 1942, under a hirings order issued under National Security Regulations, and during the war the building was used for United States Forces' and Royal Navy and Commonwealth services. The property was acquired by the Commonwealth on the Sth November, 1945. by compulsory process, "" for the purposes of the Commonwealth"", while the building was still occupied by the defence services. It is a fact that the Repatriation Commission initiated the proposal to acquire the building, .but at no time has it been understood or intended that the building was for tbe exclusive use of the commission. Statements in the press that the appeal lodged, by Grace Brothers against the resumption was made mainly because it was planned to establish a repatriation clinic are not correct.

The very urgent need for additional space of other departments led to a re-exaioination of nil allocations in the building by a sub-committee of Cabinet. Following an inspection of Randwick Hospital hy Ministers and carefu l consideration of the matter by tbe Cabinet sub-committee, the Minister for Repatriation agreed that tbe Repatriation Commission should, in company with other departments in Sydney, reduce its present requirements to an absolute minimum and release the tenth floor for occupation by the Taxation Department on the understanding that it would revert to the commission at the earliest possible date. The allocation of the tenth floor to the Taxation Department is not considered as permanent. Further, those parts of the clinic intended to occupy the ninth and eleventh floors will do so. It is, therefore, not correct to say, as reported, that the. occupation of the tenth floor by the Taxation Department has stopped the move of the clinic from Randwick.

It is perfectly true that when I became Minister for Repatriation the ninth, tenth and eleventh floors of that building were intended to be used as an out-patients' clinic and the military hospital at Randwick was no longer to be used for that purpose. 'Kandwiek Hospital has been used as an out-patients' clinic since World WarI . , and while it is a fact that it is out of the way, hard to reach and inconvenient, the fact remains that for many years past it has been used for that, purpose. It is also true that the fares of all out-patients who travel to Randwick are paid by the Repatriation Department. I agree with all that has been said about Randwick as an outpatient centre. It is unsuitably located and lacks conveniences. It would be ideal to have the out-patients treated at Grace Buildingi n the centre of the city. Tbe bead office and the out-patients department would be under the one roof. The intention is that that ideal shall ultimately be realized. In any large city, however, it is hard to get accommodation for Commonwealth departments.

TheRepatriation Commission was faced with the fact that it. did have accommodation, admittedly unsatisfactory, at Randwick for out-patients. It was put to me that we .should therefore try to squeeze up a little in Grace Building to allow the Taxation Department to have at least one floor until other accommodation could be found for it. I agreed. In fact I made the suggestion that if the department would be satisfied with one floor, and my colleagues in the Ministry agreed, they could have tit. I take full responsibility for the arrangement. I shelter behind no one. I agreed to tbe proposal and that decision will stand. vacates the tenth and eleventh floors the Taxation Department will go on to the tenth, and the eleventh will be occupied by a part of our out-patients department. 1 r was originally suggested that we should occupy tbe tenth floor, and not the eleventh, but because of the layout, of the eleventh planned by the Repatriation Commission we agreed to let the Taxation Department have the tenth. Whatever is said or done, and regardless of how many telegrams I receive and how many representations may be made by honourable members, that arrangement will stand as far as I am concerned, because I believe it is the best that can be made in the circumstances. It gives equity to all concerned. Weeks ago I told a section of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia what was proposed. Only now are protests being lodged. Honourable members opposite are not tbe only people who have received telegrams. I have sheaves of them. believe that I am doing no injustice to ex-servicemen, because I think the Taxation Department's occupancy of the tenth floor of Grace Building will not inconvenience the Repatriation Department for long. Statements that tbe Government lacks appreciation of the services of ex-servicemen and has no knowledge of, or interest in, them are irresponsible, and show little concern for, and do a disservice to, them.

Two things are being done: Attention is being provided for thein in the central office -and congestion is being relieved at Randwick. Everything is being done to meet a difficult situation. Shortage of space is at the bottom of tbe problem. We are doing our best in this difficult period to give equitable treatment to every one concerned. As soon as the Taxation DepartAs soon as the Royal Navy ment can be provided for elsewhere, it will vacate the tenth floor, because, as tbe Prime Minister said to me, ""Grace Building is recognized as the home of ex-servicemen and is to be made available to them at the earliest possible date"" Question resolved in tbe affirmative.

Cochrane, ol the Department <if and Technical Mission to Germany, which i administered by the Secondary industries Division of my department. Both the United Kingdom and tlie United .States of America have obtained the services of eminent Gorman scientists and technicians. Mr Cochrane was . asked to ascertain if any of the leading German scientists and technicians, possessing outstanding knowledge mid skill not to be found in Australia or Great Britain, would tie willing to come to Australia. A special committee, on which are represented government departments, the universities, ihe Australasian Coujicil of Trade Unions and the Chamber nf Manufactures, has been set up to examine all proposals to bring German scientists and technicians to Australia. It is emphasized that: the Government will only take such action when it. is satisfied that the knowledge fii experience possessed by the German scientist is not available in Australia or the United Kingdom. Xo such person will be brought to Australia, even for a short time, without its being certain that employment facilities unthroughout Australia available to permit of the full benefit of his experience being obtained by Australia. 2. N""o final approval for employment and entry into Australia of German scientists and technicians has yet been granted by me or by the Minister for Immigration. An endeavour is being made to obtain the services, if possible, of the following German scientists:Dr. Dauulat, scientist and inventor of ""the ""'*"" T.nrgi "" process for the extraction of town gas from brown coal. Heir Briiggerinann. designing engineer, who designed the T.nrgi "" plant above mentioned. Dr. K . F. Tottweiler. chemical engineer, possessing outstanding qualifications, who has been engaged in scientific teaching and scientific research in Germany. It is considered that his services will lie of great value in respect of chemical and biochemical research in Australian universities and research institutions. If it is later decided to obtain the services of other eminent German scientists and tech-' nicians for. Australia, should such be practicable. T shall inform the House accordingly.

With the termination of the war, the hoard's war-time functions, viz -determinatio n of the best use and distribution of Allied food supplies and effecting economies in their transport-were adapted lo Ihe needs of the transitional period and niemliership of its commodity committees was expanded. The special meeting on urgent food problems, held at Washington in May, 1040, under the auspices of the United Nations Pood II ml Agriculture Organization, recommended the replacement of the Combined Food Board by a new body representative of all important food importing or exporting countries.
