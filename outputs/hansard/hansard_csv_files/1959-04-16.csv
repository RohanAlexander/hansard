He is confined to his bed with influenza and is expected to be there for at least two days. addressed to the Treasurer. Mindful of the conditions of the income tax act which allow rebates for education expenses for school children, and mindful also of the far greater expense often incurred for young people in tertiary education, will the Treasurer consider amending the income tax acts to allow rebates of education expenses incurred on behalf of students receiving full-time tertiary education, including those with Commonwealth scholarships? House will be aware that this Government has shown a keen appreciation of the problems of parents and students so far as education expenses are concerned. Since this Government has been in office it has liberalized education conditions to a considerable degree. However, I appreciate the point raised by the honourable member and can assure him that in conjunction with a multitude of other matters on which representations have been received for some relief, this one will be considered also in connection with the forthcoming Budget. General whether he was in the House recently when the ingenuous member for Mallee issued an invitation to the Minister for Primary Industry to visit his electorate. After some billing and cooing the kindly Minister replied that he would be honoured to visit such an important electorate. Accordingly, I ask the Postmaster-General whether he has felt the impact of the current upsurge in Sydney to fulfil one's obligation for the benefit of the community. If so, will he visit Pennant Hills in my electorate and see for himself the need for providing that centre with a new post office? I may add that, probably as one of the inducements to go to the Mallee, the honourable member for that electorate may offer the Minister a sprig of dried fruits and a bag of nibble-nuts, but the electorate of Mitchell has far greater virtues than that. It embraces the oldest settlements in Australia but, unfortunately, the Pennant Hills post office is vieing with the antiquity of the electorate. member should ask his question. the Postmaster-General often wears the Davidson tartan tie, so as an inducement honourable member to ask his question. General: What say, on 16th May, we agree in the morning to provide Pennant Hills with a new post office and go to Ebenezer in the afternoon where the oldest Presbyterian kirk in Australia is holding its anniversary, and offer thanks for the Minister's beneficence? one of the rare occasions when I do not happen to be proudly sporting my Davidson tartan tie. HadI known that the honourable member for Mitchell was going to mention it in his question I would have made sure I was wearing it. The honourable gentleman has invited me to visit his electorate to look at the Pennant Hills post office and he referred to some inducement offered to my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry, to visit the Mallee electorate. It occurs to me that when I visit Pennant Hills-and I would then be wearing my tartan tie-the honourable member for Mitchell might offer me another inducement which has a background that it shares with tartan. On a number of occasions the honourable member has raised with me the question of the provision of a new post office at Pennant Hills, and consequently I know the situation there. The post office is conducted in an old building which is not satisfactory. It is a leased building, and I understand that the owner has been asking for some time that we should vacate the",7,Conciliation And Arbitration Act 1959 Act No 40 Of 1959

10,Mr Davidson,"I regret that this ispremises. So it is not a question of the department's determining whether or not a new building is required. That has already been determined. It is simply a question, Mr Speaker, of when we can proceed with the building of a new post office at Pennant Hills, taking into account the many demands on the department for capital works. I do know that the provision of a new post office at Pennant Hills is on the provisional draft programme of works for the forthcoming financial year, but that your indulgence, Mr Speaker, to ask does not constitute an undertaking that it will be proceeded with, because it has not National Service realizes this situation. I a very high priority, and whether or not it is proceeded with in this next year will depend on the amount of money available for capital works as determined at Budget time. However, I shall see whether I can make time to meet the honourable member's request for a visit to Pennant Hills. According to my present programme, I expect to spend the second week-end in May in Sydney, and the honourable member and I might get together for five minutes before then to see whether a visit can be arranged. tion is directed to the Minister for Labour. monwealth should supersede the judgment Has the Minister read the statement of the Richardson committee, expressed on page 6 of the printed report, that the parliamenalways done, if there is a case that merits tary salary increases now adopted by the Government were decided by the committee without regard to price and wage indicators? does intervene-is to present the facts on Does he realize the great contrast in principle between those words and the view expressed in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court's finding in the last judgment increasing margins in Australia, when the court rejected the principle that marginal rates should have relationship to the basic wage?

Is not this question related to legislation currently being debated by this chamber? able member for Blaxland is in order. you, Mr Speaker.

What we will do, as we have Commonwealth intervention-and usually in the basic wage cases the Government which the court itself can come to a conclusion. But it is the court itself that makes up its mind on the facts and decides what should be done, on the basis of the capacity of the community to meet the cost, in the basic wage cases, and what it thinks should be the rightful margins for workers in particular industries and occupations. I can assure the honourable gentleman that the normal practice of this Government would be followed, but the Government would not actively attempt to influence or determine the final action of the court. dressed to the Minister for Health.

18,Mr Murray,"My question is adcomfort, has had only one quarantine suspect in six years, who I understand was ultimately found to have chicken pox, not smallpox, and in view of the fact that this splendid accommodation is looked at so enviously by aged people's organizations, amongst others, will the Minister say how long it may be expected that this establishment will have to be maintained for possible quarantine use? is probable that the quarantine establishment at Townsville will need to be maintained for a considerable time to come. There are quarantine stations in each of the capital cities and, in addition, some subthat the Herald and Weekly Times Limited sidiary quarantine stations of which Townsville is one. It should be remembered that Queensland ports are ports of first entry for a great number of ships. I think that about 160 ships a year call at Townsville and many of them are from our near East where quarantinable diseases are prevalent. I think it would be taking a grave risk to abolish a quarantine station until we were certain that the risks of the introduction of epidemic diseases were considerably less than they are to-day. I do not know whether the honourable gentleman is aware that an announcement was made to-day of a fresh epidemic of smallpox in Singapore. I think that the day is still a long way off when we shall be able to abandon a quarantine station such as that at Townsville. Postmaster-General know that the Herald and Weekly Times Limited owns and controls the Melbourne "" Herald "", the "" SunHerald"", the Adelaide ""Advertiser"", and the Brisbane"" Courier-Mail"", and that by virtue of its ownership of the Melbourne ""Herald"" and the ""Sun-Herald"" it has virtual control of one television station in Victoria; by virtue of its control of the "" Advertiser "" it has control of another television station in South Australia; and by virtue of its control of the "" Courier-Mail"" and the "" Telegraph "" in Brisbane, it has control of a third television station in Queensland? Is it true that, under the legislation covering television, no one body is permitted to own more than two television stations? If this is true, will the Postmaster-General examine the share lists of the television stations in the three States mentioned and ascertain whether, in fact, the Melbourne "" Herald"" has a controlling interest in more than two television stations? mitted by the honourable member for Hindmarsh have been taken into full consideration, first of all by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board which heard applications for stations in Brisbane and Adelaide, and also by the Government in determining the granting of licences. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has said owns and controls the Adelaide"" Advertiser "", the "" Courier-Mail"", and the "" Telegraph "" in Brisbane. That statement is not correct. I am not quite sure of the percentage shareholding of the Herald and Weekly Times in the ""Advertiser"". I think it is about 30 per cent, and the "" Advertiser "" has some shareholding in the Herald and Weekly Times Limited. The Herald and Weekly Times Limited owns a 37 per cent, shareholding in Queensland Press Limited of which the "" Courier-Mail"" and the Brisbane"" Telegraph"" are subsidiaries. The ""Courier-Mail"" owns 17 per cent, of the shares in Brisbane Television Limited, and the Brisbane ""Telegraph "" owns 11 per cent. Therefore, the Herald and Weekly Times Limited has a 37 per cent, shareholding in companies which hold a total of 28 per cent, of the shareholding in Brisbane Television. This matter has been looked at. It does not constitute a breach of the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act, which provide that no person shall control, directly or indirectly, more than two television stations in Australia.

23,Mr Mackinnon,"My question ison public holidays, I have had a number of complaints from constituents, particularly those who obtain their newspapers by post, about the inconvenience involved. I ask the honourable gentleman: Is there available any method by which these people can have the services restored? method which could be adopted in order to have restored any service which it can be Shown is an essential one. This is a matter which has been referred to me on quite a number of occasions recently by honourable members on both sides of the chamber, and by members of another place, since the innovation was introduced by the Post Office, and I have had a look at it. The position is that, for some time, we have been providing on public holidays a number of services which were entirely uneconomic and for which there was very little demand indeed. Consequently, it was decided that we should have a look at the matter and see whether the uneconomic and unnecessary services provided on public holidays could be reduced. As the result of a careful survey, we find that it is possible to reduce these services in a number of areas. Not only does that reduce departmental expenditure, but also it ensures that the staff of the Post Office, who, under the previous system, were required to attend for duty on holidays, and consequently lost the benefit -of the public holidays, are enabled to enjoy those holidays just as do other members of the community. But, realizing that economy of operation and convenience of the staff must be conditional on the service which the department gives, we at present treat every case on its own merits-that is to say, we take into account the area in which the service may be discontinued, the extent of the holiday, and so on-and we always are prepared to continue a service if the closing of last twelve months, but in 1956 and 1957an office on a particular holiday, with the consequent cutting out of mail deliveries, would react against the convenience of the people in the district. There is no hard and fast rule. Individual decisions are made on the facts of each particular case. Prime Minister, I address my question to associated with a different language and the Treasurer. In the Governor General's Speech on the occasion of the opening of this Parliament, it was stated that the Constitutional Review Committee would be re-constituted without delay. I understand that, so far, nothing has been done by the Government parties about this matter. What does the Government propose to do about it, and will something be done forthwith? to say that nothing has been done by the Government parties, if, by that, the honourable member implies that the Government has not been considering this question. We have given it a good deal of consideration. It is not a simple matter, because, in the first place, I gather that the term of some members of the committee would expire by the end of June of this year. One former member of the committee is now a member of the Cabinet, and that causes some complication. However, I shall see how far thinking has advanced on some arrangement which would overcome the difficulties and enable the committee to get on with work which the Government is anxious to see proceed. to the Minister for External Affairs. It has been stated in some quarters that the calibre of Asian Colombo Plan students is not as high as it should be, and it has even been suggested that these students are below standard. I ask the Minister: Has he any information concerning the standard of education of Asian Colombo Plan students which he could give to the House? cism based on the proposition that Asian Colombo Plan students are not up to average calibre. I have notfiguresfor the the last two years for which I have seen figures-it appears that the proportion of passes by Asian Colombo Plan students at universities and technical colleges in Australia was actually greater than that of Australians in similar institutions.

28,Mr Casey,"I have heard some critisurroundings different from those they have been used to. Here and there we find failures, occasionally rather tragic failures, but on the average I think we have been quite well done by as regards the selection by other countries of Colombo Plan students to come here. The fact that the average of passes is higher than that among Australians is not surprising, because the students are all selected and nominated by the governments of their various countries, and one would naturally expect the students to be of somewhat higher calibre than would be found, on the average, among those who make their own decisions to attend universities in Australia. LEAD AND ZINC. the Minister acting for the Minister for Trade. What has been the nature of the representations made to the United States Government in relation to the unjust quotas imposed on imports of Australian lead, which have seriously affected the Australian industry and caused much unemployment in Broken Hill? Has the Minister received any firm assurance from the United States Government? If not, will he consider obtaining more of our oil requirements from non-dollar countries, particularly as oil is in excess supply at present and other countries can buy this commodity much more cheaply than Australia can? ber has voiced fears that are entertained by many people in Australia with regard to our future exports of lead and zinc to the United States of America. However, the Minister for Trade is in the United States at the present time, and this is one of the matters that he is discussing with the authorities there. I am sure that when he comes back he will have something to say to the honourable member and to the House question: Because of Mr Lalor's age and on this subject. address a question to the Treasurer, in the currently considered in connection with absence of the Prime Minister. It follows other retrenchments that have taken place. on a question which was previously asked, I will be discussing the problem with the dealing with the establishment of the Conunion and the Trades and Labour Council stitution Review Committee. In view of to-morrow morning, and a decision will be the fact that Commonwealth-State financial conveyed to the member later. relations represent perhaps the most important problem that this committee will be studying, will the right honourable gentleman ensure that no member of the committee takes the one-eyed view that was apparent from the report of the last committee, from which it appeared that certain members are in favour of transferring powers only from the States to the Commonwealth, and not from the Commonwealth to the States? I ask this question because I do not think we can have a proper review of Commonwealth-State financial relations if members of the committee adopt such an attitude. the honourable member's question is duly conveyed to the Prime Minister for his consideration. Dismissal of Employee. Minister for Works. I have previously referred this matter to him, but have not yet received any reply. The person concerned is Mr V. M. Lalor, who was formerly employed at Moorebank, New South Wales, by the Commonwealth Department of Works. Mr Lalor is an ex-serviceman who served in World WarI . and was decorated with the Military Medal and Bar and the Distinguished Conduct Medal. He has a reference, testifying to his outstanding tradesmanship, from the manager of the Department of Works sawmill in Canberra.

I refer to a statement by Mr Sasti of the Students' Association of Australia in January. Mr Sasti complained then that, due to the English arithmetical system in place of the metric system, which is used in Indonesia, and due to our system of weights and measures, when the students return home they do not receive salaries as high as the salaries paid is fully supporting me in this battle to get to students from Indonesian universities. ments and criticisms before, and I have had them all looked into. We watch quite carefully the question of disabilities of Asian students in this country and on their return home. However, I cannot really believe that there is any criticism worth listening to on the matter of weights and measures. This is something that any intelligent man -and these are all intelligent men-ca n overcome in a very short time. Generally speaking, what I said before as to the calibre of Asian students and the results obtained by them at universities and technical colleges is true. There is room for comment, I think, in respect of students who are away from their own countries for relatively long courses such as engineeralso of the Australian Broadcasting Control ing and medicine, which may engage them for periods of three, four, five and sometimes more years. To an extent they grow away from the environment of their own country. That, I think, is unavoidable, but on the whole I know of no criticism of the existing plan of education of Colombo Plan students in Australia that really is causing me, for my part, any appreciable concern. It is something we are watching all the time, and if the honourable gentleman has any particular matters in mind I should be very glad to hear from him. Postmaster-General a question. As television will not be available in Hobart until 1961, will he say whether in the meantime any plans are in hand to install coaxial cables or booster stations to widen the range of the Melbourne programmes received in the northern part of Tasmania, across Bass Strait? Further, will he arrange for his top television investigation man in MelbourneI believe his name is Mr Tasmania and particularly to investigate the possibility of a booster station on Mt. Roland, 30 miles south of Devonporta matter that I have raised here before-in order to prepare for Hobart television programmes being beamed to the north-west of the island? . Mr O'Grady was in Tasmania recently but did not visit the north-west coast.

The answer is, "" No "". No such plans exist at present. necessary and would involve unnecessary expenditure. The honourable member also asked that an official of the Postmaster General's Department should visit the north-west coast of Tasmania to make certain investigations. Officials, not only of the Postmaster-General's Department but Board, have made investigations of the various areas, including that to which the honourable member has referred, to ascertain the suitability for reception of television signals. I have no doubt that the area to which the honourable member has referred has already been properly investigated.

49,Dr. Donald Cameron,"In thematerials are governed by the Commonwealth on the advice of the Commonwealth X-ray and Radium Laboratory, which is, one might say, the chief authority in these matters. The Government has acted in accordance with the advice given by that authority. We have in the Australian Capital Territory, which is the only place where these things are at present relevant, introduced regulations to control the nontherapeutic use of X-rays-for example, for the fitting of shoes, and things of that nature. The control of the uses of radioactive materials is constantly administered by the Commonwealth in its own Territories in accordance with the advice that it obtains from the Commonwealth X-ray and Radium Laboratory. the Minister for Health. Has the Minister heard of an anti-cancer drug called krebiozen? If so, can the Minister inform the House whether he has any knowledge of the testing of this drug in America or elsewhere? stance is not a drug. The honourable gentleman refers to an attempt to produce an anti-cancer vaccine. Some experiments with this substance have been made in Canada in an attempt to produce an immune serum in horses by inoculating them with extracts of human breast cancer and thereby producing a vaccine which could be used in cases of disease in human beings. The substance is still in the experimental stages. So far, it has been used only for treatment in very advanced cases of cancer where all other methods of therapy have failed. No instances of cure have been reported, although there have perhaps been some encouraging experimental results. It is likely to be a long time, and to require a great deal of further investigation, before enable a television signal to reach country anything of real therapeutic value can be produced in this way, if indeed it ever can. Territories advise me when 1 can expect a reply to a question that I placed on the notice paper on 18th March dealing with the setting up of a housing commission in thc Northern Territory? subject is being obtained from the Administrator of the Northern Territory, and an answer is expected any day now. I shall then be in a position to answer the honourable gentleman's question. General a question which is supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Wilmot in regard to the extension of television to country areas. Have investigations been made both in the Nowra-Berry area and on the far south coast of New South Wales into the reception of telecasts? Will the Minister tell the House of the technical arrangements for boosting or stimulating television signals? In other words, will he tell the House of the technical methods of extending the range of television? Finally, if, in the future, officers of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board come to the south coast in relation to this matter, will the Minister accompany them and discuss it with the people there? commit myself to a number of visits to various places in the near future. I should like to make these visits, but I am afraid that I cannot. The honourable member asks whether I know of any investigation into the technical problems associated with the extension of television to country areas, with particular relation to his electorate. This is a subject which has been under consideration by the board's engineers for some considerable time, and the far south coast of New South Wales has been surveyed for the purpose. I have not in my mind the details of the report made as a result of these surveys, but I shall obtain them for the honourable member. He also asks what technical arrangements are possible to areas. There are several methods, and the technical problem is not in any way holding up the extension of television to country areas. The translator system, booster system, repeater system and micro-wave system may be used. These systems vary in their costs and methods. I am not in a position now to give the honourable member much detail about them, but I assure him that all are under investigation and that any one of them could be used, according to the conditions operating in the area.",17,Donald Cameron Mr Capital Territory

FRASER I ask the Treasurer: Does he know that many people throughout the community contribute regularly from their earnings towards the upkeep of elderly, not necessarily close, relatives who are pensioners, in order to supplement the income received by those people from pensions? Will the Minister agree that this sort of assistance to pensioners should be encouraged to whatever degree the Government can encourage it, and at the appropriate time, when the Budget is being prepared, will he consider allowing such payments, where they are provable, as deductions from taxable income? glad to examine the suggestion made by the honourable gentleman. It is a good thing, I believe, in this community that people have some sense of obligation to elderly members of their own families, and do not look simply to governments to discharge the obligations which all of us, I believe, owe to those who have done so much for us in their time. Whether something practical along the lines proposed by the honourable member can be worked out is a matter for investigation, and I should be glad to go into it. of the Minister for External Affairs been directed to the fact that a considerable amount of trouble associated with Asian students is due not so much, perhaps, to a lack of background training or natural ability as to their insufficient knowledge of the English language? Can arrangements be made for an intensive course of training here without a sufficient knowledge of the language, so that they may compete on more even terms in Australia? the governments of the Asian countries take my full time of half an hour because which send Colombo plan students here to if I did I might be precluding other honorensure that their nominees have an adequate able members from speaking.

It would be only of English. In selected cases we give them tedious repetition if I were to go into the an intensive short course in English which, details again. I think, has become known by the undignified title of a "" pressure cooker "" course, to try to bring them up to standard so that they can absorb and get the most out of their courses. I would remind the honourable member and the House that the great majority of the Asian students in Australia are private students. At the moment I think the number of Colombo Plan students in Australia is well under 900, whereas the total number of Asian students in Australia is about 6,000. Of course, we have much less control over non-Colombo Plan students, if it could be called control. The general public at least tends to think of all Asian students here as Colombo Plan students whereas, in fact, only a small proportion of them are Colombo Plan students.

60,Mr Turnbull (Mallee) [11.19],"IThree outstanding features of the debate so far on this bill and its two related measures have been the speeches of the three leaders of the parties, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), and the Postmaster General( Mr Davidson) who is acting Leader of the Australian Country Party. that I do not agree fully with any of those speeches. I believe that the Prime Minister's speech made very clear the whole meaning of the Richardson report, and he was able to correct many errors of thought which have been expressed in the press. But as my time is short 1 must point out quickly the things with which I do not agree. First of all, the Prime Minister made special reference to the wives of politicians. I give politicians' wives full credit, but I do not think the Prime Minister went far enough. He should have included the wives of hundreds of thousands of citizens in this great country. I think of the wives of primary producers, ministers of religion, union organizers and a tremendous number of others who have played a great part, not only in their husbands' occupations, but also in other ways in building up this great nation. Some one has said that it is from the fireside, around which linger the recollections of our mothers from the hearthstone and where our wives so often await us. that come all the hope, all the power and all the courage with which we fight the battle of life. All the credit is not restricted Country to politicians' wives. In the early days, in the sandswept area of the Mallee electorate in north-western Victoria, the wives of the pioneers played a tremendous part in the history of this great country. And not only there, but also throughout the whole of Australia the wives of pioneers and workers did a grand job and I pay tribute to them here this morning. Reference has been made to Lord Bruce of Melbourne, or Viscount Stanley Bruce as he is better known. It has been said that it cost Viscount Bruce hundreds of thousands of pounds to be a member of this House. That may be true, but on balance, Viscount Bruce gained from being a member of this House. In the whole picture money is only a minor ingredient in a combination of things that bring to a man the durable satisfactions of life. I pay tribute to Viscount Bruce. He was a great Australian. He played his part valiantly in this country, and Australia is indebted to him. But I do not think that he lost out by being a member of this Parliament. If he had not been a member he probably would have still I wish to say at once been a great merchant prince, but he would not have been a world figure or have the title of Lord Bruce of Melbourne. He would never have been a great national figure but would have been in the ranks of the men who have been outstanding examples as successful traders and merchants in this country yet have not achieved one iota of the prominence of Viscount Bruce. I turn next to the speech of the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition. When he had concluded his remarks I personally went to him and congratulated him. I told him that I thought he had made a fair statement on this subject. He had not tried to win points from the Government. I would not like to count the number of occasions or the matters on which I have disagreed with the Leader of the Opposition, but if he or any of his colleagues make speeches like that I will be one of the first to congratulate them, as the older members of the Opposition well know, although I do not agree with many of the points he made. The Acting Leader of the Australian Party made his speech following a meeting of the party. He made it with the full approval and the knowledge of our party head, the Minister excellent speech-so much so that he has received a telegram this morning, which he has shown to me, reading, "" Congratulations on a speech by a patriotic Australian "". NowI want to move on to other things. I have spoken about Lord Bruce because I intend to take appropriate action at a later stage. Regarding other aspects of this matter, perhaps I should tell this House just where I stand. First of all, I suppose that I am the only man in this Parliament who has called public meetings in his electorate, has hired halls and advertised, to inform his electors on this matter and see what their views are. I called one at Kerang",19,Parliamentary Allowances
61,For Trade ( Mr Mcewen). He Made An,"after the Richardson committee was appointed, and I called one last Saturday night at Swan Hill, a big town in my electorate. I am the only man in this Parliament who has called his electors together at a vantage point to speak on this subject, lf any other member has called public meetings, let him say so now. I had a fair attendance at the meeting. It was on a Saturday night, which is not a good night for a meeting. Order! The honourable member for Watson must remain silent. on Saturday night because Saturday night was the only night available, as I leave my home at 9 o'clock on Monday morning to come to Canberra and return home late on Friday. Some people did not come along because, probably, they had to go to the pictures. I advertised the meeting as follows:Report to the electors. Public Meeting. The Member for Mallee, Winton G. Turnbull, will report to electors on current Commonwealth Parliamentary topics, especially the Richardson Report, . . . Did you get a big crowd? The editor of the local newspaper very graciously made a news item of the announcement which said in partTurnbull wishes all people interested in the Richardson Report to come along. The honourable member for East Sydney has asked how many came along. There were 22, but they were a very representative gathering. I told these people where I stood with regard to this report and this legislation. In the first place, I told them. I was in favour of the increase in electorate allowances. I pointed out that I represent the largest electorate in Victoria. I know that there are some electorates in Australia into which you could put Victoria itself but, in the main, those electorates have only one or two big towns, whereas the population of the Mallee electorate is spread all over north-western Victoria, and the electorate has many industries, including those connected with dried fruits, fat lambs, wool, dairying, cereal growing and all manner of other things. I told them that my car travelling expenses, if based on the allowance paid to local government employees and others, were over £700 a year. That is only a small amount in comparison with the amount that some honourable members claim they should have. My electorate allowance is £800, and on that basis seven-eighths of it is swallowed up in car travel on the business of the electorate. An allowance increased to £1,050 would be appreciated by me, and I shall support the proposal to that effect. The next thing I dealt with at the meeting was the parliamentary retiring allowances fund. The balance-sheet of this fund shows that the amount paid into the fund by members and senators since its inception in 1949 is £330,432. The amount paid out to all ex-members, ex-senators and widows is £220,060, leaving a credit balance in the fund, of money contributed by members of Parliament-no t contributed by the Government-of £110,372, without taking interest into consideration. I repeat, that is the credit without interest on the capital invested. The pay out from the fund in the last full year, 1958, was £31,163, and in the same period senators and members' contributions amounted to £42,997, showing that for the last full year the contributions to the fund by members and senators were £11,834 in excess of the payout to ex-members of the Parliament and widows-and this, too, without interest on the capital invested. The point I want to make is that this clearly reveals that if the payout were increased from £31,163, as at present, to £50,000 per annum, this would be more than met by the present rate of contributions, plus interest, plus the increase of 10s. a week in contributions by members recommended in the Richardson report. I am told that, with interest, the fund is £144,000 in credit, so if the payout from the fund were to be increased by £10,000 a year as a result of the retirement of more members, it would be fourteen years before we were catching up to our own contributions and before the Government would be called upon to pay anything. At this stage I am sure that most members of the Parliament would say that they were quite in favour of the added contribution that would become necessary.",20,Parliamentary Allowances

66,Mr Turnbull,"You r turn is coming.NowI turn to the question of salaries. I did not say to my electors, "" ShallI vote against the salary increase? "" WhatI said was, "" ShallI take it? "" As honourable members know, I am capable of not taking it. The honourable member for East Sydney made an attack on me yesterday about doing a certain thing when a previous rise was before the House. But he was not man enough to say that the honourable member for Mallee was sincere and had divested himself of £1,236 on that occasion. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) said later, "" Oh, but you will eventually take this money "". The fact is that I signed a deed of divestment. I refused the money, and I am the only man now in the House who has done so. PerhapsI should not say this, but some people are looking for cheap publicity in this House. IfI get publicity I have paid for it-to the extent of £1,236, plus interest. I said to the meeting at Swan Hill, "" If all my constituents said to me that I must vote against this bill and that I must take the money, I would not do it. There are some principles that are personal to a man. The principle I will follow is that I will not vote against the increases and, as I walk out of the House, metaphorically, take the money"". My electors underestimate me if they think I will do that, and I underestimate them if I think that they would expect me to do it. I told my electors, "" There is not the slightest doubt that if the Labour caucus approves of the salary increases, there will be a vast majority vote for the rises."" I said, "" Do you think I am going to walk across and vote with a small minority, knowing that their efforts are going to be defeated and then take the money? "" IfI thought that the legislation had a chance of being defeated I would probably do that. They said, "" No, we would not expect you to do it "" . I can tell the people of Australia, too, that I will not put myself in that the principles that I have always been degrading position. The honourable member for East Sydney has been very vocal. The honourable member for Parkes, however, is very quiet, which is quite unusual. I have a proposition to put to both honourable members. orable member for Parkes represents ao electorate which is not connected with Parkes, the great primary producing area. His electorate is a pocket-handkerchief metropolitan electorate in Sydney. The honourable member for Parkes asks what is the proposition I want to put. Both of those honourable members rise here and say that members should give a lead to the nation in making sacrifices. What sacrifices have these two men ever made? That is what I want to know. What sacrifices are they prepared to make? The honourable member for East Sydney has said, "" I challenge the Government to accept the amendment."" But if the Government did accept the amendment, and there were some sacrifices, he would not be making them. I challenge the honourable member for East Sydney and the honourable member for Parkes: If they will divest themselves of this rise, if it is approved, I will be with them. ber says, "" I will see you afterwards "". Let them say it now. Some people say that we cannot do that because we have to pay income tax on it whether we take it or not. What rot that is! If we sign a deed divesting ourselves of the rise we will not have to pay any income tax on it. That is only a story that can be told to electors who do not know. Will the honourable member for East Sydney and the honourable member for Parkes accept my offerI will not call it a challenge-jus t to be with me in company and good fellowship? Will they agree or not? If they will, let them say so. Of course, they are silent They want all the money. The honourable member for Corangamite referred to Bob Dyer who says, "" The money or the box? "" Some people want both the money and the box seat for publicity in this House. They cannot fairly have both. That is not in accordance with taught. IfI do not stand up for those principles to-day, for goodness sake somebody kick me out of this Parliament. I should like to tell the House something about public opinion on this question.

70,Mr Turnbull,"The honourable memto Canberra. Last Monday, when we arrived at Melbourne, a member of Parliament with whom I am not very closely associated walked down the corridor. In my compartment, a lady said to a gentleman with whom she was travelling, "" There is our honourable member"". I looked up and saw who it was. The man in the carriage said something and the lady then passed a very disparaging remark about the honourable member. The gentleman again said something and the lady said, referring to members of Parliament, "" They are all alike "". I tried to keep quiet but of course it was most difficult. I said, "" You have said a very serious thing "". She said, "" I do not think so. I know him pretty well"". I said, "" That is not the point. You have passed a disparaging remark about a member of Parliament and then you have said that they are all alike. I resent that. I am one of them"". member of Federal Parliament personally. A few I do not know very well as they are new and I regard some of them as my very best friends, and as some of the best men that this country has produced. How many members do you know? "" I asked. She was silent. Of course, she did not know many. I said, "" What are the circumstances in which you make such a statement in a public place like this?"" She was dumbfounded. She did not say a word. I said, "" Of course you do not know many members and you are not in close touch with Parliament. That was a terrible remark that you made."" Then she made a tactful remark. She said, "" I don't suppose I meant it anyhow "". I hear Opposition members laughing. This is not a joke. I said to this woman, "" I want to talk about it because you don't know about it. You spoke in ignorance, so of course, you did not mean it."" She was quite a nice lady. A lot of people in Australia are talking about members of Parliament. But what do they know about them? How many do they know? The honourable member for East Sydney is interjecting very violently now. He knows that my challenge to him has put him offside. He knows that he will not accept it. I challenge the two honourable memcampaign. The press should know by now, bers again. Will they accept my challenge? if it has not known before, what an all-time Will they join me in a sacrifice? Of course low it has sunk to in the minds of members they will not. They want all the publicity and the headlines in the Sydney and Melbourne papers and they want to take the money at the same time. Everybody in this country should know that. The honourable member for East Sydney is very annoyed about this. I have stated my case fairly and clearly. Going back to the meeting to which I referred previously, I also said that I was against non-contributory pensions and the use of cars by ex-Ministers. By the time. I came back to Canberra the Government had decided to drop these proposals and they do not now come into it. Summing up, I say that I will vote for the allowances. I will vote for the contributory pension, and as I intend to take the salary rise, I will vote for that. As there is no indication of its being defeated I will be on the side of the majority, and I will not go over and vote with a small I continued, "" I know every minority which is only seeking publicity. Honourable members on this side of the House have given this matter eight solid hours of discussion at our caucus meetings and we have spoken about it for several hours elsewhere. We have spoken about it in our homes; we have spoken about it on aeroplanes; we have spoken about it on trains and in our own electorates. This report has been sifted from one end to the other and our leader's representation of our case yesterday afternoon was the result of a tremendous amount of thought. Various opinions had been expressed, and, finally, we worked out a majority decision on this matter and we stand by it. We have not treated this matter lightly or frivolously, but thoughtfully, both outside the party room and inside. I want to deal later with several matters that have not been discussed at all. I want to deal with the work of a member of Parliament in various widefieldsof service, and to give some of my own personal experience on the financial side. I am not afraid to tell the country my financial position. I will also mention the attitude of the press and the attitude of industrialists. A lot has been said about the city press",22,Parliamentary Allowances
71,Mr Duthie (Wilmot) [11.41],"of this Parliament and of all people in Australia who still appreciate parliamentary institution. It has been unscrupulous; it has been vindictive; it has been absolutely malicious; it has been untruthful in many aspects. The press has deliberately played on the prejudice of people against members of Parliament and on the ignorance of the electorate as to what we do as members of Parliament. It has even allowed the impression to go abroad that we do not pay for our parliamentary pensions. That shows its dishonesty, and I shall say something about that directly. It has been a battle, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said, between the press and the Parliament. It is very important for Australia to know who is going to win this battle. For my part, it will not be the press. then that I thought a Labour government It will not intimidate me into doing things that it wants me to do, nor will anybody in my electorate intimidate me to do the opposite of what I think is right in this Parliament. The press versus Parliament! Have honourable members heard of anything like it before? I have been to fifteen countries overseas, and I have studied the attitude of the press to Parliament. That attitude is worse in this country than in any country that I have visited. The press is intimidatory, insulting and it sets out, one would think, deliberately to bring down the prestige of this place in the eyes of the people. It happens nowhere else in the world to my knowledge. In considering the pressure from the press fight we had to wage throughout the counon this matter-whic h has been a boosted try on that issue against the pressure thingI have gone back over the years brought to bear by the press. We stuck that I have been in this place. In doing together again. How small is the present so. I have recalled far greater crises than campaign against us by comparison with this. This is not even a ripple compared those things. I mention them only to emwith what my colleagues and I have been phasize the contrast. through in this place in the last twelve and one-half years. Consider, for instance, the bank nationalization issue of 1947. I in the electorates? I shall indicate the effect received in my room in this building petiin Wilmota sprawling country electorate tions containing the names of 22,000 voters in Tasmania which embraces half the in my electorate. Of the 35,000 electors in island. In that electorate, 21 different kinds the constituency, 22,000 were on my back of agriculture are carried on. There are wanting me to vote against the bank nationconsiderable numbers of coal-miners, hydroalization legislation. I doubled my majority electric workers, wharf labourers, fruitat the 1949 election and when the fight was growers, about 1,500 or 1,800 industrial all over, the petitions lay eighteen inches workers in the big paper mills at New Nordeep on my desk. I received also 300 telefolk, others in big cement works, and many grams and 150 letters addressed to me perraUway workers. From this electorate, with sonally. Why-thi s is. as it were, just a such a variety of workers, I have received mere ripple caused by a little pebble cast in the fountain, by comparison with the pressures to which we were subjected at that time. Did any one in the Australian Labour Party give way under that tremendous pressure? Not one man. All stood four-square behind our leader in that time of terrific pressure. Then we had the 1949 coal strike. Has any party ever gone through a greater battle than the Labour Party had then? It was subjected to great pressure on all sides-by the coal-miners and others in the party. I have never had such experiences before. When one of my colleagues sat down after addressing a group of coal-miners, there was not one who clapped, but there were plenty who booed. We had to do so many things would never have to do in the entire history of the Labour movement. But we came through it by facing up to the situation man to man and standing shoulder to shoulder behind the decisions that we had made in this Parliament. As a result of that pressure on us in 1949, we lost twelve of our best colleagues in the next election campaign. Four of them had been Ministers. They sacrificed themselves for principlesfor the right to stick together in what the Australian Labour Party, as a party, believed to be right at that time. Why-by comparison, the present campaign is not even a ripple! Then there was the Communist Party Dissolution Bill of 1951. What a terrific What is the effect of all this propaganda only two letters and two telegrams protesting against the proposed increases of salaries and allowances. Mr Deputy Speaker. That indicates the extent of the press influence in my electorate. I could quote the experiences of other honourable members on this side of the House in respect of the same thing. I admire the men in this Parliament who are prepared to stand up, with courage and determination, for what they believe are the just provisions in this legislation, regardless of what the press has done or is trying to do. NowI come to wage justice. We have heard much about this. But fancy the press talking about wage justice, Mr Deputy Speaker! In all the time that I have been in this place, I have never yet seen one newspaper throughout Australia come out in support of wage justice for the workers of Australia, and say that the basic wage should be increased and that quarterly wage adjustments should be restored. What utter hypocrisy is the attitude of the press towards wages! The press may come out in favour of increased pensions, because that would not affect it so much. But let us have a look at the truth of the matter. Some people say that our salaries and allowances should not be increased until all other sections of the community have received increases. Let us consider that argument. I honestly and sincerelv believe-and I tell my electors so -that justice must begin somewhere. But where? That is the point. All sections of the community are saying to-day that they need financial assistance. All rightwhere do we start? It must begin with some one. Do the metal trades workers, for example, say to workers in the building industry, "" No rise for you until we get one "" ? Do the iron workers say to the coalminers, "" No rise for you fellows until we get a rise "" ? Do the waterside workers say to the pensioners, "" No rise for you until we get one "" ? I have never heard of such rot. Where there is a need for injustice to be rectified and justice to be done, the workers in an industry get on the job immediately regardless of what workers in other industries think. Recently, a unionist with 41 years' experience of union work, said to me, "" I fought in the Arbitration Court for the Australian Workers Union, Gil. I helped to get the change from a Federal to a State award in Tasmania for shearers and shepherds about twenty years ago. If you fellows do not take this rise, to which you are entitled, you will be very silly."" I replied, "" AmI hearing correctly?"" He said, "" You certainly are, and I shall tell you why"". He told me that, when he fought in the courts of the land for wage justice, he and those who were fighting with him looked about Australia in order to prove some instance in which there had been a wage increase-in any industry, no matter what it was-and that example was used in the court. He continued, "" At present, the workers of Australia have not a peg on which to hang their case, but this will definitely give an impetus to all workers and pensioners throughout Australia who are fighting for wage justice "". Anybody who is not so utterly prejudiced as to hate parliamentarians worse than the devil can see the truth in that argument. Of course, there is justice in it. If we are prepared to vote for increases in our own salaries and allowances, it is the bounden duty of all of us, and especially of the Government, to see that wage and pension justice spreads in ever-widening circles from this Parliament to every industry in whichCommonwealth awards operate. The Government should not send its representative into a court, as it did a week or two ago, to say that the economy cannot stand a wage increase-and this only shortly after it had said, in the election campaign, that the country had never been more prosperous! We do not want that sort of hypocrisy, and that is the sort of thing that I condemn in relation to this issue. From now on, the Prime Minister must adopt an entirely changed attitude towards wage justice for other sections of the community. It would not be right for me to accept an increase in my salary as a member of this place and be prepared to deny wage increases to others if I had an opportunity to do something for them. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) acted on this issue, as it were. The honourable member for Bass addressed railwaymen on this subject before it came to this Parliament. He received a wonderful reception, without one hostile interjection, from 300 to 400 men. There was not one question at the end of his speech. On the following Monday morning, the honourable member and I addressed the waterside workers at Launceston. We spoke for about a quarter of an hour to 70 waterside workers who had been working on one of the ships there. We had a similar reception again. We were prepared to go straight to these workers, even before we were invited to, and put our case. When the men heard the case explained from our stand-point, it was a different story. Previously, they had heard only the other side. I believe that most fair-minded unionists-especiall y if one met them personally and explained the issue-woul d see the justice in this thing. The Government is now committing itself to a change of attitude on wage claims business, although we are glad to see them and justice for industrial workers by bringhere. More and more of them come to ing this legislation before the Parliament. In its election policy, the Australian Labour that more and more should come, but the Party promised the workers of Australia that a Labour government would intervene before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, in association with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Workers Union, to seek immediate restoration of cost-ofliving adjustments to wages. Although that was Labour's policy, about 30 per cent, of the workers voted for the Government. If they had not done so, the Government would not still hold office. And what about the pensioners? Labour promised the pensioners a 10s. a week increase immediately if it were elected to office. It promised also to double the maternity allowance and to increase child endowment. All these are things for which we on this side of the House have been fighting for years in this Parliament. But what did thousands of pensioners do? They voted for the Government. All right-the y cannot have it both ways! How long can they go on rejecting the very things they have been fighting for, as they are doing when they keep the Labour Party out of office? We say that if the people put us in office these injustices will be remedied. The job of a member of Parliament, in regard to the duties involved, is probably the least well-known of all jobs in the Commonwealth. Just for the record, let me outline some of the functions of a member of this Parliament. All of us here know what jobs we have to do and how we are kept busy all the time, but how many people outside know? The press never gives the people a truthful version of what we have to do. Let me give some details. When we are in Canberra, we have speeches to prepare, involving much reading and research. We have to attend to correspondence that follows us here from our electorates. We have to interview Ministers on all sorts of problems brought to us by the people we represent. We have to attend party meetings. We must have a knowledge of the legislation that is before the House. We lead deputation of persons from our electorates or States who wish to interview Ministers. We must entertain visitors who come here from our home States-and this is becoming a very costly Canberra each year, rightly so. We say entertaining of them becomes very costlynot that I mind it. Then we have to attend the meetings of the House, listen to the speeches and follow the debates as intelligently as possible. Then we have duties in the office in our electorates and the home. I combine the two. Correspondence galore is coming in all the time. I have sent out from my own office in twelve years 15,000 letters dealing with problems of the people, and having nothing to do with the election campaigns. Then we have to interview the people who come to see us. They bring hundreds of different kinds of problems. As I have told honourable members on a previous occasion, a lady once came to me and asked me to find a husband for her! We have many varied problems placed before us, as we all know, and many of them are confidential matters. The people entrust us with their confidences. In continuation of our work in the office and at home we also have to contact Ministers of the Crown in Canberra and in the States. We have to contact heads of departments on behalf of our constituents, and we have to receive deputations at our offices and in our homes. My home is 13 miles out of Launceston, and I can hardly ever take a meal without being interrupted by a telephone call or by a person wishing to see me. There is only one night in the week that I can usually call my own and which I can spend with my family. That is Saturday night. Sometimes I have Sunday night too. I conduct services on Sundays for my church. I engage in that work without, of course, financial reward. I have carried on the work that I did for eight years, as a minister of religion. It is a constant battle to find enough time to meet the people and discuss their problems. Practically every member of this Parliament has the same kind of difficulty. They have very little time to themselves, and practically all their meals are interrupted. Now let me speak of the work that we do in our electorates. We make regular tours of our constituencies, meeting the people in the cities, the towns, along the roads, in the factories and in the mines. In my own case, I have had twelve tours of my electorate in twelve years. I have met thousands of people whom I would not have met otherwise. I know hundreds of people by their nick-names. This is the way in which we become known in our electorates. This is how electorates can be held. People get to know us personally. We hear of their problems during these tours of the electorates. We meet representatives of organizations, who put their particular problems before us. These organizations include even the municipal councils. We visit urgent trouble spots. A person may ring up and say, "" Come out and see me. There is a death in the family"", or, "" My mother wants a pension."" We might have to go miles to see a person who is bed-ridden and immobilized. We have to attend meetings of all kinds. We attend and conduct film nights. ' If a member has a camera, as I have and also the honourable member for Bass, he uses that on behalf of his electorate too. We have to appear before repatriation tribunals, giving advice and information. We attend a wide range of functions. We perform community services in and for many organizations. The range of problems that we have to deal with as members of Parliament is as wide as the Commonwealth. In the federal sphere it covers the fields of taxation, social so. Why are we paid at all? Why have services, the Postmaster-General's Department, repatriation, health, the Army, defence, shipping, agriculture, trade, immigration, employment, Commonwealth-State relations and housing. In the State sphere, which we have to enter when State matters interlock with Federal matters, the various problems cover the fields of education, electric power-hydro-electri c power in my own State-roads , health, legal matters, tourism, State social services, housing, fisheries and transport. We even have to deal with problems in the municipal sphere. People come to us for everything. They do not distinguish between State and Federal members. When we are at home in our electorates they look to us for a tremendous range of matters. They come to us in connection with municipal problems, and my colleagues on this side of the House who represent country constituencies know how close you can get to the people when you are really on the job all the time. In the municipalities we deal with road problems, matters concerning bridges, houses, drainage, health, streets, rates, even foreshores in cases where properties touch the coastline. The functions that we have to attend include balls of ali kinds for all sorts of organizations, branch meetings of our party, divisional council meetings, farmers' meetings if we are invited, meetings of sports bodies, agricultural shows, school fairs of all kinds, school break-ups, fairs conducted by churches of all denominations, and naturalization ceremonieswhich take up a lot of our time nowadays, and which we are glad to attend. This gives an indication of the wide range of functions that we are expected to attend and shows why we are hardly ever at home. When we go to these functions we carry a notebook in our pockets and invariably some one presents us with a personal problem. A constituent will say, "" CanI see you for a moment? "" We go outside and listen to his problem. This happens in the middle of an official function, and it happens to every one of us. Yet it is said that we attend these functions only to enjoy ourselves. That will be the day! I now wish to mention a few personal matters, and I make no apology for doing members of the Parliament asked the Richardson committee to examine their salaries? Why is it suggested that we are entitled to a raise? To make us more effective members of Parliament-that is why. That is the only reason, I hope, why we are suggesting that our salaries should be increased. I have been twelve and a half years in this Parliament, and j f I thought only of financial considerations, and of what financial gain I could get in my position, I would resign from the Parliament to-morrow. But I have always loved to serve people, and no one could get on very well in this Parliament if he did not love to serve people. It is the main part of our job; it is why we are here-to give service to the people. It is what I have always been used to. It is part of my training and I love that kind of work, f stay in this position as a member of the Federal Parliament for that very reason, but unless some financial help is given soon I will have to consider resigning because of the financial pressure. If it were simply a matter of financial considerations, you could have it! There are plenty of other jobs that one could take if one wished to get rich. There are many other jobs which would allow a person to save something. I may say that in my twelve and a half years in this position I have not saved a penny. I am further behind, and I will tell the House more about that in a moment. Some critics say that we should make asked to make sacrifices. I cannot make sacrifices, so let us examine this question of any more sacrifices. I have only one more sacrifices. What sacrifices do we make? to make, the final sacrifice, and maybe I I have worked 85 hours a week in this job will make that before I leave this place. for twelve and a half years.

That is the only other sacrifice that I can make. Twenty members of the Parliament have died since I came here. They made the supreme sacrifice through their service to the country. In my time. I have fought six elections at a cost of £1,500. After twelve and a half years, I have a mortgage of £2,500 at the bank on my home and car. I have not paid one penny off my home in nine years. In February last, the bank manager called me in and told me to wipe out my bank overdraft by June. I have paid £2,500 off motor cars in eight years and still do not own the car that 1 have! Yet a motor car to me is what a tractor is to a farmer. In twelve years, donations have amounted to thousands of pounds. I have paid £2,400 into our pension fund in ten years. Every month, I pay out of my salary £82 10s. on three items alone, consisting of £33 for taxation, £30 off my mortgage on my car and home and £19 10s. into the pension fund. Is the allowance of £800 enough for me in the Wilmot electorate? Last year I spent £1,300 within the electorate, but I received only £800 towards it. We are",23,Parliamentary Allowances

Chifley or Mr Curtin had merely broken their health while serving here instead of killing themselves, would they have been denied an increase merely because they had left the Parliament 25 years earlier? It is a mean amendment, Mr Deputy Speaker, and nothing less than that. Individuals do not make good advocates their time. in their own causes. However, the attitude of the press, which has been amply demonstrated over the past month and which has cerning back-benchers depends in very been referred to by the Prime Minister( Mr large measure on the kind of parliament Menzies) and by the Leader of the Opposithat we expect this to be or want it to be, tion (Dr. Evattt), forces politicians to try to or that the people of Australia expect it put their own case as best they can.

Mr Deputy Speaker, I think probably thought that at a time of falling prices for few members of the public realize the very agricultural products, the time was not great expense involved in representing opportune to increase politicians' salaries many electorates. The honourable member and allowances. I think it was thought for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) gave a list of his that this was bad especially for a repreown expenses. I think it would be fair to sentative of a rural electorate because say that for many members for country many rural industries have been going electorates, the travelling expenses and cost through a difficult period in the past twelve of running their own cars absorbs as much months. Some of them are not out of the or more than their entire electorate allowwood yet. I respect that point of view, but ance. There are many other things like I cannot agree with it, because an honorpostage, accommodation, printing and even able member who is beset by financial in the case of younger members such worries of one kind or another is of no things as baby-sitters because in the counuse to his electorate or to any electorate. try if a member's wife is expected to go One could argue with equal justification with him to some function, a young that if a certain industry in one electorate family cannot be left alone.

Politicians realize, Mr Deputy Speaker, both sides of the Parliament, is outweighed that their job is not one they should seek by the argument I have just advanced. to fill merely in order to get a fine income and live comfortably. They realize it is a vocation, but it is difficult to treat it as against this, bill but I realize quite plainly a vocation if there are many members in that many people would be penalized if I this place who are constantly worried by did.

Politicians do realize this and believe it with a vote, I feel I have a particular duty to even if the public on occasions find it state from my place in this House, as I have difficult to believe. If we were not here from outside, my views on the bill before from a sense of vocation, I would say the Parliament.

Only in this way will the very real need Mr J. R. FRASER (Australian Capital right to express an opinion in this House of members and senators. I do not propose to use a great deal of time, nor do I propose to recapitulate what has been said by many honourable members on both sides of the chamber about the work of members of the Parliament, nor do I propose to talk of sacrifices. I knew when I was elected to this Parliament eight years ago that this would be my full-time and only occupation, and it has been just that. I accept that. I like the work, and I hope to be able to continue to give full-time attention to this electorate while the electors consider I am capable of doing so.

The first premise of the legislation will do that and nothing more. It did not regard itself as required merely to Whether they will continue to meet those bring parliamentary salaries and allowances up requirements when three years have elapsed to date in the light of movements in the cost of I do not know, but I feel there will be need living for a further review of salaries when that time has been reached. tory provision.

How should members of the Parliament members of this Parliament who may be of the Commonwealth, whether senior ministers, able to limit their work and limit their junior ministers, office-bearers or rank and file expenditure from either the salary or the members, be regarded in relation to these sections allowances, but I believe without any hesiparity. It considered that there must be in parliatation that the member who makes his mentary service an element of community sacrirepresentation in this House his sole, fullficea willingness to serve for service sake. Thus, time occupation and devotes himself to that while holding the view that the responsibilities of work, will find the salaries and allowances reasonably be held to be comparable with those of proposed in this bill no more than adequate "" a senior executive officer of a great commercial to meet the three requirements I have stated-to meet the expenses of his representation, to live decently and save a little. I believe that many members of this Parliament are unable to save anything from their salaries, and have been unable to save anything for a good many years past. That situation should be corrected. The salary proposed in the legislation represents, I believe, the minimum that will meet the requirements of a member in this Parliament under the heads I have mentioned. Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to refer, as many other honourable members have To make an accurate assessment of the merits it is necessary to study the question as the comcommittee's inquiry is perhaps its most important. indices, but to make a complete review and a fresh examination of the entire question. To do this it began by comparing members' remuneration with those of other Commonwealth and the legislature in the United States, as well as in the Public Service. It invited personal statements from members and Senators and from the public and public organizations, and it meetings. Armed with this information, as well as with the committee set out to find its working of the community? It did not aim to achieve a senior minister, by way of example, could",28,Parliamentary Allowances
73,Mr Mccolm,"That should be a statuParliamentsor industrial enterprise"", the committee decided lhat lo preserve the element of sacrifice a more valid comparison should be the remuneration of doctors, lawyers and other professional men. With regard to remuneration of rank and file members it paid regard to the fact that they are required to serve their constituents in and out of Parliament, seven days a week, day and night. It did net, however, base salaries on this consideration. It took the view that a member should neither be lured to office by high emolument, nor yet excluded from it by the danger of financial embarrassment. ""The salary of a member,"" it reported, "" should be fixed at an amount which is not so low as to deter a man of good attainments and abilities who has no private income from entering or remaining in Parliament."" It left it to the good sense of party pre-selection committees and the electors to safeguard the nation against "" people of poor abilities who have failed in private life"" who will seek election because such a salary would seem to them to be a prize to be coveted. On the question of allowances, as distinct from salaries, the committee aimed to cover adequately expenses incurred in the course of parliamentary duties which a member would not have to meet from his salary were he in private employment These allowances may appear generous for the average office worker, but the comparison, as thc committee shows, would be quite invalid. Allowances for Ministers, i i was recognized, must cover entertainment expenses far and away above those required of even top business executives, and the committee recommended accordingly. The mayors of many Australian cities fare at least as well. Its approach to pensions was on the same basis as its assessment of salaries-that neither ministers nor members should have need to fear financial embarrassment in after life because of having adopted a career which did not offer the same opportunities for accumulation as private enterprise would offer to an employee of similar responsibility. These are ihe premises from which the committee worked. No generalized denunciation of its recommendations can be said to stand on solid ground unless these premises are also dismissed as unsound. I believe that that is a very sane article, and one that represents the view generally put by the country press. It is in clear contradistinction to the attitude adopted by many metropolitan dailies. This courageous newspaper went a step further in an editorial on 6th April. I do not propose to read the whole of that editorial, but the passages that I will read are significant, and are a rebuke to the editors and publishers of some of the metropolitan newspapers. The motto of the "" Canberra Times"" isFor the cause that lacks assistance, 'Gainst the wrongs that need resistance For the future in the distance, And the good that we can do. On 6th April, under that motto, the "" Canberra Times "", in an editorial headed, "" A Mirror for Australians "", statedAustralians generally pride themselves on being able to think things out for themselves, and when they are permitted to do this, they most often reach sound conclusions, but in thc process it is not uncommon for sound and fury to posture as reasonable thought, and there are frequent examples of what the people think being very different from noisy expression of what the people are being told to think or what they actually do ;hink. A current example is the very obvious campaign that is being whipped up on the subject of increases for Ministers and members of Parliament. There is reason to believe that the majority of Australians are looking at this matter somewhat differently to views that are being featured in noisy newspaper campaigns: And this is a newspaper speakingThe entire issue is one in which Australians who want to think for themselves will see mirrored for them the shape of their own characters as citizens. The paper carried on that analogy of the glance into a mirror. In concluding its editorial it statedIt is easy to disparage the best things in life and to disparage our country, its institutions and our public men whom the people choose, but what is the worth of our country, its institutions and those who serve it? If there is any quarrel, it cannot be with Australia or its institutions, or the men and women who have been elected to public office, but rather with the people who have chosen them. The present issue which reasonable people will find if they look at themselves in the mirror lies between two conclusions; either that the people have chosen well their members of Parliament and that having made a good choice t^.ese should be remunerated accordingly, or that thcy have made some bad choices which in due course they may correct, but if there have been mistakes, it is not the members but the electors who are blameworthy. As I know that other honourable members wish to speak before the sitting is suspended, I do not propose to continue much beyond that point except to say that I support whole-heartedly the proposals that have been made for increases in the basic salaries and allowances to members of the Parliament, both in this place and in the Senate, and I support the proposals put forward by the Leader of the Opposition on behalf of the Australian Labour Party. Tn closing, I appeal to the Government, when this matter has been disposed of, to investigate the conditions of employment and remuneration of the other half of the team in the work of representation in this Parliament. I refer to those ladies who are employed as secretary-typists for honourable members. I believe that the time is overdue when the worth of the work done by those ladies should be recognized by the Parliament. I suggest that the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) might well arrange for a committee to examine the work that is done by those people, and the remuneration that they receive at present, in order to see that justice is done to them just as it is being done to members of the Parliament. not intend to take up very much of the time of the House, because after all my views are, perhaps, known. First, I should like to say that I do think that the sending, a little earlier in the piece, of anonymous letters to a man of very great integrity, was absolutely despicable. That man, with two others of equal integrity had made out a very good report, and it must be remembered that this report was made on the evidence of Ministers and of members of this Parliament and that it should be considered as having been correctly made. Those of us who heard the speech of the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) might think that the committee was extraordinarily moderate, and that it should have raised salaries by about £5,000. I am in entire agreement with one provision in this legislation. If it had been alone, in a separate bill, I should have definitely voted for it. I refer to the proposed increase in the salary of the Prime Minister. No matter from what party he comes, his salary is definitely most inadequate. If this matter had been treated aright, it would not have come up for consideration at this moment. Provision for that increased salary would have appeared on the statute-book long ago. I am registering my protest against these bills as a whole on two lines. First, during the election campaign it was said by the Government that there was no money to spare for giving any hope of relief to certain people. We were told that the economy, although thoroughly sound, was not in a spendthrift mood. Now, five months later, we find that there is plenty of money available to give us lifts in salary. One of the justifications put forward is that these increases will cost only a very little amount in a big Budget. In my opinion, there can never be two laws, one for the rich and one for the poor. At this time, when we are struggling for markets abroad, when the only hope of keeping those we have and gaining more is by keeping costs down, I feel that it is up to us to show an example. I can hear honourable members opposite jeering me and egging me on, because they did not like what I said when I spoke first on this subject. The Opposition has shown further rifts over this matter. Its leaders are speaking with two voices. Even its executive and the unions are divided. But one thing is absolutely sure. It is that Opposition members are all rallying at the thought of more money, and for once they are blessing themselves that the Government has a large majority, so that they can say "" No "", and yet take the increases. I have been told that I am taking this stand because I am wealthy. In fact, Mr Tripovich, secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labour Party, classes me in the £40,000 bracket. I do not mind saying that that is not the position at all. The whole of my life I have been poorer than the man next door to me but, perhaps because of my Scottish ancestry, I have always found that I could save a little every year. Looked after, that saving does not dwindle. I will admit that at the moment I do not have very much spare time to look after it. But I have always based my estimate of my worth on other facts. I have based it on the amount of money that I was earning before I came to this place compared with the money that I am earning here. On the last occasion, I voted for a salary rise because I thought it was necessary. This time. I know exactly in which way I am better off. I have heard many stories from members on both sides of the House about how difficult it is to do this and to do the other. As I am a father, my heart was deeply touched by one of them. I was told that it would not be possible for one member to educate his children unless he got this rise. That may be as it may be, but there are many other honourable professions in this country.

I have listened carefully to the speeches which have been delivered from the benches opposite. I listened carefully also to a speech delivered this morning from a Government supporter who said that he had no objection to the Prime Minister of this country getting an increase in his emoluments. "" After all "", he asked, "" doesn't he deserve them? "" Well, how are we to determine what a person deserves? If you determine what a person deserves by whether he is getting as much income as a person who is engaged in hire purchase rackets, then the Prime Minister is being underpaid. If you consider that the Prime Minister's salary should be determined by what somebody named Henderson on a Sydney newspaper is gettingI do not know what salary Henderson is receivingI certainly say that, irrespective of what that salary is, the Prime Minister is underpaid. But what is to be the measuring stick to determine what a person's service to the community is worth? when you considered whether you would go with the Australian Democratic Labour Party or not. the empty mind. I know that it is necessary to have some measuring stick to determine the amount that should be paid; but there is a fundamental difference in that respect between the Prime Minister and those who sit with him on the treasury bench and myself. My guide in determining what should be paid to a Prime Minister or a member of the Ministry or myself, is not what Mr Henderson receives, nor is it what those Ministers receive or would receive in outside employment however great that income might be. My measuring stick is: What do other useful members of the community receive to enable them to live?

Is it greater nonsense to use as a measuring rod to determine the payment of members of the community that which the lowest in the community receives rather than that which the highest in the community receives? Is it nonsense to say that every member of every Australian family shall have at least a reasonable living before some members of the community shall have luxury? This is all that I am saying, and, of course, it is the fundamental difference between the ideas of members on the other side of the House and on this side. An honourable member on the Government side who spoke this morning said he would not take this rise if it were granted to members of Parliament. due course. Does that honourable member and his colleagues say that the person in the community who would use the money, irrespective of the amount, to the best use of the community should refuse it while those who would use it to the detriment of the community accepted it? What an absurd position I would put myself in if I said that. What every member who sits on this side of the House and I desire is that the whole community should advance in common. That honourable member who spoke this morning voted against an increase in age pensions, but to-day he is saying that the Prime Minister should receive an increase. He said that he could not accept an increase because the age pensioners did not get an increase, but he did not add that that was because he and those associated with him voted against the age pensioners being granted an increase. Every honourable member on this side of the House believes that pensions should be increased. We believe that the quarterly cost of living adjustments of ordinary wages should be restored. We believe that there should be increases in the basic wage and in child endowment which, for nearly half a century, has not been adequately increased.

I am just putting before this Parliament my philosophy of life as a Labourite, and I think that it is also the philosophy of life of the vast majority of the people. I say that the only people in this Parliament who have any justification whatsoever for moving for increases in parliamentary emoluments are members of the Labour Party because they, at least, hold that the lowest members of the community, those who are remunerated the least and whose needs are the greatest, should receive some attention. The Labour Parly says that the ordinary working member of the community and the recipients of child endowment and all kinds of social services, those in receipt of pensions, whether they be military pensions or otherwise, should receive increases. the other. honourable gentleman's indignation. I realize he has a twinge of conscience as a result of which he becomes violently indignant. However, what I have said outside this Parliament I think it is my duty, to say inside this Parliament. I agree, of course, to a great extent, that the press of this country takes up a very illogical attitude when it becomes violently abusive of members of Parliament on the ground, so the press claims, that they are putting their hands into the national coffers and, for their own advantage, levying a toll on industry and on the workers of this country. The same newspapers do not, of course, say anything about the hire-purchase organizations that are levying a toll on the community, or the private banking interests which levy an immense toll upon industry and the workers. They do not say anything about television organizations, or about newspapers themselves, which are reaping vast profits at the expense of the community. 1 say that if you are going to determine Minister of this country. the remuneration of either the Leader of the Opposition or the Prime Minister by what is received by other persons who are I stand for an egalitarian system of society more highly paid than they are, then the a system of society in which the burdens sky is the limit because, after all, the man are spread as widely as possible and in who decides the destiny of the nation, the which the remunerations are as evenly man who is at the head of its government, is of greater importance to the vast masses of the people than is any other individual, no matter what he may be. If we admit that principle, then we must think that the Richardson committee was a bit ungenerous in its treatment of this country's political leaders. In reality, the leaders of the Government and the leaders of the Opposition, and the back-bench members of this Parliament, because of the responsibilities they carry, should receive remuneration greater than is received by members of any other section of the community, whether they be bankers, professors, the heads of armies or navies, or persons in high positions in any other sphere, because ultimately the positions that are important in a democracy are the positions of the men who, on the floors of this Parliament, determine the destiny of the nation. But, of course, nobody would say that that should be done. Nobody would say that we should all get more than anybody else in the community. Everybody recognizes the absurdity of that so the whole contention is reduced to absurdity. We, who live in a democratic community, should advance and progress with the average members of the community. We should not seek to get so far in advance of our army that we lose touch with it altogether. We, as delegates, as representatives of the people of this country, should have a type of existence similar to theirs. Because of those things, I am very reluctant to admit that there has come a time in the history of the country when we cannot give a 5s. increase to the old age pensioner, but we can give £72 per week increase to a Prime Minister. That is so, irrespective altogether of his ability and irrespective altogether of the services that he has rendered, although, because of the great admiration I have for the Leader of the Opposition, if I were the determinant of his salary, I would see that it was in excess of that of the leader of the Government. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition, when Labour is in opposition, is much more important than the PrimeI have said before, and I say again, that",36,Parliamentary Allowances

98,Mr Peters,"I can understand thespread as possible. I believe that big noncontributory pensions are not desirable. No means test is applied to such pensions, although it is applied to the ordinary pension. If a man has been able to save something from his remuneration and invest it so that it provides him with an income, I do not think that he should receive a non-contributory pension. In other words, I do not consider that, because a man has been getting more money than others while he was working, he should get a bigger pension when he ceases to work. The logic of such a proposition does not appeal to me. But it is the fundamental logic of every member on the Government side. It is the mainspring of their political action that the more you get the more you ought to get, and that the less you have, even that which you think you have shall be taken away from you. Because of that fundamental difference, because I do not want to be silent upon an issue such as this, and because I support the attitude of my party, as declared at its caucus meetings, I have risen to make these very few temperate comments. body, I think, is very impressed with the attitude of the honourable member for attack on the recommendations of the Richardson report, acceptance of the fruit of the recommendations, and an attempt by tortuous argument to justify that inconsistency. When the Richardson report was first made public and the Cabinet decided to adopt it, in to to, I felt that a wrong thing had been done. I felt that the time for the implementation of these recommendations was particularly unfortunate. I felt, at first glance, that the proposals were excessive, although I bore in mind the fact that no adjustment had been made for three years in the salaries of members and for seven years in the salaries of Ministers. Altogether, I have felt that this has been a sorry business, equally for Parliament and the press. Neither has gained any prestige among thinking people. But the majority of members felt that the recommendations should be implemented and I began to study the facts and figures available to me as I would study any other proposal that might be brought before the House. I have to confess that when I studied the facts and figures which I will lay before the House before I sit down, my views were somewhat modified although I am still not very happy about the report and believe that it would have been better buried at the bottom of the deep blue sea. I think that honourable members will agree with me because nobody likes to be held up to hatred, ridicule and contempt among his friends and constituents. The first matter upon which I should like to comment is the considerable gap which exists, as a result of these proposals, between the salaries and allowances of private members and Ministers. I feel that the committee has"" too readily accepted popular thinking in comparing the position of Ministers to that of top management in industry and the position of private members to that of junior executives, salesmen, or, perhaps, welfare officers, in commercial organizations. This is a mode of thought that is common in the community. People are familiar with organizations of that kind and they are apt, I think with bad results, to apply that analogy to Parliament itself. It is true that Parliament does consist of two sorts of members. It consists on the one hand of Ministers, with whom I would include the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and on the other hand of private members. But it should never be forgotten that members share with Ministers the responsibility for the framing of policy and this is a very important and onerous responsibility. I would rather that some of the speeches made in the course of this debate had not been made-thos e which tended a little to exaggerate the duties of members in the electorate and to give the impression to the public that the parliamentary duty of members is mainly to attend to the individual wants of constituents rather than to policies which they may influence by their advocacy in this place. It is necessary, to-day, that members should give the whole of their time to their work in this Parilament. That is due to two reasonsthe advent of the welfare state and the fact that this Parliament is located in the bush, at Canberra. So. in considering the remuneration of members it is necessary to make two assumptions: The first is that membership of Parliament is inevitably a full-time occupation, and the second is that",37,Parliamentary Allowances

That committee quoted also Ministers is to be increased, compared with the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to the the adjustment made seven years ago, by following effect:Public office should not be a means of private bers, will give them a total basic salary of profit, but it should not involve such loss or financial embarrassment as to make it difficult £6,000 a year.

I have not time to give details as to the £1,000-a n increase of 45 per cent. This, together with their basic salary as memthat of seven years ago, by £500-a n increase of 26 per cent. This, together with tbeir basic salary as members, will give tbem a total basic salary of £5,000. Of course, both members and Ministers receive expense allowances as well. How do these increases compare with what has happened to other people in the community? In March, 1952-a t the time of the Nicholas report-the basic wage was £10 10s. a week. In October, 1955-a t the time of the first Richardson report, it was £11 16s. a week. In March, 1959, it was £13 ls. a week. If my arithmetic is correct, the increase between 1952 and 1959, which is relevant to Ministers, has been 19.5 per cent.; and between 1955 and 1959, which is relevant to members, it has been 10.6 per cent. These increases are relatively less than the proposed increases for Ministers on the one hand and members on the other, which I have just indicated. That must be faced as a fact. As regards age and invalid pensions, these have increased between 1952 and 1958 from £3 7s. 6d. to £4 7s. 6d. This represents an increase of almost 30 per cent. Between 1955 and 1958 they increased from £4 to £4 7s. 6d., an increase of 9 per cent. Of course, it must be borne in mind that before the end of the year these pensions and the basic wage may be increased, and it will be another three years at least, and perhaps six years, before parliamentary salaries are again reviewed. I come now to what is most interesting and relevant to honourable members. I examined what has happened to the salaries of professional and commercial men in the same income brackets as members of this Parliament. First, I examined the relationship between the salaries of public servants and members at the time of the last Richardson committee report, three years ago, and at the present time. It will be remembered that the Metal Trades Award, which was made in November, 1954, applied the formula of a two and a half times increase in margins over the 1937 level in that industry, and that this triggered off a series of long-overdue adjustments in margins generally. The most important repercussions was the Commonwealth public servants' margins case. Here the dates become very important. At the time when the first Richardson committee reported, in October, 1955, this case had not been concluded. Public servants receiving salaries of £1,850-closel y comparable with the then existing salary of £1,750 for members-ha d been conceded by the Public Service Board a salary of £2,498, this being very closely comparable with the Richardson committee's recommendation in September of £2,350 for members. But four months later, in December, 1955, the public servants, having appealed to the full Arbitration Court, were awarded £2,763, a figure remarkably close to the £2,750 now recommended for members, three years later, by the present Richardson committee. I understand that another application by the public servants is now pending before the Public Service Arbitrator. NextI take another group of people in the relevant bracket, university lectureis. After a long period in which their salaries remained static, they were adjusted in 1956 and again in 1958. These dates correspond closely to the dates of the first and second Richardson reports. In 1956 senior lecturers were given an increase to £2,150, as compared with the members' increase to £2,350. In 1958 the salaries of these lecturers were increased to £2,600, while the Richardson committee now recommends an increase to £2,750 for members. I understand that salaries in comparable brackets, paid by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, have increased proportionately to a far greater extent, over the period, than the salaries to which I have just referred. I come now to the field of commerce. In November, 1958, the Australian Institute of Management made a survey of salanes paid to employees in a sample group of 52 manufacturing companies, as between the years 1957 and 1958, showing the increases in various ranges, including the £2,000 to £3,000 a year bracket. Taking all the types of salary earners within that bracket, the average increase was approximately £106. The indications are that in the two preceding years the increases were perhaps half as high again. It seems reasonable to conclude that over the three year period the average increases were of the order of £300 to £400. In conclusion, let me say at once that I am in no way attempting to compare the relative worth of services rendered by members of Parliament and of the work done by public servants, senior lecturers at the universities and company secretaries. I am merely saying that these are people in the same income brackets, and that their emoluments have increased pari passu with the increases recommended by the Richardson committee. I shall now pass on rapidly, because my time is very limited, to the question of parliamentary pensions. I have listened closely to this debate and have not, so far, heard a fair presentation of the situation. WhatI will say is entirely factual and members may draw their own conclusions from it. I have studied the relevant legislation and I have informed my mind with information from persons able to advise me and who have some knowledge of the matter. This is the situation as I see it. Members' pensions at present are fixed at the rate of £12 a week for members who have served for at least eight years or in three Parliaments. The contribution by members is fixed at £4 10s. a week. The first comment I make is that this is the only scheme in Australia, designed to provide pensions for members of Parliament, that has been constructed on an actuarial basis. Secondly, it is built on the basis that 40 per cent, of the amount of the pensions is payable out of members' own contributions, and the balance of 60 per cent, is payable by the Treasury. Thirdly, it has to be based on certain assumptions which, in the event, could be proved false. The assumptions were that members entered Parliament, on the average, at the age of 45, that the average parliamentary life of a member was ten years, and that the average expectancy of life of a man of 45 in Australia is 27 years. These are refined guesses, but bona fide assumptions as to what will happen. We cannot just assume that every member comes into this House, serves for the minimum period of eight applies to the members' pensions scheme is years, then goes out at the age of 45 and the high rate of pension paid to a member's draws a pension until he is 80. The actuwidow, namely five-sixths of the member's arial assumptions represent a refined guess. pension. This is much higher than is the On the face of it, such a scheme is fair case in other occupations where, in the past, to the taxpayer. For example, the Comthe old rule of thumb has resulted in one monwealth Public Service superannuation half of a person's pension being payable scheme contemplates a ratio of 29 to 71 to his widow, though the modern trend is between contributions made by the emto increase this proportion. ployees and by the Treasury. A large employer in private industry would make a members' pensions be increased from £12 similar contribution in respect of the superor business executives annuation of senior employees in the comparable salary brackets; a small employer would normally contribute less. But there are two special considerations that must be taken into account in considering the parliamentary retiring allowances scheme. The first is that, though the ratio between the contributions of members and the Treasury is fair, it is true that members' pensions will, on the average, continue for seventeen years, whereas in the case of other pension schemes, assuming that the pensioners retire at the age of 65, they will continue for only seven years. This means that the Treasury will pay out a much larger total sum in respect of members' pensions, just as, indeed, members themselves must contribute more heavily to meet the situation. However, a substantial countervailing argument can be advanced. When a member, having served in the Parliament from the age of 45 to the age of 55, returns to private life, if he is a professional man he will have lost his practice and' not a little of his skill, and he will be no longer a young man. His earning capacity will have been substantially impaired. If he has been engaged in business, he will suffer a similar severe handicap. On the other hand, a private citizen at the age of 55 can still command a high income from that time until he reaches the age of 65. Between 45 and 55 his skill and experience will normally increase rather than diminish. If at 55 he leaves his existing employment and accepts another post, he will probably do so in order to get a better salary. While it is true that he will surrender his pension rights and probably recover only the amounts of his own contributions, he will do this for the calculated advantage involved in securing a larger salary. The second special consideration that The committee has recommended that to £18 a week, an increase of 50 per cent., and that their contributions should be increased from £4 10s. to £5 a week. On the face of it, this would destroy the actuarial basis of the scheme, and I believe that the Richardson committee's report should have contained the expert opinion of an actuary on this aspect. But what, in fact, has happened in other schemes in which inflation has eroded the value of the originally stipulated pensions, which have had to be increased to keep pace with the declining value of money? So far as the Commonwealth public service superannuation scheme is concerned, the value of each unit of pension was increased in 1947 from £26 to £45, while the contributions by the employees have remained at the same figure per unit since 1942. So, the principle has been accepted that the Treasury has borne the burden of inflation, as presumably the Richardson committee contemplates it should do in the case of members' pensions. Nevertheless, it must be concluded that the recommendation of the Richardson committee is, when all the circumstances are taken into account, quite generous. I must add my own personal opinion, after studying a matter which has not engaged my attention so vividly before, that self-employed people in the community are those who are suffering most. They have no employer to supplement their life assurance premiums, and I believe that more substantial tax concessions in respect of such premiums should be given. The conclusion I come to after going into these matters in some detail is that the Richardson recommendations are not as much out of line as on first impression I believed they were. If we pay regard to the fact that members' salaries have not been adjusted for three years and may not be adjusted for another three or six years -wh o knows?-then , looking at what has happened to incomes in the comparable brackets, for which I have given figures, the recommendations of the Richardson report can be justified. So far as Ministers are concerned, not being a MinisterI have no means of judging, but if the recommendation in respect of members' basic salaries is right, it seems reasonable to conclude, as far as one can test the matter from an investigation such as this, that the recommendation relating to Ministers is not very far out of line, although, as I said at the outset, I believe that the gap between Ministers and members should, in the interests of Parliament, not perhaps be as great as it is. I believe that the allowances for members and Ministers has created more public disquiet than the basic salaries themselves. Some things are easy to test for oneself, but they are little things. Nobody knows how much it might cost a Minister to live in Canberra, if he has a home here or if he comes here frequently for Cabinet meetings. I would not know how many Cabinet meetings are held in a year. One cannot test those things. But when one finds things like a non-contributory pension, which has now been shorn off, and the use of cars by certain retired members, which has now been shorn off, and when one looks, for example, at Ministers' travelling expenses, which have risen from £5 5s. as recommended by the Nicholas committee to £12 for senior Ministers, though one does not know what their expenditure may be, one feels that perhaps they are excessive. However, when we look at the report as a whole and are able to test it in some important respect and find that it tallies with what has happened in the rest of the community, we can assume only that these things, some of them looking wrong, may be right. able member's time has expired. speak briefly on this matter. So far, in the discussions that have taken place, I have not spoken in public on it but I feel that it is necessary to say something in this place on the matter which has assumed very great importance not only to the Parliament, but to the people. My view of the Richardson report is that it is indefensible and unacceptable and that in this form it should be rejected. I accept the view that there should be an increase in the electorate allowance and in the retiring allowances for members, but I feel that the main body of the report is indefensible and unacceptable. I adopt a standard to judge the report which is a standard that I have not always by any means achieved myself, but I view the report as a report of men who take a",38,Parliamentary Allowances

102,Mr Cairns (Yarra) [3.8],"I desire tovery differeat view of the kind of society they want from the view that I take and, I believe, the view that the great majority of my electorate takes. I am not speaking of the probity or sincerity of any of the members of the committee. 1 know one of them personally and have known him for years. 1 know that he is a man of probity and sincerity, but it is not a question of that. He happens to be of a very different social point of view and has a different set of standards from my own point of view and standards and from those of the people whom I represent. I see this report, therefore, as a report of men who accept inequality, who accept wide margins of income between one person and another, and who accept the general conditions of this society in which we live, but I feel that my function in this House is to work for a change in this form of society. Therefore, I cannot accept a report which expresses the essential social values of a society that I feel 1 should work to change. The social values of the Richardson report are also the social values of this Government and of the press-the social values of inequality. This report is perfectly consistent with everything the Government does. It governs so that those who have much can get more. It has not made any sincere attempt, I believe, to change the would have a margin of £30. To my mind, distribution of income in this country in favour of those who have little. This report is a perfectly good example of its general attitude on all matters. Every member of Parliament is in the top 2 per cent, of income earners. We are, therefore, in the same class as company directors, pastoralists examine is the rate of increase of incomes and the top professions. Being in this class, I do not believe that there should be a further distribution of income in our favour and in favour of this class of which we are a part. We can see the situation we occupy by looking at the size of a number of incomes. First, it is proposed that the Prime Minister should have an income of £14,350, some of which is tax free and some of which will be spent for a purpose that no doubt an outis adopted and the rate of increase in those side person on the same income would not use his money for. The Deputy Prime Minister is to receive £9.150; senior Minisper cent. Not only is it so much greater ters and those classified with them, £8,350 to £8.550; junior Ministers £7,100; and members £3,600. We must contrast those incomes with the income of a pensioner, who receives £227 10s. a year, or a basic wage earner who receives £670 a year, and there are many of them. If we take the average wage as being £1,000 a year, we are certainly not understating or overstating it; it is approximately of that order. Many thousands of people are trying to keep families on £1,000 a year, as well as on £3,600. Therefore, I would think on the size of income, if we accept the kind of social standard that I had expressed £3,600 as income? can check it, if he so desires. I added together the salary and the allowance, and in doing so I mentioned that persons in that position in Parliament spend some of the money in a way which they would not do if they were outside, and allowance can be made for that. Some of it is tax free. The second point is that of margins. I have spoken about the size of the salaries. If this report were put into effect, the Prime Minister would have a margin above the average income of £250 a week. Senior Ministers would have a margin of not less than £150 a week and junior Ministers a margin of £120. A member of Parliament they are very substantial margins and very definite evidence of inequality. This inequality is more than I am prepared to accept. The other aspect which we should in recent times. The honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) spoke about this. Having examined the size of incomes and the margins between them, let us examine the rate of increase. The position broadly is that since 1952, the basic wage has risen by about 30 per cent., the average wage has risen by 34 per cent, to 35 per cent., and the pension rate has risen by about 30 per cent. Let us look at the proposed increase in members' salaries if this report salaries since 1952. The rate of increase in the Prime Minister's salary will be 81.25 in terms of cash than the increase of pensions, but the rate of increase is almost three times the rate of increase of pensions.",43,Parliamentary Allowances

104,Mr Cairns,"The honourable memberThe rate of increase of the Deputy Prime Minister's salary will be 50.9 per cent., and that of the Treasurer 50 per cent. pay taxes. able member for Hume had his way. The other rates of increase in the circumstances I have described will be: Senior Minister, 44.4 per cent.; Junior Minister, 28.5 per cent.; Leader of the Opposition, 85.7 per cent.; Deputy Leader of the Opposition, 100 per cent.; Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, 100 per cent.; Deputy Leader in the Senate, 33.3 per cent.; and a private member, 57.14 per cent. If allowance were made for taxation, the rate of increase would not be much different. Not only is there a very great difference between the salaries and a great difference between margins, but there is an equally great difference also between the rates of increase compared with the incomes of other sections of the community. I fail to see how any one could support a measure of this sort while supporting the Government's social service and wage policy over the past ten years. The report, Mr Deputy Speaker, has been prepared by businessmen who have the same social and economic values as those of the Government. Moreover, the report has been drawn up in such a way as to isolate it and its recommendations from the general community. Those who doubt that statement can confirm my opinion by a study of the carefully worded paragraph at page 6 of the Richardson committee's report, which statesIn our judgment, our function was not to take the existing rates of salaries and allowances and bring them up to date in the light of movements in cost of Uving indices and average rates of earnings since 1951 or 1955 as the case might be. In other words, the Richardson committee has said, ""We have not paid attention to increases in the cost of living, and these increases to be granted to members of Par-: liament are not suggested because the cost of living has increased "". The committee is isolating its decision from that of arbitration courts and industrial tribunals which are being asked from time to time to make decisions based on changes in the cost of living. If the committee's report or this measure are cited by an advocate for employees -as a precedent for an increase in wages, the arbitration courts or tribunals will say "" No; the Richardson committee specifically stated that its report was not to be used for that purpose "". The recommendations in the report have been determined by the special position of a member of Parliament and express the privilege of that position which is that of a special social status or class. This report has not been introduced because of any change in overall economic conditions. It has been introduced for a totally different reason. The report on salaries for members of the State Parliament of Victoria was even more specific. However, I believe that although this report will not be admissible in arbitration proceedings for legal or technical reasons, it must have a terrific moral impact on the community if it is adopted. I fail to see how the Prime Minister can support an increase in salary of more than £70 a week for himself without making a substantial increase in pensions. I fail to see how the Deputy Prime Minister can accept £50 a week for himself above the standard upon which he has been living for several years without also asking his advocates in the arbitration courts to support an increase for the workers as well. But that is a moral problem that the Prime Minister and his deputy can wrestle with in the next few months. A lot has been said about the press campaign on parliamentary salaries and allowances. For once, the Government and its supporters have been under a barrage of press criticism, but the press campaign is really a campaign against the Australian Labour Party. It is directed to put the ALP. before the sights and to throw the responsibility in this matter on the Labour Party. No doubt the supporters of the Government would sooner forget the criticism that has been levelled against it because supporters of the Government generally accept the sort of social order of whicb these large salaries are a part. No Liberal Party supporters could be expected to react as adversely to a vote by his representative for such large salaries as one would expect",44,Parliamentary Allowances

The press campaign which has been so generally directed, and so specifically directed in intent, is a camthey both want to keep power away from paign which is believed by the newspapers -som e of them openly and definitely-to be a greater weapon against Labour than anything else. The press has a right to say wha.. it likes and it generally does. But it is an organization which has been assisted by this Government. That is seen in the growth of its monopoly aspects, and the transfer to the press of television licences When we know that there is interlocking control between some units of the press which have received these licences. The legislation of this Government has helped substantially to build up the press. It has the same social values as those of the Government. I was astounded to hear the Prime Minister criticize the press when it is an organization exactly the same in intent, value and purpose as the one he leads himself. This legislation also brings into question report because they fear that the implethe position of members of Parliament. I have been in this place for over three years. When I said that previously, the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Joske) said that that was as long as I would be here, but I do not hear any interjections of that sort now. The members of Parliament have been called into question by this campaign, but my experience is that they are as serious and diligent and do a job for the community as high in quality as that performed by any other group with which f am associated or of which I know. The standard of members of Parliament is as high as that of any other section of the community. It is important for the Australian Labour Party that the Parliament and members of Parliament should be held in high regard. It is not so important for our political opponents and for the press, because Labour stands for a policy which would mean that the National Parliament and the State parliaments would have to exercise a great deal more power in the community. The people will not be prepared to agree to their parliaments exercising this power unless they trust them. It is in the interests of those who want to keep power where it is-in the hands of business organizations, including the press -to have the Parliament and politicians held in ill-repute. I sometimes think that our political opponents and the press have a similar interest in this regard, because this Parliament. Of course, it is in the interests of the Australian Labour Party that the Parliament and its members should be held in high repute. Therefore, I believe that it is in our interests to take a stand on this matter which would give us credit in the eyes of the people, and that we should avoid at all times creating an impression that we are in Parliament for what we can get out of it. I think that we should try to create just the opposite impression. I should like to say something about the attitude adopted towards this legislation by the honourable member for McMillan( Mr Buchanan), the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon) and the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser). They are opposed to the recommendations in the Richardson mentation of the recommendations could lead to a general increase in costs. However, if there were no danger of that happening, I think that they would be prepared to accept these increases, but they would never agree to the principle of increases for employees generally. They do not want to see increases given to the people whom they employ, because they fear that it would lead to an increase in costs. But I remind those honourable members that there are two sides to this economic problemthe question of costs on the one side and the question of demand on the other. If wage-earners can get a little more income they can buy a little more butter, meat and wool, although, having in mind the price of wool to-day, I am amazed how any worker can buy a woollen article. This is not just a problem of costs, of depression mentality, the kind of thing that caused incomes in the 1930's to be cut and that led to 500,000 becoming unemployed. This is a matter of demand and decent standards of living, and as an economic problem it has a different bearing on different sections of rural industry. Perhaps the wool industry, because the major portion of its product is sold overseas, is satisfied to see a low wage structure, knowing that it will reduce costs of production in the industry. But the same low cost structure would have a different impact on other sections of rural industry. The dairying industry, the meat industry, and the fruit industry are examples where the greater proportion of the output of the industry is sold in this country. Those industries depend on the wage-earners having decent incomes in order to be able to buy their products. So in my view the argument submitted by some honourable members opposite, who represent country electorates, is particularly one-sided. It is an argument that cannot be justified on the ground of economics, justice, or morality. Two of the honourable members that I mentioned earlier come from sheep-producing areas, I believe. A lot has been said about insincerity with regard to this matter, but the press has made no allegations of insincerity against one parmember's predecessor? ticular group of members of Parliament. 1 refer to members of the so-called Australian Democratic Labour Party. Throughout this business they have been given favorable press publicity. There has not been one word of criticism against them. Members of that party have said that they intend to vote against the recommendations contained in the Richardson report. But I remind the House that their leader in another place, Senator Cole, appeared before the Richardson committee for one and one-half hours. What did he do? Did he oppose these recommendations? Did he say that he was against an increase of salaries and retiring allowances? I have reason to believe that he strongly advocated an increase in the remuneration for his own position to something like that of a junior Minister, arguing that he represented 10 per cent, of the Australian community. I believe that he strongly advocated an increase in salaries, but outside the committee he immediately began to fight against the increases. He and other members of his party are said to be men of honour and sincerity. They will oppose these recommendations; they will speak against them; they will vote against them; but if the legisrefrain from using the machinery of arbilation is passed they will accept the increases in order to continue the fight for justice. That was the position outlined by Senator McManus, as reported in the Melbourne "" Herald"" last Monday. I understand that my predecessor in this place, Mr Keon, has written a letter protesting violently against the exclusion of former members of Parliament from the increase in retiring allowances. He has violently stated his opposition to clause 13 of the bill that we are now discussing. He wants a retiring allowance of £18 a week, not £12, and he is a member of a party that says it is opposed on principle to this legislation. I bring this matter to the attention of the House, not because I think that sincerity or insincerity can be correlated with parties, but because I think that this particular party has been receiving very favourably biased treatment from practically every newspaper in Australia. understand why the Minister for Social Services should need to ask that question. I mention the attitude of the Australian Democratic Labour Party to these increases in order to put the record straight. In conclusion, I wish to say that in my view this report is indefensible and unacceptable. I believe, therefore, that it should be rejected. I hold those views because I believe in a fairer distribution of income among the lower income classes, and this legislation cuts right across that principle. If we are to start anywhere with a re-distribution of income, let us start at the bottom and work up, rather than the other way round. I believe that members of Parliament must work to raise the standards of Parliament. I believe that we can raise those standards by setting an example and increasing salaries on the lower levels, rather than by accepting the recommendations contained in the report. I believe that there must be an increase of wages and pensions in this country. If this report causes the Government to feel a moral responsibility to increase pensions and to tration in order to oppose the granting of wage justice to workers generally, then some good may come from the report.",45,Parliamentary Allowances

I cannotIIOL propose to offer any wearying recapitulation of the various points that have been mentioned during the debate on this bili ancl on the bill to follow this one, or to advert in any shape or form to the bill that we discussed last night. 1 have a few views that I regard as reasonably respectable, and that I mean to put in regard to the private member of Parliament. Bui before I put them, 1 should like to spend a few moments dealing with some of the points made by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns). He has said of the Richardson committee's report that it is indefensible and unacceptable. honourable member for East Sydney, agrees with him. I think a reasonable test of the egalitarianism of the honourable member for Yarra will be made when it comes to a vote on this bill. Is that egalitarianism to be defined in terms of a condemnation of the Richardson committee's report in its entirety, or is it to be considered as being directed against those things that he dislikes, putting to one side those things which meet with his approval? When the vote on this bill is taken, it will be very interesting reasons why the institution has been to see into which lobby he will walk-if I may use a House of Commons expression. His suggestion that there has been projected into the Richardson committee's report a sense of social values, I find so much hysterical nonsense. I ask the honourable gentleman whether his sense of equality is to be drawn to the stage where members of Parliament are to receive the basic wage, or is it to be drawn still further to the point where they find themselves in receipt of an amount of money comparable with an age or invalid pension? Surely the palpable absurdity of that argument is readily apparent. Then the honourable member turned on the executive heads of this country. He said that here was a widening of the social gap between the lower stratum of socieh and what have been styled the tall poppies. 1 have always regarded it as grossly unfair that the executive head of a department should find himself in an inferior financial position to that of the administrative head of the department. The doctrine of ministerial responsibility is still alive, and if an error !s made in a department it is not the administrative head who suffers and who must answer to Parliament and to the people; it is the executive head who must answer. The honourable member for Yarra. in his denunciation of this report, invoked the argument that it was necessary to build tip the prestige of members of Parliament and. ironically enough, he included members of State parliaments, although he is a member of a party that is committed to the abolition of State parliaments. May I put those rather casually made observations of the honourable member for Yarra to one side and turn to what prompted me to come into this debate? As I say, I am not offering recapitulation of the various points that have been made, but I want to express in this House my anxiety at one thing that has come out of the Richardson committee's report, and its consideration by the press and by the people of this country. It is this: The parliamentary institution-that is. this institution-ha s been damaged, and whatever one's own anxieties may be concerning oneself, I hope that it will be an intelligible point of view to profess an anxiety for the respect and integrity of the institution. One of the damaged is that people have regarded the Richardson committee-in particular, the manner in which it worked-wit h a measure of suspicion. This Parliament is charged with the responsibility of determining the salaries and allowances of its own servants. Section 48 of the Constitution seems to be quite clear on that point, and I would be the last person to suggest that there should be any divesting of Parliament's authority in this matter. Nevertheless. I am emboldened to suggest that possibly there is a far better way of Parliament's being informed as to the position of members and of those who sit in another place. One of the cogent and, to my mind, completely understandable criticisms that have been directed against the Richardson committee is that it conducted its inquiry in camera. Right from the outset, I made my attitude of mind clear. I said I believed that greater facilities should be provided for public hearings. Quite obviously, it would be impracticable for a",47,Parliamentary Allowances

116,Mr Killen,"Precisely , yes. When is a very trivial suggestion, but it is illusA few weeks ago I had a young couple in this House listening at question time. As honourable members all know, at the end of question time a number of Ministers rise and move out of the House to go about their duties. As I took this couple out to afternoon tea one of them said to me, "" Is the Prime Minister finished for the day? "" I assured them that such was not the case and that he might well be here until 11 o'clock or 11.30 o'clock at night. The young lady said, "" Can we go to meet him? "" Not wishing to disclose the fact that I did not command ready entree into the right honourable gentleman's office, I fell back upon the lame excuse that he was busy receiving a deputation. Then she said, ""Is there any possibility of meeting some of the celebrities of the Opposition?""; and she mentioned the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition. In that case I did not like to disclose the fact that the right honourable gentleman had never said to me, "" Well, Jim, your friends are my friends "". Considerable concern has been injected into this debate regarding the attitude of the press. I want to make this definite statement: I believe in the freedom of the press, but I do not believe in freedom for the press. I believe that there is a definite distinction between the two. The gentlemen of the Fourth Estate have a duty to perform equally as have members of Parliament. But they cannot discharge that duty if they are going to interpret their freedom as licence. I will give the House an illustration of licence in this matter. On Wednesday, 4th March last, at 1.20 p.m., I placed in the hands of the acting editor of the "" Sunday Mail"" in Brisbane, a full copy of the submission which I gave to the Richardson committee. The House will recall I mentioned earlier that I believe that ness must be perpetuated? AmI to cut proceedings of committees such as this should be in the open. Nothing was censored from that statement, nothing was deleted, nothing was added. It was a document consisting of three and three-quarter foolscap pages of single-spaced typing. The treatment given by the "" Sunday Mail"" to this statement upon a matter which, I was informed, was of great public interest, was to take hold of one paragraph out of the entire statement that had a news value, and to feature that paragraph only. I say to Mr Maude, the editor of the "" Sydney Morning Herald "", who protested this morning that no private member of Parliament had risen to speak their minds on this matter, that surely our cynicism is quite understandable when a private member, weeks before the Richardson committee's report was made public, handed to a newspaper a copy of the submission which he gave to the committee and it met with treatment of that sort. I say that without any malevolence, but with some warmth of feeling. Finally, I wish to make this comment: I have been a little saddened by the intellectual dishonesty of some sections of the newspapers in Australia which have persisted in linking together members' salaries and allowances. I have here an illustration from the ""Courier-Mail"", of 26th March last, listing members' new salaries and allowances. Would that newspaper be prepared to publish the fact that in the three years I have been in this Parliament my electoral allowance has been hopelessly inadequate? This is not something which is afigmentof one's imagination; it is something which can be documented and audited to meet the most respectable of inquiring minds. But this form of intellectual dishonesty does not encourage my affection for some newspapers and their treatment of a matter which involves this great parliamentary institution. SinceI have been in this House, my electoral allowance, I have found, has been hopelessly inadequate. I ask my friends, the honourable members for Deakin( Mr Davis), Flinders( Mr Lindsay) and Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon), what I am to do in these circumstances? AmI to go on eating into my salary in such a way that my indebteddown what I regard as being a reasonable discharge of my electoral duties? Is some one going to suggest seriously to me that I should wipe out contributing to all organizations? I asked the Richardson committee to give members statutory protection in that matter. Is some person going to advise, "" Cut out your postage "" ? I say quite openly that in such circumstances, no matter how deep one's convictions upon any issues might be, I could not hope to continue as a member of this Parliament. Two hundred years ago, Edmund Burke, that fount-head of clear thinking, wrote in his letter to the sheriffs of BristolI hope there are none of you corrupted by the doctrine taught by wicked men for the worse purkeep in touch with his constituents and to pose and received with the malignant credulity of envy and ignorance, which is that the men who act upon the public stage are all alike, all equally corrupt, all influenced by no other views than the sordid lure of salary and pension. Burke's hopes, as expressed to the sheriffs of Bristol, would receive little encouragement in this country. The cynical regard for Parliament and its institution is such as to make one believe that genuine conviction and desire to render public service are degenerate motives. Unless that attitude can be altered, this parliamentary institution will disappear. I share to a great extent the feelings of the honourable member for Moreton( Mr members outside this Parliament's bounds, Killen) that it may have been well if this inquiry had been conducted in public. I share also the feeling of the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) who spoke of the necessity for having this inquiry conducted by persons who were not, themselves, receiving emoluments at the discretion of this Parliament. I think perhaps this last criterion could be satisfied by doing what this Government did earlier, that is, by appointing to the commission and preferably as its chairman, a judge of a State, or, better still, a retired judge of a State, who would have the necessary prestige and experience. I think there is one solid justification only for these measures. That is, that the payment of members must be sufficient to allow a member who has no private means to discharge effectively his duties in this Parliament and the duties incidental to his membership. Now, Sir, as the honourable member for Moreton said a moment ago, we all know that if a member really discharges his responsibilities in this Parliament and to electors, the amount of allowance is quite insufficient, and he has to trench into his salary for electorate purposes unless he has private means. Much has been said about expenses in the electorates, and I shall not repeat it at great length. I regard such expenses as necessary expenses and, furthermore, expenses which, as I think the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) said, are to be welcomed as enabling a member to perform his duties properly. I also believe that there are other expenses connected with the work of this Parliament, which are very proper if the work is to be done efficiently. Although such expenses are not necessarily incurred in a member's electorate, they doubtless often have reference to the needs of his electorate. They are expenses incurred by a member in relation to special investigations into problems which come before this Parliament. Participation in such investigations is to many of us a not unpleasurable duty; but that is not the point. The point is: Is our work of value to the nation and of value to the Parliament? I believe that much of the work which has been done by honourable and outside the bounds of their electorates, is the proper function of members of a National Parliament, and has often proved of great value to the country. Now, Sir, this work cannot be done without a reasonable expenditure of money. I think that it is inevitable that the member should not be given a special travelling allowance when he is engaged on such work, because such a provision, desirable as it may be at first sight, would be almost impossible to administer. This has to be covered by means of a lump sum. I think that it is perhaps no coincidence-and this is something on which honourable members may take thought-that those people who on the Government side have played the biggest part in parliamentary committees of all kinds have been people of some private means. I say this not because I believe that those members are better than others, but because they have, through some accident, more facilities than others, and have used them. That, Sir, is right and proper; but we should not be debarring a member who has no private means from having those same facilities. Here, perhaps, lies part of the explanation why the greatest amount of committee work that has been done in this Parliament has been done on the Government side and not on",49,Parliamentary Allowances
117,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [3.54].,"the Opposition side, and it may be that the fault does not lie as much as some of us would sometimes think on the individual member of the Opposition. I believe there is this justificationa sufficient justification, and I think the only justification-for the increases in salaries embodied in this bill. It is necessary that members of this Parmore than has been paid out.

I have not yet told the whole have that kind of independence.

During 1956-57, the total payments made to members under all heads were £29,000. The contributions in cash made by members amounted to £43.000. In addition, there was an amount of £9.000 of interest earned on the accumulated funds which nearly all, though not 1957-58 the position is virtually the same. The outgoing is £31,000 and the income £43,000 plus, in this case, £11,000 interest because, naturally, the accumulation is getting higher and members' contributions continue to exceed the aid to members. If one looks at this purely from the actuarial point of view, without any contribution from the Government at all, it would seem, projecting these figures, looking at what has happened after various elections, and remembering that you accumulate, as in all these things, towards a plateau maximum which does not further rise, one would say that it looks, for the foreseeable future, as if members will continue to pay into this fund more than they may be real feelings. But one of the worse take out. based on arbitrary assumptions. the actuarial assumptions are exceedingly people turn their attention to less important arbitrary. The report shows how arbitrary things when they should be reserving they are and they have to be measured their attention for more important issues. against the experience of eleven years. This is the real charge of sensationalism Even taking the worse possible assumption which can be brought against the press and for the next three, four or five parliaments the dreadful part about it is that the -for the next twelve or fifteen yearsthe amount paid in by members will subunless it be brought also against each one stantially exceed the amount paid out to of us. We are participants in this error them. That being so, I feel that this of judgment-in this lack of sense of scheme, which is an insurance scheme run proportion. among members, and one under which members are paying in more than they take out, cannot be described as a generous scheme but as a very wide one because it does give to the member the necessary freedom of action, the feeling that he does not jeopardize his family's living if he offends those who may affect his re-election to this Parliament. I think it is, for that reason, an essential part of the proper functioning of a parliament which contains, as I think it should contain, people who have no private means. 1 do not want to reiterate what I said last night. Although there should be margins, I believe that some of the margins here provided are unhealthily large. I shall not go back over that ground.

We must preserve, of course, the freedom of the press. We must preserve its freedom to criticize. It should have that freedom and Parliament should not be too thin-skinned in regard to it.

As I mentioned at an earlier stage of the proceedings, the Opposition intends to move a number of amendments, and I think that it will be easy for honourable members to understand the position if I just give the background to the matter. The Opposition entirely approves of the basic allowances to senators, and members of the House of Representatives, which are provided for in this bill. That is the decision of the Australian Labour Party, and effect has been given to it by the party in the division that has just concluded. The bill provides also for allowances to officers of the Parliament and leaders of parties other than the Government parties. The present rates of these allowances are prescribed in sections 6, 7, 7A, 8, 9 and 10 of the principal act, and the new rates are prescribed in clauses 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this bill. I propose to move a number of amendments dealing with the allowances for officers of Parliament, and for leaders and deputy leaders of parties other than the Government party.

Treasurer) [4.28] Mr Chairman, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has moved a number of amendments. He gave an indication last night of their substance. The Opposition is seeking to reduce the amounts provided in this legislation as increased salaries and allowances for Ministers, certain office-holders of the Parliament and leaders of parties. The amendments, as I understand the position, all embody the one principle. They seek to apply that principle to a number of items contained in the bill. The Government has already quite clearly indicated its view on these matters. I think the parties have, by vote, already revealed that there is an overwhelming majority supporting the viewpoint advanced by the Government on these matters, and we cannot accept the amendtwo hundred and f if t y ' "" , ments moved by the Leader of the Opposition.

We have a big credit balance in that fund. If his successor died, his widow would get £15 a week. As we cannot make our pension payments retrospective for even six months, I cannot support a proposal to make a non-contributory fund payment retrospective for 30 years. Therefore, I support the amendment. [4.50] -It is with no particular pleasure that I support the amendment on this occasion. The effect of the amendment, if it is carried, will be to deprive Viscount Bruce of an additional amount of pension. I knew Mr Bruce, as he then was, as Prime Minister when I was a young member on the staff of the Melbourne "" Argus "". I know that he had very high personal qualities and that he carried out the duties of his office according to his lights. He worked very well indeed at the task that then had to be performed. He was, of 1 course, bitterly anti-Labour, and he did attempt in the end to destroy the whole system of Commonwealth compulsory arbitration. But I do not think those are factors pension to the present Prime Minister can which need to be taken into account at this apply to the Prime Minister of a comtime. We are not having regard to whether pletely different Australia and a completely a man served one party or another in deterdifferent government over 30 years ago. mining what should be his salary and allowances for service in this Parliament. But I do put it to the committee that every wealthy man, too. reason that has been given by the Government for singling out the Prime Minister of Australia for a special pension is a is to be applied. So far as I know, it is a reason which does not apply in this case. fact, as the honourable member for Parkes The whole argument made on behalf of has said, that Viscount Bruce does not the Government has been that the position stand in urgent need of money. But that is of Prime Minister of Australia in modern outside the real point at issue here, because times is one that is tremendously arduous Viscount Bruce did not render service, and involving an immense strain, both physical was not required to render service, or and mental, upon the occupant of that undergo strain and ordeal, of a nature that office. The Australian Labour Party has would justify singling him out for this very recognized this and has, I think, very fairly and even generously accepted the view that the Prime Minister of Australia stands in a unique position because of the immense strain and the tremendous difficulty of the task he has to perform. We have agreed that some special provision should be made for a man who has to carry that almost unbearable strain for a considerable period of years. But that would be no reason for giving a similar pension to Viscount Bruce. He was Prime Minister of Australia at a time when Australia did not have a quarter, or even one-tenth, of the obligation that the Commonwealth Government shoulders to-day. Every one of us in this party is aware of that. The population of Australia was less than half what it is now. The Commonwealth itself was confined in its duties and functions to a very limited scope 1 indeed. The annual Budget of the Commonwealth of Australia, from recollection, was certainly well under £100,000,000 and probably was around £50,000,000 to £60,000,000 compared with £1,000,000,000 to-day. The Prime Minister of Australia in the 1920's was not a harried or worried man carrying an unbearable burden. Viscount Bruce did not suffer in health, physically or mentally, as a result of any undue strain he had to carry. Indeed, those were very easy years-year s of high prices when Australia was financed by a 1 continuous flow of loans from overseas so that the task of the Government of the time was very simple.

143,Mr Allan Fraser,"No means testlarge pension at the expense of the Australian taxpayer. The Government would be branded with the utmost inconsistency if it went back 30 years to give this pension to Viscount Bruce while, in legislation already before this House, it proposes to deprive those who are not still members of the House of the benefits of the increase in the contributory pension, to which all members of the House are subscribing. To give a large increase in non-contributory pension to a man who went out of office 30 years ago, while depriving members who left Parliament in recent years of an increase in their contributory pension, would be an injustice and an inconsistency which could not be justified anywhere. I ask the Government to look at the matter again Mr Harold Holt -The pension is justified by virtue of the office held. true. The Government at no stage has used that argument. The argument has been that the office held requires and involves such a tremendous physical and mental strain on the occupant. This pension is not given because a man has held a position of honour, but because he has held a position of great strain. That certainly does not apply to Viscount Bruce, who held office in Australia when the Government of the Commonwealth had not one-tenth of its present responsibilities, when the population of the country was only one-half what it is to-day, and when the Budget was only one-twentieth the size of the present Budget. Davies, R. Sunday week, I viewed a television session called, "" Meet the Press "". There were two guests on that session. One was the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Anderson, C. G. W. Wentworth) and the other was a Mr Aston, W. J. Webster. Mr Webster is the managing director of Bradford Cotton Mills Limited. He is also chairman of Felt and Textiles of Australia Limited, and he is a director of many other large firms in this country. One would expect him to say that Viscount Bruce was entitled to this pension. But, strange to relate. Mr Webster said that the recommendation that Viscount Bruce should receive this pension was an absurd part of the Richardson report. That was the opinion of a man whom you would expect to be in favour of the recommendation. It should be apparent to anybody that if this recommendation with regard to Viscount Bruce were put to a referendum of the people, it would be defeated hands down. Such a recommendation is completely out of favour with the general public. Not one person in 100 would recommend that Viscount Bruce should get a pension of £3,000. Let us face the position. When Viscount Bruce was Prime Minister of Australia, the job was not as onerous as that of the Premier of New South Wales at that time. It is absurd to compare the job of Prime Minister in those days with the same office to-day or during the war years. Question putThat the amendment (Dr. Evatt's) be agreed to. The committee divided.

Question so resolved in the negative. to make some reference to a provision in clause 10 to which I raise strong objection. Whilst the committee has decided, by a majority of ten, to extend to Viscount Bruce the benefits provided by this clause, I avail myself of a further opportunity of raising an objection to the introduction into the parliamentary superannuation scheme of the principle of non-contributory pensions. If this clause is carried in its present form, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) on his retirement will receive a pension, not of £1,200 to which he would now be entitled, but of £3.000, which represents an increase of £1,800. I do not think that is justified. Let us examine what the Government has done with the report. As I have already said, it has abandoned the recommendation of its own committee for the extension of the principle of non-contributory pensions to ex-Ministers of this Parliament, and with that decision I and other members of the Opposition agree. But how illogical is the Government! Having abandoned that idea and taken unto itself great credit-althoug h that action was taken only after great agitation and pressure from its own supporters and from members of the Opposition-it decides that the case of former Prime Ministers will be different. Although the Prime Minister contributes each month to the superannuation fund only the same amount as is contributed by every other member of the Parliament, he will benefit enormously as a result of this legislation. This is wrong in principle. In the Public Service, if a man receives higher pay he contributes more to the superannuation fund during his working life and as a result qualifies for a higher pension upon retirement. But Prime Ministers are to receive a higher pension without any additional contribution at all. It is not a question of preventing a Prime Minister from retiring into a position where he could not maintain a reasonable standard of living. That is not involved in this case. In my opinion, if there is any man in this Menzies. R. G. Parliament who is able to provide for his McEwen. J. future, surely it is the highest paid memStokes. P. W. C. ber of it. and that is the Prime Minister. Snedden, B. M . If this series of bills pass through another chamber, he will receive, as Prime Minister, £276 per week. When he is away from his home in Canberra, he will receive a travelling allowance of £105 .a week, because the allowance is paid on a sevenday a week basis, without having to account to anybody for its expenditure. He receives also an allowance that is tax-free. Let us examine whether, as an ex-Prime Minister-whic h I hope he will soon be-h e would be well provided for. BeforeI pass from his present emoluments, may I refer to the fact that besides the actual money which he receives, he is provided with a free residence here in Canberra and a free residence, Kirribilli House, in Sydney, so there are other considerations that he receives in his position as Prime Minister. If he were to retire to-morrow, he would be well provided for. He would receive £1,092 from the contributory scheme, to which he contributes exactly the same amount as does every other member, and, in addition, he would get £1,200 a year as an ex-Prime Minister. On top of that, he would receive the £1,000 legacy from the estate of the late Sir William Angliss. So that, without regard to any other income that he might receive from investments, his known weekly income would be £98. I myself think that that is a situation that should not be permitted. If the Parliament believes that Prime Ministers ought to receive a larger pension, let that be taken into account. I think the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) said that the Government was considering a contributory scheme for additional pensions for Ministers. Let the Government extend that consideration to Prime Ministers, and if the Prime Minister wants to qualify for a higher pension, let him contribute, as he is well able to do, more from the salary which he receives. Opposition) [5.13] I want to say only a few words. The decision to pay an additional benefit to ex-Prime Ministers or their widows was taken in 1952.

Later on, it applied to Mrs. Scullin, after her husband's death. I do not want to argue the matter, because it was considered very carefully by the Opposition party yesterday. The matter was debated very fully, and the party decided most clearly that it would object to the granting of further benefits to Viscount Bruce, who has been so many years out of office. The party expressly decided, by vote, that no objection would be made in the case of the present Prime Minister. That might be altered in the future. That is why we took action in putting the proposal in relation to Viscount Bruce. I say this, not for the purpose of proposing any motion, but in order to explain to the committee, as I am bound to do, the way in which the matter comes up. Clause agreed to. Clauses 11 and 12-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 13 (Application of amendments). Opposition) [5.16] I think this can be dealt with quite shortly. The clause readsThe amendments made by sections seven, eight and nine of this Act do not apply in relation to a person who ceased to be entitled to a parliathe course which the Government is now mentary allowance (by death or otherwise) before the date of commencement of this Act, or in relation to rights that arose or arise upon the death of such a person, or of the widow of such a person, whether before or after that date. We say that is wrong because the clause denies to all those now in receipt of pensions and their dependants, the increases provided in the bill. It is not suggested that the increases cannot be provided, because the finances are in good shape. Secondly, we submit that this proposal is contrary to all previous practice. Thirdly, this proposal is not covered by the Richardson committee report in any way. It does not suggest such a thing. This is being done independently of the report which led to this legislation. Fourthly, the clause suggests a principle, which will operate in the future, that must prejudice and adversely affect present members and their dependants who belong to the fund. I could mention cases of persons well known to honourable members. Mrs. Ashley, the widow of the late Senator Ashley will be denied the increased benefits, and Mrs. Barnard, Mrs. Drakeford and Mrs. Lazzarini will be similarly affected, as will the widows of all the war-time Ministers. These are people who, in a sense, have vested rights. If the benefits from sucb a fund are increased it is only right that those rights should not be discontinued, especially seeing that this proposal has no relation whatever to the Richardson committee's report. also be affected. many others. Honourable members must agree that increased benefits should not be provided in this way. If a change in the scheme is to be made at some future time, let us consider it then; but persons who are now receiving benefits from the fund should receive the proposed increases and their rights should not be interfered with. Treasurer) [5.18] A few moments' thought on the part of members of the committee should convince them that what has been done is sound in principle. However much our natural sympathies may extend to the widows of former members, it should be obvious that there is justice in taking. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), I think for very good reasons, did not carry his argument to the point of having it applied to defeated members. Or do I misunderstand him? Is it his purpose that this provision should apply to defeated members as well as to widows? Opposition Members -Yes. ago the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) was arguing strenuously that a provision should not operate retrospectively because different circumstances prevailed in earlier years. This is a superannuation scheme to which members make contributions. Under the former scheme Viscount Bruce did not contribute at all. This is matter of different degree, is it not?

Yet, if a member who was elected for the first time only a few months ago were lo die immediately after this legislation became law his widow would be entitled to £15 a week. I do not think that that is equitable. I can quite understand a Treasury official, for instance, tak£2,000. ing the view that the increase should not be payable to anybody who has not been paying into the fund for long, but I cannot understand the proposal that it should no; be payable in respect of the widow of a man who paid inlo the fund for many years before he left this Parliament. I have had a long association with friendly societies and public actuaries, and I know that they always acted on the principle laid down many years ago that payments out of a fund are regulated in scale by the contributions made to the fund by the persons concerned, and that new subscribers to a fund are not entitled to as much benefit as are old subscribers. This clause is designed to operate in the reverse direction. Under this clause members who were contributors to the fund and lost their seats at the last election wil! also increased by 50 per cent., and the innot be entitled to the increase, and neither will the widows of such members. Let us look at this further. Quite a moments ago, we voted an increase of number of members lost their seats at the pension to an ex-Prime Minister, although last general election and. as they die. their he had made no contribution to the fund. widows will become entitled to the static I agree with that entirely and completely. amount of £10 a week.

Well, that is a very weak argument as far as I am concerned. The Government and the Opposition have agreed on this feature of the Richardson committee's report, and the only people who have disagreed with it are members of the press. This is a retiring allowance that is entirely different from any other known arrangement in Australia, as the committee said. We are not permitted, as are people who contribute to other superannuation schemes, to take out extra units in order to protect ourselves in our retirement, and protect our widows when we die. This is entirely different from anything else, and I support the Opposition's request that this matter should be further studied before we commit ourselves to an irrevocable decision in respect of people who have contributed so much to the fund. I only hope that the Treasurer will let this particular part of the legislation drop for a while, or give an intimation to the House that it will be closely examined, before we are much older, with a view to doing something for those retired members and their widows. The Opposition's point of view on this particular issue has been very clearly stated, as it has been on all other issues. The Richardson committee's report was presented to the Parliament in the form of legislation. One recommendation was that parliamentarians' retiring allowances should be increased according to a certain scale. But the Government had no recommendation in the Richardson committee report for the present proposal which has been included in a bill which is ostensibly to give effect to the Richardson committee's report. You cannot find anything in the report which says that there must be a line drawn in regard to who is to get the benefits under this proposed legislation and who is not. The honourable member for Canning( Mr butory scheme when we read the Hamilton) instanced a casea supposititious case, and I hope it always will remain so -in which a new member of this Parliament might die at a very early period of his service. His widow would be entitled, under this clause, to £15 a week from the fund, whereas the widow of a man who has retired after long and distinguished service to the Parliament, and to this nation, would get only £10 a week. That would be the case in connection with the families of Mr Holloway, Mr Dedman and Mr Scully, all of whom had eight years of service as wartime Ministers. member of this Parliament will get £3 less than would the widow of a member of the present Parliament. say that whilst the retired members live in happy retirement they get £12 a week for themselves, and their wives, while the widow of anybody who is now a member would receive £15. Once the principle of cutting off benefits is adopted members of this Parliament retiring in the future will find, when they are no longer in the Parliament, that fresh legislation will be introduced giving higher benefits to people who succeeded them in the Parliament. We think that that principle is not a good one. There has been no actuarial investigation of the scheme provided in this bill. The Ministers have made the investigations themselves. These matters should not have been made the subject of legislation until there had been a complete actuarial examination of the scheme and the trustees of the scheme, under legislation of this Parliament, had had an opportunity of examining it and reporting to their respective parties. The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) is seized with the importance of issues raised and has offered to investigate the whole question and, maybe, cover it in the legislation which is contemplated to make the recommended non-contributory pensions scheme a contributory one. before to-day. whether it wa.s thought of long before today, but we only heard of the non-contriRichardson committee's report.

I could not feel like taking that money, knowing that the families of people who had contributed to this scheme from the beginning who were war-time Ministers were being ignored because they and other members had not been here on the commencing date of this legislation. I think there are so many injustices in this scheme, so many inequities, that the Minister would be well advised to withdraw the clause entirely. There is no urgent need for the passage of this clause. The fund is not going broke immediately. It would need an exodus of 60 members of this Parliament at one election to jeopardize Prime Ministers and other Ministers. I the financial stability of the fund. That will not happen in the next three years because we are not going to have an election in that time. Therefore, it would be a good thing to withdraw this clause entirely and take it into consideration with the other scheme which the Minister is producing. Let us have the whole problem of retiring allowances for members and their dependants decided after a thorough and a competent examination. I think the Government is panicking on this question. My first impression was that some people would get a benefit who ought not to get it. I had in mind the former members of the Democratic Labour Party in this chamber. They are the luckiest people who ever came into the Parliament. They were here for six years, with one exception, but they served in three Parliaments and have gone out entitled ultimately to pensions of up to £15 a week. Most of them are receiving to-day £12 a week. Yet, we are injuring other people who are entitled to a benefit. I know that the line has to be drawn somewhere. Unfortunately, there are quite a number of people who were members of this Parliament prior to 1946 who get no benefit. They were on both sides of the chamber. We in this Parliament have been here for ten, fifteen and, in some cases, twenty years. Mr beyond the walls of this Parliament. It Frank Forde gets no benefit from the current or previous legislation. He was in the Parliament for 29 years, a Minister for six years, Deputy Leader of the Opposition for nine years and Prime Minister of this country for seven days. ber for Canning( Mr Hamilton) mentioned his case. He contributed from the beginning for over eleven years. He went out on current benefits and will be denied any additional benefit. Mr James, Mr Watkins, Mr Johnson, Mr Chambers, and a number of other people who, unlike Messrs. Johnson and Chambers, were not Ministers during the war period are also affected. I do not like drawing distinctions between believe in the old Roman adage that a leader is only the first among equals. I do not believe in providing all for the men who happen to be in the leadership of the country, while at the same time denying other benefits to people without whose cooperation no Prime Minister could have been a success. I have made my plea largely on behalf of those whom I have known in this Parliament over twenty years. But there are some people even further back than those who came into the 16th Parliament and later and who have been ignored. If we can go back and give a benefit to a man who ceased to be Prime Minister 30 years ago and who ceased to be a resident of this country 25 years ago, surely we can bring in all these other people whose service to this Commonwealth, whatever party they represented, for quite a long period, was not undistinguished, and generally went with very little reward. the committee to support the Government's proposal in this matter and accept the assurance that I have given that all the problems involved in this matter, and their implications, can be studied, first, by the trust set up under the legislation which, in turn, can report back to the parties represented in this Parliament.

But I want a little implementation by the postponement of this clause to the date on which the committee reports. Why cumber this legislation with this agreement? It will become a statutory form. The right honourable gentleman says that it raises difficulties. It raises more than difficulties. It raises questions of basic justice. Why not do, by agreement, what we have suggested and omit clause 13 in its present form from this legislation? When Parliament comes back, if there is agreement by the people interested, we can pass the necessary legislation or reject or amend it. To keep it in this form is to tell a lot of people that the door is closed to them and I do not like doing that even for 24 hours.

Chairman, I just want to explain my position very clearly. I gave an illustration earlier of the reasons why I would vote a certain way in a division. I referred to the former honourable member for Moore, and to his position as compared with that of his successor. As we could not get certain provisions dated back six months then, I was not prepared to support the proposal for non-contributory pensions, especially for persons who have been out of this place for as long as 25 years. But that does not mean that I now have to vote for the amendment. I think that the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) has made a fairly reasonable suggestion, and I realize that there are amendment before the committee. does not mean that I must now support the opposition to the clause. There are certain things which may come out of this proposal and which may be in the best interests, not only of the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Fund, but also of the Parliament, and I think that the Treasurer's suggestion that the whole matter will be very fully investigated is reasonable. I have faith in the Treasurer, of course, and I accept, that assurance. Mr J. R.

Mr George Lawson -That applies also to those members who retired at the end of thc last Parliament. Mr J. R. FRASER -It applies not only to members who were defeated. Members of this chamber who retired will be deprived of thc benefit of these increases also, and retiring senators will gain the benefits. The names of some widows who will be affected by this proposal have been mentioned in the discussion on this matter. I suggest that we should bear in mind also the widows of Mr Archie Cameron, Senator George McLeay and Mr Larry Anthony. I think that the Treasurer should withdraw the clause and leave the situation as it stands now. The bill should be passed without this clause. [5.49] Mr Chairman, I hope that the committee will in no circumstances accept the proposal made by the Leader of the House and Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) which means that we should import a new principle into the administration of the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Fund. The suggestion is that this matter should be referred to an all-party committee and that, until the all-party committee has had a look at it, the prevailing practice which has been adopted by successive variations of the amounts of the pension payments should be allowed to continue. In the course of the discussion, many anomalies which will be created if the Government's proposal is adopted have been mentioned. I think that the anomaly pointed out by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) is a fatal one. He has pointed out that if the Government's proposal is adopted members of this chamber who were defeated or who retired at the last general election will be denied the beneThe Richardson committee, which we were fit of the increased pensions, and that senators who were defeated or who retired at the last election will receive the benefit of the additional payments.

But those members who have been defeated bave been in receipt of a pension, in cases in which they were qualified to receive it, from the time of their defeat, whilst the senators in question have been contributing up to this point of time and will be called upon to pay additional contributions.

The member representing the Northern Territory may vote on any question arising in the House of Representatives.'."". The bill that is before the committee seeks to limit the voting power of the member for the Northern Territory in the House of Representatives to matters that relate solely to the Territory. I direct the attention of honourable members to the provisions of this clause. I do not want to canvass the details of the arguments that have already been advanced, because I covered most of the ground in my second-reading speech. I want to emphasize, however, that the provisions of the clause as it now stands, and which I seek to amend, will be of no earthly use to the people of the Northern Territory. The Government's proposal would limit me completely to voting on matters affecting the Northern Territory and would bar me, or any other representative of the Territory in this chamber, from voting on many matters that vitally concern the electors of the Territory. I would be prevented from voting on income tax laws and similar vital legislation on which, of course. T have not the power to vote at present. IfI had already had the voting right which the Government proposes to confer on the representative of the Northern Territory, in the last ten years I would have been able to vote on only seven occasions. Most of the measures solely affecting the Northern Territory in that period were of no great significance to the Territory. Possibly, no more than one or two would be of any significance at all. The others generally were designed to amend in a minor way some existing law of the Northern Territory. Therefore, the limited right proposed in the clause-if it can be called a right at allis useless and insignificant and does not affect the status of the member for the Northern Territory in the House of Representatives. I would have expected that the Government would have introduced an amendment which would be at least a step towards granting at some future date a right which the people of the Territory have so frequently and rightly demanded. There is no (Northern Territory) constitutional barrier to giving the member for the Northern Territory, whoever he may be, the powers that I have sought for so long. For the benefit of honourable members. I shall read section 122 of the Constitution which relates to this situation. That section has this to say about the Parliament's powers to make laws for the Northern Territory and its representationThe Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit. The founders and fathers of the Constitution envisaged a set of conditions such as we have in the Northern Territory to-day. They had in mind the exceptional circumstances that might arise in relation to the Territory concerning the numbers of electors who constitute the average Australian electorate to-day. I concede that we have only about 9,000 electors in the Northern Territory. I concede also that the average Australian electorate has about 40,000 voters, but I believe the founders of the Constitution had that situation in mind when they inserted section 112. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) relies on numbers as the basis when assessing the Territory's right to full or even partial representation in the House of Representatives. I remind the committee that it is 37 years since the original legislation granting partial representation to the Northern Territory was passed by the Parliament. In that 37 years, there has been no worth-while amendment to that act. To all intents and purposes, the position of the representative of the Northern Territory in this chamber remains as it was 37 years ago. The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), who was the Minister for Labour and National Service, gave an indication of the Government's objection to a change last year. I think the Government's real objection to granting full representation to the Northern Territory in this chamber does not lie in numbers. It lies in the fact that I , who represent the Northern Territory now, am a member of the Opposition. 1 shall read to the committee a statement made by the Treasurer when he conferred with members of the",72,Northern Territory Representation Bill 1959

It is high time an area such as the Northern Territory. I think that we accepted the fact that we in this it would be in the best interests of the Northern country are all Australians. There are no Territory if the representative from that part of distinguishing barriers or boundaries. The Australia could give us in this Parliament quite objectively the views and problems of his electorate Opposition's request is a reasonable one, not coloured by party bias. I feel that the Treasurer put his finger on attention and support of honourable the Government's real objection to granting members. any further extension of the voting powers of the member for the Northern Territory. The limited concession that is proposed in this bill is put forward as a measure of recommittee were traversed in the secondform to satisfy the demands of the people of the Northern Territory, but which in effect accomplishes nothing at all.

It is the whole substance of the bill. The Government's proposal is ber for the Northern Territory has no votwill, if this bill is passed, have the right to vote on any law that relates solely to the right to vote on the disallowance of any to the Northern Territory. So the bill makes a distinction between no voting rights of any kind and a limited voting right.

205,Mr Hasluck (Curtin,"Minister forthat was laid down for the States of Australia and for the residents of other parts of Australia. Section 122 of the Constitution clearly envisages special arrangements in respect of Commonwealth Territories, and it clearly envisages that those special arrangements, whatever they may be, should be such as Parliament itself should decide were fit and proper. That is the particular problem to which we apply ourselves this evening-wha t are the appropriate arrangements to make in respect of the powers of the honourable member for the Northern Territory in this chamber, the voting rights of the honourable member in this chamber? So far as the functioning of the House is concerned, the member for the Northern Territory is, as all of us are, the representative of a constituency. Like all of us, he has his duty to his constituency, to represent it, to see that the particular interests that arise in his part of Australia are fairly represented to the chamber. But besides doing that, every member in this chamber shares in two other responsibilities. One is the making of laws, which apply not solely to his constituency, but to the whole of the Commonwealth and to all the people of the Commonwealth. In the making of those laws honourable members, coming as they do from various constituencies, have the same voting power. The other responsibility that is in our hands relates to the formation of governments. If after an election this party or that party has a majority of supporters on the floor of the House, it forms the government. That is the way in which the decision of the electors of Australia is transmitted into political actiona counting of heads. That is how governments are formed. Then, as we all know, if it should happen that there should be a defection of some of the supporters of a government, so that the government can no longer command a majority on the floor of the House can no longer muster the votes that are necessary to carry legislation that it considers vital-that government goes out of office. So each of us has this additional function of not only representing a constituency, not only making laws in respect of the whole of Australia, but also of deciding the fate of governments in Australia. Let us, then, consider the Northern TerriConstitution, do we give to the representatory, but not as a Territory with its own tive of a constituency of 8,000 voters constitutional problems, because those constitutional problems are being tackled by this Government in other measures that are before the Parliament and which relate to the constitutional arrangements made inside the Territory itself. Let us look rather at the functioning of this Parliament, and the way in which the functioning of Parliament is related to the formation of governments and the rise or fall of governments. As every honourable member knows, the Constitution and the electoral laws lay down very strict provisions regarding the division of the whole of Australia into electorates, and although, in State legislatures, it is quite common to have a weighting of votes to give greater power to remote areas, country electorates, or mining electorates, under the Commonwealth Constitution and the Commonwealth electoral law there is no such weighting. Indeed, there is the most careful provision to ensure that there is a numerical evenness, almost a uniformity, among the electorates. It is prescribed that the number of electorates shall be decided by such and such a process. Then when that number is decided, another little piece of arithmetic is performed, which gives you the quota of voters which may be in each electorate. It is also laid down that there shall not be a greater variation from that established quota in each electorate than is prescribed. The result of that is that in Australia to-day there are uniform electorates ranging between the smallest, with 31,000 voters, and the largest with 65,000. I think the average is about 42,000, and there is a provision that if the variation becomes too great there will be an immediate adjustment so as to make the electorates as nearly as possible equal to each other. That is the deliberate intention of the Constitution, and it is the pattern on which this House is formed. Against that background we look at the Northern Territory. I ask honourable members to look at it not as a territory with its constitutional problems, because those constitutional problems are being dealt with in another way. Look at it as a constituency of this Parliament. It is a constituency which consists of 8,000 electors. Against those principles, so clearly established in the precisely the same power as belongs to the representative of what might be called the normal Australian constituency, which is roughly five times that size? The founders of the Commonwealth took care in the Constitution to produce evenness of representation on a population calculation. To depart from that would be to upset a principle that has applied since federation and that still applies in the working of this Parliament. That is the only reason why, at the present time, the Government finds itself unable to agree with the view presented by the honourable member for the Northern Territory that he, representing 8,000 voters, should have exactly the same power in deciding the fate of governments and in making laws for the whole of Australia as is enjoyed by the representatives of constituencies which are numerically five times as strong. That is the simple position. It is not a matter of lack of sympathy with the rightful aspirations of the Northern Territory. Nor is it a suggestion that the people of the Northern Territory are under any sort of a stigma. Rather is it a recognitorates varies from 31,000 to about 67,000. tion of the standard and established pattern of parliamentary government in the Commonwealth of Australia. We on the Government side have tried to extend, as far as we feel justified in doing at the present stage, the voting powers of the member for the Northern Territory. Whereas, as I said previously, he now has no power to vote in this Parliament, in future he will have a limited power to vote. He will be able to vote on laws which relate solely to the Northern Territory, and in respect of the disallowance of regulations which apply to the Northern Territory. But in the vital matters of deciding who governs Australia and whether a government stands or falls, we say that it would be contrary to the principles of the Constitution to allow him the same standing as that of representatives of other constituencies of much greater size. That is the simple position, as we see it. Therefore, much as we may sympathize with the aspiration of the people of the Northern Territory to take a greater share in the affairs of the whole of Australia, we cannot accept the amendment and will vote against it. support the amendment moved by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson). I congratulate him on his persistent fight to achieve reasonable self-government for the people of the north, and on his campaign to see that they have a voice and a vote in this, the National Parliament. It is clear that the Government is not sympathetic. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) has said so. He said that it was a matter of counting heads. He seems to be more concerned with the political implications of the strength of parties than with the overall problems of Australia. He has adopted the attitude that there are insufficient people in the Northern Territory to-day to justify having a member with full voting rights and that that is a static condition which will not change, and that consequently the honourable member for the Northern Territory should not be clothed with power equal to that of other honourable members to record a vote on all matters affecting the nation. I join issue with the Minister on that attitude. He has pointed out that the number of people enrolled in the various elecThere is quite a substantial variation in those numbers. I put it to the committee that the 8.000 people who are eligible to vote in the Northern Territory to-day should not be overlooked. There is a population of 20,000. and many of these people will become voters in the future. This is not a static situation. More people will go to the Northern Territory, unless the Government intends to write off that vast area, which is so important to Australia. We all believe that the population of the Northern Territory will grow. It must grow, and if it is to grow, its representative should be provided now. not at some time in the future, with a vote in the affairs of this nation. Why should he be given a vote? In the matter of the security of this country, surely the north is vital. Not only is the north vital to the rest of Australia, but also the rest of Australia is vital to the north. The honourable member may have a say in the future in some aspects of the government of the Northern Territory, but surely it is important to the Northern Territory that effective foreign and defence policies should be followed in order to secure the north for the people of the Northern Territory. I think that that goes without saying.",74,Northern Territory Representation Bill 1959
206,Mr Luchetti (Macquarie) [8.55],"ITo deny the honourable member for the Northern Territory a vote in matters affecting the security of the nation is to deprive the people of the north of a say in the affairs of the Government of this country. It should also be remembered that the people of the Northern Territory, like other Australians, pay their taxes. The old cry, "" No taxation without effective, full representation "", has been taken up by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, and it may well be repeated. Surely, matters affecting our economy are vital to the north, and surely the honourable member for the Northern Territory is entitled to a say in regard to budgetary proposals affecting the whole nation, because the financial and economic policies followed by this Government have a bearing on the affairs of the Northern Territory. Another important matter is transportation. Surely, the honourable member for the Northern Territory should be entitled to say what type of transport policy should be determined by the Commonwealth for the north of Australia. His voice should be heard when the railhead reaches the boundary of the Northern Territory not only in respect of the pattern of transport to serve the Territory but also on behalf of the people whom he so ably represents in this place. When one considers the question of security and of the economic affairs of this nation, transportation is most important and the honourable member should be entitled to a vote on these vital matters on behalf of the people in his area. It is important that in this place there should be a person who understands the needs and requirements of the people of northern Australia. He should be able to speak here as an equal with representatives of other areas, not as a junior partner voicing an opinion and restricted to voting on only minor matters. He should have a full right to vote on important matters such as I have just mentioned. Decisions which are made in Canberra vitally affect the Northern Territory and, therefore, the honourable member should be given full authority to speak for that area and to vote on what is proposed. 1 regret that the Government, after the persistent campaign of the honourable member among the people in the Northern Territory and his continued advocacy for their welfare and advancement should be rewarded in such a grudging and parsimonious manner. Mr L. R. Johnson -It is a mere sop. to me to be nothing more than an attempt to satisfy, to some extent, the clamour of the people in the north. Members on this side have often commented on the fact that people in the north feel their remoteness and the fact that they have not an effective voice in this Parliament. They are not able to express their point of view by vote. These anomalies should be corrected by the Minister, and I suggest that he should rise above the small, petty, political, partisan attitude and give to the honourable member for the Northern Territory an effective vote in the affairs of this nation. That vote will affect all of Australia, for be it remembered, in the final analysis, what happens throughout the whole of Australia is important also with regard to the north of Australia. I support the amendment. [9.3] I do not suppose there is any one in this House who has a greater sympathy for any movement which makes for the decentralization of government than myself, since 1 have been actively associated with a struggle to secure self-government for northern New South Wales for something over 40 years. I must say that I noted with regret that a remark by the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) and apparently by the leader of the House( Mr Harold Holt) in regard to certain implications in the voting responsibilities of this House should have been represented to mean that the desires of the people of the Northern Territory are being blocked for the simple reason that the granting of full voting powers to their representative in this House would merely give one more vote to the Labour Opposition. I think that is a most unfair and unreasonable summing up of the purpose and intention of what I heard the Minister say to-night. The Minister simply pointed to the great disparity between the number of electors in the average constituency in this House and the number in the Northern Territory. It is not fair or reasonable to expect that the representative of the Territory, which has",76,Northern Territory Representation Bill 1959

It is quite true and worth remembering with some feeling of profound regret that that the Constitution provides that there the rate of its development was for many shall be a minimum representation of five years less under the Commonwealth than members irrespective of numbers for the it was under the aegis of the State of South original States. That was put in the ConAustralia.

Neverpouring large sums of money into various theless, it is quite true that in Tasmania the activities in co-operation with private number of electors required to elect a organizations, for the development of the member to this House is, speaking from material and other resources of the Northmemory, something of the order of 31,000 ern Territory. as against a maximum number of 67,000. But between an electorate of 31,000 in one particular State and a total membership to a proposal for granting to the Northern of 8,000 in the Territory is a very wide Territory the fullest powers of self-governgap indeed. I would say that what the ment which would be consistent with the Government has put forward is fair and federal contract under which this Comreasonable in that it extends the voting monwealth is formed, placing upon the new powers of the representative of the Northern States, under, say, something like the Territory in this House, and it does foreFinancial Agreement, certain responsibilishadow, which I hope I may see in my ties which States alone can discharge.

R. FRASER (Australian Capital Nelson) and seconded so well by the I think that the arguments ( Mr Hasluck) do not hold water, Mr limited number of measures, why not, Chairman, and indeed they can be refuted quite easily. The Minister has stated, and reiterated, that the only reason for limiting the voting powers of the member for the Northern Territory is the numerical smallness of the' electorate. He has said that a member representing at the most, some 8,000 electors, should not be given equal voting rights with the representatives of electorates in the States, the average number of whose electors varies from 40,000 to 44,000. He asked a question, and answered it in the negative. He asked: Should the member for the Northern Territory, representing some 8,000 electors, have the power to decide the fate of an Australian Government? He answered that question by saying that definitely the member should not have that power. When speaking to this amendment, the Minister contrasted the size of the electorate of the Northern Territory with the size of the electorate of Kalgoorlie and the size of the average electorate. He pointed out that the Northern Territory has an electoral enrolment of 8,000, and said that the electorate of Kalgoorlie had an electoral enrolment of 31,000. Kalgoorlie's enrolment is something like 32,300. He said that the electorate of Lalor had some 65,000 electors; in fact, its enrolment is more than 67,300. I point out that, while the Minister says that a member representing 8,000 electors should not have the same voting rights as a member representing 31,000 electorsa difference of 23,000-h e is quite happy that the represenative of Kalgoorlie, with 32,000 electors should have equal voting rights with the representative of the electorate of Lalor, with 67,000 electorsa difference of 35,000. The Minister has said that a member representing so few electors should not have, by his vote, the power to destroy or defeat a government. But the bill itself gives the member for the Northern Territory the right to vote on any measure solely affecting the Northern Territory. So, in point of fact, if the numbers were nearly even on these measures, the member for the Northern Territory could defeat the Government by his vote. defeat the Government by his vote on a indeed, give him full power to vote on all measures that come before this Parliament? The Minister referred to the position created by the Constitution. I should like to remind the Minister that section 24 of the Constitution provides as follows:The House of Representatives shall be composed of members directly chosen by the people of the Commonwealth, and the number of such members shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice the number of the senators. The Constitution had already laid down that the number of senators shall be equal for each of the States. The section continuesThe number of members chosen in the several States shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of their people, and shall, until the Parliament otherwise provides, be determined, whenever necessary, in the following manner:(i.) A quota shall be ascertained by dividing the number of the people of the Commonwealth That is, the whole countryas shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, by twice the number of the senators: Thus giving the quota for an electorate. The section continues(ii.) The number of members to be chosen in each StateI n fact, I think And it was State electorates to which the Minister was referringshall be determined by dividing the number of the people of the State, as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, by the quota; and if on such division there is a remainder greater than one-half of the quota, one more member shall be chosen in the State. The section concludes with the following provision:But notwithstanding anything in this section, five members at least shall be chosen in each Original State. Under that constitutional provision the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918-1953. Section 25 of that act deals with redistribution, and that is the section to which, presumably, the Minister was referring when he adverted to the quota set for an electorate. I remind the committee that section 25 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act provides as follows(1.)

Such proclamation may be madela) whenever an alteration is made in the number of Members or.' the House of Representatives to be elected tor the State; and (b) whenever in one-fourth of the Divisions of this measure which the Minister says is not ihe State the number of the electors differs from a quota ascertained in the one of party politics. I know there are manner provided in this Part to a greater extent than one-fifth more or visited the Northern Territory and have one-firth less; and (c) at such other times as the Governor General thinks fit. The point I want to make is that the Minister is seeking to relate the provisions of the Constitution, dealing with the electorates provided within the boundaries of States, to the power of the Commonwealth to create electorates, such as the ones it has created in territories of this Commonwealth, and the power of this Parliament to provide for the representation of those electorates on the basis that it thinks fit. Section 122 of the Constitution, to which the Minister also referred, makes perfectly clear that this Parliament has the power, the right and, I suggest, the duty, to grant full voting rights to the member for the Northern Territory. The Minister read that section to the committee, but I shall read it again. It readsThe Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such territory in either of the people of the Northern Territory! I House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit. Having quoted that section 1 remind the committee that the provisions of section 24 of the Constitution, and of section 25 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, refer entirely to electoral divisions created entirely within the boundaries of States. SoI suggest the Commonwealth has power under section 122 of the Constitution to give the member for the Northern Territory full been an exhilarating experience to listen voting rights without having to have regard to the members of the Australian Country to the number of electors within the'bounParty and the Liberal Party defending the daries of the Territory. The Minister has cause of equal electorates. After all. their said-and I think quite reasonably-that history in this country has been completely this is not a matter of party politics. Tbe to ignore the idea of "" one vote one value "" Constitution lays it down that representa'as applied to the electoral boundaries of tion may be allowed on such terms and in State Parliaments. I do not know why the such conditions as the Parliament thinks Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck). who fit. I suggest that if the Minister is serious is absent from the chamber, could not have and sincere, as I believe he is, in saying stayed here on this occasion. Having listhat this is not a matter of party politics tened to the honourable member for New -no t a matter of seeking to gain advantage here or in some other place-h e should let the Parliament decide. Let there be no division in this chamber on party lines on men on the Government benches who have considerable knowledge of that Territory. I believe they would prefer to be able to vote so that the member for the Northern Territory will have full voting rights in this Parliament. I think that that time should no longer be delayed. I invite the rebels who were in evidence earlier in the day to make a day of it and vote with the Opposition to carry this amendment and give the member for the Northern Territoryan electorate which has been represented here for some 37 years-the right to vote on equal terms with every other member of this chamber. I suggest that power to do this exists because no limit is imposed under the Constitution. When it is claimed that it should not be possible for a government to be defeated by the vote of the member for the Northern Territory, representing only 8,000 electors, let me remind the committee that the fate of any government may be decided by a handful of votes in any one electorate of the Commonwealth. So what nonsense it is to talk of limiting the rights am not so much concerned with the member for the Northern Territory as an individual. He is still on the pay-roll whether he has a vote or not. I know how strongly he feels about this matter. But I believe that the slight on the people of the Northern Territory should be removed by support for this amendment.",77,Northern Territory Representation Bill 1959
209,Mr Bryant (Wills) [9.22.],"It hasEngland( Mr Drummond), I thought perhaps that a change of heart has occurred in the Liberal Party and the Country Party. I want to pay a tribute to the work of my honourable friend from the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) and my honourable friend from the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) who. in the period 1 have been in this Parliament, and before that time, have put before the Parliament and the people of Australia the demand for equal rights for the people they represent and for themselves as parliamentarians. Let us consider the proposition put forward by the Minister-that there are only 8.000 voters in the Northern Territory. This is the Minister-and the Liberal Party is the party-that speaks of humanitarian rights. Yet. in the course of his speech, not once did he mention the 16,000 aborigines of the Northern Territory who are just as entitled to be represented in this chamber by a full voting member as any other person born under the Southern Cross. The total of 16,000 aborigines-w e have not accurate statistics-probabl y includes 6,000 adults who ought to be voters and who ought to have some say and be represented in this Parliament. Those 6,000 aborigines in addition to the 8,000 people already on the roll in the Northern Territory make a total of 14,000 citizens. Yet they are considered not to be entitled to be represented by a full voting member in this Parliament because other electorates have 31,000 and up to 67,000 voters! What is the actual position in relation to the membership of this Parliament? The State of Tasmania has about 180,000 voters. It is represented in this Parliament by ten senators and five members of the House of Representatives-fiftee n parliamentarians with full voting powers. They can become Ministers of the Crown. On important decisions of state, such as that now being made in the Senate, they have full voting rights. A total of 180,000 divided by fifteen gives, I think 12,000. So, for every 12.000 Tasmanians there is one fully fledged and accredited parliamentarian. But there are at least 14,000 adults in the Northern Territory yet their representative can vote in this place only on matters which solely concern the Northern Territory. Surely a parliamentarian from the Northern Territory should be able to exercise a vote in this Parliament equal to the vote of any other member Even on the grounds of simple arithmetic the member for the Northern Territory should have every right to act in this place as an equal to the rest of us. What anomalies are being created and defended in the arguments that have been put forward on the Government side of the chamber! Let us assume, for a moment, that the member for the Northern Territory became a member of the Cabinet. In Cabinet he could contribute to the making of policy decisions by casting a vote which would be the equal of any other. But when the matter on which he had voted in Cabinet came to the House to be authorized by legislation, he could not vote on it. That is one anomaly which is being perpetuated in this legislation. There are dozens of matters upon which the member for the Northern Territory ought to be able to vote. To-day, the House made a decision on pensions for parliamentarians-pension s towards the cost of which the member for the Northern Territory contributes equally with every other member. The vote on that measure affected the spending of the money which the member for the Northern Territory contributes to this co-operative undertaking in which he is equal to every other member. Yet he had no vote on the measure! The member for the Australian Capital Territory had no vote on it either. In the election of the Speaker-the person who under this legislation will determine the issues upon which the honourable member for the Northern Territory may vote in the Housethat honourable member has no vote. He has no vote in the election of parliamentary committees such as the Printing Committee, the Library Committee, and the Public Works Committee. But he can sit on those committees as an equal member. What anomalies are being perpetrated in this proposed amendment to the act! This legislation is simply the result of another delusion such as we saw represented in the amendment to the Northern Territory Legislative Council legislation. Why cannot the members of the Liberal Party face up to things and treat human beings as human beings and one man as one man. and not worry about whether he represents the same number of people as members from other electorates? Not only is the member for the Northern Territory the representative of the people of that Territory in this chamber, but he may be regarded as their State member and their senator as well. Indeed, he is their State Parliament. He is the only member who can speak for them as State parliamentarians and senators speak for the people of other States. Far from being deprived of special facilities and power in this chamber, he should be given special power and rights. He represents a special relationship between his constituents and the Parliament, and also the Government. Therefore, I disregard all the arguments that have been put forward by Government supporters. As a member of this Parliament, the honourable member for the Northern Territory ought to be treated as the equal of other members. He has the same job to do in representing his constituency. The duties that devolve upon him are identical with those which devolve upon other honourable members in this place. I understand that the honourable member is likely to go overseas as a representative of this Parliament and this country to the Inter-parliamentary Union meeting where, I have no doubt, he will be regarded as an equal and, if matters come to a vote, will have an equal vote. What nonsense it is that we should deprive him of a full vote in this chamber! Therefore I earnestly support the proposed amendment. I am very disappointed that there are not more people in the chamber this evening to take part in this debate and that successive members from the Opposition side have had to make their contributions, hoping that somebody from the other side would get up and support the Minister. This is indicative of the attimost difficult part of Australia receive due tude of honourable members opposite. When it comes to fundamental principles of parliamentary democracy they pay their respects by staving away. followed with great interest the debate that has taken place on the amendment moved by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), and I have been somewhat surprised at some of the views that have been expressed. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) has based his objection to the amendment entirely on certain provisions of the Australian Constitution that have relation to States, and States only. One finds, on examining section 24 of the Constitution, which was referred to by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser), that it was the number of people in the Commonwealth that had to be considered in fixing the, quota mentioned there. I ask honourable members just to visualize what the position was when the founders of the Constitution drew up the particular sections which have been referred to by the Minister. At the time, there were six colonies, which became the six States. South Australia then included the Northern Territory, and the whole of the people of South Australia had representation in the Federal Parliament. Through their representative, they could exercise an effective vote, whether they lived at Darwin or at Adelaide. At that time, every person in what was then the State of South Australia had effective representation in the National Parliament. At the moment when the South Australian Government ceded to the Commonwealth that portion of Australia now known as the Northern Territory, the people in that Territory lost their civil right, as Australians, to effective representation in the National Parliament. I think it is fair to say that the founders of the Constitution, who, at the time when they drew it up, were actuated by the most democratic of thoughts, never dreamed that the sections of the Constitution which have been quoted here this evening would be used as a reason for depriving citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia of an effective vote in the National Parliament. So separation of the Northern Territory from South Australia has not meant that the people who are prepared to pioneer a consideration. The fact that they possess the pioneering spirit and are prepared to do their level best to develop Australia has resulted in their complete loss of franchise in the National Parliament. I think that we, as members of that Parliament, have to view the matter from the stand-point of the democratic civil rights of the people who live in what is now known as the Northern Territory. We have to consider two aspects of this question. The first is the development of the Territory itself. You cannot expect a territory to be developed unless the people",80,Northern Territory Representation Bill 1959
210,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [9.30],"I havewho do the work of developing it are recognized as citizens with the full rights of citizenship. In the Northern Territory, we have an area which, because of its richness in minerals, is gradually but surely attracting population. It is rich in pastoral resources, and large tracts of land have been leased for rice-growing. In that Territory, a number of men and women are doing the pioneering work needed to make it a valuable territory and a source of potential wealth for Australia. But all that they receive in return for their display of pioneering spirit, the hardships that they endure, and the work that they are prepared to do to develop Australia, is the immediate loss of their rights of franchise in the National Parliament. The second aspect of this question that we have to consider is that the people of the Northern Territory are this country's first line of defence. If ever we face again the same problems that we faced in 1941 and 1942, the defence of this country will begin in the Northern Territory. We shall expect the people of that Territory to do whatever is necessary and, if need be, to lay down their lives in order to defend a country which is not prepared to give them the franchise in respect of the National Parliament. When we look at the matter from that stand-point, we must take into consideration something apart from the ideas that were expressed in the Constitution in the light of the political and geographical divisions of Australia as they stood at the time when the Constitution was drafted. We are responsible for the Northern Territory and, if we believe in civil rights and democratic liberty, it is our duty to ensure that the people of the Territory have the right to express themselves on all the matters which affect them, in the same way that the people of the States may express themselves. The people of the Northern Territory are defence of Australia. Are they not entitled to have an effective voice in that matter? They are concerned with the development of Australia. Are they not entitled to express their views effectively on that matter? All the national matters which we have occasion to debate in this chamber from time to time are equally as important to, and have equal effect upon, the people of the Territory. They must obey the laws that we pass. They must pay the taxes that we levy. They must do all the things that this Parliament says shall be done by the citizens of Australia. Yet we deny them the right to have an effective say in the enactment of the laws which they must obey! There is only one other thing that I desire to say, Mr Chairman. I want to impress upon honourable members as firmly as I can the fact that we are a nation that is proud of its active participation in the fight to establish the right of every adult to a vote and the acceptance of the principle of one man one vote and the principle that the people shall be able to determine the questions which affect them. That fight has been an extremely long one, and it has been fought in every State of the Commonwealth. When we read the history of the respective States, we find that the first thing that the adventurous pioneers who came to this country in the 50's of last century fought for was the right to vote in the selection of the people who would pass the laws that the citizens would be compelled to obey. I suggest to this Parliament, and to the Commonwealth Government, which describes itself as a democratic government, and which claims to believe in civil liberties and civil rights, that 8,000 people, spread over a vast area almost as extensive as the northern part of Western Australia, should not be deprived, merely by reason of their small number, of the right effectively to express their views through an elected representative with an effective vote in the National Parliament. If we believe in democracy, it is our duty to see that its principles are extended by the legislation that we enact here to the citizens in the far-flung places of the north who are doing a wonderful job for this Commonwealth. They should not be penalized because they are prepared to go concerned with the out into the wide open spaces and develop this country. They should not, for that reason, be deprived of the right effectively to express their views in the National Parliament. I sincerely hope that that democratic sense of justice which maintains that every person 21 years of age and over is entitled to vote will be given effective expression in this measure so that the people of the Northern Territory may have the right to express their views through their elected representative in this place in the same way that citizens of the States express their views through the honourable members who represent them. Chairman, I am not without sympathy for the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for the Northern Terriarguments with which it has been supported, but on account of another argument that I shall advance in a moment. I have not been impressed by the argument of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) that we should give effect to the principle of one man one vote and thereby give a vote in this place to the member who represents the Northern Territory. After all, the average enrolment of voters in electorates in the rest of Australia is 42,000, and the number of voters in the Northern Territory is 8,000roughly one-fifth. If you gave a full vote to the member for the Northern Territory, you would, in effect, be giving a full vote to one-fifth of a man. SoI am not impressed by that argument. Again, it is said that in the event of war parties, that you will have more money the Northern Territory might well become an important theatre, and for that reason a vote should be given to the member for the Territory. Well, I suppose that in a future war there might be fighting across the North Pole, and on the argument that I have just outlined it might be suggested that the United States of America should occupy that area and give a vote to the Eskimos. I am not impressed with the argument that because a particular area might become a theatre of war the people who live in it should be represented in D "".rliament. There is, however, a very important argua vote, they would have a real contest ment that could be advanced. This area has remained stagnant for well over half a century. It is true that it is beginning to be developed now, to some extent, because of the increase in mining activity and because of other developments in recent times. But it has stagnated for a very long time. Any one familiar with its history is aware of the fact that a succession of Commonwealth governments has done rather less well than even the Government of South Australia did when the area was under the jurisdiction of that State. I should have thought that perhaps an not need to spend money in Bradfield, and important argument in favour of giving a vote to a member representing the Territory was this: If he is to have a vote in this House it will become important to both their members representing the Territory. As the Minister has pointed out, if you give this vote, then a man representing 8,000 people could turn a government out of office or put a government into office. The member representing the area would have very considerable power. A government, feeling that it might go out of office if it could not win the seat for one of its supporters, might well be disposed to spend a good deal of money in that part of Australia. Nothing, of course, could advance the development of the Territory more. The only problem is that the present honourable member, who represents the Labour Party, has been returned unopposed, and the vote for the Labour Party is so overwhelming in the Northern Territory that the possibility of development in the way I have suggested is not very great. It is only when the numbers are fairly even, so as to provide for a real contest between the spent in the Territory. If it is going to be a blue-ribbon Labour seat, and if no Liberal can ever win it, quite obviously the Labour Party, if it were in power, would not need to spend any money there, because it would have its candidate returned in any case. When the Liberal Party is in power it would not consider it worthwhile spending, money there because it would not win the seat in any case. Perhaps, therefore, the people of the Territory should consider whether they should split the vote a little more evenly between the two parties. They would have a member in this House with between the two parties, and money would be spent on development. That is a matter for the people of the Northern Territory to consider. So. I am not entirely out of sympathy with the amendment, and I merely suggest that the people in this area might arrange for a more even balance between the supporters of the various parties. of Bradfield?",82,Northern Territory Representation Bill 1959

214,Mr Turner,"The Government doesperhaps the people of Bradfield should consider the situation in the light of the remarks I have just made concerning the Northern Territory. It is most important that the Northern Territory should be developed. When reference is made to the fact that its population is only 8,000, I am reminded of the fact that one small division in my electorate contains 8,000 people. Yet there is no comparison whatever between two or three suburbs in my electorate and the vast area of the Northern Territory, with its great problems of development, particularly with regard to transport, the cattle industry, mining, tropical agriculture and other fields. There is no comparison whatever. To suggest that the 8,000 people in my electorate correspond in any way to the 8,000 people in the Northern Territory would be absurd. There is every reason, therefore, why these people, who have such a task to perform, should be better represented than those living in, say, the suburbs of the capital cities. Perhaps better representation would greatly enhance the prospects of development in that area. There is no doubt whatever that the Territory does need an infusion of new blood. As the honourable member for the Northern Territory knows, it is impossible to develop the area more intensively without much better transport facilities than are available at present. He knows, for example, that the Barkly Tableland could be much more closely settled if there were a railway or some means of moving cattle or sheep-if it is possible to run sheep there-to the seaboard. He knows that closer settlement of that area is intimately bound up with transport. I, personally, know that the people of the Territory need to be shaken up a good achieved unless better transport facilities deal. Two or three years ago I had the are provided and there is a real shake-up. experience of going through the NorthernI can well imagine that the amendment Territory, across the stock-route on the moved by the honourable member, if it did Barkly Tableland, on a motor cycle.

She broadcast the information over the pedal radio that a Communist was coming through and should not be welcomed-and I was not welcomed. I had some conversation with the manager of Bunette Downs station. He did not invite me to sit down. He realized, I presume, that I was a Communist. At Anthony's LagoonI was told that there was plenty of camping space outside. I had my camping equipment with me, and I camped in the wide open spaces. I mention these things because they are diverting in themselves, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I am not usually taken for a Communist, and the hospitality of the wide open spaces was a new thing to me. These people in the Northern Territory suffer from xenophobia. They are remote from ordinary civilization. Having considered their methods of running cattle, 1 believe that they are in a very backward state indeed, and I feel that the best thing for the Northern Territory would be a thorough shake-up. There should be far more people there, far more progressive people, and people without the xenophobic outlook adopted by those that I happened to meet. I want to see the Territory develop. I want to see far more people there, with far more progressive methods of animal husbandry and a different attitude from that which has been prevalent for so long, "" What was good enough for our fathers is good enough for us, and we do not want to see any new people coming here.

It is quite clear that, if we reckon the people of the aboriginal race in the Northern Territory as being on an electoral roll, we have an entirely different size of constituency than exists to-day where the 8,000 people about whom we are speaking are largely Europeans. The non-inclusion of aborigines in a State is not of much significance numerically, because they would not add very greatly to a State's quota or give it any additional seats if they were counted. But in the Northern Territory, in the existing balance of population anyhow, they are a very significant group. If the people of the Northern Territory wished to have a broader sympathy from the people of Australia in the claims which their representative has been putting for0 ward so skilfully to-night, many broad sections of Australian public opinion could be mobilized on their behalf if they were equally concerned about the representation of the people of aboriginal race in their Territory as they are about their own problems. I want to stress that what the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr comply equally with its laws. That may be Nelson) is saying to-night is something which is entirely a matter for the judgment of this chamber. The Minister is not bound to consider quotas of electorates throughout the Commonwealth when determining the representation of the Northern Territory or the representation of the Australian Capital Territorly. I think that the case of the Australian Capital Territory is as strong as that of the Northern Territory, but the position of the Northern Territory is rather sadder than that of the Australian Capital Territory. I think that the electors of the Australian Capital Territory, many of whom come here and sit in the seats behind the green ropes, have far more influence on the Government of the Commonwealth than have the people in most constituencies, who vote every three years. I often think that the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) must in many ways have the most difficult seat in the Commonwealth. Whereas in some of the outlying electorates we may perhaps bamboozle the electors with floods of oratory, he must very often have to consider that in front of him when he goes compaigning are many of the technical experts who deal with the problems of the Commonwealth such as taxation and who have a far more intimate knowledge of these problems than most honourable members, and certainly far more than the average elector. Mr J. R. Fraser -It is a very intelligent electorate. that, judging by the representative it sends to this place. The honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) made some observations on the Northern Territory being a Labour seat. I do not think that the seats which are at the moment Labour able member's time has expired. concerned at the serious anomaly that exists in the representation of the people of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. The fact that they have not a full voting member in this chamber is not justified. We are all Australian citizens, no matter where we reside in this continent. All the citizens of this Commonwealt said of the residents of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory as well as those in the constituency I have the privilege to represent. I have in my hand the electoral roll of the Northern Territory. Each of the persons named in this roll is subject to the same laws as I am, yet their representative in this chamber is denied a vote and consequently they have virtually no voice in this legislature. No doubt the electors on this roll include many ex-servicemen. They would be vitally affected by amendments to the Repatriation Act and its administration. Yet, their representative in this Parliament has no vote on such items which are so vital to his electors. The fact remains that if a returned soldier moved from the Northern Territory to Oodnadatta, in South Australia, he would have a voice in this place through his representative. Surely, this situation is not in accordance with true democratic principles. There are people in",86,Northern Territory Representation Bill 1959

Those people suffered more than most of the residents in other parts of the Commonwealth, yet they have no voice in the future of the continent they suffered so much to defend. That is not just. Every adult in Australia who comes within the provisions of the Constitution should have the right to full expression of his or her citizenship. That right is given to every other man and woman who has reached 21 years and who complies with the electoral laws.

I remind honourable members that the residents of this national capital, the city of Canberra, and all electors in the Australian Capital Territory are similarly denied a voice in the laws by which they are governed. We tax the residents of both these territories, yet they have not the full rights of citizenship and a voice in matters that are so vital to their welfare. I pay a tribute to the honourable member J. R. Fraser), who has distinguished himself in his representation of this electorate. We are fortunate to have men of such calibre representing both the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. How frustrating it must be for those gentlemen and those they represent to know that they are denied the right to exercise a vote on legislation which is of vital concern to them. T join with other honourable members in saving that the time is long past when the relevant provisions of the law should be amended so that these people who comply with our laws, pay taxes and suffer hardships as they do in the Northern Territory in developing its wide spaces, may have a voice in this legislature. I warmly support the honourable member for the Northern Territory in his claim for a more effective voice in the chamber. I feel much more in sympathy with the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) than with the views of the honourable member for Bonython( Mr Makin). I admit that this is a difficult problem but one does not cure an injustice by perpetrating a greater one. Let us admit that the people in the Northern Territory naturally suffer some sense of grievance and deprivation. But what are we to do about it? Do you create a greater injustice by giving to 8,000 people the same voice in the conduct of this Parliament as we give to 50,000 people in my electorate or the electorate ber? taken and I shall refer to the aborigines later. At present, there are some 8,000 people on the roll of the Northern Territory. Are we to give them the same vote that we give to 50,000 odd electors in my 0 electorate or any other? worse than that in South Australia. it is right or equitable to give this sort of disproportionate value to the vote. If we adopted the suggestion of the Opposition in this regard we would cure one injustice but only at the price of creating a greater injustice. The Government has taken a reasonable view in this matter. It and its should not claim all the credit-hav e seated in this chamber representatives of the various Commonwealth territories, or some of them. But those representatives get a voice and a vote on questions that specifically concern the territories they represent. It may be said that that is not enough. What more would the Opposition do? One solution that immediately suggests itself is that we shoud have one member with full voting rights representing all the territories of the Commonwealth as one constituency. In that way all the Territories of the Commonwealth, when lumped together, would be worth one vote in this chamber. Superficially that is an attractive suggestion, but it is not a suggestion that commends itself to me, because I believe that if we adopted that system we would",87,Northern Territory Representation Bill 1959

228,Mr Wentworth,"I do not believehave members here who did not know thei constituencies, because those constituent would be too far-flung and their interests far too diverse. I think that such a sysK would be a disservice to the people in the Northern Territory and to the people in the Australian Capital Territory, because although technically their representative would be getting something in the nature of a fair vote, the people of the Northern Territory would be getting less than a fair voice through their member and their interests would not be as effectively represented as they are now. An alternative suggestion, and one that has some attraction, is that we should have some kind of liaison committee that would look specially to the interests of the Northern Territory. That committee would not be an effective legislative body but would inform the House on matters concerning the Northern Territory, and would keep all honourable members in touch with affairs in the Territory. As I have said, that suggestion has some superficial attraction. Suppose, for example, that we had a committeea select committeemeeting in times of recess-no t necessarily in Canberra-and comprising the honourable member for the Northern Territory, the Minister for Territories, two or three members from each side of the House, and perhaps-thi s would be in line with British practice although not so much in line with Australian practice-the secretary of the Department of Territories or some officer of the department. There would also be a member of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory on that committee. That suggestion wouldi make some immediate contribution to the situation, but it would have one bad effect. It would stunt the growth of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory, a body whose authority we hope to see expand and go on from the present transition phase to the stage where it conducts more fully a legislative programme. However, that suggestion of a liaison committee has some merits. It has its pluses and its minuses. I do not think that we should create such a committee unless the people of the Northern Territory want it. If they want it, it might be an interim measure that we could adopt pending the time when the Northern Territory reaches full statehood. These are difficult questions. I think that the proposition put forward by the Opposition does cure an injustice, but only at the price of creating a greater injustice, a more glaring anomaly. I confess that I do not see any perfect solution. At the present time, I do not see any better solution than that which has been adopted by the Government, although I concede that it is not a perfect solution. After all, the member for the Northern Territory may not have a vote on all questions. But would that mattei? Would that have any practical effect in this present Parliament? In view of the large majority on this side of the chamber, it does not seem to me to be of very much consequence in the next three years whether the member for the Northern Territory does have a vote. In another parliament, a more evenly divided parliament, perhaps a vote for the member for the Northern Territory could have some important consequences. Mr Chairman, there remains the very grave anomaly referred to by the honourable member for Fremantle. What are we to do about the aboriginal inhabitants of the Northern Territory? We know that the electors of the Northern Territory would not at present want to give full citizenship rights to the aborigines. I do not think that the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) would advocate that they be given full citizenship rights at this moment and made voters. However, I should be grateful to hear his views on that subject. able member's time has expired. fully support the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson). I listened with interest to the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth). and I appreciate the difficulty that he was trying to skate around. He made a remarkable statement that it would make no practical difference if the member for the Northern Territory were given full voting rights in this Parliament. I never thought that we were judging a question of this great importance in that way. That is not the correct way to look at the situation. The honourable member for Mackellar says",88,Northern Territory Representation Bill 1959
229,The Chairman,Order! The honor,89,Northern Territory Representation Bill 1959
230,Mr Duthie (Wilmot) [10.17],"Ithat because there are 47 members on this side of the chamber and 78 members on the Government side, that is a valid reason why full voting rights should not be given to the honourable member for the Northern Territory, The only thing that this bill does is to permit the member for the Northern Territory to have a vote on legislation that relates Nevil Cardus who, referring to bowlers solely to the Territory. He is also allowed a vote on any motion for the disallowance of a regulation made under an ordinance of the Northern Territory and on any amendment of such a motion. I have been informed by the honourable member for the Northern Territory that if he had had those powers over the last seven years, he would have exercised a vote only seven times. member. He would have voted seven times in the last ten years. That is all that this legislation would have allowed him to do. So, if there is no further amendment to the legislation in the next ten years and the honourable member is still hereI hope he will be-h e will have the privilege of voting seven times in those ten years. How utterly ridiculous it is to regard that as a beneficient gesture! The Government's refusal to give full voting rights to the honourable member for the Northern Territory has the effect of disfranchising voters of the Northern Territory in matters of taxation, defence, postal services, social services, repatriation, agriculture, and, of course, land settlement, which surely must be a very important feature of the development of the north in years to come. moment. a change of government; then land settlement will be encouraged. Because all these are matters which affect the whole of Australia, the electors of the Northern Territory are disfranchised in this Parliament's consideration of them. Now the representative is to be allowed a vote on matters affecting the Northern Territory. If a cyclone destroved half of Darwin, and some legislation was introduced to effect rebuilding, he wcild h° allowed a vote, because the legislation dealt solelv with the Northern Territory. My real criticism is based on the fact that the Northern Territory people are disfranchised in regard to dayto-day matters which affect every one of them. In the absence of the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) one is reminded of who toiled very hard but failed to take wickets because catches were dropped, said that their efforts were recorded in heaven, where they do not go by results. but they could not spin? they could not spin. The honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) made one remark upon which I want to touch. He put forward an argument which I feel is weighing with the Government. It was that the character of the representation of the Northern Territory is Labour at the present time. The honourable member for Bradfield said that the Northern Territory was a safe Labour seat. For thirteen years it was represented by Mr Blain, who was not a Labour man and whose voice was always opposed to the Labour Party. When people speak, as the honourable member for Bradfield did, about a seat being safe because its representative was unopposed at the last election, I remind them that although the Labour Party was unopposed in Kalgoorlie at the election of 1955, the seat was lost to the Labour Party in 1958. So there is nothing to determine that any constituency shall irrevocably attach to any particular party. I am reminded that the electorate of Moore is another case in point. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) made certain valuable suggestions. He did touch upon the question of the aborigines and the representation of other territories. I feel that the question of the representation of other territories is important. I do not want to develop it as a theme, but since this Parliament can determine that the territories are represented upon any terms that we think fit, if we thought at the present time that the aborigines of the Northern Territory or the natives of Pamia and New Guinea, by reason of lack of education oi for any other reasons, could not form a",89,Northern Territory Representation Bill 1959

Even if we have doubts about numbers in respect of the Northern Territory, we have no reason to have any doubts about numbers in respect of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea.

These may be questions for the future, but I think it is important that we should be considering them now. After all, the French, who are a logical people, have worked out a system whereby the Cameroons and other overseas territories of France, including a territory as remote as New Caledonia, are proud to be represented in the metropolitan parliament, the Chamber of Deputies in Paris. In the face of the mounting ideological significance of race relations, we should be thinking of the representation in this Parliament of the people of the aboriginal race and the people of any other race for whom we have responsibility, including the natives of Papua and New Guinea.

Of the Constitution is that representation course, they are not able to have a vote should be on a basis of the representation exercised on their behalf. of adequate numbers of the population. Let us imagine for a moment-this , of course, is a speculative exercise-that it tation is not effective. or the north-west of Australia would be better developed if it were separated from its parent State and made a territory of the Commonwealth. Would it be seriously considered, as a sensible proposition, that the separated territory should immediately be given full representation and voting rights in the National Parliament, whereas in fact it might contain, perhaps, only 3,000 or 4,000 voters? The plain fact is that acceptance of this amendment would be contrary to the spirit of the Constitution. In my view, it would also be contrary to common sense, because, as the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) has pointed out, there are only about 8,000 voters in the Territory. Honourable gentlemen opposite talk about the present arrangements being contrary to the fundamental principles of parliamentary democracy and develop that as an argument. They say that the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) has to be, in a sense, a State member as well as a Federal member, but I really believe that this is a gross overstatement because, as it will be recalled, the Territory now has a Legislative Council. The next argument is that residents of the Territory have been deprived of an effective vote. If this amendment were carried, the effect would be not to give them an effective vote but to give them a vote five times more effective than those of the electors in any other electorate of the Commonwealth.

244,Wilson. K . C. Mr Wheeler (Mitchell) [10.42],"O nintroduce taxation measures into the Legislative Council of the Territory on 20th April, and that the debate will be resumed next June. It is pretty obvious that the bureaucrats made up their minds a long time ago that the Territory was to have this tax imposed, and so far as they are concerned that is the end of the whole matter. They will listen politely to anything the inhabitants have to say, but nothing will be changed. Naturally, one suspends judgment on the proposals until they are known, and 1 am not saying that the bureaucrats are wrong in their conclusions that the taxes should be introduced; however, 1 am saying that they may be wrong, because there has been no adequate public investigation made on the spot. I am saying that even if they are doing the right thing, they are doing it in the wrong way. The Minister passed the whole mater off rather airily when he replied to me previously. He saidNo new decision is to be made on the question whether or not the people of Papua and New Guinea are to be taxed. He went on to say that, of course, they had been paying taxes for years, and that the Government was just reviewing the methods of raising revenue to ensure that it was raised more equitably. These are phrases beloved of the bureaucrat, and they cloak an attitude straight out of "" Alice in Wonderland "". The introduction of income tax is a major step in the history of any community. There is no more personal relation between an administration and the citizen than that which concerns the income tax department. There is no tax of which the citizen is more acutely aware, and probably none of which he is more resentful. No community is ever quite the same again once this step has been taken. How wrong the Minister is in thinking that this is just a routine matter is shown by the angry and widespread reactions which the proposals have aroused in the Territory. The uncertainty about income tax is already having a stifling effect on develThey claim, in addition, that, under the opment. Worse still, the residents have been left with a feeling of injustice. They feel, in a way they have never done before, the sensation of being subject to a dictatorthey do not receive any form of social ship which is 2,000 miles away. All members of this House must remember that we are breaking a cherished principle of democratic government by imposing taxation without representation. The people of other federal Territories have spokesmen in this House. The peopie of Canberra, for instance, who are right on the spot and can easily make themselves heard on any question, have nevertheless been granted a spokesman in this Parliament. So have the people of the Northern Territory, as was ably demonstrated by the member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) in the debate this evening. But one of our most faraway TerritoriesPapua and New Guinea-ha s no such representative in this Parliament. In the circumstances, it is most essential that the people of that Territory be given every opportunity to state their views on this vital matter before anything is done. Yet they have had no opportunity of stating them. A departmental report was considered adequate to meet the case. The report, to which I referred in my previous remarks on 18th March, has on it the hallmark of the blissful seclusion of Canberra, and shows a complete unawareness of many of the difficulties of living in the Territories. The residents of Papua and New Guinea challenge the report on a number of points. They say, first, that because of their isolation their expenditure cannot be judged by mainland standards. They are under constant pressure to return to Australia, especially when their children reach school age, or when medical attention is required. They must give their families higher standards of living than in Australia, in order to compensate for their isolation and for the climate. They question the official figures showing the expenditure on the nonnative population as £3,500,000 a year, and they dispute also the Treasury's contention that it is entitled to recoup this expenditure in full by taxation. They point out that such a practice is not adopted in respect of the residents of the Northern Territory. Administration's proposals, they would be paying more tax per head on the average than the people of Australia pay, although service benefits. I know that there is to be a debate in the Legislative Council of Papua and New Guinea on the proposals. But that body has a majority of government nominees, and the only real protest that the elected minority can make is to resign. When the minority members threatened to do this, the Assistant Administrator, Dr. J. T. Gunther, pointed out that this would simply leave the public with no representation at all in the discussions. I put it to the House that we cannot afford to have in Papua and New Guinea the atmosphere of frustration and resentment which the handling of these proposals has aroused. I think we all agree that this Territory is both our front line of defence and, because of constant visits by representatives of the United Nations, our administrative shop-window. We desperately need goodwill and a spirit of cooperation among the white residents in an area which, it can quite reasonably be said, may be our next battle area. To introduce income tax to any community without arousing ill will is admittedly no easy task. Nevertheless, if the Administration persists in its present bulldozing methods in the face of public opposition, I think it will have failed Australia. In this critical era, the maintenance of morale in the population is paramount. I believe that these are reasonable people and that if the Minister can show that the taxes are just and necessary they will be accepted. It is time for statesmanship in the territories and I appeal to the Minister to throw away the official approach which has already had such unfortunate consequences and which, in the ultimate, will bring no credit to this House. I appeal to my colleagues in this House to ask themselves what they know of this measure. I feel that the answer will be, ""Very little"". I suggest to honourable members that they should ask for some discussion on this subject so that we may be better informed and so that we who will probably have to accept the responsibility of imposing this form of taxation can ensure at least that the people shall have a fair deal and that they shall be able to state their case publicly. There should be some form of debate or method of discussion in this House of the proposals which, we understand, are to be introduced on 20th April, which are to lie in the Legislative Council, and which are to be submitted to debate on 20th June. I ask my colleagues to look at this situation and say whether we, as a responsible House, should not be taking far greater interest in the matter than we are doing. still get ten minutes? ber's time started when he was called. cern over the conduct of a certain section of the Australian press. I think that my point of view on this matter has been amply justified by all members of the Parliament thinking the same way concerning the events of the last few days. I am speaking to-night because to-day an article appeared in the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" signed by the editor, Mr Angus Maude. The article was entitled "" The Prime Minister and the Press"" and, in a box, it gave the record of Mr Angus Maude. It gave his scholastic attainments.

In this letter, this lady, whose name was given publicly afterwards, challenged the reason why the paper, the policy of which was directed by Mr Henderson, had a great aversion to the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). This letter was not published but Mr Maude wrote back to the lady challenging her remarks. In his letter he saidI thought perhaps I should inform you that the editorial policy of ""The Sydney Morning Herald"" is my responsibility, and that none of the directors knows what is going to be in the "" Herald"" leading articles until he reads it at his breakfast table next day.

Can any one believe that a paper with the traditions of the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" would allow a newcomer to direct its policy in a federal election? No. I say this because I want to place some doubt on the credence that one may attach to Mr Maude. In the article published to-day, Mr thing it is. This was once one of the best Maude described the speech of the Prime Mimster in this House as "" a violent attack on the press"". I have read the speech again. The Prime Minister was trenchant, but not violent. Mr Maude also questioned what he called the Prime Minister's somewhat unworthy personal attack on the individual executives of the newspaper companies. What had the Prime Minister said? He had challenged the executives of the papers to publish their salaries, emoluments and perks. Was that unworthy? But this paper impugns the honesty and integrity of 184 members of this House and another place. Apparently, you may attack members of Parliament. They are fair game. But if a member of the press is attacked, that is not fair game. That is unworthy.

It was given prominence with his photograph. But Mr Maude adopted an unprecedented method. In the middle of that letter he interposed his own comments. No decent journalist does that. Not only did he interpose comments in that letter, but he published alongside it a leading article, somewhat of the Nasser type. I invite honorabie members to read the leading article and see what a scurrilous papers in the British Commonwealth. Today, it is going down and down. But this is not all. In the same period of which I am talking the paper made reference to the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) The honourable member may not be photogenic, but this paper attacked him and published a photograph showing him in a very unfavorable light. You may recall the staring eyes, which it may have been thought were suggestive of some one making a salary grab. Somebody in that newspaper must have directed that the honourable member should be given the staring eyes treatment.

But they control it by the means that the ""Sydney Morning Herald"" has adopted-by slanted reporting, misleading statements, and the like. I think that the comments made by the Prime Minister were quite fair. There is no yardstick by which you can judge a member of Parliament, a Prime Minister or a Minister. The Prime Minister suggested that the executives of the ""Sydney Morning Herald"" should place their cards on the table and reveal all their salaries, emoluments and perks. I think that that is quite fair. Why should that not be done? That suggestion does not constitute an unkind attack on this newspaper. It is, as I have said, quite fair. It is common knowledge, as has been indicated by this lady who was present, and who knows Mr Henderson, that there has been a personal feud against the Prime Minister on the part of the "" Sydney Morning Herald "". That is common knowledge, as I have said. But the ugly part of it, Mr Speaker, is that, under the protection of the freedom of the press, a powerful organ of this kind is used for a vindictive and spiteful attack on people who cannot answer back. I raise these matters because I have been a reader of the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" for many years, and I have found its line growing increasingly bitter. Is it because we have coming out here now gentlemen like this Mr Maude? We could perhaps describe him as an angry young man. We have gained enormously from some of the British migrants, who have done much to assist this country, but here is one migrant who is introducing into Australia a very ugly kind of yellow journalism. Speaker, I also should like to make a few comments about the "" Sydney Morning Herald "". I take strong exception to this newspaper using parliamentarians as a yardstick in relation to age and invalid pensioners. Let us just have a look at the salaries of some of the chiefs of this newspaperconcerned about the welfare of age and invalid pensioners. I am led to believe, on good authority, that Mr Henderson receives a salary of £30,000 a year, plus perks, and that Mr Angus Maude receives a salary of £9,000 a year, plus perks. This is the first time in the four years that I have been in this Parliament that I have agreed with the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), but I did agree with him the other evening when he challenged the executives of this newspaper to publish details of what they received in allowances and salaries. I notice, however, that that challenge was entirely ignored. 19 it not true, as has been remarked in this Parlament before, that the newspapers have always endeavoured, and always will endeavour, to mould public opinion by ridiculing parliamentarians, because, if they were to build up parliamentarians, the value of their editorials and opinions would not be regarded very highly by the public? Let us just have a look at the way in which the newspapers treat parliamentarians. They ridicule the party leaders, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), by cartoons. There is not one man in Australia who has been more ridiculed in press cartoons than has the Leader of the Opposition. Yet, if anybody attacks the press or is thought to besmirch or ridicule any one connected with it, these people are the first to squeal like stuck pigs. Last week, in all sincerity, I asked a question about the payment of alimony to the wife of a certain newspaper proprietor. I asked that question only because I thought it was complete hypocrisy for the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" to use parliamentarians as a yardstick in relation to age and invalid pensioners. I sincerely believe that, in the next Budget, this Parliament should make provision for very heavy taxes on high incomes from £2,000 upwards. That would affect every parliamentarian as well as the editors of newspapers. But, if we were to",94,Printing Committee

This is just typical of the form of these newspapers. I recall that, during the latter part of Mr Chifley's sevice in this Parliament, the press ridiculed him and, by implication, suggested that he was a fellow traveller. Let me tell Mr Fairfax, and all his family, that not one of them is fit even to clean the boots of a man like Mr Chifley was. This press ridicule has been going on for many years. Let us hope that the Parliament will always reign supreme against these insidious monsters that try to capture public opinion. Speaker. I wish to raise a subject that is have the materials in Australia, produced far removed from newspapers. I propose to by our own people, which could well do quote a letter that I wrote to the Minister the job.

My letter went on to sayIn view of this, I would be pleased if you could supply me with some information concerning the following matter. I believe that on or about 25th February, 1959, quotas relating to the importation of timber from dollar areas were increased by 15 per cent, in respect of the licensing period ending 31st March, 1959. Was this decision taken at the request of any particular body of timber traders? Also, what were the grounds for the decision and was the native timber industry of Australia given the opportunity for consultation before this action was determined, having regard to the fact that in some States at least, timber production is well below available log volume? I think it is fair to say that the Australian timber industry to-day needs some more practical support from this Government. The Australian timber industry is a greater contributor to capital investment and the employment of labour in Australia than that section of industry that is concerned with the importation of overseas timber. It is regrettable to see each year slight increases being granted in the amounts of I want to take the House back to an member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) and I debate.

I suggest that some very quick action should be taken on this matter, if not by the Minister who is overseas, then by the Minister who is acting for him. Action must be taken quickly in the interests of the Australian timber industry. In my own State the mills are not operating at full capacity. Timber is being piled up while, at the same time, overseas timber is being imported and being used in place of the Western Australian timber. I know that in South Australia certain objections are raised to the use of Western Australian timber. This dates back to some quarrel between the two States in the post-war years, when certain circumstances made it impossible for us to supply South Australia with sufficient timber. However, I contend that this Government has a responsibility to do something about the matter, otherwise the Australian timber industry, especially in my own State, will find itself in an even worse been held since the Labour Party came condition. I would not have spoken to-night but for the remarks of the honourable member for Hume( Mr Anderson). The honourable gentleman is entitled to wax indignant, as he did, about the treatment of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) at the hands of the "" Sydney Morning Herald "". The honourable member said he believed in fair comment, but he certainly was stirred by what he had read, written by a new Australian named Angus Maude. I remember the honourable gentleman, and other honourable gentlemen on the Government side of this Parliament, voting some years ago in favour of a resolution to the effect that foreign interests-the term was used by the honourable member Wentworth), and it meant in this particular case English interests-mus t not be permitted to hold more than 10 per cent., I think, of the shares in any Australian company controlling broadcasting or television stations. I wonder whether the honourable member for Hume proposes that no Englishman shall be the editor of any Australian newspaper. There is a custom in the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" organization, a long-standing practice, that to be the editor of that journal, you must have been recently imported from England. It is almost literally true that over the editorial door of the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" hangs a notice "" No Australian need apply "". I have met Mr Maude. I found him a very interesting personality. I do not think that he knows the Australian scene sufficiently well to be able to say that what he writes should not be subject to some supervision or censorship by people like Mr not in a position to challenge him on his claim. However, I was interested to hear the honourable member for Hume say that he believes in fair comment. Now, what does he mean by fair comment? I have never heard him or any other member of this Parliament rise in the cause of fair comment and attack the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" or any other newspaper for the venom, the viciousness and the vindictiveness which have literally oozed out of every article and every comment on every Labour leader in every election campaign that has into existence. I have never heard any honourable member on the Government side say that the attacks on the right honourable member for Hunter, the present Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), in recent years or when he was Minister for External Affairs, were fair or measured or reasonable. in 1943. exception in 1943, and I know the reason.

But as the Japanese moved further back to their bombed islands, of course there was a change in tone of the newspapers, as there was a change in the tone of judgments of the High Court of Australia. If you want to read the history of the Pacific war, read it in the Commonwealth Law Reports, in the judgments of the High Court.

The directors who control the banks are the same directors who control the newspapers and the big business interests. Money power controls the lot, and the Labour Party, wishing to change society, meets with the uncompromising opposition of these people. I have never heard the honourable member for Hume, for whom I have very great respect personally, and whose friendship I hope I enjoy, attack the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" when it has misrepresented our point of view or distorted the statements of our leaders. have not read it, although the ""Sydney resolution moved in regard to the control Morning Herald"" is one of my favourite of broadcasting stations. newspapers.

The honourable member for Hume has started well; I wish him luck in his Pilgrim's Progress. I hope that he will have a few adherents to his cause and that more time will be taken on the adjournment of the House in airing the views that he has expressed.

Before he came to Australia, Major Maude was a Conservative member of Parliament in the United Kingdom, where the Conservative Party is akin to the party represented by honourable members on the Government side in this House. that he represented the same field of thought in Great Britain that honourable members on the Government side represent here. Major Angus Maude was one of the five rebels who resigned from the Conservative Party in Great Britain over the party's attihave been ridiculed by the press. In that tude on the withdrawal from Suez during the crisis. We know that the present Prime Minister of Australia, who was sent to the Middle East as an envoy, returned from his mission with a story that started the invasion at Suez which was supported by Major Angus Maude. At that time the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" was opposed to the British landings in Suez, but ten months later, when Major Angus Maude was the editor of that newspaper, it supported the American landings in Lebanon and the British landings in Jordan. This Government also supported that policy, so that in many fields of thought, particularly on foreign policy, Major Angus Maude and this Government think alike. The"" Sydney Morning Herald"" was critical of a matter which has just been discussed by this House to the point of decision. The"" Daily Telegraph "", however, was one of the few newspapers in line with the thoughts expressed in this House. As a matter of fact, it was pathetic to see the moderator in the Meet-the-Press television session, Mr David McNicol, when a business-man was interviewed on the proposed increases of parliamentary allowances. When the business-man was asked what he thought of expenses at the rate of fifteen guineas a day to be allowed the Prime Minister, the moderator bent over backwards figuratively to stop that line of discussion. He said, "" Don't you think that £4 a day for the private members is adequate?"" The business-man said he thought it was not enough, and that private enterprise could allow £6 a day. Mr 1952 and 1953 respectively, enacted legislation McNicol tried to defend the Prime Minister on all points. The"" Daily Telegraph "" has covered up on every point for this Government.
