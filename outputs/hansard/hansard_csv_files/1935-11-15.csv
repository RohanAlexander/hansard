21,Mr Casey,"by leave I regret that in Australia, would lead to complications far graver than any disadvantage in the present system. It is to be inferred from, the Auditor General's statements that he considers that the Government should collect in taxation such amounts as represent the actual outgoings for the year of account only. This would mean violent fluctuations in the rates of taxation to meet obligations that arise in any one year, but which can and should be spread over several years. The system of trust fund accounting is the only way in which this can be done. The charge that ""Parliament and others"" are misled and deceived by the form of the accounts can only be described as untrue. The suggestion that I have personally been responsible for some changes that have resulted in a dishonest presentation of the financial position, is untrue. The accounts have been kept and presented in the same manner for 25 years, and by Treasurers of every political complexion. Explanation of Goverument accounts ean be sought by any member of the Parliament, and reply is always fully and freely given. The annual accounts of the Government are necessarily lengthy and complicated. The proposal that they can be reduced to complete simplicity by eliminating the trust accounts, is a misrepresentation of the position. The Auditor-General makes a number of unwarranted statements in regard to invalid and old-age pensions, aud in particular traduces the character and habits of invalid and old-age pensioners. The Government takes grave exception to such unsupported statements. The existing system of inspection and checks is adequate for the protection of the revenue. The results of the inspection system have not brought to light any evidence to warrant the charges and accusations made by the Auditor-General. His general criticisms of the pensions system are based largely on hearsay and prejudice, and on his own political views, and I believe are wholly unwarranted in tone and misleading in substance. The report will, as usual, be examined in detail, and any action that the Government feels to be necessary will be taken at a later stage. Mr Casey. of the Treasurer's statement, does the Government contemplate amending the Audit Act so as to define more clearly the powers and duties of the Auditor General, and to shear him of the responsibility, which he seems to have taken upon himself, of constituting himself a censor of public morals and parliamentary procedure? out in some detail the duties and responsibilities of the Auditor-General. One subjection gives him somewhat wider powers than are specified in preceding sub-sections, and I think that somewhat wider power is desirable in order to give him some latitude of expression. However, the Government does not consider that, in ordinary circumstances, it is necessary to amend the act to deal with a situation such as has now arisen. custom in the Public Service for officers with accruing leave to take out their leave in sufficient time to enable them to complete it on reaching the ordinary retiring age? If a public servant has . twelve months leave due to him, does he not usually take it at the age of 64 years, in order to complete his service at the age of 65 years? If that is the position, is it a fact that the Auditor-General, who has accrued leave of twelve months due to him, has remained in his office up to the retiring age of 65., and that, in addition, the amount of £1,700 is provided for him on the Estimates for accrued leave, which, in effect, allows him to remain in the Service until he reaches the age of 66 years? Does the Treasurer consider that to be an action which protects the revenues of this country ? is now being examined. If the honourable member places his question on the notice-paper, he will receive an adequate reply. does the Minister assume that the report of the Auditor-General is actuated by malice? deduction from the terms employed hy the Auditor-General himself.",12,Auditor General S Report Treasurer S Reply To Criticism

Debate resumed from the 31st October (vide page 1229), on motion by Mr was 4,S73,000 bushels, but as the exports That the bill be now read a second time. This measure has the support of the Opposition, because it is designed to give relief to the growers of citrus fruits. It provides for a variation of the assistance given last year, in that it is proposed to pay a bounty of 2s. a case, instead of a guaranteed price of 13s. a case. The alteration of the incidence of the assistance is justified, in view of the fact that a guaranteed price does not provide an incentive to an improvement of the quality ojf the product, as would the bounty, seeing that the exporter has to rely for success largely on the quality of the product which he places on the overseas markets. The future of the industry depends to a great extent on improvement of the standard of production. In this industry, as in a great number of other Australian export industries, everything possible should be done to raise the Order! The honourable member is introquality of the product put on the overseas ducing a subject that goes beyond the markets, thus ensuring a good name for scope of the bill. Australian produce, and a much higher price than has previously been paid. I should like to see the amount of the bounty increased. The industry asks for 3s. 6d. a case, and, in view of the straitened circumstances of the great majority of those engaged in the industry, it is regrettable that the Government has not granted a bounty of at least 2s. 9d. a case. The Labour party has always consistently stood for the development, scientifically and efficiently, of both primary and secondary industries. An effort is made at times to misrepresent the party's policy in regard to this matter; but it believes that if Australia is to carry a greatly increased population in the years to come, we must not overlook the demands of the primary producers any more than the just claims of the local manufacturers, who have set out to supply Australia with the whole of its requirements of manufactured goods. It is appalling to find a section of honourable members almost completely disregarding the value of the .local market to fruit-growers aud primary producers generally. This market is of tremendous -importance to the citrus industry. In 3932-1933, the output of this .industry amounted to only 136,000 bushels, 4,737,000 bushels had to be sold on the Australian market. Thus, the more prosperous the people are in the cities, and the more numerous are the employees in secondary industries, the more lucrative will the local market prove to the fruit growers and other primary producers. The value of the local market, not only .to these primary producers, but also to others, can be gleaned from the fact that 79 per cent, of our dairy products, 44 per cent, of our pastoral products, and 65 per cent, of our agricultural products, are consumed locally. I sincerely hope that those who have in mind the assistance of this great primary industry will lend a helping hand towards developing the great secondary industries of Australia which provide employment to-day directly for nearly 500,000 people.",13,Auditor General S Report Treasurer S Reply To Criticism

Bell),"tion to the importance of the Australian market to tlie citrus-growers of this country, and to the fact that out of 4,873,000 bushels of citrus fruits produced locally, 4,737,000 bushels are absorbed by the local market. If we are to get the citrus fruit-growers out of the unsatisment for the lifting of the embargo. factory position in which they find themselves to-day, we must give more consideration to the necessity for increasing the local market. During the last twenty years the citrus industry has made considerable progress. were 24,800 acres under cultivation for citrus fruits; by 1932-1933 the orchards covered 52,400 acres. This increase was largely brought about as the result of the settlement of thousands of returned soldiers on the land producing citrus fruits. setback when in December, 1932, the Government of New Zealand imposed an embargo against the entry into the Dominion of all fresh fruits and vegetables from the Commonwealth. That embargo was relaxed in 1933 to the extent of permitting the entry of oranges from the State of South Australia only. It is understood that this action was taken by New Zealand as a quarantine precaution, but I submit that it was more in the nature of retaliatory action against the embargo imposed by the Commonwealth on the importation into Australia of potatoes from New Zealand. In 1934 the Dominion Government again decided to allow South Australian oranges to enter New Ze.ala.Tid, but only in specified quantities and by certain vessels. 1934 was 112,000 cases. This year New. Zealand has agreed to admit 136,000 cases from South Australia, up to and including the Watiganella shipment on the SOth October. The market in New Zealand has proved very profitable to South Australian growers, and the disposal of this quantity to New Zealand has, to some extent, relieved the Australian market I understand that formerly the mandarin-growers of New South. Wales used to export large quantities of mandarins to New Zealand, and that they have been very badly hit by the embargo. Commonwealth and State Governments of the exports of citrus fruits to New have from time to time endeavoured to Zealand was £40,000 in 1927-2S; £65,000 have the embargo placed on the importation of oranges into New Zealand, lifted. I hope that the Assistant Minister( Mr Thorby) will be able to give honourable members the latest information regarding the negotiations which have taken place with the Dominion GovernI understand that the Government of New Zealand is greatly perturbed at the possibility of the introduction into the dominion of the frui t fly pest which is prevalent in some of the Australian In 1913-1914, there States; but surely upon satisfactory evidence being produced, say, by the Department of Agriculture in New South Wales, that shipments of Australian oranges are properly inspected and passed for export in satisfactory condition, the objections of the Government of New The industry received a great Zealand would be largely overcome. The fact that this industry gives direct employment to over 10,500 persons in Australia demonstrates that it is of great importance to this country. The figures relating to Australian trade with New Zealand disclose a balance favorable to Australia. The total Australian trade with New Zealand, including bullion and specie, for the years 1927-28 to 1933-34, is shown in the following tableExcess ot Year. Imports. Expots.

The value of the dominion market to the Australian grower is shown in the following figures: The value",14,Thobby
33,Mr Forde,"I am directing attenin 192S-29; £80,000 in 1930-31; and £129,000 in 1931-32. In 1933-34, however, owing to the imposition of the embargo, the value of the citrus fruits exported to New Zealand dropped to £55,000. of exports of citrus fruits to other countries, chiefly the United Kingdom, increased from £6,000 in 1927-28, to £106,000 in 1933-34. cases of citrus fruits were exported to countries other than New Zealand; in 1934, the quantity increased to 213,000 cases, 179,000 of which went to the United Kingdom. The financial assistance which it is proposed to render to the citrus fruits industry is very small, considering its importance and the number of people engaged in it. The cost of the bounty in 1933 was £3,000, while it is anticipated that something like £10,000 will be required to meet the guarantee for the 1934 season. In the Estimates this year £20,000 has been provided for the bounty proposed in the bill now before the House. Thus it cannot be said that the industry is being too generously treated, particularly as it is a .small-man industry and one which permits of closer settlement schemes affording employment for thousands of returned soldiers. The problem confronting the orchardist of Australia to-day is the difficulty of finding a market for their products. According to the Commonwealth Statistician the greatest area under orchards and fruit gardens was 281,149 acres in 193132. declined slightly owing to difficulty in disposing of surplus production. By 1932-33 it had fallen to 273,627 acres. The marketing problem is more acute in New South Wales than in any other State. South Australia are able to demand a reasonable price on the loeal market and the loeal demand is sufficiently great to continue profitable production. But in New South Wales there is a serious glut of fruit at certain periods, because of cither the tremendous production or a serious under consumption due to lack of purchasing power. The growers in that State are therefore particularly in favour of a scheme for bhe organized control of production and marketing both [00] locally and overseas. They were successf ul in having a bill introduced into the Parliament of New South Wales to deal with marketing, hut 'because of certain criticism levelled by outside interests, the On the other hand the value measure was withdrawn, and the impression is that the Government will not proceed further with it. I understand that it was drafted on lines similar to marketI n 1933, 97,000 ing legislation which was introduced to cover other pirmary products in Queenslaud. Organized control of production and marketing in connection with tlie dairying, cotton, peanut, maize and canned fruits industries has been a great success in Queensland. I hope +hat the Commonwealth Government will endeavour to bring about some unanimity among the citrus fruit growers of Australia so that an orderly marketing scheme may be jiut into operation for both local and overseas markets for the 'benefit of the growers. Only by that means can the industry be lifted to a basis of reasonable prosperity. If growers are allowed to export indiscriminately to the overseas market, not only will it result in low prices, but also there is a possibility of a bad name being created for the Australian product. I hope the Government will do everything possible to ensure an improvement of the quality of citrus fruits exported overseas. I suggest that the Government should bring to bear upon this industry, the research activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Sir David Rivett, Chief ExecuSince then the area has tive Officer of the Council, speaking at the Agricultural Council in May of this year, gave a brief outline of the various research activities in progress or contemplated for 'the benefit of the citrus industry. He pointed to the fact that the The growers in Victoria and Council had been conducting investigations into problems connected with the preservation and transport of oranges. Continuing, he saidThe investigations which were under the control of a citrus preservation committee, were of a restricted nature owing to the fact that only u small sum of money was available for the purpose. In other words, he was restricted in bis activities because of the inadequacy of the appropriation made by this Parliament for the work in which he was engaged. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter and to increase the allowance for' this work so that -the Council will not be hampered in its activities. citrus fruit in the United Kingdom market were higher last year than they aTe this year, but, unfortunately, oar exporters did not get top prices, for tha quality of their fruit was not as good as it might have been. It is interesting to note, however, that, although the British market for citrus fruit is depressed, Australia is getting as good a return for its fruit on that market as it got last year when the ruling prices were higher. This is due to improved quality. possibilities of a greatly expanded market for Australian citrus fruits. Eor the year ended the 31st December, 1933, the imports of citrus fruit into the United Kingdom totalled 11,500,000 cwt. and the price paid was £7,9S6,000. Of this total, Australia supplied only 46,000 cwt., or 0.4 per cent., for which £44,000 was paid. It is obvious, therefore, that Great Britain could assist Australia by increasing it3 purchases of our citrus fruit. We weTe assured that the ratification of the Ottawa agreement would lead to a greatly expanded market for our products in Great Britain, and I have no doubt that if forceful representations were made to the British Government our claim for a larger share of the British market for citrus fruits would be acceded to, with the result that, this Australian industry would be greatly assisted. It could be represented to the British Government that many returned soldiers are producing citrus fruits, and that because of the unsatisfactory market available at present their financial position is particuremarkable success has attended the larly unsound. If Great Britain would assure Australia of an increased market for citrus fruits, more land could be put under citrus trees in every State of the Commonwealth, except, perhaps, Tasmania, and substantial progress could be made. An increase of our 1933 sales in the British market by only 5 per cent, would allow us to send to that market an additional 570,000 cwt., which would mean an increased return of £500,000. Australia gives Great Britain many preferences over foreign competitors. Eor Mr Fwde. the last twenty years British manufacturers have enjoyed preferences from Australia worth £10,000,000 a year, and it is surely not asking very much of the The prices ruling for Mother Country to.request an increased market for our citrus fruits. Our exports of oranges to the United Kingdom have increased from 1,652 centals, valued at £3,000, in 1927-28, to 61,500 centals, valued at £58,700, in 1933-34; aud our total exports ofall citrus fruits to that market have increased from 29,S00 this year centals, valued at £43,000, in 1927-28 to 128,000 centals, valued at £.128,000, in 1933-34; but when we ""remember the magnitude of the British market this is. a relatively small increase. The United Kingdom offers I support the bill, but urge the Government to give further consideration to my suggestion that a more liberal bounty should be paid. This industry provides direct employment for 10,500 people who, at present, are struggling against heavy odds; and as it plays a big part in our policy of closer settlement, it is entitled to sympathetic consideration. I also urge the Government to increase the vote for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to enable it to enlarge the scope of the research work on which it is engaged in connection with the citrus industry. {Quorum formed.] The purpose of this bill is to provide for the payment of a bounty of 2s. a case on oranges exported from the Commonwealth to the United Kingdom. As our citrus industry is of considerable importance to Australia, I believe the measure will be supported by every honourable member. For some years now this industry has more than supplied the requirements of the local mairket notwithstanding that efforts that have been made to increase the consumption of citrus fruits in this country. The Railways Commissioners of Victoria and other States must be complimented upon the success of the campaign they set on foot with this object. We are compelled, however, to look elsewhere for markets, and the United Kingdom offers a good deal of promise in this regard. In 1933, 97,000 cases of Australian citrus fruits were exported to the United Kingdom ancl places other than New Zealand, and",15,Thobby
34,Mr Francis (Moreton) [12.21],"in 1934 the total increased to 213,000 cases. But this increase is not sufficient to -stabilize the industry. The various citrus-producing countries of the world compete keenly for the British market, and the growers of some countries have had a footing on it for so many years that it will be very difficult to dislodge them. It is, however, essential that Australia, being an Empire dominion and a relatively new exporter of citrus fruit, should be allowed entry to this market upon reasonable conditions, and the purpose of this bill is to encourage efforts to that end. Some special assistance was given to our citrus-growers by certain provisions of the Ottawa agreement. It was provided in ScheduleB of that agreement, for example, that Australian oranges should receive a preference of 3s. Gd. a cwt. from Great Britain from the 1st April to the 30th November of each year. That period was fixed because it covered a time that would not conflict with the season when other countries export large quantities of oranges to the market of the United Kingdom. Many of the difficulties of our citrus fruits industry have been caused by the policy of trade embargoes and prohibitions which has been in existence for many years. I know that the imposition of these embargoes by Australia led to retaliation on the part of New Zealand, with the result that the importation of Australian citrus fruits, other fresh fruits, aud fresh vegetables into that dominion was entirely prohibited. Negotiations which have since occurred have resulted in the lifting of the embargo to some extent, but I suppose our citrus-growers and exporters of other fresh fruits and fresh vegetables have been penalized to an amount of more than £200,000 a year because of this action. It has been alleged, at times, that, embargoes have been placed on importations because of the danger of the introduction of certain diseases, but a conference of experts held at Canberra some time ago expressed the opinion that this danger was not nearly so great as it had been represented to be. member not to continue to discuss the policy of trade embargoes and prohibitions; otherwise the debate will become much wider in its scope than it should be. self with saying that it is vitally imperative that everything possible shall be done to avoid discord by ihe pursuit of such a policy. As we are approaching the Christmas season, with its message of "" peace and goodwill to all men "", it would be in the interests of the producers of both Australia and New Zealandi f everything possible were done to improve our trading relations. If larger markets can bo obtained for Australian citrus fruits in the United Kingdom by means of the bounty which the Government is now proposing, it will be greatly to the advantage of our producers. If , at the same time, we can regain the market we had in New Zealand, the outlook for this industry will be much brighter. I believe that, it is possible for us to export fruit of tlie highest quality, although I regret that recent shipments opened up in England have not been so good as they might have been. In conclusion I urge the Government to do its utmost to reach finality at an early date in. its negotiations for a new trade treaty with New Zealand, based upon the removal of embargoes. I shall not discuss this measure at any great length, for it is clear to all honourable members that our citrus fruits industry requires assistance, f wish, however, to emphasize the request, already submitted to the Government during this debate that the negotiations with New Zealand for a new trade treaty, and particularly for the lifting of the embargo on the sale of Australian citrus fruits to New Zealand, shall be brought to finality as soon as possible. It seems to me that this bill is, in some respects, an admission by. the Government that the negotiations with the Government of New Zealand for the resumption of our former trade relations with the sister dominion in citrus fruits have failed. Although this measure has been introduced with the commendable purpose of assisting the citrusgrowers of Australia to export their fruit to the United Kingdom, it is of some concern to the taxpayers of the Commonwealth that the trade with New Zealand in these fruits has apparently been lost. Are we to go on year after year providing bounties for many primary industries",17,Thobby

So much assistance has been given to those engaged in the various branches of primary production that a feeling is beginning to grow up amongst other sections of the community that they, too, are deserving of some consideration from the Government. Men have invested their life savings in businesses which, owing to the economic depression, are not returning any profits, and such persons seem to have just as much claim upon the Treasury for assistance as have the primary producers. When a bounty is paid to an industry, the public at large must find the money, either by direot or by indirect taxation. However, I accept the principle that this industry is deserving of assistance, and I support the bill. Citrus fruit-growers in New South Wales are very anxious to know what is being done to restore their trade with New Zealand. At the present time, the outlook seems hopeless. Recently, an agent in Sydney told me that efforts were being made in New Zealand to cultivate citrus fruits for the local market, and that market for their product that large quanexperiments were being carried, out in connection with the raising of citrus fruits in areas where climatic conditions are regarded as suitable. . being done only to a limited extent. can appreciate the feelings of the Ausshortly be resumed. tralian citrus fruit-growers in view of this threat to their industry. At various times delegations from this country have matta-Parliamentar y Under-Secretary visited New Zealand, with a view to for Employment) [12.40] I support arranging for the resumption of the citrus the proposal of the Government, not fruit trade, but no success has been because I believe it is the best that could achieved. I do not suggest that they did be advanced, but because I believe that not put forth their best efforts in behalf the citrus fruits industry is entitled to of the citrus-growers, but the fact remains some compensation for the inability of that the embargo against Australian the Government to compose our"" differfruit is still in force. We were told that ences with New Zealand. that the Minister for Trade and Customs meant tremendous loss to the citrus( Mr White) intended to visit New Zeagrowers, except those of one State which land in order to make a further attempt has been allowed to continue its trade to compose the existing differences, but he with New Zealand. The honourable memhas not gone. and Customs had his berth booked to go, application of business methods to gowhen the dominion authorities cabled to vernment. I can recall a certain inciJiim asking him not to go. If so, the problem of it looks as if New Zealand does not want to deal with us. The argument of the dominion authorities is that Australia has refused to extend to New Zealand the benefits of reciprocal trade in regard to potatoes, subject to be debated. It has nothing to clo with the bill. Mv. BEASLEY -That may be; but the fact remains that the whole matter of trade with New Zealand is bound up with the embargo on dominion potatoes. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fordo) referred to the position of the mandarin-growers, and there is no doubt that they have suffered severely, a fact which must be well known to the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart). The honourable member once suggested that it would be a good thing if business methods were more generally applied to government, and I am curious to know how he would solve this problem by the application of business methods. So difficult has it been for the mandarin-growers to find a tities of fruit have actually been destroyed. I support the bill, but express the hope that the industry will soon be restored to its former level, and that it will not therefore be necessary to vided for.

Sir Whatever the cause, the fact is that we have not been able to have the market in New Zealand restored to us. As the Minister whoconducted the most recent investigations into this matter, I speak with some inner knowledge, and, in the light of that knowledge, I am convinced that there is no real reason why the difficulty cannot be composed unless it be that the Commonwealth Government is determined to give a more attentive ear to the demands of certain other sections of rural producers than to the citrus-growers. I believe that the industry will not cover the losses of the growers. would have been better served if, instead of making the money available in the form contemplated in this measure, it had been used to provide means of processing fruit, so that it might be sent to tbe United Kingdom in better condition. annually 20,000,000 cases of oranges, of which, until very recently, Australia supgreater than the margin to be provided plied only a few thousand cases. The loss of the market in New Zealand compelled the Australian growers to look to the United Kingdom, and when I was Minister for Commerce the first steps were taken to develop that trade. The chief difficulty arises from the length of the journey, and only as a result of recent scientific research has it been rendered possible to keep oranges in good condition throughout the six weeks' voyage to England. More might yet be done, howover, in the direction of providing processing sheds, and additional cool storage spare on the wharfs. I should like to know whether the Minister has received any representations from reliable sections of the industry asking for assistance in this direction. Sitting suspended from, lg.44 to 2.15 p.m. bill in principle has the approval of the citrus industry, but I accept it merely as a stop-gap. The Commonwealth Government last year guaranteed growers 13s. a case on citrus fruits of a certain standard exported to Great Britain, and as the guarantee entailed a loss amounting to more than £10,000, it is clear that the return to the growers from the sale of the fruit overseas did not amount to 13s. a case, the limit of the Government's guarantee. The guarantee was intended only not as a bounty. Accordingly, although manufacturers of the fruit cases, the pickers and the packers and graders of the fruit, and the railway systems which transported the fruit to the seaboard, the shipping firms which carried it to the British market and the commission agents were all paid-the growers got nothing whatever. thing now. Last year, in spite of the fact that a number of cases of fruit reached the British market in an inferior condition, the returns were higher than this year when the quality was good, and the only reason for the losses incurred The British market absorbs was the low prices paid. This year the drop in the British prices has been by the Commonwealth bounty. The bonus of 2s. is to be paid on l i bushel cases or Is. 4d. on each bushel of citrus fruit. A number of growers .sent oranges to England in anticipation of the bounty this season, but some on the irrigation areas of New South Wales, who have received returns have been notified of debit balances in respect of the shipments amounting to Is. 2d. a. case. Even with the aid of the bounty, therefore, they will get the wonderful return of lOd. for a l £ bushel case of selected fruit. A critical position faces the industry. The British market cannot be looked to with optimism, as Brazil and South Africa are situated in a much better geographical position than Australia to supply citrus fruits in the British market. If Australian oranges are shipped in a certain stage of greenness to ensure their carriage in a good condition, the sugar content of the fruit does not develop sufficiently to make it acceptable to the British consumers. If , on the. other hand,",19,Thobby

47,Mr Nock,"A bounty of 2s. a casetlie fruit is allowed to reach the stage of ripening rat which the sugar content will develop, it is too ripe for shipment as choice fruit, and may reach the other side of the world in an unsatisfactory condition. That defect applies more to the Eastern States than to Western Australia and South Australia, which have the advantage that the fruit takes two weeks less to reach its destination. The only profitable market of tie irrigation districts of New South Wales is therefore New Zealand, which is, however, closed to it. The embargo imposed by the Government of New Zealand on the importation of citrus fruits, from Australia precipitated a crisis in the industry-in New South Wales. Certain relaxation of the embargo allowed fruit from South Australia, mainly navel oranges, entry into New Zealand; but when the season for navels ends, conditions become just as bad as they are when the full embargo operates. The Murrumbidgee irrigation area mainly produces large quantities of ^alencias, whicli, despite the fact that there is no risk of the fruit-fly, are denied entry to the-dominion. danger was one of the excuses raised by New Zealand for rejecting citrus supplies from this country when the embargo was placed on its potatoes. Various attempts have been made to reach an amicable agreement with New Zealand, bust, with the exception of the relaxation of the embargo already mentioned, little has been accomplished. The stop-gap legislation which the Government has introduced for a payment of bounty to encourage the export of citrus fruits to Great Britain should not be an excuse for ceasing the negotiations, and. I should be pleased if the Commonwealth Government would approach the Government of New Zealand through the personal agency of a Commonwealth Minister. I"" understand that the Minister for Trade and Customs at one stage proposed to visit New Zealand to carry on, among other things, negotiations regarding the citrus embargo. If he does not go, the Minister for Commerce, or the Assistant Minister for Commerce, should, and the negotiations which appear to have lapsed should be renewed with greater intensity. Mr Nock. available at Hotel Canberra would have to be exported to New Zealand. grading and examination exists on all citrus fruit sent from Australia. New Zealand, if it is willing to take it, can have first quality Australian citrus fruits. The people of New Zealand want it and the Australian people want to sell it. We must recognize further, however, that the producers must organize. Only 10 per cent, of the citrus fruits grown in Australia is exported, and if an excise of 3d. a case were placed on locally consumed oranges, a bounty of 2s. 6d. a bushel case would be available on all citrus fruits sent overseas. More fruit could then be exported, the glut which occurs every season in the local market would be eased, and the conditions of the industry would be correspondingly improved. Under present Conditions, however, all those associated with the export of citrus fruits to England are rewarded for their services except the grower. He receives nothing. The Government is justified in taking the The fruit-fly action embodied in this measure, because the assistance which will be given, although small, will help to carry the growers over the period of the negotiations for the re-opening of the market in New Zealand, which is the Australian fruit-growers' only natural and profitable market. support the second reading of this bill, as the assistance given under it will be of benefit to the citrus fruit industry. It has received the approval of the citrus fruit-growers. When New Zealand placed an embargo on citrus fruits in 1932, I urged the Government to do everything in its power to try to create a market for citrus fruits in Great Britain, although I realized that many countries in closer proximity to the British market than Australia were producing oranges for it. I hoped, however, that the Empire viewpoint would assist the Australian fruit-growers; and that Great Britain would provide a profitable outlet for their product. The Government agreed to assist the growers in developing a trade with Britain and, after negotiations with the British Government, a trial",20,Frederick Stewart To Cover The Expenses Of The Export And

Unfortunately, it was not a great success, but later shipments have been better and in some instances very good prices have been realized. Another matter which I am continually bringing before the Government is the question of the export of citrus fruit juices. I have felt for a long time that the export of citrus fruit juices would provide a further strong Australian industry. by New Zealand was enforced and thousands of cases of Australian oranges had no market, I advocated that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch, and Commonwealth departments associated with it, might be able to devise' some means for establishing an industry by extracting citrus fruit juices. So far, however, no solution has been obtained. Similar lack of success has greeted the efforts of other countries on similar lines. I have a number of extracts from The. Industrial Engineering Chemist of 1932 dealing with the question. Despite their failures, I urge the Government to encourage its scientific advisers to continue the investigations into the possibility of utilizing citrus fruits for the extraction of juices for export. I feel that a very good market awaits Australia if it can pioneer this industry. The schedule to the bill, I am glad to notice, contains provisions which will make for the betterment of the marketing of citrus fruits. One wise provision is that misshapen or unnecessarily corrugated fruit shall not be shipped. If Australia is to improve its position in the British citrus market, it must send nothing but the best quality fruit to it. Another provision is that oranges must be graded either as special or. standard within certain definitions in the Commerce Act. Those conditions may for a while restrict exporters, but, in the long run, the growers and Australia will benefit. A third provision is that oranges shall not be treated by borax. I believe that in other countries the oranges are so treated in order to improve their stand also that that treatment is likely qualities of the fruit when the distance for which it is to be carried is to be long. Certain requirements have to 'be observed in connection with the cases in which the oranges are packed. Many other conditions are laid down which, if observed, will be of real benefit to South Australia. I . hope that many of the difficulties in which the industry has found itself in the past will be removed by free access being obtained to the market in New Zealand.'I support the second reading of the bill and hope that it will have When the embargo imposed a speedy passage If there is any justification for this bill and similar measures, it is that Parliament feels that it is necessary to give assistance to the industries affected. But I cannot refrain from expressing the opinion that, for as long as I can remember, such legislation has not been the moans of removing the ills it has been designed to cure. If the Parliament really desires to act effectively, it should start from the bottom instead of from the top. I do not believe for a moment that the bounty of 2s. a case on exports will be of great value to the grower of oranges, although it may assist him a little. I question whether the grower will receive the bounty. The bill does not stipulate that it must be paid to him. It will be paid tc the exporter or his agent. growers. shown where the bill makes that provision. Parliament has passed many measures of this nature, and invariably 95 per cent, of bhe disbursement has gone into the pockets of other than the producers. The person who parasitically lives on the grower will receive by far the largest proportion of the bounty. It appears to me that the machinery of this 'bill is intended to deal more with the imposition of penalties upon those who, with a view to deriving immediate profit, have largely destroyed markets not only in Great Britain 'but also in other countries by trying to put something over the purchaser with an inferior product. Neither appearance. But I underin this nor in any previous similar legislation has a means been devised to protect to prejudice the keeping the home consumer.

Naturally these growers have been adversely affected by the economic depression, and the prohibition of the exportation of oranges to New Zealand, it is fortunate for the industry that South Australian oranges, which are free from the Mediterranean fruitfly, are now admitted into New Zealand. J t is hoped that at an early date the negoAustralian basis, proper use could be tiations being carried on with the dominion authorities will lead to satisfactory trade arrangements. I do not know that the present attitude of the Government of New Zealand is prompted by spite on account of the embargo placed upon potatoes from New 'Zealand, because of lire blight; but, under New Zealand's agreement with the United States of America, it can send fruit to that country provided it is not grown in a locality in which the Mediterranean fruit-fly is known to be present, and, further, that New Zealand does not import fruit from a country infested by the fly. Another handicap under which the industry labours is the absence of organization and control by growers on an Australian basis, and the difficulty experienced in making fruit of the first quality regularly available to the public. Much small miserable fruit should be used by factories for processing, such as the manufacture of fruit drinks. The further one goes from the capital cities, the more noticeable is the shortage of the fruit offered for sale. Oranges form a health-giving food, and the be3t way to encourage their consumption would be an arrangement providing for their transport over the railways at Is. a case, thus enabling country people, particularly those in the west, to obtain good oranges at reasonable cost. Tho present transport charges practically double the retail cost of the fruit. The value of the assistance already given to tbe industry is reflected in the fact that the quantity of oranges exported to the United Kingdom in 1933 was 97,000 cases, whilst in 1934 it increased to 213,000 cases. The Commonwealth guarantee against loss has made it possible for the industry to cover the export charges on its fruit. Although the growers have not made a profit on the transaction, it is satisfactory to know that to N ew Zealand. Scventy-eiffht thousand cases the industry has been carried on, and that a» great deal of labour has been employed, whilst freight has been provided for the railways in the form of fruit that would otherwise have been left, to rot on the ground. If only because of the employment which the industry provides, it is deserving of further assistance. If the growers were organized on an made of small fruits for the purpose of manufacturing orange drinks. This branch of the industry is menaced to-day by the many substitutes for fresh fruit drinks, in the manufacture of which imported acids are used. Offal from factories using oranges is probably mixed with these drinks to make them resemble the genuine article. The use of the small fruit for this purpose would be particularly beneficial to the growers having old orchards in New South Wales. The industry enjoys an advantage of 3s. 6d. a case on the British market under the Ottawa agreement, and I hope that nothing will be done to interfere with that preference. I hope that the bounty will soon be increased from 2s. to 3s. a case, so that the total production of the industry may find a ready market, and that further expansion will be encouraged. growers' conference was held at Gosford a short while ago, and apologies for nonattendance were received from the Minister .for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page), the Assistant Minister( Mr Thorby), the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Gardner), the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson), and others.

Every one connected with the export, except the grower, received f u l l payment for serviees while in very few cases did the grower receive tlie cost of production, while quite a proportion only netted a few pence per case. As the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) pointed out, no guarantee is given to the industry that the bounty will be paid to the growers. It is feared by the honourable member that the money will go into the pockets of those who exploit the growers, included among whom may be mentioned the shipping combine and the banking interests. The president of the Fruit-growers Federation further statedThe governmental liability was reduced by the growers. When the advantages to the Government of this class of insurance were pointed out to the then Minister for Commerce( Sir F. H .

However, this was not done, but instead the guarantee on f r u it so insured was increased to 13a.

All that the ComReid monwealth Government can do to assist the citrus-growers of this country is to provide a paltry bounty of 2s. a case. The whole position of the citrus fruit growing industry should be reviewed; the Government should bring forward some stabilization scheme. So far none has been forthcoming. The Government has been dilly-dallying with the Government of New Zealand over this matter for months. It was said by the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) in this House when two Ministers of the Dominion Government were visiting here that some good results would of only half that which was promised can be achieved as the result of the negotiabe given to the citrus-growers. This is tions then proceeding, but nothing has been done and the citrus-growers are still the bill; but I reiterate the opinion that in a bad way. Micawber-like, the Go^ vernment is waiting for something to turn up. Everybody will agree that the citrus-growers of this country are in a precarious position. As said by the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Nock) the boxmaker has his money, the railways and shipping companies have their money, the exporting agents have their money; in fact, all the people who farm the farmer get their cut, but the grower himself is in debt all the time. The home market should be encouraged. Surely the Government could do something to boost up the advantages of citrus fruits to the people of this counResearch to extend the scope of its intry. I agree with the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) that the people want the fruit, but are unable to buy it because of the high prices charged. It is put into cold storage and, member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick when released, is sold at a price four times greater than when it was originally stored.

The Government should be prepared to render assistance to this industry on a much more liberal scale, and consideration shoxild be given to the return of the £20,000 taken from the growers by the Government. in this bill. hand the Government is taking £1 out of the pocket of"" the fruit-grower, and with the other it is putting back a florin piece. The honourable member for endeavoured to show that in the speech delivered by the presideut of the Fruit-growers Federation of Australia, complaint was made of the failure of the Government to honour its promise to the growers in this respect.

The great bulk of the citrus fruits sent overseas is exported direct by the grower. In view of the statements that have been maderespecting our trade with New Zealand, I point out that in 1933 -South Australian exports of citrus fruit zo New Zealand totalled 16,200 cases, and in 1934 its exports totalled 37,790, or considerably more than double the amount exported in the preceding year. The sale of this fruit to New Zealand undoubtedly relieved the position on the local market for other citrus-growers. The Government is doing everything possible to assist our citrus-growers to maintain and improve their position in the United Kingdom, to overcome the difficulties in relation to New Zealand, and to open up new markets in other countries of the world. I appeal to honourable members to facilitate the passage of the bill so that it may become law without delay. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

I feel disposed to move an amendment to tbe effect that all the words after "" of "", first occurring, be struck out, as an indication te the Government that the committee desires the bill to be withdrawn, with the object of making more adequate provision for the assistance of the exporters of citrus fruit. The circumstances of many people in this industry are deplorable. Instances have been brought under my notice of growers receiving debit notes in respect of large consignments of fruit, that have been sold on the local market. In view of this state of affairs the proposed bounty of 2s. a case of oranges exported is not adequate. The unfavorable conditions that have been experienced in this industry in recent times have forced many settlers to abandon their orchards, and accept relief work. honourable member to confine his remarks to the clause before the committee. a bounty of 2s. a case, as proposed in the bill, is not adequate.

Where a person exports oranges through an agent, the bounty may be paid to that agent, who shall be liable to account there for to the exporter. .In my second-reading speech I expressed the opinion that this clause was not sufficiently definite. I question whether it is drafted so as to ensure that the bounty will actually be paid to the growers of the oranges exported. Subclause 1 of the clause provides that the of the oranges "", and sub-clause 2 readsWhere a person exports oranges through an agent, the bounty may be paid to that agent, who shall be liable to account there for to thu exporter. It may easily happen, however, that the bounty is paid to a person who is not the grower of the oranges. The intentions of a measure of this kind are often disregarded, because the language in which they are expressed is not sufficiently definite. The very fact that penalties are provided indicates that a good deal of dishonesty is likely to be practised. We know that, as the result of all sorts of manoeuvring, a considerable proportion of bounties of every kind that should he paid direct to primary producers finds its way into the pockets of persons not entitled to receive it. The clause, as drawn, does not state definitely that the bounty imist be paid to the growers.

Minister for Commerce) [3.26] I explained in my speech, in reply, that oranges were generally exported direct by the growers, but that it would authorize agents to export on their behalf, in which case the bounty would be paid to the agent only on the authority of the grower. Persons who buy oranges outright, and subsequently export them, have to'take all the risks, and buyers would sell in the knowledge that a bounty of 2s. a case is payable in respect of all the fruit exported which is of the quality specified in the schedule. In my opinion, the procedure laid down in the bill for rhe payment of the bounty is the only logical, honest and feasible one. that could be drafted to meet the circumstances of the case. The statement of the Assistant Minister( Mr Thorby) bears out what I have said, namely, that those growers who do not themselves export but sell their fruit outright in Australia will not get. the bounty. It may be that, because the bounty is payable, they will receive a little more than would otherwise be the case, but it remains true that, in the majority of cases, the bounty payable under this scheme will be a bounty, not to the growers, but to the exporters.

If the Government is not prepared to accept the amendment, it will place itself in the position of using public funds to subsidize an industry that may be carried on by sweated labour. [ 3.38] I support the amendment. The Government has itself laid down the principle, that it will not support industries which are not economically worth supporting. When tariff protection for such industries is sought, the Government say chat the couutry should not be saddled with them because they are not economically sound.

It is not part of my duty to lay down, on behalf of the Commonwealth Governmeut, the conditions of employment which must be observed in the citrus-fruit growing industry. There are other authorities whose duty it is to prescribe conditions in regard to wages, child endowment, &c. Honourable members opposite are agreed that those engaged in the export of oranges are genuinely in need of the assistanceprovided for in this bill. Now they suggest that, while this assistance is being given, the Commonwealth should endeavour to impose. conditions which are really not its concern. The Assistant Minister( Mr Thorby) will agree, I think, that even the poorest citrus-fruit growers are not any worse off than are some of the lower paid workers in this industry as in others. I had the experience some years ago of working for a citrus-fruit grower, and T know that many of these growers make a practice of paying as low wages as they can. The unscrupulous grower will work his employees all sorts of hours for the lowest possible wage, and then expect the Government to pay him a bounty derived from taxation which must inevitably fall with greatest severity upon the workers themselves. doubt there are many citrus-fruit growers who deserve assistance, but others sively on the growing of citrus fruits, and some of these are quite well off. They do not. need or deserve help. If it were possible to devise a plan whereby only those in need of assistance should receive it, the Labour party would give such a plan its support, but we are not justified in supporting a proposal for assisting an industry which refuses to pay decent wages to its employees. basic wage is surely low enough, and the Commonwealth Government would not be asking too much if it were to insist that the payment of that wage should be a necessary condition for receiving the bounty. I would rather see an industry go out of existence altogether than that it should work its employees under conditions such as operate in many indus(Calare-Assistant tries at the present time.

It would appear from their statements that honourable members find it impossible to make their finances last, despite the fact that they are on a much higher salary scale than the men employed on the citrus orchards. From time to time as the Government's revenues improve, honourable members ' increase their salaries. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter does not seek £875 a year for those workers; all that is sought is the payment of the basic wage. amendment is an attempt to hinder, by the introduction of conditions best left to the Arbitration Court, a measure which is designed entirely for the promotion of citrus exports and for the improvement of the conditions of the growers.

The honourable member's time has expired. the citrus f ruit-groweT3 are entitled to the cost of production in order to make a decent living, the employees in the industry should be paid the basic wage. The Labour party does not object to the payment of the bounty, and it supports the bill, but it does not agree with the "" low wage party "" represented by the honourable juember for Barton( Mr Lane), who has described this amendment as a lot of industrial clap-trap. Far from being that, ii. is an appeal on behalf of a large section like him desire to keep the worker on the employed in the citrus fruit industry. To ask for the basic wage of £3 4s. a week, on which a man is expected to mainlain his wife and three children in New South Wales, is not out of place. The amendment is quite justifiable, because the bill authorizes the payment to the citrus fruit-grower of a bounty of 2s. a bushel on h:3 oranges. Parliament sets a minimum price, on which the grower can base his price, on the export of his product. In those circumstances, surely no grower would take exception to paying' the basic wage. Most of the fruit picking is probably done by contract, but, whe.ro labour is engaged by the week, it is not asking too much to expect the industry to pay a living wage to employees. Because we advocate that, we have been accused by tlie honourable member for Barton of I am opposing the speaking industrial clap-trap, and he was allowed to get away with it. Presumably, he is entitled to refer to honourable members as tricksters without being called to order. honourable member is incorrect in his statement. It was not put in that way; otherwise the Chair would have required the honourable memher for Barton to withdraw the remark. man did not hear the honourable member for Barton, for I am sure that other honourable members noted the reference of trickery of members who support the amendment, and go to the Domain on a Sunday, trying their industrial clap-trap on the people.

The Labour receives assistance, all sections engaged in it should share in the bounty. If the industry happens to be in poor circumstances and is unable 'to pay a proper wage to the worker, the bounty should be spread over all those engaged in it and not confined to a small section.

This Parliament should take steps to protect the interests of those not employed under any award, and more especially in subsidized industry. No industry is likely to prosper when 84 per cent, of our people are receiving iow incomes, because it is the 84 per cent, which supplies the biggest market for primary products. When the majority are paid an adequate wage, industry is prosperous.

I recall that awards were suspended in every State. member must not digress. in the States was suspended. We now ask that a section of the people engaged in a rural industry should receive some protection, in view of the fact that, the industry in which they are employed is to get a bounty. I object again to the abuse that emanates from the other side of the House regarding the Labour party's motives in moving amendments to assist the welfare of the workers. do not think members on this side of the House object to the principle behind the suggested amendment. A similar principle is incorporated in the Wine Export Bounty Bill. It was inaugurated by the Bruce-Page Government, and re-enacted by the Scullin Government, and it has remained for the whole of the time ft perfect dead letter. Some impatience has arisen over the manner in which a section of members is delaying the passage of the bill over what is an "" eyewashing "" amendment. able member ( Mr Ward) declaimed that the bounty would be payable to the exporter who might be a dealer, other than the grower who sells. Actually, there is no serious abuse in the payment of wages in the districts where citrus fruits are grown for ducers have had an extraordinarily bad export, but should there be any, this additional regulation can only increase the inducement to abuse. Many growers sell to a dealer. In the stores and at the of the standard which we all desire that wharf and various other places where the fruit is handled, the dealer is undoubtedly effective means by which that standard obliged to pay award rates. As a matter of fact, the exporter receives the bulk of his fruit from the irrigation areas. Any one who is acquainted with those areas at picking time must realize that the Australian Workers Union is better organized in them than in most parts of Australia. I can say from personal knowledge that most of the growers who have large citrus orchards and big packing plants have been cited before the Arbitration Court, and are necessarily complying with the awards of that tribunal. I know that growers who have not done a fair thing by 'their employees have been fined for non-compliance with awards. The inclusion of the amendment in the bill could not in any way expand the safeguards provided by the industrial laws of the States and the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. It is purely eye-wash, and is brought forward at a time when the only effect of the debate upon it can be to delay the passage of this measure, which is so urgently needed by the citrus industry and which, in all its essentials, has the support of every section of the Parliament. I therefore uphold the 'Ministeri n his refusal to accept it at this last moment. A similar provision in other bounty acts has proved quite ineffective, and we can only conclude that the intention underlying its submission is to serve propaganda publicity purposes. [Quorum formed.'] It is futile to think that the insertion of such a tinkering amendment, which, so far as I can see, is not even drafted as effectively as a similar provision in the Wine Export Bounty Act, would do anything to improve the conditions of the workers. What really is necessary to achieve that object, is to make the industry more prosperous, and that can The honorbest be done by establishing it on a firm for East Sydney basis.
