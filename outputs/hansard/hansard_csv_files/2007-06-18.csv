271,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (9.29 Pm),"IMonday, 18 June 2007 ----at 4.04 pm. Sitting suspended from 4.00 pm to 4.04 pm Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee Report Debate resumed. Dr EMERSON (Rankin) (4.04 pm)-It is with considerable pleasure that I speak today on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration entitled Servicing our future: inquiry into the current and future directions of Australia’s services export sector. Its origins were a conversation that was held when we were looking for a future inquiry. I acknowledge the cooperation and support of all committee members in agreeing to do an inquiry which essentially came under the banner of looking at the future of both the services industries and manufacturing beyond the resources boom. The purpose of the inquiry was to assess whether we should take a completely hands-off approach and allow, after the resources boom tapers down, the operation of exchange rate and other market variables to bring about the necessary economic changes that would in time boost the competitiveness of our services industries and manufacturing, as the textbooks would suggest. Alternatively, we were to assess whether there might be some active government policies that could be applied to prepare Australia, in particular the manufacturing and the services industries, for life beyond the resources boom. My thanks go to all members of the committee who thought this was a good idea. Today we have one instalment on all the hard work that was done. The other, which relates to the future of the manufacturing sector in Australia, will be tabled in the not too distant future, as I understand it. As the chair points out in this report, around 75 per cent of the nation’s gross domestic product is produced by the services economy and 85 per cent of employment is provided by our services industries, yet our services exports account for a little over 20 per cent of total exports. There is therefore some genuine capacity to lift our services industries’ export performance. It may not necessarily or even desirably get up to 75 to 85 per cent, but one dimension of the report is some recommendations on how we might lift the services industries’ exports. Labor is pretty pleased with this report. I do not want to make this a highly partisan comment, but recommendation No. 2 is for the government to create a minister for the services sector and, as I am in fact the shadow minister for the services economy, we are in there early on that score. If Labor were to be elected at the next election, that commitment would be carried through very early on. I will not spend too much of the time available on each of the recommendations. They are there for all to read. But I would like to point to a number of them. Recommendation No. 3 is MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Adjournment Been Waiting For Over 10 Years To Get Dental
272,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Jenkins) Took The Chair At 4.00 Pm.,,150,Committees
273,The Deputy Speaker,"Order! There not being a quorum, the chair will be resumedin some senses controversial but nevertheless very worthy. We have suggested the establishment of a program of permanent migration, to address shortages in lower skilled positions in industries such as hospitality and tourism, and also the provision of incentives for Australian and overseas workers to move to rural and regional areas where skill and labour shortages are severe. We think that is a better way of going than changing the designation of, for example, 457 visas. This country is going to have ongoing shortages of labour. The challenge of the ageing of the population means that for every older Australian there will be fewer Australians of working age. The government has lifted the immigration intake over the last few years, which has been a positive development. This report says that these problems will not disappear beyond the resources boom. There will be ongoing shortages of skilled and less-skilled labour. Therefore, we recommend a permanent increase in the immigration intake. Our argument is that, if it is good enough for people to come to Australia to work, they should have an opportunity-where feasible and consistent with the national interest-to remain here and contribute, ultimately, as citizens of this country. Another important recommendation relates to trade negotiations. We have suggested at page 44 that it is of great importance to Australia that the focus in trade negotiations shifts towards services and that the government should attempt to prioritise services trade negotiations where possible. Indeed, we go further in recommendation No. 4 and recommend that in both bilateral and multilateral negotiations the government gives greater priority to services trade issues and that, where negotiations are stalled because of issues in one sector-for example, agriculture-the government should consider negotiating agreements for individual sectors. This is breakthrough policy development. Again, I pay tribute to all committee members for agreeing that this was the way to go. For too long, when negotiations have stalled, particularly on agriculture, we have taken the attitude that nothing else gets done while that blockage remains. The committee has said that we need to move on and do our best for agriculture but not prejudice successful negotiations in the service or manufacturing industries. Another set of recommendations relates to the tourism sector and international airfreight. We have indicated at page 72 that the committee believes that calls in relation to avoiding long-haul flights are based on Eurocentric protectionist motives more than the desire to address climate change. The government and industry must attempt to ensure that the increasing public interest in climate change is not exploited by groups with protectionist interests. Again, thanks to all committee members for agreeing that this was the right approach. We go on to say in recommendation No. 9 that the government should be prepared to argue Australia’s case against Eurocentric protectionist policies which exploit the increasing public interest in climate change. Climate change is a very big issue in the public policy arena. Certainly we need to respond rationally to the challenge of climate change-but I emphasise rationally. Australia is a long way from the rest of the world and, if our aviation industries were to be subject to some sort of extra charge, a carbon charge, that would disadvantage Australia’s tourism industry and also its international airfreight industry. It is all very well for the Europeans to come up with these self-serving ideas, but they do not care what impact they would have on Australia-so good on the committee members for agreeing to this recommendation. I get a bit tired of public policy institutes coming up with ideas to make the poor pay more for basic essentials such as electricity. In this context I point to a survey that the Australia InMAIN COMMITTEE stitute released today on climate change, which says that 74 per cent of Australians would prefer a greenhouse strategy based mainly on energy efficiency and renewable energy. It found that 77 per cent of Australians would prefer to get their electricity from a renewable power source. This shonky online survey had 1,034 respondents. The point I make about reason and rationality is important in these areas, particularly in the service economy and services such as electricity generation. The cost range in dollars per megawatt hour for blackcoal energy supplies is between $30 and $35 but for solar voltaic is $120-plus. That is a four times higher charge for electricity. These are the charges that would be involved in the heavy emphasis that the Australia Institute thinks Australians wish to put on solar energy displacing black coal. Let us make sure that the climate change debate is a rational one, based on facts and reason. That is why we made the recommendation in the report about Eurocentric protectionist policies. This is a very good report. Thanks to all members of the committee across the political divide. The debates we had were conducted in a non-partisan way. That is the way it should be, ideally. I recommend this report to all members of the parliament; it is groundbreaking in its breadth and coverage. of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, titled Servicing our future: inquiry into the current and future directions of Australia’s services export sector. Like the previous speaker, I was particularly pleased to see such a bipartisan approach to the various issues and challenges that our committee focused on over the past 12 months. All members of the committee-and I am being generous in certain respects-were very focused on ensuring that the very best possible set of recommendations could be put forward. In many respects, I was genuinely pleased to see the bipartisan way in which this was handled. More importantly, I believe that, fundamentally, there were a number of key recommendations put forward by this committee that will bode well for the future of Australia, particularly those focusing on the services industry. As the member for Moncrieff, representing a city like the Gold Coast, I must say that I have been very focused on the services industry. The Gold Coast is a relatively new and emerging city. It certainly is one that perhaps has more than most when it comes to possible gains that can be made with a particular focus on the services sector. With that in mind, it is exciting to know that the services sector accounts for 75 per cent of output within Australia and 85 per cent of employment and generates 20 per cent of exports, to make it one of the key sectors in the Australian economy, which, perhaps surprisingly for some, is something that is a little-appreciated or known fact. The purpose of this report was to look at ways in which the Australian economy and successive Australian government policies could further drive this output and the export of Australian services and could further increase the take-up of employment in this sector. I was particularly pleased that the Treasurer was able to commission this inquiry by the committee on 3 May last year. In many respects, his ability to recognise the need to continue developing this process is a reflection of the leadership he has shown in this area over the past several years. As I said, there were a number of recommendations that came out of this inquiry, and I do not intend to discuss all of them. But I would like to touch upon some of the key recommendations that flowed from the report. I will go in numerical order, starting with recommendaMAIN COMMITTEE",150,Committees
274,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (4.14 Pm),"I am very pleased to rise today to speak to the reporttion No. 2, which was a recommendation that there be created a minister for the services sector. I must say that this is perhaps the single largest overarching recommendation the committee has put forward, which I believe will have ramifications in a very positive sense going forward. Whether it be a Liberal or a Labor government, it is very clear that a minister for the services sector would spearhead efforts to coordinate and bring together the services sector across a whole range of industries that are currently not particularly well coordinated. This has been caused by the effluxion of time and, in some respects, the various policy approaches being adopted in an inconsistent manner. Nonetheless, the creation of a services minister would, I believe, fundamentally alter the landscape going forward. Australians could have confidence that a dedicated and focused minister, who would ensure that there was a disciplined and coordinated approach to the services sector, would see this sector expand its growth beyond that which it has already achieved without this minister. Recommendation 4, which also deals with the issue of bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations, is also a very good recommendation and one that I am pleased to highlight here. There can be no doubt that in past agreements of a bilateral and multilateral nature there has from time to time been an inability for beneficial services outcomes to be achieved because, in many respects, there has been one particular sector-and more often than not it is agriculture-which has tended to stall in these negotiations. We know that many services exports are not able to reach their true potential because of non-tariff barriers. In this respect I believe that it is very important that any future government closely examines opportunities to enhance the services side of the economy and to enhance services exports by making sure that, when it comes to services, there is a resolute focus on what is the single largest part of the Australian economy. Although media columns and a lot of media focus very much on agricultural products and agricultural exports, the fact remains that we really should do more when it comes to the services side of the economy. I believe this recommendation, in a very pointed way, reinforces the committee’s view on a bipartisan basis that there must be absolute commitment and focus if we are going to continue to drive exports of services and that this can be achieved through both bilateral and multilateral treaties to a greater extent than it has been in the past. Recommendation 5 is one I was particularly passionate about. Recommendation 5 calls for the creation of a Brand Australia Council. In the United Kingdom, for example, the London Development Agency works on developing a London brand, a brand that applies to any external operations of UK agencies to bring them all under one brand. I have to say that, to me, that makes eminent sense. You do not see, for example, key private sector brands having various brands in various countries. What you tend to see with the Coca-Colas, the McDonald’s and the Nestles of the world is one consistent brand which applies across all of their branding across various countries. Sure, there are liable to be changes and there often are sometimes unique changes to the brand that alter it in a subtle way so that it accords with the local market that that particular brand might be operating in, but fundamentally the brand remains the same. It seems to me that the establishment of a Brand Australia Council would do a great deal to ensure that Australia is recognised around the world in a consistent and uniform way. This is fundamentally important, because we know that Tourism Australia is out there creating brand awareness of Australia, and that is a positive thing. But we also know that there is a variety of other agencies, such as Austrade, Australia’s investment agency, and other key agencies which MAIN COMMITTEE should be on the coat-tails of one unique brand for our country, so that internationally all people recognise an Australian brand when they see it and look forward to working with Australians, who, I think it is fair to say, are considered to be fairly lovable rogues around the world. Certainly I would hope so, and I believe that is the approach that Tourism Australia takes. Recommendation 7 I will touch upon quickly as well in the short time that I have. Recommendation 7 is that an independent inquiry on the future of inbound tourism be established. Inbound tourism generates about $17 billion of exports for Australia, and the tourism industry employs some 550,000 Australians-a key and vital industry for our country. More importantly, from my perspective, it is the single biggest industry in my electorate on the Gold Coast. There is no doubt that tourism is certainly only the tip of the iceberg of our potential generation of wealth from services exports. In that respect an independent inquiry would bring the kind of truth that is required to the industry to highlight both the good aspects and perhaps the negative aspects which historically may not have been dwelt upon. There can be no doubt that, as a result of a number of inquiries over the past couple of decades, we have tended to focus on aspects of the industry that we like. The committee believes it is time that an independent inquiry took stock of exactly where we are, made some tough decisions and actually shone the spotlight on particular parts of the industry which perhaps in the past have not had light shone onto them. In that respect I think a full and frank assessment of the future of the industry would be a very positive and beneficial outcome. Recommendation 8 is again another critical recommendation that the committee put forward. It deals with the recommendation that there be more emphasis placed on rogue operators and more emphasis placed on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to really clamp down on rogue operators. The committee heard a lot of evidence from witnesses concerned about the operations of rogue operators. I myself have witnessed first hand on the Gold Coast rogue operators acting in a way that belittles the Australian tourism industry and does our country no great service whatsoever. The committee, on a bipartisan level again, was disappointed at the lack of action that the ACCC had taken. In this respect I think this recommendation is a very important one. Recommendations 9 and 11 are the other two recommendations I would like to highlight with respect to climate change and, particularly under recommendation 11, with respect to niche marketing to do with the medical services export sector-no doubt a nascent industry but one that, again, could generate great wealth and income for this country. In the very short time. I have left I would like to pay tribute particularly to those who played a key role: to the chairman, who has been a very fine gentleman and member-the member for Cook, Bruce Baird; I thank him for all his work-the deputy chair for his outstanding work, and all members of the committee. I also thank Gold Coast Tourism and the various tourism representatives. (Time expired) Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (4.24 pm)-I also rise to speak on the report Servicing our future: inquiry into the current and future directions of Australia’s services export sector presented to the parliament by the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration. This report was undertaken as part of our inquiry into the current status and future directions of two major industry exports sectors-services and manufacturing. While the manufacturing report is to be tabled in the next parliamentary sitting, our emphasis with both sectors was on looking ahead and preparing for the economic times post the resources boom. MAIN COMMITTEE As it has in most economies, the size of the services sector in Australia has increased over time. In 2005, the proportion of employment services was 75 per cent, up from 58 per cent in 1973. The parts of the services sector employing the most people are retail trade; property and business services; health and community services; and construction. Gross value added by the services sector is likely to amount to around $800 billion of Australia’s trillion-dollar economy in 2006-07. My electorate of Newcastle reflects the changing nature of our economy. Between the 1981 and 2001 censuses, the proportion of people employed in the following services industries grew rapidly: wholesale and retail trade; health, education and community services; finance, property and business services; and recreational personal services-with health, hospitality, retail and higher education our largest employers. The committee, though, in looking at the different members of the services sector, found it was very difficult to measure the amount and nature of trade in services. There was a consensus view amongst those who appeared before the committee that services export statistics did need to be improved. This view was shared by the private sector, government departments and the Australian Bureau of Statistics itself. The committee feels that, while the ABS is measuring services exports consistent with international practice, there are areas in which improvements are needed, and the ABS has identified those. Thus, in recommendation 6 we recommended that more resources be made available to the ABS to improve its collection of data on the international trade in services. In my electorate the nature of the services sector includes many very small or microbusinesses-SMEs-who are exporting, for instance, medical services. Voice map training systems is one service being successfully exported to the UK. Quality IVF control systems are exported to countries around the world. Another successful small business service has been setting up training colleges in Pakistan, and an IT service provider is exporting those services to countries around the world. It is very difficult, obviously, to measure those very small businesses and the aggregated contribution they make. But the report also concluded that there is considerable scope for increasing the export effort and outcomes from the services sector, particularly with the opportunities in Asia. Submissions from the industry noted several issues limiting progress in this regard. These included non-tariff trade barriers, which are insufficiently addressed and acknowledged by our export agencies. It is easy to quantify and assist the export of goods and the manufacturing of goods but perhaps not so easy to influence and support those in the people based services sector. So there was also attention given in the report to the need for standards, attention to regulation and overregulation in this sector, and the need for some separate approaches. Skills shortages were seen as another key barrier for our services export industry. That is generally recognised as an issue for Australian businesses across the board. However, in the services sector, being people based and a labour-intensive industry, it is a particular problem. For example, the ABS tells us that in accommodation, restaurants and cafes it takes 24 workers a year to produce $1 million in output. In mining, for example, the same output takes just two workers in that one year. Speaking of the mining sector, the boom in that sector is one of the reasons put forward in many submissions for skills and labour shortages in the services sector. It is interesting to note that many services industry people are attached or related to that mining boom, particularly MAIN COMMITTEE those in engineering and consultancy services. It has been argued that the big wages being paid in the mining sector are pulling people as diverse as chefs, bus drivers and mechanics out of sectors like tourism and into other sectors. The report made 14 recommendations, and I acknowledge a previous speaker on this report, the member for Rankin, who has absolutely been ahead of the government. In recommendation 2, the report recommends the setting up of a minister for the services sector. Of course our shadow minister for the service economy, small business and independent contractors was greatly helpful to us in our work on our committee. The report also recommended research into innovation and pointed out how innovation in the service sector can increase productivity. Given productivity rates in this country, it is one of those areas we found overlooked a great deal in the services economy. Recommendation 3 suggested that a permanent migration program was needed to address shortages, particularly in lower skilled positions-for example, hospitality and tourism. While we acknowledge that the 457 visa approach is being used, I noted today the differences in the positions of Helen Clark and the Prime Minister regarding using lower skilled workers in our region. I think specific and permanent migration programs need to be considered. I think recommendation 5, to initiate Brand Australia Council, is a way to give oversight and coordination to all the agencies and export authorities that do look at Australian products. Their branding and approach has always been on goods rather than services. The council will look to the quality and importance of standards and the increased success of the services sector. But to do that of course we also need to take on rogue operators who can do great damage, particularly in tourism, although I think hospitality and education services were also areas where we saw rogue operators that had the potential to damage the brand of Australian services quite remarkably. Recommendations 7 to 11 particularly look at the need for assistance to the tourism service sector. We also saw a greater role for the ACCC, and we recommended that they have additional resources to actively seek out and prosecute alleged rogue operators in the tourism sector. We did suggest that there should be increased funding by both state and federal governments to the Inbound Tourism Compliance Taskforce and acknowledge that there is a need for some national coordination on this issue. In terms of education services, recommendation 12 went to assessing the overall competitiveness of Australian student visa requirements. Is it easy to come here and access those education services or is it easier to go somewhere else? Recommendation 13 recommended a performance audit, by the ANAO, of DEST compliance and enforcement action, of alleged breaches of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act and its national codes. I think all of us are hearing in our electorates about more problems emerging from that field. Recommendation 14 encourages Tourism Australia and Australian Education International to work together to see what they can do to protect standards, recognising that there is an overlap. There were some general areas that needed a little more attention-and certainly there is not time in each report or each inquiry to cover them all. But, in my view, there was a need for some much more flexible approaches to training. With a mobile population, when you get a boom, people are drawn to and from all over the country. I know flexible delivery is something that education institutions are working very hard on, but I think it needs some new focus and support. An emphasis on entrepreneurship is also probably missing from our overall eduMAIN COMMITTEE cation approaches, and we cannot help but see that SMEs that are delivering services are totally dependent on high-speed and wide-bandwidth broadband. Particularly in regional Australia and electorates like mine, without those broadband capabilities they cannot fully take advantage of the export opportunities in a global economy. Finally, I would like to also add my thanks to the secretariat for their efforts. These sorts of inquiries require a great deal of coordination and a lot of travel around the country, and we were able to sample widely from different service sectors and from different places in regional and metropolitan Australia. I would also thank the chairman. He does run a very productive, congenial and certainly non-partisan committee. I acknowledge the non-partisan contributions of all the committee members and their willingness to support this inquiry. I recommend the report Servicing our future to the House. I know it will be well received by the services sector in general. give something to the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration in the future. I am sure we would welcome the approach and the abilities of the member for Batman to the committee. It has been very noticeable that all previous committee members who have spoken in this debate have commented on the fact that there has been a bipartisan approach by the committee, chaired very well by the member for Cook and also, quite arguably, served very well by the best secretariat in this House. Secretariat members certainly help the members enormously and go to a lot of effort to ensure that the committee produces a great report. I lament the probable outcome that as it was a bipartisan committee there will not be too much publicity in the papers because there was not much controversy. Certainly some good views have been put forward but, unfortunately, I do not think the media will give it due consideration and promotion because we are not at each other’s throats. Mr Martin Ferguson interjectingThe electorate of Barker, which I have the honour of representing, is a little over 64,000 square kilometres. It is larger than Tasmania. When you go through the electorate you make your way past some of the country’s great treasures. The Murraylands region of my electorate has already been identified as a future logistics and transport distribution hub for South Australia because of its ideal location, only an hour away from Adelaide. It has certainly been easier to come in and out of Adelaide via Murray Bridge or the Murraylands as a result of the money that this government spent on the Heysen tunnels, which also made access into Adelaide safer. Because of its ideal location there is very easy access via road and rail to the eastern seaboard, which is very important in a country like ours. Tourism derives a significant proportion of the electorate’s economic dollar and opportunities for tourist and sporting events, businesses, cruises and retreats are growing and receiving international acclaim and media publicity. Of course, agriculture is also a very strong base for the Barker electorate. Nationally the services sector is responsible for 75 per cent of this country’s outputs and 85 per cent of employment. Export services make up more than 20 per cent of total exports. It is surprising to some that this is more than rural exports and about on par with manufacturing exports. That is not to say that manufacturing or agricultural exports should be derided; in fact, they are very important to our economy. Without food, for example, we do not live. It is MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Committees
275,Mr Secker (Barker) (4.34 Pm),I welcome the attempt by the member for Batman to,157,Committees
276,Mr Secker,"That might happen. I am very pleased with the report Servicing our future.as simple as that. Without exporting food we would be producing probably 80 per cent more than our actual needs in Australia. Inbound tourism is, at the moment, Australia’s biggest service export industry. It is among the top export earners across all industries and has set new records for arrivals and exports. Yet, despite this, for some time the services sector has been overshadowed by Australia’s goods producing industries, such as the agricultural and manufacturing industries, and by the much publicised mining boom. It is this committee’s view that the Australian government must give greater priority to the services sector by way of government acknowledgement and assistance and by way of media attention. This committee was charged with the responsibility of identifying challenges posed to the services sector by the current resources boom and to highlight both issues and opportunities for the sector into the future. The Servicing our future inquiry suggests that service exports are likely to be of increasing importance to the Australian economy not just in the near future or the short term but in the coming years and decades. That time is fast approaching, but before it does this government and any other future government must be ready. We must have the ability to address workforce needs such as a shortage of skills and labour, which are already present in our economy. We need to tackle the significant competitive challenges on the horizon for the educational sector, the second largest services export sector, and to remove growth-constraining issues surrounding non-tariff trade barriers. Educational export services were brought home to me when I was part of a recent trade delegation to Mexico. We are certainly growing in that area. Many students are coming to Australia and we also have students in Mexico. There were many recommendations. Innovation, particularly in the use of information technology, has been a key driver of productivity in the services sector. I hark back to my days at university when I was doing an economics degree. Even then they were talking about innovation. We talk about it a lot, but I think we need to recognise it even more. There has been little study done of the role of research and innovation in lifting productivity in the services sector. More could be and should be done in this area. Because of this, the committee recommends that the government commission research into innovation in the services sector and its implications for productivity. It was also the view of the committee that the services sector would benefit from improved federal government coordination. We believe that the most effective way to achieve this would be with the introduction of a minister for services. Every member of the committee has mentioned that so far, so obviously they think it is pretty important. Such a role would provide a focal point for the services sector, recognising its increasing importance, particularly in terms of exports. This position could assume a generic responsibility for the sector, informing government policy on issues that affect all service industries. As well it could be responsible for coordinating research into the services sector and formulating a government strategy to ensure the continued expansion of service exports. We also recommended that the government consider establishing a program of permanent migration to address shortages in lower skilled positions-and we chose those words very carefully-in industries like hospitality and tourism, and provide incentives for Australian and overseas workers to move to rural and regional areas where skills and labour shortages tend to be more severe than they are in the cities. Australia’s population is ageing, and we need to MAIN COMMITTEE look to permanently boost the supply of labour in the economy. The committee is in favour of permanent rather than temporary migration of lower skilled workers. The focus must be on younger migrants to avoid increasing the problem of the ageing population. There is a significant shortage of workers at a skill level below that which is already covered by the current skilled migration program, so it is not so much, certainly in my area, a shortage of skills but a shortage of actual people and labour to do the jobs. We also recommended that in all future bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations the government give greater priority to services trade issues. Where negotiations are stalled because of issues in one particular sector-for example, agriculture-the government should consider negotiating agreements for individual sectors. Whilst we talk about Australia’s good record with the export of goods, we are lagging in international brand recognition. Like the member for Moncrieff, I am very passionate about our ability as an exporter of business services, for example, not being well recognised. We must broaden our international brand. The committee recommends that the government initiate a Brand Australia Council. This council would not take over the operations of promotion agencies like Tourism Australia and Austrade but would provide an opportunity for these agencies to communicate, to work together on promotion where possible and to investigate how our brand is perceived internationally and where it needs to be improved. There are many other recommendations that are worth listing. Very quickly, they include: that governments, both state and federal, take proactive steps to eradicate rogue tourism operators; that the government commission an independent inquiry into the future of the inbound tourism industry; and that more resources be made available to the Australian Bureau of Statistics for improving its collection of data on international trade in services. (Time expired) the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration entitled Servicing our future: inquiry into the current and future directions of Australia’s services export sector, and, in doing so, indicate to the member for Barker that I pay close attention to the work of this committee. I say that because, as the shadow minister for tourism, I feel that the recommendations of this committee’s report are exceptionally important. I also say at the outset that, like the member for Barker, I do not believe the work of the committee structure gets enough attention and recognition. I think we all appreciate that committee work is one of the most rewarding parts of being a politician, because it enables us in a bipartisan way to make some real recommendations about real policy issues of national importance-recommendations we can be proud of. As shadow minister for transport and roads and tourism, I am paying close attention to the recommendations of this report because of the importance of tourism to the export sector. I hope that the member for Moncrieff, who has been an active participant in this committee, brings the report to the attention of the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, because I know the member for Moncrieff is highly critical of the minister’s performance. I, like him, appreciate that she needs all the assistance she can get with her portfolio work. Having said that, let me say that the report focuses heavily on tourism, a key service sector in Australia. Tourism related services account for almost $28 billion in the balance of payments and are MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Committees
277,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (4.44 Pm),"I welcome the opportunity to addressmade up of more than 60 per cent of Australia’s total services exports. The importance of the tourism industry as a whole is often forgotten, and this report reminds us that it contributes about four per cent of Australia’s GDP. I think, therefore, that it would also have been appropriate for the committee to have recommended that, in terms of the performance of the Howard government, tourism be a key cabinet portfolio rather than being in the outer cabinet, the outer ministry, as is currently the situation. The report rightly identifies a number of challenges faced by the industry and highlights the fact that the recent slowing in Australia’s services exports has been partly attributable to the stronger Australian dollar leading to slower growth in tourism related services. This is something that cannot go on without it being properly addressed. As the report notes, there has been a decline in tourist arrivals from Japan over the last decade and, while Japan’s ageing population and modest economic growth over the last couple of years partly explains it, it should be a matter of concern to Australia that Japanese tourism to other destinations such as China, Singapore and South Korea grew over the same period. So, in that respect, I welcome the committee’s report on the findings of the action plan for Japanese tourism with respect to how we go forward. It is something that has to be pursued vigorously by the government. I consider that there is no doubt that the ‘So where the bloody hell are you?’ campaign has been a complete and utter failure in Japan, and it is time some sensible analysis and federal leadership were exercised to reverse this negative trend. The minister’s response is to want to audition for a Japanese soap opera! We need more than that. Another challenge for Australia as a tourism destination is the growth of low-cost carriers flying within Europe and Asia, which has increased the relative price of a holiday in Australia for European and Asian tourists. At the same time there has been little development of lowcost, long-haul flights to destinations like Australia, and high world oil prices have resulted in many airlines introducing fuel surcharges of around $74 to $100 on long-haul flights, further increasing the relative cost of travel to Australia for a tourist. Again, I support the recommendation of the committee to commission an independent inquiry on the future of the inbound tourism industry and the challenges it faces. When it comes to Australia’s challenges on inbound tourism, we need more action. That is why I also welcome the committee’s support for the development of an action plan to consider the impacts of climate change on the tourism industry and its recommendation that the action plan also consider the potential impact of carbon emission reduction policies on inbound tourism. The committee notes, appropriately, that in recent times there have been calls from within Europe for its citizens-another trade embargo-to avoid long-haul flights and give preference to consumer products that have not been freighted over long distances; another crack by the European union at Australia. The committee appropriately expressed a view that some of these calls are based on Eurocentric protectionist motives more than a desire to address climate change, and noted that government industries should attempt to ensure that the increasing public interest in climate change is not exploited by groups with protectionist objectives in mind. I could not agree more. Let us deal with a few facts. Let us have a scientific debate about climate change and its potential impact on the tourism industry. Globally, aviation contributes just two per cent of greenhouse gas emissions but eight per cent of world GDP-that is, 28 million jobs and $US3 trillion. Recently, the less than august Australia Institute-an organisation for which I have no MAIN COMMITTEE respect because it seems to pride itself on belting low-income people in Australia-proposed a carbon tax, an elitist tax, on domestic flights and called for an end to the promotion of the aviation industry. Never mind that, according to the Australian Greenhouse Office’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, civil aviation contributes just 0.9 per cent of Australia’s emissions. If we got rid of the entire aviation industry, as the Australia Institute would have it, we would still be left with 99 per cent of Australia’s emissions. Australia’s geographic remoteness and vastly dispersed population means we rely on air travel more than the rest of the world. In Europe, distances between destinations are much shorter, and rail and road networks provide alternative modes of efficient transport. But it should also be noted that every rail journey in Europe is subsidised by between $US3 and $US9, while every air journey contributes between $US6 and $US11 to government revenues. Air transport is, interestingly, responsible for 99 per cent of Australia’s international passenger movements each year, with about 18.1 million air passengers entering and leaving Australia-and the Australia Institute would have us kill the Australian aviation industry both domestically and internationally. They ought to have a long, hard look at themselves. Within Australia, the arrival of low-cost airlines Jetstar, Virgin Blue and, now, Tiger have connected Australians to each other and improved access to markets for Australian businesses like never before. It has also meant that ordinary people, low-income earners, can avail themselves of air travel-at long last. But let us keep it this way. It is the responsibility of both sides of parliament to stand up to the idiots in the Australia Institute. The Australia Institute report, so far as I am concerned, is brazen in its simplicity and puts the organisation in the dubious company of the Green warriors who hope that climate change will finally bring down capitalism. While this might enable grandstanding in the media, it fails to progress the climate change debate in any meaningful way, and it damages the prospect of finding sensible scientific solutions to a complex debate that is of exceptional economic importance to the future of Australia, especially rural, remote and regional Australia. Each year, for decades now, the airline industry has made efficiency improvements of between one and two per cent. It may not seem like much to the Australia Institute, but eliminating a single minute from every flight around the world would save 4.8 million tonnes of greenhouse emissions. That is a big incentive for the airlines to actually make progress, because emissions cost money-it is about good business. With fuel prices at record highs, it is good business to reduce emissions. It is no coincidence that the financially successful airlines are also often the greenest, as they invest heavily in new aircraft and technologies that burn fuel more efficiently. New aircraft are 70 per cent more fuel efficient than 40 years ago and 20 per cent more fuel efficient than 10 years ago. Technologies in airspace management, such as advanced navigation and scheduling systems, are advancing and achieving dramatic fuelefficiency improvements. I commend this report to the House, because it is about making appropriate recommendations for the future of the services sector in Australia. It also brings to a head such complex issues as climate change, which are key to the future of a number of service sector industries in Australia and key to economic growth and employment in Australia. I commend the committee for its very valuable work. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE ing here today which has been created by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration and entitled Servicing our future: inquiry into the current and future directions of Australia’s services export sector. BeforeI go on to my contribution, I was listening to the first few minutes of what the member for Batman had to say in his speech, so I thought I would rise and take issue with some of the points that he made which I thought were wrong and over the top. But I will not do that, because I am just in such furious agreement with the second half of his speech, where he talked about the report that was brought down by the Australia Institute. I see why he has a reputation, at least on our side of the House, for bringing a very common sense perspective to some of these issues. His contribution was excellent. This report makes 14 recommendations. I wanted to concentrate primarily on the first six, because recommendations 7 to 14, which deal a lot with the tourism industry in Australia, have already been extensively canvassed by the first five speakers. SoI wanted to concentrate in my contribution on recommendations 1 through to 6. The first recommendation is that the government encourage more research into the services sector. That is a reasonably sensible recommendation. We hit something of a fork in a road as a committee about which direction we would take when we were framing this report. We could have taken the road of, maybe, increased government intervention or possibly suggesting that the government should spend more money doing this or that. But what has been taken in this report is a far more sensible approach. We have opted to enhance the efforts of the private sector that are already occurring and making the services industry such an important part of the Australian economy. Rather than coming in with a very heavy hand of government, these recommendations have something of a light touch. They are more about encouraging the government to coordinate. Recommendation 1 is a good indication of that. Recommendation 2-one that I know has pleased my colleagues on the other side of the chamber today-about the creation of a minister for services is very much in that vein. We are not recommending that the government do exciting new things or take incredibly large initiatives in the services sector, but we are saying that it would be worthwhile for the government to have a look at the services sector and see if there is some way that we can help to coordinate things better. The creation of a minister for services would obviously be a step in that direction. Recommendation 3 is, in my view, the most important recommendation of the committee. It is important because it deals with a factor that is heavily weighing on the Australian economy at the moment. It is, without a doubt, the No. 1 complaint that business has brought to me as the member for Stirling. That is the labour shortage, sometimes referred to as a skills shortage. The reality is that, because we have a booming economy, we are literally running out of people to work in that economy. People consistently come to see me in my electorate to complain that they cannot find workers, particularly in some of the traditionally lower paid occupations such as aged care, hospitality and of course all sorts of occupations that you would find within the tourism industry. It really is now a critical issue. If you cannot find the people to work in the economy, you cannot continue to expand the economy. I was worried that as a committee we might squib this one, because there might be some different political imperatives for the members on either side of the committee, but I think MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Committees
278,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (4.54 Pm),"I rise also to talk about the report that we are discusswhat we have come up with is very sensible. We recommended that the government institute a process whereby more permanent migrants can come to Australia. I actually do not have a strong view about whether the migration to Australia is permanent or on a more short-term basis, but other members of the committee felt that it was important to have migrants come on a permanent basis as opposed to coming on any temporary basis. I think it is so important to solve this problem that I really did not think it was worthwhile taking issue about whether people come here temporarily or permanently. The most important thing is that we solve the problem and get more people here. This is a very good report. All the recommendations are worthwhile, but it is really vital for the government to take notice of recommendation 3. I am going to be very pleased to take this report back to my electorate and discuss it with some of the business people who have come to see me on a regular basis, begging me as their member of parliament to do what I can to encourage the government to allow more labour to come to Australia. Recommendation 4 talks about having some more emphasis within international trade negotiations on the services sector. A lot of players within the sector were of the view that, when we come to negotiate both multilateral and bilateral trade agreements, we as a government place more emphasis on manufacturing and agriculture, which belies the fact that services is actually the largest sector of our economy. Players within the services industry felt that there needs to be more emphasis placed on the services sector within those negotiations. There is evidence to suggest that that would be a very sound thing for the government to do. Recommendation 5 was particularly championed by the member for Moncrieff, and he has discussed it within his contribution. It is for the creation of a Brand Australia. We were given a number of examples where governments have done this quite successfully; the Italian example was one. It would promote Australia as a homogenous brand, as opposed to promoting different sectors of Australia, if you like. Australia would benefit if we were to do that in a more coordinated way. Recommendation 6 is a reiteration of a plea that we heard from many players within the sector that the ABS provide more data from the services sector, particularly regarding its place in international trade. In the remaining few minutes I will move on to the other recommendations, recommendations 7 through 14, which deal primarily with tourism. Recommendation 7 asks that the government has a look specifically at the inbound tourism industry. There was some concern within the sector that tourism has not been growing or that we have not been maintaining the rate, particularly from some markets, of inbound tourists. A lot of that, of course, has to do with the fact that the Australian dollar is currently so strong, which has a negative effect on Australia as a destination, particularly on the Japanese inbound tourism market, which is mentioned specifically in recommendation 10. Recommendation 8 is about rogue operators within the tourism industry. Sadly, we as a committee heard evidence that rogue operators were not policed in an overly vigorous way. Members of the committee had received representations quite heavily, particularly members from Queensland-and the chairman was also terribly concerned-that the ACCC was not using its powers to properly police rogue operators in the tourism industry. The committee urges the ACCC to take another look at that and to increase the frequency with which they take compliance action. Importantly, we decided not to do this by putting a whole new layer MAIN COMMITTEE of bureaucracy on the tourism sector. There was some discussion within the committee about doing that. I personally felt that that would be very unfair on the vast majority of tourism operators that do operate within the law. I think recommendation 9 is the second most important recommendation of the committee. I could not agree more with the member for Batman’s contribution about this. We should not subscribe to some Eurocentric view that penalises hard working Australian exporters, and we should not fall for the line-that the EU seems to be pushing very heavily at the momentthat somehow Australia should be penalised for being a long way from the rest of the world. We have really got to be alert to that sort of nonsense. AgainI concur very strongly with what the member for Batman said. Recommendation 10, about the Japanese market, I have already touched on. The depreciating yen versus the Australian dollar is obviously a substantial problem there. Recommendations 11, 12, 13 and 14 are very important to the tourism and education sectors and, specifically, coordinating between the two. I thank the chair and the other members of the committee for their work in producing a very worthwhile report. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Baird) adjourned. Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation Committee Report Debate resumed. Ms HALL (Shortland) (5.05 pm)-I rise to speak on the report presented by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation entitled Current vacancies: workforce challenges facing the Australian tourism sector. The tourism industry plays a very important role in Australia. In 2003-04, tourism contributed 3.5 per cent of gross value added, 3.9 per cent of total gross domestic product, 5.6 per cent of total employment and 12.1 per cent of total exports. More than 550,000 Australians generated $17 billion in Australian export earnings. On those figures, you can see just how important the tourism industry is to Australia. The number of international visitors to Australia is increasing. In 2004, there were over five million international visitors, and that was a 9.9 per cent increase on the previous year. Various countries contribute to those visitor numbers. New Zealand is by far the largest source of our international tourists. There is strong growth predicted in the tourism sector into the future. However, the growth in the industry is sensitive to international events and it stands to be inhibited by the skills shortage that exists. The committee looked at the skills shortage and came up with a number of recommendations to address it. Overwhelmingly, the most important issues are, firstly, wages and conditions and, secondly, the lack of training and the lack of a career path for people working in the tourism industry. People employed in the tourism industry often view a job in that industry as a job that you do before you get a real job. The simple fact that there is no career path-or a very limited career path-impacts on the number of people who work in the industry. The tourism industry has a very high turnover of workers. In large part, as I mentioned at the start of my comments, that is due to the very low wages that are paid to the workers in the industry. The conditions of work also impact on that, including the fact that people are reMAIN COMMITTEE quired to work very long hours. There has been a shortage of chefs in Australia since the 1950s and it just continues to grow. We have heard of restaurants having to close their doors simply because they do not have the staff to operate them. Chefs and other people in that industry are quite often working when other people are out having their recreation. This places a big burden on the people employed in the industry. It is also very interesting to note that, because of the relatively low wages and poor conditions, these workers do not have a commitment to the industry. At the hearings, the committee heard from the Hotel, Motel and Accommodation Association, who indicated that, over the years, there have been regular breaches of the laws within the industry whereby employers have not adhered to award conditions. Peter Olah, who was giving evidence to the committee, said that Work Choices had actually allowed employers to now do legally what they had been doing illegally for some time. What this shows is that employers do not have a commitment to their staff. If they did have a commitment to their staff, that would go some way to addressing the skills shortage that exists in the industry. It is also important to recognise that many tourism businesses are small, marginal businesses. They have a high turnover of owners. Quite often they close down. A large percentage of them are family businesses, single-owner businesses or partnerships. These businesses do not have the depth of training to operate successfully over a long period of time. The businesses are also often seasonal. In the snowfields it is very much a winter industry and in the Top End, once again, the peaks tend to be in the winter. Each area has its peaks. I thought the Whitsundays had a very good approach to tourism, in that all the operators in the Whitsundays join together as a group to try to improve the industry, to give some depth to the industry, and to draw on the expertise of, and to provide support to, others. The recommendations of the report went across a number of areas. We recognise that there was a lack of data collection and analysis of the labour needs within the tourism industry. It is very much an ad hoc approach. I think that is symbolised by those small businesses that are operating in a very unplanned environment. They are struggling and reacting to the circumstances of the day rather than having a planned approach to their business. Anyone who has any sort of relationship with business knows that the most important thing is to have in place a plan and to work towards that plan. As a committee we thought there needed to be more comprehensive workforce planning done within the industry. We also thought that there needed to be a partnership with regional research industries, institutions and industry bodies to undertake a review and analysis of employment data for tourism and related sectors-once again adopting a much more planned approach. This will provide support to employers whilst at the same time encouraging employers to think about the needs of their staff. Because of the seasonal nature of the workforce, we felt that the development of a seasonal workforce management plan would be of benefit to the industry and at the same time be of benefit to those people who work in the industry. I feel it is very much an industry that by its nature does not make a total commitment to its workers. It is an industry that sees itself as being seasonal, that sees itself as offering an employment opportunity to workers on a very short-term basis and that does not value its workers to the degree that makes a commitment to their training and develops that career plan that I think is ever so important if the industry is to thrive. There are very good overseas examples of where this commitment is made and where tourism is considered not as a job you MAIN COMMITTEE have before you get a job but as your real-life job. If that is to happen in Australia and if we are really to address these shortages, we have to address the issues surrounding wages and conditions and the ongoing training of workers. I would also like to put on the record that within the industry it is important that we deal with the issue of prior learning-recognise prior learning and reduce the barriers to recognising prior learning-and actively promote the competency based apprenticeship pathway. These are all recommendations. In the report we deal with visas, but my contribution to this debate has concentrated on the fact that we need to make a real commitment to training and a real commitment to wages and conditions if we are to address the skills shortage, because there is competition from other industries that pay a lot more to their workers and that have much better conditions for their workers than the tourism industry. Unless something is done to make it more attractive-unless issues like housing and the long-term career paths of people working in the industry are addressed-then we will continue to have this skills shortage that affects this industry that is very valuable to the Australian economy. BeforeI start I would like to thank linesmen and ballpersons-I thank Dr Anna Dacre; Siobhan Leyne, the inquiry secretary; and all of the staff involved with making us as members of this committee look good in writing. Ms Hall interjectingthose remarks. I know that Labor members have been spending a little bit of time talking about employment relations issues, Work Choices and so forth. I know that there is not a dissenting report, as I said to the House, but I took advice from the Clerk-I know that the member for Werriwa was disturbed about that-and the Clerk put the words ‘dissenting report’ in my earlier contribution in the House. So, if it is acceptable, I will disassociate myself from my own comments and say they put some other comments in there. That is what the Labor members did. They reflected a bit on industrial relations practices, as is their wont, and there was obviously a deal of interest and pressure from a variety of unions keen to put a point to the committee, which we listened to. One would suspect that Peter Olah talking about the fact that Work Choices provides some flexibility that had not been there before was in fact recognition that restrictive award conditions made it impossible for some people who were employed to do one job but were not necessarily affiliated or paid according to the various awards relating to the various tasks that they might undertake. In that regard, Work Choices means that they can have a private agreement with that person. I really do not want to spend much time in this discussion dealing with that. I think it is fair to say that it is true, as the member for Shortland just observed-I will paraphrase what she said-that this is a sector that is vital to Australia’s economic base, that does not pay its workers as well as it might and that has only itself to blame for so many of the problems it currently has when it comes to labour shortages. As people in Western Australia observed to the committee, if you are a good cook, a good chef or a good wait staff person and you are in the local hotel, restaurant or whatever in a mining area then-guess what!-the mining industry bloke down the road is going to come and hire you and will be fairly likely to offer you some accommodation that you might not already be getting.

280,Mr Hardgrave,"I think all of my colleagues opposite are happy to be associated withBroome-I think that was the name of the place-to close completely because all of those who were broiling and oiling chickens at the Chicken Shack went off to work at Cable Beach, where I am sure they picked up some other skills. The point is that there is an enormously competitive labour market in this particular area. My grave concern as somebody from a media and marketing background who watches the ambitions of government and tourist authorities to bring more people to Australia-and I note the member for Cook is here and his passion for Qantas, our national carrier, to bring those people in is very well known in this place-is that we as a nation are not actually going to be able to live up to the expectations that we have created in our tourist marketing, because one of the key elements of meeting those expectations that is missing is the failure to properly invest in our people. To leave it all to chance-to leave it to the backpackers, the entry level job seekers and, as the member for Shortland rightly observed, the people who get a job in tourism or hospitality before a real job comes along-and to leave it to just those people to underpin the way in which our tourism and hospitality industry operates is an enormous folly. We have a sector that is small and medium business in the most. There is not a Sofitel and a Hilton in every country town. Those Hiltons and Sofitels do have a huge impact on the professional standards-there is no doubt about it. In every country town you may well find that well-meaning, superannuated people are taking on the business investment of their lifetime, hopefully turning their retirement dreams into some sort of success for themselves, and are struggling to find staff. Kate Lamont, who provides enormous high-level advice for Tourism Western Australia and who put Margaret River on the map through her abilities as an entrepreneur in building up a business case for Margaret River wineries, said to the committee at the Perth hearings that she is back to changing sheets in her hotel rooms. This is an extraordinary problem for the sector; you have someone who you want to be entrepreneurial and to give good advice to government and industry doing the close work of tightening up the sheets around the beds they let at night. We have a problem in this sector. Some of it is built around the failure to pay adequately but, to be fair, a lot of it is built around the failure of this industry to be collaborative enough to put pressure on the government and to make sure that, if you move from one hotel or caravan park to a hotel thousands of kilometres away, the experience you gained at one place counts for something. The national training system does not kick in and recognise the in-house training as well as it should. That conflict has to be put to bed because, if we want to give people a chance to grow their wage and a long-term career, and if we want this industry to meet all of the expectations of people coming to this country, we have to give people a career path. In the recommendations put forward, the committee has provided some ways to achieve this. It asked, ‘Why don’t we have a portable long-service scheme?’ If it is agreed that you have been working and that you have been involved in the industry in one place and moved to another, let that all count in understanding, appreciating and respecting the experience you have gained in those different places; and let that be recognised by the industry. As the member for Shortland asked, ‘Why don’t we accept that a lot of the places are seasonal?’ We have to make sure that if you get 12 weeks work at the ski fields, which might well be 18 weeks given that the snow fell fairly early this year-I know nothing about skiing, but I heard that on television-why don’t those 12 or 18 weeks work count towards a long-term understandMAIN COMMITTEE ing and credentials to give you a nationally recognised training outcome? That prior experience and learning should count towards something so that you can invest in yourself with further training and know that, even if you do not have a piece of paper, your experience is being recognised. That does not exist in Australia today. We are sending all the wrong messages to people, saying: ‘There’s a little bit here and a little bit there. Take your CV, tout it around and hope people understand what you have written down.’ We need to put a better stamp of approval across the efforts that individual workers make and we need to make sure that individual employers are working in a collaborative way to reward people with those sorts of skills and experiences. This report set out to put forward a number of suggestions for the recognition of people’s competency and the training and experience they have. We also explained what I think is a fundamental failure of the migration occupations in demand list, the MODL, which requires that people have at least three years of postsecondary training in a particular profession for that professional skill or trade to be recognised as worthy of importing to Australia. That is a huge failure when you are looking for front-of-house staff and cannot find them. It is a real problem if you cannot find enough people to make the beds in your hotel rooms. The skills required to make a bed properly, to maintain a room properly and to serve wine and food properly-let alone the high-level standards of maitre d’s in restaurants-are not recognised by the migration occupations in demand list, because the criteria are too restrictive. The committee has honed in on this and said there is something absolutely daft about a skills shortage in certain parts of Australia so pronounced that we are told some hotels in capital cities around this country are shutting down entire floors, saying, ‘Don’t rent a room on floor 14 because we can’t make the bed.’ The Crown Casino in Melbourne preserved two-thirds of its restaurant during Chinese New Year because they did not have enough waitstaff. The committee is saying to think about the cost to the economy of keeping alive this restrictive practice on the migration occupations in demand list. SoI think we have put forward a bit of food for thought. I hope that the government takes our observations seriously. I hope the industry takes it seriously, because there is a bit of challenge in this to the industry-to get organised and to get on with the job. But I still say, as I always said when I was the minister responsible for training in Australia, the message is clear in the tourism sector: the best investment you can make in your business is in your people. If you want to train them and invest in them, you will keep them. If you don’t, you will be short of them. (Time expired) Moreton in debating this House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration report on the tourism sector. I have to say he did make a very significant contribution to this inquiry, particularly in relation to vocational education, much of which was picked up in this report, and I think the industry will be better for it if they actually act on a number of those recommendations. I acknowledged the contribution of my friend earlier today but I did not acknowledge the former chair of this committee, the member for Deakin, who instigated this inquiry. I should mention that the member for Deakin, Mr Barresi, was very committed to this inquiry from the outset. I am sure we mourned his passing as chair as we visited Cairns, the Northern Territory and other places like that, drilling down into this inquiry! MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Committees

These people, quite frankly, have put in a sterling effort on this report. They do a lot, as the member for Moreton indicated, to make us look good. A report like this is as much a reflection of their dedication, professionalism and commitment as it is of the serious way in which all the participating members approached this inquiry. We are very fortunate to have such professional service available to us. As I said in the main chamber, it is something that we should not take for granted; we should certainly acknowledge the support that we do get from that part of the organisation and the people who are always able to give us independent advice whenever we need it. Without dwelling on it, that is certainly something that is significant and something that should be recognised. In this inquiry, one of the things that was challenging the committee was: what is the tourism industry? Largely, the tourism industry is basically whoever considers themselves to be in tourism. Unfortunately, that does not translate in terms of participation in some form of structured industry. I agree with the member for Moreton that one of the things that was quite apparent throughout this inquiry, when people spoke of tourism jobs, was that it was a job that you had before you had a job. That actually flows through into the general mentality or attitude, certainly the attitude to training and retaining staff-and an attitude that prevents the industry taking that next step and going further. I think for the industry it is important that it does view itself as a significant part of our economy. For instance, this industry accounts for something in the order of $17 billion in terms of overseas earnings or annual net income. It contributes about 3.9 per cent to the GDP. These are significant figures. This is not simply a fledging industry. Sure, it is a young industry, but it is also an industry which has its place. It certainly has a significant attraction and value to it and it has tremendous growth opportunity. But, to do that, the industry has got to start investing in itself. Madam Deputy Speaker, you and I, like everybody else, know there is no shortage of lobbyists in this industry. When people want something, they will come and knock at our doors, but they will not do it collectively. They will not look at this as an industry. One of the clearest examples of that was when we started looking at employment in this industry. I understand this, and I take the advice and evidence that was presented. A lot of employers were not of the view of investing in training because the staff may not be there-the employers have a high turnover rate and, if the employers invest, someone else is going to benefit from it. So they are not actually looking collaboratively as an industry at training. They are saying, ‘What’s good for me and my enterprise in my business?’ The trouble is that an industry is no stronger than the weakest link. I know there are cost inputs in this, but I think the member for Moreton is right: we do need to do various things, particularly in relation to recognition of prior learning. If someone moves from one business to another part of the business or to interstate or works in one of the resorts in the ski fields and picks up skills as they go, that should be seen as building up this collective skills base and almost as having a skills passport. But we do not MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Committees

283,Mr Hayes,"On a more serious note, I would also like to join with the chair and comrecognise that, as someone is a ‘new employee’ every time that they start somewhere else. That is something that has to change. The sector of the industry that showed probably the most foresight in this regard was the Australian ski one. They knew that they had a very limited season. They knew that they wanted to attract people back into their sector of the industry in following seasons. They were trying to work collaboratively with each other in what they had to do to attract people back and how they would share staff around. Someone might stay in one resort one year and work at the chalet down the road next year-but it was all about their staying in the industry. That is how the ski sector was starting to see itself. That is what has got to occur with this industry, and we have set out a range of recommendations that look at that. Training should not be seen as an impost on a particular employer but as an investment in the industry. If we are serious about growing this industry, that has really got to occur. For that to occur, one of the things that we need to do is, quite frankly, have the industry focus on itself. I actually wrote, as one of our key recommendations, that we see the establishment of an industry leaders forum to look at these issues over a range as wide as the industry itself. It would not be as to Joe Bloggs’s motel down the road or anything like that. It would be a coming together of all the very small parts. It would be the motels sector, the hotels sector, the chalets sector-all the tourism resort sectors-coming together to work out what they need to do to expand this industry as an industry. As I said, I have actually billed that as one of our key recommendations. This industry has now got to pick up the lead that has been set by this inquiry and follow the recommendations in the report. We call on the federal government to help facilitate the establishment of an industry leaders forum to focus on these issues. I, the member for Moreton and every other participant in this committee believe that, quite frankly, for the tourism experience to be valuable it must in fact involve a lot of the labour force employed by this industry. Therefore, that needs investment if we are going to attract people back-as against the once in a lifetime ‘I won’t stay there again’ syndrome, the ‘Fawlty Towers’ syndromebecause attracting people back to the tourism experience is all about employed people and having those people trained, having those people accredited and having people who can move about in the industry safe in the knowledge that they are building up their skills. They include chefs to some extent. I know that to date all our views about apprenticeship training have been based on time. But for this industry it is probably not sensible to base everything on time, because a lot of it is seasonal and people may still be able to undertake their training whilst they are employed in a particular area. We should make sure that training in this industry is competency based and that the competencies are at least recognised and transportable to every employer that a person goes to. dies of all this is that those in overseas tourist destinations appreciate the training that has been done and the skills that have been developed by a lot of our young people, but we are not doing that when it comes to developing our own tourism industry. I think to some extent it is a matter of maturity. We are now saying it is time to take the next step. It is time to move this industry forward. It is time to develop this industry to its potential. It is time to invest in the development of MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Committees

285,Mr Hayes,"Exactly, and I take the point of the member for Moreton. One of the trageskills and not simply provide a job before someone gets another job. We are now talking about developing careers to make this industry sustainable and to make this industry somewhere people want to work for a lifetime and get their passport to work all around this country in first-class facilities. The young people of this nation are entitled to be proud. They are certainly entitled to receive the training that is going to accredit them for full participation throughout their working life, hopefully in this industry. We have to now bite the bullet and realise that this is an industry worth working in and it is an industry worth having a career in-this is something the committee is unanimous on. (Time expired) Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation on the tourism sector is very timely, and it comes at a significant time of expansion in the Australian economy, which is seeing pressure placed on many industries, particularly with respect to the availability and ability of skilled workers to take up positions in communities across the country. As a nation, the economy has grown some 40 per cent over the last 10 years. The growth in Western Australia is predicted to continue for some years to come. Therefore, it is possible that the workforce challenges facing Australian tourism-and, more particularly, the Western Australian tourism industry-are likely to continue without some recognition of this report and its 25 recommendations, which are dealt with under the headings of employment in Australia’s tourism industry, addressing labour shortages and skills demand, recruitment and retention, investing in business, and training and taxation incentives. Like many other industries, the tourism sector faces global competition for skilled employees. However, many available workers do not have the skills required to effectively carry out the work without additional training. As a committee we heard that the industry has a culture of turnover, which very much limits opportunities for training whilst supporting the seasonal flow of workers. Recommendation 3 goes to the thrust of this and suggests that industry in partnership with government look at developing a seasonal workforce plan to build community and industry cooperation, which would go a long way towards addressing the ebbs and flows created by the seasonal work pattern. Restaurants, cafes and hotels have traditionally been great employment opportunities for part-time students or travellers wishing to supplement their income. Whilst previously the table and counter staff could be unskilled, as they had the support of the permanent skilled staff, employers are now finding the solutions to the problems much more difficult. In the past any shortcomings were covered by the skilled staff. It is increasingly harder for businesses to attract and maintain skilled staff. The training that is provided to staff is not retained because of this mobility of the workforce. They are frequently being poached for other higher paying positions within the tourism industry and other industries that are looking for people with ability. Many skilled staff are poached from the tourism sector while at the same time possible new entrants are finding employment in more highly paid industries such as in the resource sector. This is having a significant impact on businesses in the tourism sector trying to find suitable staff to fill vacancies. The name of the report, Current vacancies, is well chosen, as currently, across the nation, chefs, service staff, kitchen staff and supervisors are in big demand. The Restaurant and Catering Association of Australia estimates that there are currently some 8,000 vacancies Australia wide.

286,Mr Henry (Hasluck) (5.35 Pm),"This report of the House of Representatives Standingers, providing lucrative employment options, which has seen a migration of workers from their chosen career into these better-paying opportunities. In my electorate of Hasluck we have the Swan Valley, which is well known for its winemaking and grape growing over many years. Over the past 20 years the Swan Valley has changed remarkably. We should all take the opportunity to visit there when in Perth. It is not very far from the CBD. Mr Hardgrave interjectingyou would have been lucky to pass a cafe. You may have been able to drop in to a couple of wine cellars for a drop of wine tasting or see sultanas drying in the drying sheds. I think there were only a couple of restaurants in the area at that time. These days there are many good restaurants, cafes, wine cellars, boutique brewery operations, chocolate factories and cheese factories dotted throughout the valley. Indeed, Spring in the Valley is a great festival and is held at a wonderful time of year to celebrate the development of the tourism sector in Western Australia. Some 50,000 visitors visit boutique breweries and enjoy fine food, wine and music, as well as the arts and crafts on offer. Indeed, it is very pleasing to be able to make this speech today while the Mayor of the City of Swan, Charlie Gregorini, the Deputy Mayor, Mel Congerton, and Chief Executive, Mike Foley, are visiting Parliament House in Canberra. The Swan Valley boasts some extraordinary restaurants and wineries, such as Sandalford Wines, with its annual program of bringing music to the valley, as well as the Riverbank Estate Winery, which I had the pleasure of visiting only recently. It is not just in the electorate of Hasluck that the impact of the skills shortage is being felt. As the report indicates, it is being felt right across Australia. There is a need to address it, and many of the recommendations in the report go a long way towards doing that and ensuring that we develop a much more professional tourism sector than we may have had in the past. Tourism helps define who we are. It enhances our Australian nature, our natural environment, our cultural diversity and our ecotourism. It puts genuine Aussie ingenuity on display for not just our neighbours but travellers from around the world. Along with other programs and campaigns that we have developed, we want to look our best and be at our best so as to encourage by word of mouth return visits. In 2006, there were 635,000 international visitors and six million-a huge figure-domestic visitors to Western Australia, with a combined expenditure of some $4 billion. The tourism dollar has been steadily growing, apart from a slight drop in the early 2000s. It is well known that the hospitality industry is experiencing a very difficult time in filling vacancies. I have been able to assist some constituents-restaurateurs and people running hospitality venues-in my own electorate of Hasluck with advice on 457 visas and other options to help ease this labour problem. This report makes a number of very worthwhile recommendations, such as data collection and analysis to provide for comprehensive workforce planning. Recommendation 11 details the visa extension of up to two years for overseas tourism and hospitality students who comply with education and training conditions. This would be a sensible and an attractive option to assist in alleviating the current shortfall in some of these fields. MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Committees
287,Mr Henry,"It is fantastic. When driving along the length of West Swan Road years ago,I agree with the member for Werriwa, who just spoke on the report, about recommendation 12, which recommends the establishment of an industry leaders forum to promote career choices and opportunities in the industry. As a result of a review carried out in 2005-06 of the separate training packages for those in the hospitality and tourism industries, it was recommended that those packages be combined into one package. A new package was then developed with extensive industry consultation. It has been formally endorsed by the industry but has not been unanimously endorsed by the states and territories. I urge those states and territories to endorse it so that we can overcome some of these difficulties and ensure that some of the recommendations of this report with respect to vocational training and education in the tourism and hospitality area can be implemented. All the recommendations are sensible and should be implemented to address the skills shortage. I look forward to that occurring. With some 22,700 people commencing Australian apprenticeships in tourism in the 12 months to March 2006, a range of measures have already been put in place to make apprenticeship systems more accessible, including more flexibility for the delivery of on-the-job training components and incentives for employers who offer employment related training, including mid-career apprenticeships and higher technical skills announced by the Prime Minister in the Skills for the Future package. We have a lot to do, but quite clearly this report addresses a number of critical issues in the tourism industry. I believe that, if the recommendations in the report entitled Current vacancies were implemented, they would go a long way towards addressing that outcome. I commend the report. shadow minister for transport, roads and tourism to speak in the Main Committee on what I regard as an important report, entitled Current vacancies: workforce challenges facing the Australian tourism sector. I thought it would also have been appropriate if the Minister for Small Business and Tourism had found time to attend the Main Committee to compliment the committee on an exceptionally good job. It is a much-needed report. I know she is a very busy woman, planning her next overseas trip. As we all appreciate, the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, with the assistance of the secretariat, is exceptionally important to the tourism industry. A huge amount of work has been undertaken by the committee and the secretariat in pulling together all of the evidence and the associated material received by the committee over an extended period. On behalf of the opposition, I can simply say that we welcome the report, and we will be having considerable regard for its recommendations. I say that because I think it is fair to say that the time honoured image of Australia’s tourism sector as a fun-loving, easygoing industry to work in, with parties at every turn, has been hardened in recent years. There is a huge challenge confronting the industry. Much like the industry itself, the tourism market force has undergone significant change that adapts to radically changing global trends both within and outside the tourism industry. Labour shortages have emerged as a key factor affecting the future growth and viability of Australia as skilled workers become a rare resource. Australia’s $81 billion tourism industry is not immune to this trend. If anything, it has felt the effects more acutely. It is a people focused industry with high service standards and requirements and consequently demanding labour MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Committees
288,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (5.44 Pm),"I welcome the opportunity as therequirements. Yet, unfortunately, as a sector it is struggling to maintain competitiveness with other sectors which have the capacity to offer higher wages and better conditions, such as the provision of housing in the resources sector. Bus tour drivers who have a heavy vehicle licence are being lured over to the mining sector where, without any need to upskill, they are offered three times the wage they earn in tourism. The same goes for young people starting out in life. Why not work in the mines on a fly in, fly out basis and earn at least twice as much as they can in hospitality, without having to deal with the poor image associated with the tourism sector? That is also a key issue addressed by this report. Unfortunately, while tourism from a tourism perspective is an industry defined by new and enjoyable experiences, relaxing holidays by the beach or exciting adventure tours, it is characterised in a less than glamorous way for the actual workers in the tourism businesses. As the committee found, the reputation of the tourism industry is that it is an industry of hard work, bad conditions and relatively low pay. This is a point not disputed by the operators, employer representatives or employee representatives who gave extensive evidence during the work of the committee. I might say that it is a trend that has been exacerbated by the Work Choices legislation, as admitted in evidence by the hotels and motels association, an employer organisation. The organisation indicated to the committee that there were regular breaches of employment law and nonadherence to award conditions, unfortunately, in parts of the industry. I say this is a shame because there are a lot of good tourism businesses out there seeking to do the right thing by their workforce and the industry at large, many of them small to medium sized operators, who believe in the work of the sector and want to realise its potential by pulling together. This report appropriately outlines that there is a role for everyone to play in helping the industry to address the serious issues, and the tourism business operators and industry as a whole are no exception. I do not think we need to suggest that operators and the industry as a whole do not know the requirements that are ahead of them. You do not need to have a master’s degree in marketing and brand development to know that the tourism industry has a serious image problem when it comes to employment options for our young people. There is a widespread perception in the Australian community that employment in the tourism sector is not the start of a career path, but rather it is the job that you have as you pass through to where you want to end up with a career option-short-term employment to earn a few dollars on the way through. This disappointing fact is reflected in the high turnover rates of staff within the hotel industry, which is an additional cost to industry. The Sustainable Tourism CRC noted in its submission to the committee that turnover rates were between 39 and 84 per cent, depending on the level of the role. The CRC also found that the main reason for the employers’ turnover were low pay, poor working hours and the need to search for better career opportunities. It is a disappointing fact, because the tourism industry is an industry where you can work your way up through a career path if you are prepared to stick to it. It can be a very rewarding career path and it can fulfil all the requirements of meaningful and stimulating work. The industry therefore needs to get out there as a matter of urgency and celebrate its success with stories about its success. While the sector is made up primarily of small to medium sized businesses, they are businesses that all face the same challenges yet are driven by the same goals of increasing not only numbers on the ground but tourism yield while maintaining MAIN COMMITTEE a high product and quality product standard. This provides the sector with a unique opportunity to come together and for a collaborative approach to training and skilling to ensure the future viability of the industry. Unfortunately, the industry currently lacks coordination in several key areas-an issue that was brought to the fore through the committee’s work, which noted that opportunities in training were being missed. These opportunities include looking beyond just young people as the traditional pool of workers. There are vast opportunities to be seized in encouraging more mature age workers in tourism, particularly those already travelling that are commonly known as the grey-haired nomads. Opportunities also abound in employment of Indigenous Australians, and this comes with the double benefit of realising the massive growth potential of Indigenous tourism in Australia. I, therefore, wholeheartedly support the recommendation of the committee to support the identification of barriers to the employment of older workers and an inquiry into the opportunities for Indigenous tourism growth and associated employment and, more importantly, training opportunities. It is one of the many common-sense recommendations to arise from the report. Another is recommendation 11, which would enable overseas tourism and hospitality students to extend their visas by up to two years once they have successfully completed their tertiary courses. They must be courses of some standing and significance and they must have undertaken an appropriate level of work placement as part of their course completion and training program. However, while I fully support this initiative, I do have some reservations about offering the option of moving into the permanent migration scheme after the completion of two years continuous employment. Those reservations relate to a pilot trial to fill vacancies in the hairdressing field. On all available evidence, this is a trial that is not working. The trends today see participants move out of the area of demand, in hairdressing, once their permanent residency status has been approved. We want people who actually take up these opportunities to give a commitment to long-term employment in the tourism sector, especially in rural, remote and regional Australia, and not to use it as an easy entry point to Australia for short-term visas and appropriate long-term migration opportunities. I do not believe that this option will therefore solve the industry’s labour requirements. The industry has to refocus and re-engage the Australian workforce and, in doing so, improve its retention rates, better train its workers and overcome some of the turnover costs associated with the industry. Having said that, can I say that the report includes many common-sense recommendations, including a better plan for the future of the industry, better research and willingness by all in the industry-all levels of government, the private sector employees and their unions-to actively work together to overcome the challenges identified in the report. In the meantime, as an interim measure, I implore everyone in Australia, including businesses, to better manage their workforce and to encourage the Australian workforce to have a holiday and reduce the huge liability that currently exists in business for accumulated annual leave and long service leave. This can do an exceptionally big favour to the tourism industry, because we are very sluggish on the domestic tourism front.

Not least of all of the challenges that it needs to confront and overcome is the current skills shortages-indeed, just basic labour shortages. We understand the difficulties that the tourism sector has to tackle on a day-to-day basis. We were able to meet with many businesses whose core business is tourism and hospitality, and they raised many concerns about the difficulty of attracting labour to their businesses. There were businesses, particularly in remote areas-very important tourist precincts, but quite often areas remote from capital cities-that were having difficulties attracting the necessary labour. It was not always about skilled labour; it was about just having the hands-on experience, the capacity to lend a hand in the peaks of the tourist period. So committee members in inquiring into this matter-an inquiry that we were asked to do by the minister for tourism-sought to look at some practical measures that could mitigate the adverse effects of labour and skills shortages in the industry and recommend them directly to the executive government for it to consider and hopefully incorporate into its policies. A number of the recommendations looked at ways in which we could change current law in a way that would enable certain people to work for longer periods. For example, people on particular visas might be able to extend those visas if they work in remote areas, so that businesses in remote areas of the country would be able to attract sufficient staff to ensure their businesses were prosperous. As the member for Batman indicated, we were also concerned about increasing the participation of older workers in the sector. I guess there we are talking about domestic workers-that is, the Australian residents who should be able to supply the shortfalls in labour demand in these critical areas. Of course, there were also concerns raised-and this is where the members differed somewhat-over whether Work Choices legislation was a benefit or not to the industry. We did have some alarming evidence in the transcript that pointed to behaviour which I do not think anyone would condone. Indeed, the representative from one of the employer bodies-the Hotel, Motel and Accommodation Association-indicated that there were many employers in the hospitality industry that were in breach of laws prior to Work Choices but who, because of Work Choices, were no longer in breach of the law. It was put to that witness, ‘What you are saying is that there were people who broke the law and, because of Work Choices, they still do the same thing but they do not break the law?’ and he answered yes. That was a concern, certainly to Labor members of the committee. We did not think the government should be assisting businesses to find ways to drive down wages and conditions by allowing something that was unlawful yesterday to be lawful today. I am not suggesting that all government members would think that was the best thing to do, but clearly this was a representative of an employer body who thought he could now do that. And it seemed he was advising members of that body to do exactly that. Leaving Work Choices, and the industrial relations law generally, out of the equation, the members of the committee focused most of their energies on looking for ways to mitigate the shortages that exist. I think that the committee members participated very constructively and consensually, particularly in looking to find unanimous recommendations to put to the executive government. I appreciate the efforts of the former chair, the member for Deakin, who has MAIN COMMITTEE an interest in the area but has an interest in training as well. Of course, the member for Moreton took over his role halfway through the inquiry, and we worked well there. I would like to put on the record our appreciation for the secretariat. They did a magnificent job. The secretariat not only collated the information, the primary sources and the secondary sources, and brought together the evidence but also were heavily involved in drafting reports for us to look at, examine and then consider whether we would amend or accept. I think through their good efforts we have come up with a report that focuses on common-sense recommendations that will be useful for the tourism and hospitality sector in addressing the problems that it currently confronts. I also add that the member for Werriwa, who took over as the deputy chair, along with the chair played a very proactive role in ensuring that the report was ready and is of sufficient quality for the executive government to consider. Now that the report has been tabled, it can be considered by all members including the executive government. Debate (on motion by Dr Washer) adjourned.

306,Mr Mcmullan (Fraser) (6.08 Pm),"With respect, this is the most nonsensical and leastposed expenditure. It is true that it does not need to be a table tennis match backwards and forwards, but when there is a series of questions on a similar matterasking for a point of order. for example, when I do get up to speak to the portfolio, it will be nothing to do with these matters. Mr Anthony Smith-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is precisely our point. I do not know what the member for Fraser is going to raise-that is why I proposed, given the choice, that it would be sensible to address all of the issues raised in one section at the end. That is whyber for Fraser if he has further questions. tion in detail arrangements are being handled. I have never heard or seen a set of arrangements so designed to prevent people getting information rather than to facilitate them. It is true that the parliamentary secretary should be entitled to expect members to say, ‘I have concluded all the questions I have on that particular section,’ and then expect the parliamentary secretary to respond. I realise the standing orders cannot force him to respond, but it is the only sensible, reasonable and normal thing to do-for example, I have some questions to raise about COAG. Why you would want to answer COAG questions in the middle of questions about Kirribilli I cannot imagine. So it is perfectly reasonable for the parliamentary secretary to say at the end of five minutes, ‘Is that the end of all the questions in that area?’ and if not for the person to go on until they are concluded. It is totally unreasonable to say, ‘Go for 40 minutes and then I will tell you what I am going to say about Kirribilli, about COAG’-about any other matter that someone might come along and raise. So let us try and get the procedure a little more cooperative, get all the questions in one particular section and then get such responses as we have and then go on to the next section, and I think we might do a bit better. secretary has answered that point. Are there further questions, from any member, of the parliamentary secretary? tribution is distinctly unhelpful. But you are entitled to be as unhelpful as you choose.

315,Mr Mcmullan,"I will ask some questions now; thank you.Treasury or Finance or PM&C because they overlap, but we do not want to do it three times so, with respect to the parliamentary secretary, I will raise them here because they do relate to the responsibility of Prime Minister and Cabinet with regard to federal-state relationsfederal-state relations more broadly and to some extent COAG in particular. I want to try and get from the department and the parliamentary secretary some sort of understanding of what action the government has taken with regard to the several independent reports that have come forward identifying the massive waste of taxpayers’ dollars involved in unnecessary duplication of administration and particularly in relation to the manner in which specific purpose payments are managed and the duplication that is envisaged. Not all of the assessments provide figures. The one that does is the report by Access Economics commissioned by the Business Council of Australia, which says in its report that the cost to the federal government of administering grants to the states-that is specific purpose payments over and above the costs of either the states or the federal government directly funding and running the programs themselves-is $861 million, and overlap and duplication in areas where both the states and the federal government are operating at the same time is $913 million. And there is also an analysis of cost shifting from the states to the Commonwealth and vice versa. Then there are some other numbers which lead to the BCA Access Economics $9 billion figure for economic costs. I do not want to refer to the $9 billion figure, firstly, because it does not all relate to costs to government-some of it is just costs to the economy-and, secondly, because I am not sure that I agree with all the analysis. But it is a very powerful estimate. Even if we say it is double, that Access Economics has doubled the actual number, the overlap and duplication cost is $860 million. Let us say it is only $400 million and the second area of overlap and duplication is $900 million. Let us say it is only $450 million-that they once again got it totally wrong-we are talking about cost to the taxpayers of about $1 billion. There is no sign of any action by the government to save any of that money. The state heads of treasury have got together and looked at the way in which specific purpose payments are administered. They have said there are problems with specific purpose payments-lack of flexibility and efficiency incentives, duplication of roles and responsibility, costs of compliance and administration-and we have seen examples raised by Allen Consulting of specific purpose payments that cost more to administer than the value of the grant. They have had lack of consultation and blurred accountability. Then we had the report of Allen Consulting into, amongst other things, specific purpose payment arrangements. They raised a whole series of problems about the inefficiencies generated by excessive attention in specific purpose payments for control of inputs instead of control of outcomes, which is hard to define-outputs at least. We get excessive regulation and detail at a massive cost to the taxpayers at both levels-and they are the same taxpayers-and to the economy as assessed by Access Economics. I wonder whether the department and the two associated departments engaged in this-but I will ask it in the context of PM&C-have focused any attention on this and whether they have done anything to seek to save this money.

317,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bk Bishop),"Parliamentary Secretary, do you wish topm)-Madam Deputy Speaker, you know that I am well-known for cooperation. Given the fact that we have had two contributions, that there will be a third and that the time allotted for the debate is about another half an hour, I will take the opportunity to respond to the first two sets of questions now that I have heard them and then we can move on from there. The member for Fraser, who has just completed his remarks, referred to a number of reports and a number of claims in the reports. He mentioned Access Economics and Allen Consulting. The Leader of the Opposition is on the public record on the Jon Faine program in Melbourne. He said that he thought there could be major savings in the health portfolio, an interesting claim to make and one that this side of the House notes very carefully. I am not aware of any material that this department could provide. I will not waste the time of the Maim Committee other than to say that I will take all of his remarks on notice and to the extent that I can answer them on notice, I will do so. With respect to the member for Grayndler’s long series of questions which have been read into the Hansard, can I again say I will certainly take those on notice and to the extent that I can provide any information, I will. I have no material that would enable me to add to what the Prime Minister has said in the House. I refer the member for Grayndler to a number of points the Prime Minister made in the House about the costings, the advice and the sequence of that. As I said, I will happily take his very specific questions on notice and to the extent that I am able to provide an answer, I will. I point out to the member for Grayndler that it is interesting that he is raising these questions in this debate when he did not raise them in the House today. I also make the point that, when the member for Grayndler and those opposite spoke about these issues, they merely confirmed to the Australian people their complete inability to make policy in key areas that are of vital importance to the Australian people. The member for Grayndler will also know from following debate in the House of Representatives that the issue of Kirribilli was well highlighted by a number of government ministers, the Prime Minister included, particularly with respect to its use by former Prime Minister Hawke and former minister Graham Richardson. He would note that passages were quoted from a book by Marian Wilkinson entitled The Fixer: The untold biography of Graham Richardson-unless I stand corrected. The member for Grayndler listened to those quotations which confirmed that, unlike the function the Prime Minister hosted which was not a fundraiser, the fundraising at Kirribilli occurred solely under Prime Minister Hawke and that the figures that were expected-if I remember the quotes from Marian Wilkinson’s book The Fixer-were $10,000, $20,000 or up to $100,000. The House should note that the member for Grayndler has not, to my knowledge, said one thing about his view on that matter. Have you criticised former Prime Minister Hawke or former Minister Richardson? No. There is silence. That absolutely highlights the complete hypocrisy of the member for Grayndler and of those opposite when they talk on this issue. gagement from the parliamentary secretary. However, we have had no defence with regard to the facts around the 1 June fundraiser held by the Liberal Party at Kirribilli. It is interesting that, in his defence of the Prime Minister, the parliamentary secretary has again asserted that MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Deputy Chair Are You Reflecting On The Chair Member For Fraser Deputy Chair Are You Reflecting On The Chair That Would Not Be Advisable Deputy Chair Good

319,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (6.20 Pm),"I am pleased that we have at least had some enthis was not a fundraiser even though the Prime Minister said at his press conference last Thursday that it was. Indeed, the business observer registration form for that function indicates that, for the payment of $8,250, the only functions that cannot be bought into-that is, through additional tickets open to people who do not pay the full amount-are morning tea with chiefs of staff, the Senate afternoon tea and of course the Prime Minister’s welcome reception at Kirribilli. With all due respect to our good Senate colleagues and the chiefs of staff, the big attraction is pretty clear. If you add up the cost of the additional tickets that are available for each of the other functions, even if you went to two at one time, you would pay a total of $1,300. So an additional $6,950 can be seen as being paid for that Kirribilli function alone. I also note that it is argued that people were somehow there at the invitation of the Prime Minister. However, the registration form makes it very clear that forms had to be returned with payment to the federal council’s secretariat by Monday, 30 May 2007 and that all cheques had to be payable to the Liberal Party of Australia. That is the key problem herethat you have a function at Kirribilli House that is open to anyone who can afford the $8,250 fee. We were told that some $5,186.78 was returned-that is, for food, $2,128.50; beverages, $1,476.52; casual staff, $829.57; and hire charges, $752.19. That was stated in the parliament on Tuesday, 12 June. It is interesting that last Thursday the Prime Minister stated that additional money had been paid back by the Liberal Party, for security. In the letter to the Leader of the Opposition on 14 June, the Prime Minister stated, ‘$5,186.69, and an additional amount only advised to my office today of $312.45, that being for security.’ My question is: at what time was that additional $312.45 paid for security, was it only last week and, going to the other functions that have been held, when were the payments made for the 1999, 2002 and 2005 functions? pm)-CanI first address the long preamble or the remarks of the member for Grayndler before the question. I point out that, in his latest and last contribution, he again illustrates and highlights his utter hypocrisy on this issue and the Labor Party’s hypocrisy on this issue. He cannot bring himself to mention the names Bob Hawke and Graham Richardson and the fundraisers that are detailed in Marian Wilkinson’s book The Fixer. He greets this with complete silence as if he has never heard of former Prime Minister Hawke or former Minister Richardson from his own state. My understanding is that the member for Grayndler should have no difficulty criticising former Minister Richardson. But let me just point out again his complete inability to criticise, even in the mildest sense, what can only be regarded as an outrageous misuse by that former Labor minister and the former Labor Prime Minister. Let us recall the details in that book, which were relayed to the House last week, of $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, maybe even $100,000 back in 1987. What would those dollars be worth today, 20 years on? They would be worth significantly more. I neglected to mention the other feature I recall from that revelation last week in the House of Representatives that, specifically, those guests invited to that dinner were asked not to provide the cheques to the Australian Labor Party until after the election-I will stand to be corrected, but I think the book also said this-thereby ensuring that some disclosure provisions could be circumvented. I think that is what the book said. At that time, I am not sure who the MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Deputy Chair Are You Reflecting On The Chair Member For Fraser Deputy Chair Are You Reflecting On The Chair That Would Not Be Advisable Deputy Chair Good

Is that right? The election was in July. So we have a situation of great hypocrisy here. paign director. This money was raised. It is not in dispute. But the member for Grayndler cannot even bring himself to mildly criticise let alone mention this. We now know, through confirmation from the other side, that the member for Fraser was spending the money that was being raised, at the very least. I think that, when he interjected, he said that the money would not have come to the national head office of the Labor Party. That raises all sorts of other questions, doesn’t it? I tell you one thing, Member for Fraser: in 1987 I was 20 and in 1987 the member for Grayndler would have been about 30-or am I being cruel? in the adjournment debate he could mention that. In regard to specific questions on the cost of security for this function and for previous functions, I do not have any information I could provide. You have put those questions into the Hansard. I am not sure whether you have asked them on notice. Whether you have asked them on notice or not, I am happy to take them on notice; and any information that can be provided in the normal way will be provided. Minister just last week when he said, last Thursday, that Liberal Party functions were not held at Kirribilli House or at the Lodge. I refer to revelations on the weekend that, indeed, the Prime Minister hosted a function for the federal executive of the Young Liberal Movement of Australia on 18 October last year. Why did the taxpayer pick up the bill for this function? How does it differ from the 1 June fundraising event at Kirribilli where $5,100-now $5,400-was repaid by the Liberal Party? What was the cost to taxpayers of this event? How many Young Liberals were in attendance at this function? When did the Prime Minister seek advice on who should pay for the function? Was advice sought prior to the 18 October function, or was it sought last week, perhaps even on Saturday, as a result of inquiries which were made? How many other Liberal Party functions have been held at the Lodge and Kirribilli House for which taxpayers have paid the bill? Could the parliamentary secretary table the details of each of these functions, what they cost the taxpayers, who was in attendance and any advice which suggested that it was appropriate that taxpayers pay the bill? I also refer to the Prime Minister’s A guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility of December 1998, which states: Ministers are provided with facilities at public expense in order that public business may be conducted effectively. Their use of these facilities should be in accordance with this principle. It should not be wasteful or extravagant. As a general rule, official facilities should be used for official purposes. What was the official purpose of the Young Liberals function? What was the official purpose of the four Liberal federal council fundraising events that were held at Kirribilli House and the Lodge? A further question is in respect of legal advice with regard to the clear breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act that has occurred as a result of these fundraisers being held at Kirribilli and the Lodge: has the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet had any MAIN COMMITTEE",182,Deputy Chair Are You Reflecting On The Chair Member For Fraser Deputy Chair Are You Reflecting On The Chair That Would Not Be Advisable Deputy Chair Good

325,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (6.29 Pm),"My questions go to the statements of the Primerole in considering the legal advice in respect of the use of Kirribilli and the Lodge? Also, has the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet had any contact with the Australian Electoral Commission over this matter and, if so, what has that contact consisted of? pm)-Again there is a whole series of questions there. Let me deal with some of the last questions first. On the issue of legal advice with respect to electoral donations, which I think was the import of the member for Grayndler’s question, he stated that there was legal advice of a clear breach. That is not correct. There was legal advice, as is my understanding from watching news reports last Thursday evening and reading press reports on Friday, obtained by the Australian Electoral Commission. tained legal advice and the AEC had determined its position. When the member for Grayndler says that in his view there is clear advice I think he is referring to the advice obtained either by himself or by the opposition. That is my understanding. I know that those opposite have sought advice. I saw advice littered through the papers on Saturday from one person whose name I recognise: Anthony Lang. Unless he is someone with the same name as a very well known and long standing member of the Labor Party, then it is the same Tony Lang from Melbourne. The point I am making is that I am sure those opposite will get legal advice, but the Australian Electoral Commission-an independent agency-has determined its position on this matter. With respect to your specific questions about any contact the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet may have had, I am not aware of any. Obviously if I have anything to add to that, I will let you know. With respect to your other request to table details of who, when, where, how and at what time, it will not surprise you that I do not have anything to table. I am not aware of any of the details of the matters you raise or request. As to your generic questions about the news stories in the weekend papers about members of the Young Liberal Movement having dinner at the Lodge, I simply point out to you that, naturally, when a Prime Minister occupies the Lodge-as Mr Keating, Mr Hawke and all of those before them did-they are entitled to have people visit and attend. If the member for Grayndler was being at all level headed and sensible he would recognise that point. As to his very specific questions, I am not aware of any of the detail. To the extent that I am able to provide him with detailed answers, I will do so in the normal way. I will treat them as questions on notice and any replies that are forthcoming will be provided in the normal way. mentary Secretary to the Prime Minister that the opposition has no disagreement with the idea that the Prime Minister is entitled to have people visit and attend the prime ministerial residences. We do take issue with the fact that there are two residences-unlike what other Prime Ministers have seen fit to do-at extraordinary cost to the taxpayer. We have a problem with the undermining of the very principles of disclosure in the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the use of the national estate for fundraising purposes by the Liberal Party. That clearly is what has occurred with these events. With the 2005 and 2007 invitations, the program outlined four business observers.

329,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (6.38 Pm),"On behalf of the opposition I say to the Parliaamount to attend the fundraising function at the Lodge. In 2007 it is $8,250 at Kirribilli House. It is clear that, unless there is payment made for the hire of the venue, the concern is that having such a fundraiser at Kirribilli House saves the Liberal Party money-compared to if they had to hire a private venue-and therefore increases the amount of money made from that fundraising activity. The reason that disclosure of gifts is there is to stop people donating and not disclosing through the normal processes. It is quite clear that the figures, which go to $9 a head for food and some $6 a head for drinks, for the Kirribilli House fundraising function-which has become known as the cash-for-canapes affair-are simply totally inadequate. Anyone who knows anything about Sydney prices knows that. The Prime Minister was given the example in the parliament of the restaurant Guillaume at Bennelong, just across the harbour. The starting price there is $60 per head, and that excludes alcohol and venue hire. The concern here, as I think Australians know, is that to get food and drinks for that price they would have had to have caught the fish out of the harbour themselves-and perhaps hopped the fence and shucked a few oysters themselves. That simply is not the case. That is why we are asking for the real costs of that event. We reiterate that to the parliamentary secretary. I am surprised that he has not had a single answer prepared on any of this-this has been a prominent issue for nine days now and yet the representative of the Prime Minister, before this session of the Main Committee, has not been able to provide a single figure. SoI ask again: what were the real costs of the 1 June cash-for-canapes function held at Kirribilli House to raise funds for the Liberal Party? pm)-I am happy to receive exactly the same questions from the member for Grayndler five minutes or so after he last asked them and I am happy to give him the same answer. I will take the opportunity though to correct a couple of other statements he made. I think he indicated earlier that the Australian Electoral Commission had not received legal advice. I will read from the statement released by the AEC last Thursday. It says, ‘Legal advice provided to the AEC.’ So clearlybeen provided by the Solicitor-General-instead of legal advice provided by Labor lawyers; is that your point? Grayndler is seeking to do. These issues were so serious to him that he did not ask a single question in question time. He was told by his tactics groupMr Albanese interjectinghas addressed all of these issues in great detail. I will finish where I started on this. The more the member for Grayndler talks, the more he confirms that those opposite have no serious policy plans for the Australian public.

335,Mr Anthony Smith,"that he would have to take it all up here. The Prime Ministerute of every day researching various menus for various catering facilities. But the issues he raised have been answered. He cannot hide his complete hypocrisy on this issue-his failure to mention former minister Graham Richardson, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and their outrageous fundraising and attempt to avoid disclosure at that time, with hundreds of thousands of dollars. As we have discovered tonight, the member for Fraser was the campaign director of the Labor Party at that time. It simply does not wash. The member for Fraser has asked a whole host of questions. Many of those questions have been asked and fully answered in the House. To the extent that any new information can be provided, it will be provided-and he knows that. This whole issue speaks for itself. I am sure he will have further questions. I thought he would have raised them today in the parliament or at his morning doorstop interview, but of course he did not. He has asked all of his questions and, to the extent that any information can be provided, it will be provided. ments made by the member for Moore, who is here in the chamber. I think that if any illegalities have been created then they should be investigated. That has certainly been the concern of the Labor Party-that there has been a breach of the Australian electoral law. I refer also to the comments by Mr Bodel, the Australian Electoral Commission official in charge of funding and disclosure, who made it clear that he believed there was a case worthy of an investigation on whether there had been a failure to disclose. Later on, he was reported as saying that he had basically been told to shut up on this issue. Can the parliamentary secretary assure the parliament that the Prime Minister’s office or any other minister’s office has not been involved in the attempted intimidation of the AEC? We note that, between the Prime Minister giving his press conference just prior to two o’clock last Thursday and the 6 pm news, the AEC released a statement saying that they had received advice-which of course had been foreshadowed by the Prime Minister in his press conference-and that that advice was from the Solicitor-General. Will the Prime Minister’s office ensure that there is no intimidation of the AEC or its officers over this issue and allow for the proper consideration of the independent legal advice which has been provided to the AEC? pm)-The member for Grayndler’s questions could be easily answered if he would just take the trouble to read the statement from the AEC on the morning of 14 June, in which the AEC announced that it was examining any potential disclosure obligations under the Electoral Act in relation to a function hosted by the Prime Minister and noted suggestions that the government may have attempted to silence or constrain the AEC in its responses to the media on the issue. The statement says: “The AEC takes its integrity and independence very seriously and I want to make it quite clear that no attempt was made by the Government or anybody else to influence the AEC in its response to this issue,” Electoral Commissioner, Mr Ian Campbell said. The member for Grayndler asked the question, but he is obviously not interested in the answer. Obviously, he has not read the press release. It continues: “Contrary to some media reports, the AEC Director of Funding and Disclosure, Mr Kevin Bodel was not asked by the AEC or the Government to “shut up” regarding these matters.” MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Deputy Chair Are You Reflecting On The Chair Member For Fraser Deputy Chair Are You Reflecting On The Chair That Would Not Be Advisable Deputy Chair Good

Attorney-General’s Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $3,724,746,000 Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (6.50 pm)-Thank you to the member for Brisbane for indulging me in this section. My question is to the Attorney, regarding a very welcome $200,000 in the budget for a feasibility study for a new Family Court in Newcastle. My question is: Attorney-General, given the discussions you have had on numerous occasions with the legal fraternity and the Family Court registry staff in Newcastle, what impact will this further study have on bringing about a new Family Court facility in Newcastle and on attaining a Federal Court in Newcastle? briefings on the issue but, as I understand it, we make a commitment in budgets for specific proposals which are a known quantity. I know that needs have been identified by the local profession and have been mentioned to me by the Family Court and the Chief Federal Magistrate. There are issues about accommodation in the context of the adequacy of the present accommodation and the term of the present commitments. This is about ensuring that there is resourcing to make the further judgements as to what is required and about ensuring a proper recognition of the court’s needs. When an appropriate proposal is developed, I am sure it will be something that the government will want to support. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (6.52 pm)-My second question is: Attorney, given your powers in terms of appointing the federal magistracy, was there an allocation in the budget for any performance review of how the federal magistracy are delivering services in federal courts, their suitability and the way they are taking on some of the complexities of their new roles? If so, what methodology and processes are in place? this answer. We have a Constitution here in Australia and there is a doctrine of the separation of powers. I have sometimes wanted to look at the performance of a number of our courts, and I have wanted to help the parliament to obtain information about performance so that some objective measurements could be made. I am told that there may be some willingness to look at some of those issues in a generic form, but they are matters about which the courts have a very strong view. SoI would have to say that there are no specific proposals for the sort of monitoring that the honourable member suggests is possible. But what I can say is that, if you want to use some anecdotal evidence, the Magistrates Court has been extraordinarily successful. There has been an enormous shift in the matters that are being dealt with in family law generally from the Family Court to the magistracy. There is some data published about the extent to which requests are made in particular jurisdictions for matters to be transferred from one list to another.

341,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Attorney-General) (6.53 pm)-Others might be interested inBrisbane is in the chamber, and he may want to speak later. I saw some figures for the Brisbane court which demonstrated that the requests to the magistracy ran into many hundreds. The requests to go back to the Family Court were about a quarter or even less than that on the information that I had seen. I get anecdotal information as well from practitioners about how the federal magistracy is performing with very high levels of productivity. When you have the profession in some areas speaking with their feet, it suggests that it is doing very well. A further point is that these comments should not be seen as a reflection on the Family Court, which, in our expectations, is expected to deal with the more complex and more difficult issues. One would expect that the workload of the matters that are more complex and more difficult might demand more time and certainly greater deliberation than less complex matters. The only other point I would make is that in Newcastle, as you would be aware, a person who had been a magistrate was seen fit to be promoted to be a judge in the Family Court there. I understand that she has been very highly regarded, both as a magistrate and now as a Family Court judge. I might say that she is not alone. There are a number of others who were similarly able to be successful magistrates and whose qualities were later recognised in an appointment to the Family Court bench. a couple of matters associated with the resourcing of ASIO and the skills set that exists within ASIO currently-in particular, the capacity for foreign language skills within ASIO and whether or not there is provision to deal with an expansion of the foreign language skills. Also as part of that broad question, what initiatives are on foot to encourage recruitment in ASIO of people from non-English-speaking backgrounds in particular? I would be interested in the Attorney’s comments on that field. member for Brisbane that I know he has special responsibilities within the opposition and that, if he were to be rewarded with a ministerial post which sawdisappointed. But if he were to be so rewarded, he would find himself pressed by somebody from this side of the House on those same issues and be in the unfortunate position of not being able to elucidate very fully. There are good reasons for that. As to issues that go to security agencies and the way in which they are resourced to carry out particular functions and the skill sets that they have, to discuss those would, I think, prejudice security. I am perfectly happy for the honourable member to be briefed on those matters separately, but I do not think it is appropriate to canvass them in a broad-ranging debate, save to say that the importance of having linguistic skills is not something that escapes the attention of others. That is all I would want to say. stand what he is saying. I might avail myself of his invitation. A related and not quite so sensitive issue within the A-G’s broad portfolio is Federal Police numbers.

I underadequacy of our existing Federal Police numbers and what measures he thinks may be needed to improve the availability of AFP personnel to do what is an increasing list of jobs that we as a parliament and as a community expect of them. been personally greatly impressed with the quality of leadership and direction that has been given to the Australian Federal Police by Commissioner Keelty. I think his reappointment for a second five-year term was evidence of the confidence that the government has in his leadership and in the senior executives within the Australian Federal Police. I will get you a detailed briefing on the actual numbers. I probably had it for question time but I did not bring it with me in the folder that I have. Somebody has gone to see if they can retrieve it. My recollection is that there has been very considerable growth in resourcing of the Australian Federal Police. The way in which those resources are deployed, of course, presents some very significant management challenges for the commissioner and his management team because the work in relation to Commonwealth issues has been growing in complexity and number. Some of them, we understand, in relation to pornography and paedophilia, which I mentioned today, are matters with which the Australian Federal Police, given the volume of complaints, may have some difficulty. There are other areas in which the Commonwealth is expected to be involved in enforcing laws. We resource the Australian Federal Police in this budget to be able to deal with copyright issues, because they have not been seen as a priority matter before. The counterterrorism role is a very significant one to which the Australian Federal Police have responded very fully. The large number of overseas deployments have put them under very considerable pressure. Traditionally, there have been overseas deployments. The Cyprus one would be well known for the fact that Australians have participated in it over a long period of time. That has given the opportunity not only for the Australian Federal Police but also, in a number of cases, for senior police from our states and territories to participate offshore. I think Nick Kaldas, who is assistant commissioner in New South Wales and deals with counterterrorism issues in the New South Wales Police force, was a person who spent a good deal of time seconded to deal with policing issues in Iraq. So over a period of time. I think we have been well served by the Australian Federal Police. But the complaint, I gather, is that some would argue that, in a policing model, more of the functions that in the Australian Federal Police have been performed administratively should be performed by commissioned officers. I am not making those decisions, but I am not sure that that is necessarily the case. But it is the complaint, particularly of the association or the union representing police that, if you look at the state police services, they have a larger proportion of commissioned officers. I think they were talking about 80 per cent in some of the statements I saw and they suggest that the Australian Federal Police is something of the order of 60 per cent. I think that does reflect the fact that some tasks can be undertaken by people who are not necessarily sworn officers and the capacity of the service is not necessarily reduced. At the moment there are quite significant challenges that the Australian Federal Police face in recruiting staff. I know that there are reports that they have been poaching staff from state and territory police services. It is the case that, as part of its staffing for both the international deployment functions and aviation security, we have advertised quite extensively and have MAIN COMMITTEE",188,Deputy Chair Are You Reflecting On The Chair Member For Fraser Deputy Chair Are You Reflecting On The Chair That Would Not Be Advisable Deputy Chair Good
347,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Attorney-General) (7.00 pm)-CanI say firstly that I havesought to fill positions in that way. But, in relation to the actual strategy, and the proportion that are commissioned and the proportion that are undertaking other tasks, I will get the honourable member a further written brief. do apologise: I took advantage of my familiarity with the Attorney-General to make comment in his speech which I am certain could be interpreted as showing partiality from the chair. powers. Brisbane, who I am certain would understand the temptation I was subject to. great demonstration of impartiality, which I suspect I would not have been able to rise to. I want to follow up on that last point. It would be useful, I think, if the Attorney-General, in providing the answer to that earlier question, could make clear the number of sworn police officers as opposed to people in other positions within the AFP-which of course now includes the Australian Protective Service. On that point, I also seek comment from the Attorney-General about the role of the Protective Service personnel in overseas deployments and indeed whether or not the Attorney-General thinks that it is desirable for the AFP to have within its overseas contingents, in places like the Solomon Islands, a mixture of Protective Service staff and sworn officers. While we are on the subject of the AFP, I also invite the Attorney-General to give us some idea of when he thinks the government will finally have sufficient numbers of personnel to meet the Wheeler recommendations for airport security. There is, as I understand it, still a shortfall in those areas-that is, for response teams at the airports from the Federal Police and Protective Service. I am not sure whether he will have that on hand. He might also care to take that on notice. Let me just say that, in relation to the way in which I would approach the issue of resourcing, say, in a place like the Solomon Islands, I would take professional advice as to the requirements, particularly in relation to the risks that are involved. I have some familiarity with this. I have a daughter who actually went to the Solomon Islands as a public defender. She was there at a time when there was perhaps not as much tension and difficulty as there is now. I think, in relation to those issues, there has to be a very clear view that, while one asks questions and probes in relation to these matters, in the end it has to be a professional judgement as to those deployments; and I would leave them in the hands of the commissioner.

357,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (7.08 Pm),"On a slightly different matter, I seek the Attorneyadvice on what measures, if any, are planned to be taken this year to enhance security at the various federal courts around the country? ing matters that the courts had to operate as part of their core business. My understanding is that there is screening-at most courts I am aware of-in relation to ingress and egress, to the point that I find I am frequently subjected to it when I want to visit my office at Elizabeth Street in Sydney. The point I would make in relation to those matters is that it is a core business. I was very much involved as the Chair of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act back in the seventies when people whom I knew well were threatened-I notice that the honourable member for Prospect has joined us-and I can truly say that Ray Watson lost his wife tragically. He was a student of my father’s at Penrith High School. I knew him as an adviser on family law issues to former Attorney-General Lionel Murphy. David Opas, who was shot, I used to brief when I was a young solicitor in Sydney. Richard Gee, whose home was bombed, was a specialist adviser to the select committee that I chaired. So, from time to time, issues do arise in relation to the safety of our judicial officers, and we regularly make proper risk assessments in relation to those matters as we do in relation to other office holders. Certainly, in the present climate, the security measures which the courts have been putting in place have been seen as being measured and appropriate. The courts take advice from the PSCC on what is required and, as part of their core business funding, they are expected to implement them. both sides of the chamber are concerned to ensure the security of our courts and that those who service them are protected. But, in some respects, I would have to say that I did not get an answer to my question at all. I got a nice bit of political speak that handsomely took up 2½ minutes of the time remaining but said nothing about any additional measures that might be afoot for the year ahead. SoI assume that there are no additional measures afoot for the year ahead. If there are, I am sure the Attorney will correct me, or one of his advisers will set me straight. SoI will leave that area, given that I have about two minutes left. If the Attorney can add to it, I am sure he will do so, using up the two minutes. the newly created AusCheck. The government said that they were going to establish AusCheck back in December 2005. It commences in July this year. Would the Attorney comment on why it took 1½ years to get AusCheck up and running? But, more to the point in terms of its future and the budget at hand, how many employees does the Attorney anticipate AusCheck will have? Can he provide details of whether they will be full time, part time or casual? Also, I note that the AusCheck website talks about providing ‘capacity to be used for other background checking purposes’. How many employees does the Attorney anticipate will be tasked on those other background checking purposes? Has the Attorney got in his mind a particular area that might fall within that very broad category of ‘other background checking’? we were to extend the operation of AusCheck, we would have to amend the act. Initially, we envisaged that we might be able to do that by regulation. But, as part of the Senate review, I gather that is one of the adjustments we made.

I will try and get the numbers for you, but I think the delay reflects a lot of the nature of parliamentary democracy where issues are debated, committees review and you have to get legislation through. You do not start to budget and appropriate money to carry out particular purposes until you have a proper lawful basis for doing it.

When did he actually find that out and under what circumstances? Kevin Bodel actually made that statement. I think the member for Bruce was quoting from a newspaper article, so he is assuming that something written in a newspaper article was what Mr Bodel said. I am not sure that that is the case. Irrespective of that, late on the afternoon prior to the publication of that article on 14 June, that is, on 13 June, my understanding is that the journalist who wrote that article told the Prime Minister’s press office that she had a quote from the Australian Electoral Commission stating that the use of Kirribilli House may be required to be disclosed. We knew that could not be the case because the AEC, as far as we were aware, had not asked for any information regarding this particular aspect, therefore it would not make a definitive statement like that. My office contacted the AEC after receiving that information from the Prime Minister’s press office to determine whether that was truly the case. My office was told that the journalist in question asked a hypothetical questionKirribilli was not mentioned-about the disclosure of buildings in relation to events for fundraising. The officer, Kevin Bodel, provided an answer based on the hypothetical question. The journalist then went on to ask questions about Kirribilli. Kevin Bodel, I am informed, told the journalist, ‘Well, we would need various information before we could make any comment about Kirribilli.’ My office was concerned that a journalist was writing a story that included a quote that was contrary to what the AEC said was the way in which the conversation between them went. contacted the Electoral Commission, and did he speak to the Electoral Commissioner or to Mr Bodel himself?

I did not speak to Kevin Bodel myself. I only spoke to the commissioner much later in the evening, when, I think, the story was already filed. I also should emphasise that, in making the inquiry about this story that was going to be published the next day, my chief of staff spoke to the Electoral Commissioner first and, subsequently, to Kevin Bodel.

As the Electoral Commissioner’s statement indicates, they are independent and they certainly received absolutely no direction whatsoever. I say once again to the member for Bruce that the Electoral Commissioner could not be clearer than he was in the statement in this regard. There were no questions, muddying or anything like that. The statement that he made was absolutely clear cut.

Electoral Commission could ask any particular questions if they needed any information, because the commissioner made a statement earlier in the day-I think this was on the 14ththat they would seek legal advice. We certainly ensured that the AEC got any information that they needed to be able to get that legal advice. I should also point out to the member for Bruce, to save him some questions perhaps, my understanding is that the government, via the Prime Minister’s office, I think through the Attorney-General’s, obtained their own legal advice from Mr Burmester. And the AEC, quite independently, obtained their own legal advice. There have been a number of comments made-most recently by the member for Grayndler in the previous part of this appropriation debate in the Main Committee. From what I heard him say, he seemed to think that the AEC’s advice was the same as what the government got. That is not the case. The Attorney-General obtained advice directly from Mr Burmester. The AEC, independently, had already instigated the processes to get their own independent advice from the Australian Government Solicitor, and they in fact received that advice prior to even seeing the Burmester advice. understand it: the Burmester advice and also the advice from the AGS.

I, quite appropriately, would not be privy to any briefings that the Australian Electoral Commission would have given to its independent legal advisers. I am sure it provided them with the facts around the matter. Some of those facts, I think, may be different to what the member for Bruce has provided in terms of his so-called independent legal advice as well. I suspect that the member for Bruce might have told the Labor Party’s independent legal advisers that this was a fundraiser, and they may have ruled in relation to that. But the Prime Minister has made it very clear that this particular thing that happened at Kirribilli House was not a fundraiser. I am sure that would have been part of the information that the AEC worked on. As I said, the AEC is an independent body and it is not appropriate for me to be privy to that information. sulted about that and do you have a copy of it? In order to ensure there is no confusion in the public arena, would you undertake to release the Burmester advice, that being the relevant advice that the government received?

Perhaps the member for Bruce should have asked the member for Grayndler to ask that question of Prime Minister and Cabinet. other question I have in this respect is: has the minister or his office had any discussions with the AEC re the legal opinion that they are now in receipt of from the Labor Party and also, as I understand it, from Bob Brown in the last day or so with respect to alternative views on this matter? not had any contact or conversations. AllI have seen are the press statements by the AEC in relation to receipt of the Labor Party’s advice and the fact that they would investigate it. along those lines? my role at all; it is up to the Australian Electoral Commission. I should also reinforce the fact that neither has my office had any discussions about the AEC looking into that advice. ent matters regarding the department of finance’s role in overseeing government expenditure generally. I draw the minister’s attention to page 1022 of this year’s Budget Paper No. 1, which indicates that expenditure across departments would be $49 billion. Last year’s equivalent Budget Paper No. 1 at page 1023 indicated that at that point the forecast expenditure across departments would be $54 billion. So expenditure has come in $5 billion under what was expected in last year’s budget papers. I want to explore with the minister whether that is a real change or whether there has been some change in the methodology of accounting practices that would account for that difference. If there have been changes to the methodology, could the minister inform the House of what those changes and their implications are? If there have not been changes in methodology and it is a real difference, perhaps the minister could indicate what has caused that very significant variation over the last 12 months.

I will certainly ensure that the member is provided with an answer to those particular questions. those questions on notice. I suspect that answers to the following questions might be in a similar vein, which I understand and completely accept. I draw the minister’s attention similarly to the line item ‘whole-of-government and interagency amounts’. This year’s budget paper shows that to be a negative amount of $9.82 billion, but the estimate in last year’s budget paper was for there to be a positive $122 million at this point of the cycle. So again we see a $9 billion shift, which is a significant amount of money in anybody’s book, without any explanation that I can see in the budget paper or any other public explanation from the government as to why that has changed. I imagine there has been some change in accounting methodology, but could the minister take on notice whether that has been the case? Could he take on notice particularly whether there has been a change in methodology and, if so, what that change in methodology encompasses and what the difference is? If there has been such a change, could the minister provide, within the best of his department’s ability, a profile of departmental expenses based on this new methodology or classification over the last three financial years? look at that. As to the first part of that question, once again, I cannot provide an answer here and now, but I am sure we can provide an explanation for that. As to the second part, I will say yes, but I will put a rider on that: provided it is a reasonable thing to actually put together for the member. pletely understandable. I would now like to turn to the issue of annual appropriations for depreciation, particularly of information technology expenditures. Could the minister confirm that, under the accrual budgeting mechanism, agencies are provided with annual appropriations to cover depreciation expenses of information technology? In addition, could he confirm whether they are separately allocated money to upgrade their IT and other assets, but particularly their information technology assets? Could the minister also confirm what programs the Department of Finance and Administration has in place across the government to ensure that there is no double-dipping-that is, that departments and agencies are not receiving funds for depreciation which are meant to, over the long term, deal with issues of replacing equipment on a rolling basis as opposed to major upgrades? What mechanisms are in place to ensure that there is no double-dipping? Can the department provide the total amount of actual depreciation expenses for each year since 2000 funded through the price of outputs appropriations and other appropriations, including through additional estimates? The last part, clearly, the minister will need to take on notice. Perhaps he may have some information on the earlier parts of the question, or he may wish to take it all on notice. earlier part, I think it can be taken as read that all capital assets are depreciated, so depreciation certainly relates to that. But, for any new bids, individual departments have to go through the normal budget process. WhatI can say is that we are spending a lot of money on ICT.

The benefits have been seen in this town particularly from government investment in ICT. As to the last part of your question, yes, I will have to take that on notice. ciate it also if he could provide more information on notice in relation to the earlier parts of the question. I would like to ask the minister about something I noticed in the budget papers which I would have thought was unusual; I would ask for the minister’s clarification if he is able to give it. In relation to the AusLink strategic regional program supplementary fundingin particular, the allocation of $250 million in 2006-07 for the AusLink strategic regional program-the budget paper says this: The Programme provides funding for road, rail and intermodal projects in Australia’s regions that will support the growth of regional industry, respond to structural change, or strengthen local social and economic opportunities. The fiscal impact over three years, 2007-08 to 2009-10, is due to funds being fully expensed as projects are completed. It could be that that is all perfectly normal and maybe I have misunderstood it, but if I have read that correctly-I mean that genuinely-that would put the cash and accrual accounting mechanisms out of kilter which I would have thought would be very unusual. Is the minister aware of the issue? If cash and accrual have been put out of kilter, what approval processes were put in place for this and was the National Audit Office consulted? the detail of that. I know the program well. It is a great program, particularly for members who represent electorates in rural and regional areas. In the latter half of 2006, either $120 million or $150 million was spent on the program. I cannot remember exactly what it was. I know there were applications for substantially larger amounts of money than that-about tenfold. That was the reason the minister responsible, as part of the budget process, sought an expansion of that particular program. In doing so, part of the additional funding was made available in this financial year. There were projects that had already been submitted and assessed as being appropriate but they could not be funded because there was not enough money originally allocated last year. There was an extra $250 million that could be spent. In explaining those differences, I am not exactly certain whether that affects what the member is talking about in this cash accrual aspect, but I will check it. to a more detailed answer. There could be a perfectly legitimate and reasonable explanation and I have misunderstood it. On my reading of it, particularly the sentence ‘The fiscal impact over three years 2007-08 to 2009-10 is due to funds being fully expended as projects are completed’, it is very unusual in that normally funds are expended when they are spent. Another matter which the minister has more direct responsibility for is the government fleet. Is the minister able to provide, either now or on notice, information on the government fleet-in particular, the number or percentage of the government fleet that is able to use ethanol, how many of the fleet are fitted out to use LPG, and whether the minister has any knowledge or is able to ascertain a breakdown of those questions in relation to Comcar, the SES cars MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Deputy Chair Are You Reflecting On The Chair Member For Fraser Deputy Chair Are You Reflecting On The Chair That Would Not Be Advisable Deputy Chair Good

I am not interested in individuals or parties, only a total. Does the minister have any information on that? that, referring back to the AusLink question, to clarify the problem that you are misunderstanding: revenue in 2006-07 is acquitted in further years. My information is that they are not out of kilter, but we will give you the full detail of that. The only thing I can say off the top of my head about the fleet is that 85 or 90 per cent of the fuel that Comcar purchases is E10. That is gradually worked up as new stations are located so that Comcar can access E10. I think the use of E10 is highest in Canberra. With respect to the other fleet, I am sorry, but I do not have those figures off the top of my head. I am not sure to what extent they have been compiled because, as you would be aware, it is up to individual drivers as to where they buy their fuel. You would have to sort of bring it all back together, and I am not sure whether that has been done or not.

(2) Does the Minister’s department have the capacity to monitor whether foreign nationals entering Australia under the Temporary Business (long stay) sub class 457 visa have functional English; if so, how does the department define and test functional English. (1) In the period 2005-06: (a) one business was barred for a specific period from nominating a person or activity, (b) one business was barred from sponsoring more visa holders under the terms of the existing sponsorship approval, (c) one business was barred from making further applications as a business sponsor, (d) two businesses had their business sponsorship approval cancelled, (e) two businesses had the 457 visa of its overseas sponsored workers cancelled. (2) English language is a factor in the department’s decision making where it is identified as a skill necessary to perform the nominated position or to enable registration or licensing. It is at the discretion of the decision maker whether the information on the English language ability of the applicant provided with the application is sufficient, or if further testing is required. Under current Subclass 457 arrangements, substantial weight is placed on the judgement of the sponsoring employer given the negative impact of delays associated with formal testing.

402,Mr Costello,"The Minister for Finance and Administration has supplied the following anthe Inclusion Support Subsidy (ISS) may not provide adequate funding to include children with moderate or high support needs in mainstream out-of-school-hours programs; if not, why not. (2) Have concerns been raised with him, or the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, that duty-of-care and best practice compliance requires providers to have a oneto-one staff-to-child ratio, or better, to cater for children with moderate or high support needs; if so, when were these concerns raised. (3) Can he advise (a) the average wage and other costs to childcare providers of employing each additional childcare worker or carer and (b) the subsidy rate for the ISS in 2007; if not, why not. (4) Further to his reply that the ISS may assist a provider with “employing an additional worker to increase the staff-to-child ratio”, can he be sure that the ISS provides adequate funding to pay wage and other costs connected with employing additional staff members to meet best practice staff-tochild ratios; if so, why; if not, why not. The Inclusion Support Subsidy is provided to assist eligible child care services with the cost of including children with additional needs. The Inclusion Support Subsidy can contribute to the provision of relief staff while the carer attends training, specialist equipment and resources and employing an additional worker to increase the staff to child ratio. The focus of the Inclusion Support Subsidy is to build the capacity of child care services to include a child with ongoing high support needs. The Inclusion Support Subsidy is available to child care centres as a contribution only and is not intended to be a reimbursement for all costs associated with the inclusion of a child with ongoing high support needs. Funding should be utilised in conjunction with a range of other strategies to enhance a service’s capacity to include all children. The Inclusion Support Program provides a range of practical supports and assistance to child care services to help them to build capacity to provide a quality child care environment for all children, including those with additional needs. More detailed information about the program is available at http://www.facsia.gov.au/internet/facsinternet.nsf/childcare/services-ipsp.htm#4. Because the aim of the Inclusion Support Subsidy is to facilitate inclusion in mainstream environments, it is not designed to provide one-on-one support for any individual child. Nor is it a substitute for specialised disability services like respite and health care. The number of carers in a service funded by the Inclusion Support Subsidy at any one time is limited to no more than 10 percent of the service’s approved child care places. The provision of specialist disability services and medical services is the responsibility of the state and territory governments. This includes specialised services such as early intervention programmes, special schooling, accommodation, intensive therapy programmes, and related services such as respite and day activities/excursions. The Australian Government makes a substantial contribution to these state responsibilities through the Commonwealth State and Territory Disability Agreements.

404,Mr Ruddock,The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to,203,Questions In Writing
405,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s questions as they relate to the Atof the referring agencies and the level of security clearance required. The CDPP complies with the FMA Act. (2) The level of security clearance required by each defence counsel depends on the highest classification of information the counsel is required to access throughout the proceedings. The agency from where the information originates determines the appropriate classification levels for information. (3) For reasons of security, the government does not comment on the levels of clearance held by senior or junior external counsel acting on behalf of the government. Nor does the government comment on the numbers of clearance holders at each clearance level. (4) The agency engaging the external counsel is responsible for sponsoring the security clearances of counsel. All national security clearances are processed in accordance with the Australian Government Protective Security Manual (PSM). (5) The agency or agencies engaging the external counsel cover the clearance costs. (6) (a) he security clearance process is limited to counsel engaged or sponsored by a Commonwealth agency where the need for a clearance has been clearly identified. The Attorney-General’s Department and other relevant agencies may sponsor defence counsel engaged by nongovernment entities in matters where national security information may be involved. The National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 also makes provision for clearing defence representatives in certain circumstances. (b) In accordance with the PSM, security clearances may only be sought where the need for access to security classified resources is clearly established. The agency engaging or sponsoring the counsel determines that need for access and undertakes the relevant processes for the counsel to acquire the corresponding national security clearance level. The level of clearance requested is relative to the highest classification of the resources accessed by the counsel. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 also defines and limits the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation’s (ASIO) security assessment functions to those required by Commonwealth agencies. The ASIO security assessment is a mandatory facet of the process to acquire a national security clearance. (7) For reasons of security, the government does not comment on the length of time required to obtain a clearance. (8) For reasons of security, the government does not comment on the numbers of applicants undergoing the security clearance process through Australian Government agencies. Australian Federal Court: Hearsay Evidence (Question No. 5734) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 10 May 2007: Is hearsay evidence admissible in an Australian Federal court if the conditions and/or methods that are used to obtain that evidence are not disclosed to, or are unable to be ascertained by, a defendant or a defence lawyer; if not, why not. The Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) applies to proceedings in an Australian federal court. The relevant State and Territory evidence laws generally apply in State and Territory courts exercising federal jurisdiction. The rules on hearsay evidence for proceedings in an Australian federal court are contained in Part 3.2 of the Evidence Act. The Part establishes the general rule against the use of hearsay evidence and then sets out a number of specific exceptions to the rule.",203,Questions In Writing
406,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Generally, there is no requirement, in admitting hearsay evidence, for a court to require disclosure of the circumstances in which that evidence was obtained. However, the court may need to consider the circumstances in which the prior representation (the hearsay evidence) was made. For example, under subsection 65(2) of the Evidence Act, in a criminal proceeding where the person who made the representation is unavailable, the court is required to consider whether: (a) the representation was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind; or (b) the representation was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication; or (c) the representation was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable; or (d) the representation was against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made. Rulings on the admissibility of evidence are matters to be determined by the court. Part 3.11 of the Evidence Act gives the court discretion to exclude evidence even if that evidence would otherwise be admissible. This includes discretion to exclude improperly or illegally obtained evidence.",204,Questions In Writing
