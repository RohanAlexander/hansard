0,"War, I May Point Out That, During Their Term Of Office, They Endeavoured To Block Operations At Cockatoo Island Ber Must Confine Himself To The Matter Be","fore the Chair. the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is really serious in his suggestion that this factory should be transferred to Canberra. My own opinion is' that the inquiry of the Public Works Committee should be confined to the extension of the present premises at Lithgow, with a view to an augmented production of war materiel. It would be most unwise, in my opinion, to give the Public Works Committee a roving commission, in view of the urgency of the situation; and I can only think that the honourable member for Eden Monaro is merely trying to liven up a somewhat dull House. ought to be passed at once, so that the proposed extension may be inquired into and carried out as rapidly as possible. I am very glad that the motion has been submitted in its present shape. Last session, in answer to a question, I elicited a reply that the rifles which were being turned out at the Lithgow factory had cost something like £100 each. ber must not go into that question. it was then pointed out that the comparison was unfair, seeing that we were also informed that a huge plant had been put up suflicient to turn our rifles for Australia for many years to come. We now find, however, that, at the first stress, it is necessary to practically rebuild, or, at all events, to greatly extend the factory. One of the many good services that will doubtless be rendered by the Public Works Committee will be that of eliciting facts connected with our Defence Department facts which hitherto honourable members have been unable to ascertain, no matter what Government has been in oflice. I trust that the Committee will be able to determine exactly what this Small Arms Factory is costing. Last year information was adduced which showed clearly that the cost of manufacturing rifles at Lithgow panned out at more than £100 each, notwithstanding that equally good weapons could be imported for about £3 each. The provision in our law which requires the reference to our Public Works Committee of all works involving any considerable expenditure is, in my judgment, an admirable one. Had such a system been in operation years ago, it would have saved the Commonwealtli millions of pounds. Indeed, it will effect a saving of millions of pounds in the future. In my judgment, the Committee may be trusted to conduct an exhaustive inquiry into this matter. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has raised the very important question of whether Lithgow is a suitable site for the Small Arms Factory. In my opinion, there is much to be said in favour of establishing all national works in Federal territory. Other things being equal, I believe that it would be better to so establish all The motion national factories, thus assisting to attract population to that territory. this proposal is one that vitally concerns an industrial centre of my electorate, I feel that I ought to say a word or two upon it, and particularly upon the suggestion of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that national works should not be confined to one locality. I take it that his suggestion is merely one of his characteristic serio-comic efforts which we may dismiss from our consideration. member ought to be a good judge of that sort of thing.

The proposal before us is one to refer a certain work to the Public Works Committee. sion that, in view of the proposed extension of the Small Arms Factory, the question of where it should be established naturally arose.

There are facts connected with this matter which, in view of existing conditions, it would not he wise to discuss here.

I do not think that it becomes honourable members to raise the slightest question upon this proposal.

32,Mr Josephcook,"I am talkingduring week ends, and at all times, our Small Arms Factory at Lithgow works but one shift per day, and closes its gates religiously from noon every Saturday until the following Monday morning. No man in these times can be perfectly satisfied with such a condition of things as that. There may he reasons for it, but if there are we are not permitted to know them. ""We can only form a judgment as outsiders, and I say that in war time, when rifles are of the very essence of our preparations for war, this is not to me a satisfactory reflection. It is about five years since it was decided to erect the factory. It is, I think, four years since the machinery arrived here, and the plant has been completed for three years. Large additions have already been made to the original plant, and one cannot but express disappointment at the poor results achieved up to date. Here we have a proposal to practically duplicate the existing plant at a cost of an additional £100,000. If it were not war time. I should ask some very plain and pertinent questions regarding the use which is being made of the plant we already have. I am not sure that I ought, not to ask them even now. The Minister has said that after inquiry he is satisfied that the best is being done at Lithgow. recently visited the factory with a view of seeing whether it would not be possible' to increase the output. to think that the best is not being done. The fact may be mentioned that once the machinery is erected there is nothing very difficult about the work of a Small Arms Factory. That was brought out very clearly in connection with one of the disputes which came up for arbitration at the Lithgow Factory. I may say that if ever there was a place where there has been a crop of little troubles to settle the Lithgow Small Arms Factory is such a place. Whatever else State Socialism does for us it does not prevent industrial troubles. In connection with one of these troubles the question arose as to what should be an engineer's work. It was asserted very distinctly at the time by the manager of the factory that it was not difficult for any man to learn the work of sharpening the tools required to be used, which, it waa stated, was largely the work to be done on tlie engineering side. In the circumstances, why it is not possible, after three years, to work a couple of shifts at this factory, where no greattechnical skill is required, I do not know. quired in some branches is great. but for those branches the Government have the engineers' associations of the whole of Australia to draw upon. It is only the other technical branches that are to be learnt on the spot. Sharpening and setting tools is the main thing that is novel or new up there; and I remember that the manager was emphatic that that should not take a man very long to learn. Yet, for some reason or other, after three years' experimentation at the factory, we are able to work only one shift, and close the gates at noon oh Saturday. In the absence of any other reason that I know of, this state of affairs strikes me as not satisfactory, to say the least of it. Here is a proposition that, so far as we know-and this is the answer to the°honourable member for Nepean-wil l make no impression whatever on the war. Mr Wright's own estimate is that it will take from twelve to eighteen months to erect the new plant There is the preliminary inquiry; there are all the details of ordering the plant, which has to come ove» the sea and be put into working order. deal longer. But this is only the addition of another section to fit into the old plan; yet Mr Wright says it will take from twelve to eighteen months, and cost £100,000. I am not so sure that in the circumstances there is all the urgency that has been alleged. I hope the war is not going to last another eighteen months. Altogether, I feel that the matter is going very properly to a committee of inquiry, who, if they do their duty, will view the whole plant, and review the totality of its functions from the time it was first attempted. to get information that no Minister has been able to get. to think that that is so.

I observe that the final minute on the subject by Senator Pearce is dated 1st April. wise and intelligent proposition. understand that the site is safe and secure, and adjacent to many natural advantages. Eveu there I am not quite sure that all expectations have been realized. One of the strong reasons for putting the site at Lithgow was that we should be able to manufacture our own steel suitable for rifle-making, but I have uot heard that any steel of the kind has been manufactured at the local works, nor, so far as I can ascertain, is it likely to be for some time to come. There is not sufficient demand here to compensate the proprietors of steel works for making the particular kind of steel required. It is too late to attempt to uproot the plant; it is there, and the duty is laid on this or any other Government that may happen to be in power to make whatever additions are necessary to equip it and make it an up-to-date rifle-producing factory that will enable Australia to be self-supporting in every respect relating to preparation for war. the motion, and congratulate the Government on sending the question on for full and complete inquiry, which I hope will result in a full and intelligent report to the House, giving us an infinitely better understanding of the works at Lithgow, and perhaps a greater degree of satisfaction with them, than I , at any rate, have at present. port the motion; but, at tlie same time, it is not quite clear that the Government are adopting the right procedure. It is possible for them to undertake the work themselves without any preliminary inquiry under the Act. If the Minister is as desirous of despatch as he suggests, and as some of his colleagues behind him recommend, it is possible for tlie Governor General in Council to exempt the vote from the operation of the Act, as an item required for the military and naval defence of the Commonwealth. Having, however, brought it before the House, and followed the procedure suggested by the Public Works Committee Act, it seems to me that the discussion ought to be as wide as you, sir, in your judgment can allow. The Committee are directed by the Act, in considering and reporting on any work, to have regard to its stated purpose, the necessity or advisableness of I hope it is a carrying it out, and, where it purports to I be reproductive or revenue-producing, the amount of revenue likely to be produced, and its present or prospective public value. They have generally to take such measures, and procure such information, as may enable them to inform or satisfy Parliament as to the expediency of carrying out the work. This is an expenditure to increase the output of small arms in Australia. Whether we be at war or not, the whole question of the production of small arms, whether their quality or quantity has been satisfactory in the past or may be made so in the future, whether they will be needed in the future, and how they shall be used if and when produced, ought to come within the ambit of the discussion. I , therefore, suggest that honourable members who desire to see the necessities of rifle clubs considered, apart from the needs of our trained troops here or overseas ber must not discuss the question of rifle clubs. sir, if you are in that mood, as I do not desire to transgress your ruling. But if we cannot discuss the use to be made of rifles produced as the result of this extension, we shall be limited in one of the most important sections of the discussion we wish to undertake. mittee will consider that matter and report upon it. son to be bitterly disappointed with the result of the work at the Small Arms Factory under Government control.

53,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"Attorof course, by the developments in the arts and sciences, and particularly in the concept of society in its relation to patentees. patent. A patentee, during the period for which his patent is granted, may sue any person who infringes his patent rights. He has, in short, a monopoly which he may maintain by civil action. By the amending Act of last year the patent rights of enemy subjects were made liable to suspension or avoidance, at the discretion of the Minister, who was empowered to appoint licensees to exercise them. A similar position was created in regard to trade marks and designs. Buti t is found that, when patent rights have been suspended or avoided, every person in the community may make or vend the patented article, which makes a Crown licence of little or no value. No person would be willing to invest a capital of, say, £50,000 in the production of a patented article unless he were assured of a market in which he would be protected, and in which his outlay could bo recouped. If a licensee is to be in no better position than any other person in respect to the production of patented articles, there will be no inducement to obtain licences. retained until the war is over ? That was the understanding iu England. to demand royalties from any person other than a licensee, and the royalties paid will remain in a trust fund, to be administered at the close of the war as circumstances may determine and Parliament may dictate. There is another phase of the matter. SupposeA to be the patentee of an article, the production of which demands a capital of £50,000 or thereabouts. If A's patent rights are suspended, and a. licence to manufacture the patented article is granted to B, on condition that he pays a royalty to the Crown, B will manufacture only if he is protected against competition, or if the competition is limited to Crown licensees. Now, any person may infringe the patent rights. Where a patent has been avoided and a licence to manufacture has been granted to a Government official as representative and agent for the Crown, other persons may manufacture the patented article, and cannot be proceeded against, either civilly or criminally. The Crown cannot sue for infringement, because the right to do that was vested solely in the patentee, and does not pass to the Crowa on the avoidance or suspension of a weakness in this legislation during the second-reading debate of the Bill of last year. orable member then said that the right of action for infringement was gone. But it has not gone permanently; it has goneonly during the war, or during the period of suspension or avoidance of the patent. After the war, patentees will be able to call to account any person who, without their permission and without licence from the Crown, has infringed a patent. Action against a licensee would, of course, be barred by Statute. The Bill has been introduced to give the Crown power to punish unlicensed persona for infringing patent rights which have been suspended in favour of any person or persons. It thus safeguards to some extent the rights of patentees as well as those of licensees. Whatever be determined as to the distribution of the royalties collected under the amending Act of 1914, the patentee whose patent nas been suspended or avoided is placed by this Bill in a better position to recover after the war whatever he may be entitled to. The measure also assures a monopoly in the production of the patented article to the Crown lieensee, and is thus a necessary complement to the Act of last year. The intention to give the licensee a monopoly, and to transfer to him all the rights of the patentee, was imperilled by a defect in .the Act of 1914. That Act took his monopoly from the patentee whose patent was avoided or suspended, but left the community free to make, vend, or use the patented article, nob only when the patent was-avoided, but whenit was suspended -in favour of a Crownlicensee. In this explanation of the BillI have confined my remarks to patent rights, and have not referred to trade marks and designs, because, so far as this Bill goes, the difference between them is not one of principle. If it can be shown that the measure can be made more effective, I shall be glad to adopt amendments to that end. The Act of last year was introduced to enable the community to continue to enjoy the benefits of patented articles affected by the war, to offer sufficient inducements to licensees",18,Patents Trade Marks An D Designs Bill No 3

57,Mr Hughes,"That is so. The honi n whose favour the patent waa suspended to put their money into the manufacture of these articles, so that Australia should gain not only by opportunities for use of tlie article, but also by the establishment of industries for its manufacture, and where this could only be effected by suspension and not by avoidance. The 1914 Act has been found defective in so far that a licence now granted to a person under it does not give that person such a monopoly as would induce him to invest his capital, nor does it protect the community, because, since it enables any man to use the patent involved, it , in effect, in many cases, will prevent any from doing so.

The to a length which, I feel confident, neither Examiner of Patentsi n every country the Attorney-General nor his supporters examines the official records to determine, appreciate. sure revives some of the most mischievous whether an invention claimed to be new features of the practice of the Crown is new in fact. The Crown says to an apcreating indefeasible monopolies in in plicant for a patent, "" That is all we can dividuals, which existed at the time of the do for you. If your invention is new, Tudors, and which, after a great constiwe shall give you a monopoly in respect tutional struggle by the Commons against to it for fourteen years, with a right, the Crown, was at last limited-in many under certain circumstances, to have it respects it was abolished-by the famous renewed, but you must take it at your Statute known as the Statute of Monoown risk. "" It will be seen that the real polies. That Statute, which was passed safety to the public and the Crowni n the time of Elizabeth, provided that the against the granting of improper monoCrown should not be permitted to grant polies lies in the fact that there is thrown any monoplies except subject to a certain definite limitation. The Crown had been granting monopolies and making revenues out of the practice. I am not suggesting that anything of the kind is likely to happen here. But the principle involved in this B ill is one that has been fought for and maintained throughout the history of, not merely Great Britain, but every modern civilized country-the principle that the granting of monopolies by the State must be limited within a veiy defined area. That defined area is that a monopoly shall be granted only as a reward for a new and useful invention. Both those words are used in the Statute of Monopolies, and they have been taken I am not at all sure that I do modern country to be a f a i r mark of The honourable gentleman pracof all our patent laws, and I have rethat right absolutely granted to h i m . It could not lie guaranteed by the State, but must be subject to the condition that the invention which is claimed to be new Asi t is worded, this meaas far as can be determined from them, upon the person who secures a patent right the condition that if his invention is challenged he must show that it was new when the patent was granted in respect of it . Every patentee, whether an enemy or a friendly patentee, is subject to that condition. an inventor does nowadays is to patent his invention in every country. We have hundreds of German patents here, and doubtless there are hundreds of British patents in operation in Germany. Many of these patents are not worth the paper on which they are written. Many of thera are absolutely worthless. patentees have paid their fees, and have obtained their patents for what they are worth. such an invention, the patentee cannot say to him, "" Here is my patent, and that must be quite enough to you. You must pay me a royalty."" ' On the contrary, the person seeking to exercise an invention has the right to say to the patentee, "" Your invention was not new when you obtained a patent for it in Australia."" agree with me that of the German patents with which we are now dealing there are hundreds in Australia which are probably as bad as possible, and which every Australian citizen has a right to challenge. I understand that this B ill has an immediate connection with what is known as the Thermit case, and I cannot help regarding this measure as an illustration of the danger that always attaches to the passing of a B ill , in general terms, In other words, a German patent may be to deal with a particular subject-matter. If the Government wish to deal with a particular matter, Parliament should be so informed, and a measure relating specifically to it should be introduced. But when we have brought forward a general change of the law to meet a particular difficulty arising in a particular case we are apt to fall into serious dangers. ing to the facts which I tliink have led to the introduction of this B ill , I wish to point out that there are hundreds of German inventions patented in Australia which any oue has a right to use. We can say in respect of many of them that the invention to which the patent relates was published in a scientific magazine here before the patent was granted, or that something almost exactly similar was being used, say, in the Castlemaine Foundry before the invention patented. Sir William Irvine. war time? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE A t any time. The Crown, in granting a patent to any man, has always said, in effect, to him, "" You have a monopoly in respect The first thing that to it only if you can prove that your in vention is new. An y man has a right to do that, in respect of which you claim a monopoly, if he can show that your in vention is not new."" ThisB ill has nothing to do with the war, except in so far as it takes its origin from the fact of certain patentees being enemies of The ours. The Commonwealth Act of 1914, copying the Imperial Act, enabled the Minister to make a regulation under the If any one chooses to exercise general patent law providing for the suspension or cancellation of the patent rights of tlie subject of any State at war with us-to put it shortly, the patent rights of any German-or , in the alternative, to grant a licence without suspending a patent word "" and "" is used. We may suspend The Attorney-General w ill without giving a licence; we may suspend and give a licence or avoid a patent altogether. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE The Attorney-General is in error. Section3 of the Act of 1914 provides that regulations may be made(a) for avoiding or suspending in whole or in part any patent or licence the person entitled to the benefit of which is the subject of any State at war with the King; avoided or suspended. The section provides, further, for the making of regulations(b) for avoiding or suspending the registration, and all or any rights conferred by the registration, of any trade mark or design the proprietor whereof is a subject as aforesaid; _ (c) for avoiding or suspending any appliBefore alludcation made by any such person under any of the Acts referred to in this section, andParagraph c deals with applications and has nothing to do with the point with which I am dealing(d) for enabling the Minister to grant in favour of persons, other than such persons as aforesaid, on sueh terms and conditions, and either for the whole term of the patent or registration or for such less period, as the Minister thinks fit, licences to make use exercise or vend patented invenwas tions and registered designs so liable to avoidance or suspension as aforesaid.",19,Patents Trade Marks An D Designs Bill No 3

59,Mr Hughes,"No t alternatively. TheThe word "" and "" merely connects the different paragraphs, giving power to make regulations. It will thus be seen that the Minister has power to make regu lations to suspend or cancel a German patent, or, allowing a German patent to remain in force, to grant a licence to any individual. If a German patent be annulled, a licence in respect of it cannot be granted. A licence has force only as long as there is in force a patent relating to it . licence if we annul the patent. pend a patent, and yet not grant a licence. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I understood the honourable gentleman to go further, but I accept the statement just made by him. We can annul or suspend a patent, and yet refrain from granting a licence in respect to it . If we annul or suspend a patent we may not grant a licence, but we may leave a patent in force. pend our authority to grant a licence does not arise. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE totally different view from that just expressed by the Attorney-General. If we annul or suspend a patent, the necessity for granting a licence to use the invention relating to it does not exist. The1 operation of the patent destroyed altogether or suspended during the operation of the war. If it is suspended any person may, without licence, use the invention to which it relates. Statute. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE where a patent is not suspended or anson to manufacture the patent, but that nulled that the Minister may grant a licence does not give the licensee a molicence that may be of any purpose. That nopoly; it simply authorizes h i m to being so, I come now to the point to manufacture without paying royalty to which I wish to direct special attention, the patentee. If the Minister grants a because I believe it has been overlooked. licence under statutory authority to a This legislation, if carried in its present man to manufacture, notwithstanding a form , will have extraordinary, far-reachpatent which still remains in existence, ing effects. If a patent be annulled or the man has an absolute right to do it cancelled, or suspended, or if a licence be under the existing Act, and the patentee granted without annulling or suspending is absolutely precluded from suing after the patent concerned, then any perwards with regard to the actions of the son who gets that licence is merely licensee. Of course, after the terminaexempt patentee. . HeI f we suspend the patent we abolish the force, and from that time onward the monopoly for the time being.

65,Mr Fenton,"That is true, but if as not forgetting that everything turns on the fact that the power given to the Minister is to suspend, in whole or in part, in favour of a particular person. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE if the Minister grants a licence, it is in favour of the person to whom he gives it. The words "" in p a r t "" cannot mean "" in favour of any particular person."" To suspend a monopoly even in part means to allow everybody to do the thing which the monopoly claims to do. patent rights. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I am endeavouring to put my own view. I have no doubt as to it . tions in the B ill are such that they conflict with the argument of the honourable member. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I had some difficulty in understanding what was the meaning of suspending a patent "" in part."" patent consists of several subordinate monopolies or claims, it may be suspended in regard to some of the' claims,, though not in regard to the whole patent. It cannot mean suspension in regard to any particular person, because, once suspended, it is suspended in regard to everybody, or not at all. If honourable members will give me a little more attention upon this very technical subject, I shall lie able to explain this very dangerous quality in the B ill , and I have no doubt that the Government, if they view the matter as I do, upon explanation, will be prepared to make the necessary modifications to gain their real end. According to clause 4Where a patent, or the registration, and all or any of the rights conferred by the registration, of a trade mark or design, has been suspended in favour of any person Mark these words-in favour of any person-becaus e there is nothing in the existing law which speaks of suspending a patent "" in favour of any person "" ; the words are meaningless. There cannot be a licence where a monopoly is suspended. It is not required. A licence is permission to do something which, but for the licence, one would be prevented from doing by law. The clause proceedsany person other than the person in whose favour the patent, or the registration, as aforeAustralia can come along and ask for an said, has been so suspended, who, during such suspension, makes, uses, exercises, or vends the invention forming the subject-matter of the patent, shall be guilty of an offence. Penalty : £500. If it be passed in this form, the clause will achieve two objects which could not Of course, have been contemplated by Ministers. It will deprive the people of Australia of the righ t which they have always had against any patentee, no matter how usef u l his invention may have been, to say that, so far as Australia was concerned, it was not new at the time the patent was obtained. This provision not only takes We are dealing with over a German patent, which may be good or bad, and vests it in some licensee, but . it also arms that licensee with a power and authority such as -no patentee has ever had in any British or modern community. patent rights? able patent rights-so much so that no Australian citizen can say, "" Y o u r in vention was never a new invention here."" It can only mean that, if a Not only does it deprive every man of the right of claiming to dispute a monopoly on the ground on which similar monopolies have always been open to challenge, namely, that it was not new when the patent was obtained, and that it was in the possession of the public previously, but it also adds, or perhaps substitutesi t is difficult to say-bu t it certainly creates a new and drastic enforcement of the monopoly such as exists in no other jurisdiction, for we make any encroachment on the patent a criminal offence with a penalty of £ 5 0 0 , whereas, under the existing law, the sole right that any patentee has to support his monopoly is a civil action for damages. He may say, "" Y o u have made use of my invention; it was new, and I have a patent for it ; by using it you have caused me a certain amount of damage, and I shall sue you for damages, and claim an injunction against you in order to prevent you making furthe r use of it . "" That relief the patentee has subject to tlie inherent right of the man whom he attacks to say, "" You have never had a valid patent, because the invention was not new at the time you got it in Australia."" that if this righ t is granted to a certain party, protected by this Act, no man in improvement?",22,Patents Trade Marks An D Designs Bill No 3

71,Mr Fenton,"D o you mean to infernot my meaning. An improvement is an entirely different thing. A patent may be issued for an improvement on an existing patent, so long as it is new; but the existing patent cannot be used without the payment of royalties to the patentee. the onus of proof from the patentee to the other person. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE much a question of proof. This Bill now proposes to give to the patent the guarantee that it is. a good patent, whether it is new or not, and the man who gets a licence will uot only have the right to manufacture without paying royalty to the patentee-that is to say, he will have the right to do what no other man will have the right to do if the patent is good -but , also, he will have a.monopoly which is conferred on him in a way which it is not now conferred on any patentee. No one will be able to dispute the validity of the patent, whether it be good or bad. The right which we all have to dispute any German patent in the hands of a German patentee will be gone. Thus hundreds of these patents, .which may be good or bad-that many of them are bad has been proved in our Courts of law -ma y be taken over under this Bill, and vested in licensees, and at once be made impregnable. have the right to get. the royalties the original patentee would have received? but why should the Crown have that right against the public? That is the danger. We are creating a new monopoly for inventions which are not new. A German may have a German patent for something which has been used iu Australia in various forms before. It may be thoroughly bad, but the German patentee comes here and gets a patent at the Patents Omen. It is often done, because the examination is necessarily bad; it is an examination of documents only, and numbers of these patents are very easily .attackable and capable of being upset. Nevertheless, the patent stands, but any one has the right to go on making ThermitI merely take this as an example; I do not know whether the patent is bad-and if the patentee chooses to sue for damages the other party may be in a position to prove that it is a bad patent. Now, however, under this Bill, once the patent is vested in the licensee it becomes impregnable. It may be as rotten as possible, but it is at once built up into an impregnable fortress so long as the licence is held. that be? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE It may be for the unexpired period of the patent, It is not so anything up to fourteen years. As the Attorney-General has pointed ctot, if we desire people to put capital into the manufacture of tliese articles, w© must give them something worth going for, and probably licences will be granted for as long a period as possible; therefore, the monopoly may rest for all that time, and it is an impregnable monopoly. It is very dangerous, indeed, to vest in the Crown, in, any shape or form, the right to grant monopolies, except subject to conditions which have been attached in every country to the grant-for instance, the condition of giving something to the public in return for the monopoly. The patentee gives the public the benefit of a new invention, but for that alone does he get the right to prevent other people from using it? upon the patentee. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I do not think there is any question of the onus: of proof. It is not merely the onus of proof that is thrown upon him the licensee goes to Court, do you mean ?"" the person to Court and says "" You are using my patent."" The onus of proving that he is rests upon the patentee. speaking of the existing law ? proof would be on the patentee. the existing law, the person who assails a patent has to prove that it is not new. That is the ordinary law. He has alwaysthe right to call evidence that it is not new: but the position created under this Bill is that nobody can prove that theoriginal German invention was not new. party wish to give a monopoly?

I merely wish to point out to my friends on this side of the House, as well as to those on the other, that this power, whether in the hands of a Government supported by honourable members on that side, or by honourable members on this side, is an equally dangerous power. That is what I want to point out. I propose to take up a few minutes by referring to an instance of what I mean. I do not think there is any disputing the fact that the occasion responsible for this Bill is in connection with the question that has arisen regarding a German invention named Thermit. I know very little about the subject of the invention, excepting that it is a kind of chemical or physical preparation by which enormous heat is generated, and that it is largely used in the welding of iron and steel. An HONOBABLE MEMBEB -It is used on our tram-lines. history of the Thermit controversy. After the last Act was passed in 1914, two applications were made under it, and under regulations raised hy it, in respect of this particular invention. dale Smith, the other by Mr Henry Chinn. Both were made to avoid the Thermit patent. If either had succeeded, in effect, it would have meant that Teesdale Smith, or Chinn, or anybody else, might have used the patent-that is, under the operation of the Act. Both the applications were opposed by a number of persons. First of all by the patentees, then by the Australian Thermit Company, who were, I imagine, tha exclusive licensees of the patent in Australia. They were opposed by the Minister of Railways in New South Wales, by the Commissioner of Railways in that State, and also by the Malvern Tramways Trust. Mr Chinn opposed Mr made to the Attorney-General himself. Teesdale Smith's application. persons who had applied for licences or persons wishing to apply ? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE know what relation these people stood towards one another, or towards the original patentee. They all opposed the applicadale Smith's application, though the granting of Mr Teesdale Smith's application would have had exactly the same effect as the granting of Mr Chinn's application. They were all persons who opposed the applications to avoid or suspend the Thermit patents. A t that stage there were no applications for licences. The applications, I am informed, aud this information has been supplied to me by a gentleman engaged professionally in the litigation plication before the Commissioner fort suspend. these persons were applicants. time the only applications were to avoid' or to suspend the granting of either of which would, of course, have thrown the whole thing upon the world at large. man has coupled them both together. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I say two persons made application to avoid or suspend. One was Mr Teesdale Smith, the other Mr Chinn. application was not granted. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I am not making any accusation against the Attorney-General. I am sure he did what he thought was right in this case; but I want to show what might be done. The applications, as I have said, were opposed by quite a number of persons. For some remarkable reason, Mr Chinn opposed Mr Smith's application, the granting of which would have had exactly the same effect as if Chinn's application had been granted. The contractors to the Malvern Tramways Trust also for some reason opposed Smith's application. These, however, are details that do not matter. The fact is that the applications were opposed by quite a number of persons. The applications were Very properly, he referred them to the Commissioner for Patents for inquiry; but Mr Teesdale Smith, before the hearing before the Commissioner for Patents, I do not withdrew his application. The next step was that in which the Commissioner would have heard Mr Chinn's application, which up to that time had been merely an application to suspend or avoid a patent -that is, to open the door to the world. Mr Chinn asked the Commissioner for an exclusive licence to be granted to him-",24,Patents Trade Marks An D Designs Bill No 3

There was power to grant a licence, but this power to grant an ""exclusive licence"" is only now being asked for. A f t e r the matter had been further dealt with , a decision was given, the effect of which was, shortly, that the Attorney-General refused to grant Mr Chinn's application, but suspended the patent "" so f a r as regards and in favour of (a) the Engineerin-Chief of the Commonwealth railways; and (b) such persons as the Minister may license."" Now that again was meaningless. I say so with great respect to the Attorney-General; but to say that under the existing law you can suspend a patent "" as far as regards and in favour of "" any particular person, has no meaning. Under thc existing law, all a Minister can do is to suspend a patent-that is, he can open the door, but he cannot open the door to any one particular person. suspends the patent; he annuls it application to grant a licence! Sir WILLIAMIRVINE if he granted a licence, he would open the door to one person and close it to the rest of the world, but leaving to the rest of the world the right to put the law into operation to show that there is nothing in the door, so to speak-in other words, to show that the patent is bad. I have the orders made by the Minister here, and, assuming that he possesses the power, I want hi m to understand that I take no exception whatever either to the form or substance in which he proposes to take this power, provided he has thoroughly looked into the matter. to invest the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways with the exclusive power to utilize this Thermit patent in Australia. may, or it may not be. If the Minister has looked into the matter, and has come to the conclusion that it ' is, I do not quarrel with his decision. that he should possess power to grant an exclusive licence to some other person beside the Engineer-in-Chief. I do not dispute that. it at the time that order was made, and this B ill is, of course, couched in language which is intended obviously to valiA n "" exclusive licence"" means date that order, because it now^ for the I do not know whether first time, speaks of a case in which a knew that it meant patent has been suspended in favour of any person. Asf a r as I know, no patent has ever been suspended in favour of any person except the Thermit patent. the B ill or the Act? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE The B ill . I want to say this, putting it shortly, that if the Minister wants merely to grant the same rights as the patentee had for the purpose of enabling that person-subjec t to all the disabilities of the patent, subject to the right of anybody to prove that there is nothing at all in it , that there is no monopoly in it if he wants to transfer the right of a German enemy to a citizen of Australia, I have nothing to say in opposition, but, as I said before, it is a power in the hands of any Government, or any Ministry, which ought to be exercised with the utmost caution and watched with the utmost jealousy. It may be a power which it is very desirable for the Minister to posHe sess; but, in order to grant that power, all Parliament has to do is to say that the Minister may invest some person witli the same rights in a patent that the GerO f course, man patentee had. That is what should be done. It would not take the Parliamentary Draftsman five minutes to put that simple thing into a form which would give the Minister all he wants. If , as he pointed out, he wants to invest some person with that power, and to give him the necessary inducement to invest his capital, and, with that end in view, to grant him a monopoly, let him grant £he monopoly subject to the same conditions and the same risks that now exist in the German patentee from whom he proposes to take the patent. But, if you go beyond that, and say that the Minister or the Government may take any GermanI t may be highly desirable patent out of the hundreds that exist in this country, and may transfer it to a particular individual, and render him abIt solutely safe from any attack, no matter how vicious, then the licensee to whom you grant that power w ill not only have his ordinary rights to sue for damages It may be desirable against an infringer if his patent is good, but you are also going to protect him by granting an inviolable monopoly with a penal provision, fixing the penalty for But he had no power to do infringement at £ 5 0 0 .

As a matter of common sense, you would not avoid a patent if you were going to give a licence for its use. ThisB ill does not deal at all with the avoidance of a patent, but only with its suspension. in parts. ever intended. the word "" avoid "" ought never to have been put in the Act we passed at the end of last year. concerned, it is clearly directed to the power of suspension. to which I am calling the attention of the Attorney-General is this: considerations in passing this B ill was to protect the right of patentees during tlie war, because at such time they had no right of action. reason. December, orders were published in England permitting the payment of the necessary fees for obtaining a renewal or a continuance of a patent in an enemy country, and also reciprocal permission was given to pay enemy fees in England on patents held by enemy subjects, so that the suspension of the rights of the patentees should not, except by precluding them from taking action for infringement, be prejudiced by the duration of the war. Primarily, what we are doing is fulfillin g the international rule that, unless we deliberately abrogate contracts, the patents also should be protected during the war. of abrogating contracts. is a rule of law that contracts are not necessarily abrogated. The next reason is that adduced by the Attorney-General -to induce people to take up these patents by issuing licences to them. For that reason the Act allows licences to be granted for the f u l l term of the patent, and the> allegation is that, unless that It was done quite rewere done, people would not embark on the expenditure necessary in order to use the patent. The point I would impress on the Attorney-General is, that if such It has been declared licences are granted, he must not interfere with the rights of a patentee, or do anything which would be in the nature of giving away those rights. as one of the guiding principles. why I believe this legislation was introduced. Only the right of action for in fringement is suspended; at the end of I do not think that was the war that right accrues again, and its My impression is that revival enables action to be taken in respect of infringements during the war. authorities. Perhaps such action is not possible, but I have seen opinions to that effect from eminent men. that is not so. One of the absolutely clear, but the opinion has been expressed that on the revival of the patent, as the remedy only during the war was suspended, the right to take action i u respect of an infringement will be restored. continue' during the war, but his right to take action in regard to them does not. then any one who uses a patent now would be subject to that liability after the war, and legislation was passed to enable licensees to be protected against being subsequently sued. These are three of the probable objects or reasons which influenced Ministers in Englandi n putting this measure on the statute-book. As the honourable member for Flinders has shown, we have f a r exceeded these objects, because we are really putting beyond all doubts patents that may be open to challenge. Again, we may be inadequately protecting the rights No t in this B ill , but it of the patentee whose rights are merely suspended. If we grant an exclusive licence for an inadequate fee, we are not only preventing others, but we are not compensating the man who is deprived of all his remedies.

If we impose a fine of £500 for in any way using a patented article, the right which is given to another to use it under licence amounts to an exclusive licence. member suggest that the patentee should still have the right to issue a licence? orable member for Flinders suggested that, if a licence is granted, the licensee ought to be placed in the same position as the patentee, but not a better. And we ought to see that the licensee pays an adequate consideration; otherwise we defeat one of the objects, which is to protect the patentee. show that the position of the patentee and the position of the licensee are not the same-that one has an effective remedy, while the other has not. pression is that, under the circumstances, this may be regarded as rather hasty legislation. [5.59] I am at a disadvantage in not having heard the remarks of the Attorney-General, though I did hear a portion of the speech of the honourable member for Flinders. From a legal stand-point, there is not the slightest doubt that the honourable member for Flinders has established a very strong position, indeed-a n almost unassailable position. Buti f we depart from the strict legal aspect, and' put aside for the moment the technical objection to the introduction of the penal terms, and regard the matter from a somewhat more practical point of view, I must say that I am not prepared to condemn, in the same wholesale fashion, the provisions of the Bill as they appear. I admit that the terms of the Bill indicate a better title for the licensee than that of the original patentee, and that strikes one at first as somewhat anomalous. But we have to distinguish between the two, in the emergency that has arisen. The original German patentee holds a monopoly, and has data and material at his disposal, in order to establish his title, benefit of employment. We can only that the licensee could not hope to have. The object of our legislation is to induce our own people, in the case of large and valuable patents, to invest, possibly, large sums of money, with a view to giving the Commonwealth the benefit of the patent. If the licensee is to be harassed, and doubts thrown on his title, we are placing him in a very serious position. Sir WILLI AM IBVINE -Does the honourable member wish the Crown to grant the licensee a new monopoly for an old invention ? far as to say, in the circumstances, that that might be justifiable, in order to insure that we are not deprived of the benefits of the patent. Some assurance should be given to the Commonwealth citizen who invests his capital in the production of the commodity. price for making good all patents now bad? ferring to all patents, but valuable German monopolies. It is from the practical, or public-policy, stand-point that I wish to deal with the question. First of all, we desire to encourage the investment of capital in a particular patent which we believe to be a good one; and a man, before he invests his money, desires to know that he is reasonably secure. This is either a good or a bad policy. If it is a good policy in the interests of the public, we should encourage the production in every way, and, practically, give to the licensee a new patent in order to encourage him to invest his capital, establish an industry, and give the public the benefit of the patented article. orable member give encouragement in the form of a monopoly in the case of an invention as old as th© hills? from the position that the German patentee has already got his monopoly, and that that monopoly has -not, up to date, been assailed.

To all intents and purposes the licensee should get a new patent; and that is a position we can justify from the public stand-point. As a matter of public policy, we give the licensee protection in order to bring about that production which previously was exclusively vested in the German patentee, and probably only known in the form of German imports. able member wish to give the licensee more protection than we give to one of our own patentees? Sir ROBERTBEST stand-point that, first of all, the German patentee has had a monopoly, and that the product of the patent is desirable for Australia. Therefore, we tell our capitalists that we w ill give them some assurance as to title, inasmuch as they are placed at a serious disadvantage in not being able to establish a title to the original patent in the absence of the. original material. protection by means of the Tariff, but in the particular case before us, we give protection by an assurance of title. tection by means of a bonus. after all, the licence is only a different form of protection in order that the industry may be-encouraged, and the benefits of it enjoyed by the Commonwealth. From a public policy point of view, there is much to be said in favour of the B ill as it is presented. I do not attempt to justify the B ill from a technical or legal stand-point; but, with a view to the protection and creation of an industry, I am quite prepared to support the terms of the measure. House is very much indebted to the honourable member for Flinders, who, out of the wealth of his legal knowledge in this particular direction, has given us valuable advice and guidance. knows of his wide practice and knowledge, and I think we may accept, without qualification or reservation, the legal advice that he has tendered. But I wish at once to join issue w i th the honourable member for Kooyong, who, unfortunately, did not hear the most telling portion of the speech of the honourable member for Flinders, and may, in his concluding sentences, have misinterpreted the honourable gentleman.

In a general fashion, of course, we all desire to encourage the increase of manufacture, particularly of patented goods. The honourable member, however, advocates a most I start fro m the extraordinary view. For the sake of getting capital introduced into an industry he is prepared to grant to one person a monopoly, exclusive and unassailable. law. honourable member would refuse to, probably scores or hundreds of others, the Sometimes we give right to embark in competitive investments. Sir WI . LI . IAMIRVINE O u r patent law applies only to inventions that are new. able member for Kooyong on the point was that accepted u n t i l about 350 years ago.

First of all, there was fixed a time l i m it , and, at the expiration of the fixed period, the community was given the great benefits which it was deemed to have been paying for, by way of royalties, for fourteen years. Then we arrived at conditions which were practically copied by the civilized world as manufacture spread itself abroad. So Everybody fa r as I understand, all that any community has done in the last century in regard to terminable rights is to consent to give the patentee a certificate.

Thus we have men trading on patent rights, with vast sums of money invested in their industries, who are subject to all the risks of this kind of competitive manufacture. I think it is good that it should be so. If a patent be good, it will stand the test of the Law Courts; if it be not, it will go down. Surely that rights are the basis upon which the whole is in the interests of competitive invention.

Thereupon the Attorney-General, aided by his Commissioner of Patents, may say, "" We will do neither of the things which we are asked, bnt we will issue to A, B, and Company a licence for thirteen years, which represents the unexpired portion of the title."" Now there may be half-a-dozen other applicants for suspension or voidance of that same patent. All of them may be desirous of laying down machinery and of entering into production under licence conditions, and yet the Attorney-General may say to them, ""We will give A, B, and Company a licence for that period."" That could be done whether the patent were good or bad. Under existing patent law, if it were bad, A , B, and Company would not take the risk.

It might be granted under the principle of preference to unionists. I do not say this with a view to throwing the apple of discord on the table. One of these men might be a unionist, and the other might not. Let us suppose that both apply to the Attorney-General for the suspension of a particular patent, and that such suspension is granted to one of them in accordance with the language of this clause. If he be true to the principles of which he is so able an exponent, he should give it in favour of the unionist. gentleman would believe that' the unionists would be better intrusted with the work because he was a unionist. tleman would give>it to the non-unionist. believe in preference of any kind. tleman onry practises it . either.

The honourable member for Balaclava said, in the plainest and most unmistakable way, that I , in the exercise of my judicial discretion in regard to this matter, would exercise it so that I should give preference, not to the man who was most fit, but, for party reasons, to some other person. I resent that. repeat that, although I followed the honourable member for Balaclava very closely indeed, I did not gather from his words the meaning attributed to them by the Attorney-General. There has evidently been a misunderstanding. the Attorney-General the assurance that I did not say that which he has attributed to me, and did not mean it. If I had used the words I should at once withdraw them. I acquit the honourable gentleman, and always have done so, of any attempt to improperly use the judicial functions intrusted to him. I was endeavouring to show that this power could be used by the honourable gentleman in the way I have described, ancl I said that, as he was an advocate of preference to unionists, it seemed to me tliat it should be so used by him if he were true to the principles he professes. I do not wish to continue the argument indefinitely. If the present Government were turned out of power, and the other party came in member will allow an "" if , "" which implies, not an expectation, but a hope? If that happened, I say this would then be an equally dangerous power to entrust to any body of men, if it is not absolutely necessary for the national safety. close with the observation that I trust that the Attorney-General will take counsel with the legal members on this side, who have expressed very strong views as to the legal effect of the clause which has been referred to, and that, if possible, before the Bill emerges from the Committee stage, the honourable gentleman will assure honourable members that only those rights which now exist wHJ, under the Bill, be transferred to the new holder of the I have had many opporpatent. Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 7.J/.5 p.m. I was rather surprised at the heat displayed in the debate by certain legal gentlemen, whose training ought to have shown them that it is a great advantage in argument to keep cool; nor could I quite understand the heated manner in which the honourable member for Balaclava endeavoured to discuss the question. It struck some of us that there must be some underlying reason for this display of temper and enthusiasm over a Bill of this character. I take it to be a Bill necessitated by the present disturbed state of the patent rights law, owing to the war. Certain patentees, being enemy subjects, have been deprived of their rights under their patents, and, as there is no legal authority to carry the patents on, the Government have brought in the measure to enable licences to be issued to persons willing to do so. The Attorney-General has repeatedly stated that the licensee will have no more privileges than the original patentee. A patent is a monopoly, but honourable members on the other side have been endeavouring to impress on us the enormity of the offence of monopoly. We on this side know quite as much, and a little more, about monopolies than they do, and have taken a little more interest than they have in the various monopolies from which the people suffer. In Great Britain a number of patentees, especially German patentees, have had a great monopoly over certain scents, dyes, and patent medicines. This caused the British Government some trouble, but they overcame the difficulty by enacting that, unless the patentee manufactured the article in Great Britain within two years, he forfeited his patent rights. Some of I these German patents are absolutely essential in trade. The honourable member for Flinders referred to one connected with the laying of rails for tramways and trains. Some provision would have to be made to meet cases of that kind.

No enormous capital is required for tliat. not, I have always endeavoured to encourage people to put their money into investments. The honourable member for Elinders, ably supported by the honourable member for Balaclava, seemed to display exceptional eagerness, determination, and perseverance to impress on the House that it) would, by this B ill , be creating monopolies, detrimental to the interests of those represented by us on this side. The facts, however, are plain. The honourable member for Flinders was in quite a new role in taking up the cudgels on behalf of tlie oppressed. The whole of the honourable member's argument is met by pointing to the circumstances of the times, which demand a B ill of this character. Butf o r the war the measure would not be before us. The complaint of some honourable members that it is oppressive and tyrannical might be justified in ordinary times, but it has no weight now. We have had a number of ornaments of the legal profession disagreeing this afternoon, but the Attorney General has maintained his ground, and, applying to the subject that business capacity which I think I possess, I have come to the conclusion that the B ill w ill not have the h a r m f u l effects predicted by the Opposition.

H is desire to give adequate protection to licensees or persons in whose favour there is a suspension of a patent under the original Act appears reasonable. patentee is blocked from operating [105]2 his patent, although the patent is one which it is desirable to work in the interests of the people. Our problem is to devise some protection which w ill encourage the person in whose favour a patent has been suspended to undertake the work. A patentee has the righ t to bring an action for damages for an in fringement of his patent. If another Whether that is so or person is to be put into the position of a patentee, we ought to see that he has all the rights and privileges as regards the protection of his in terests that the patentee had, but this B ill makes different provision from the right of action for infringement. It gives entirely new rights. The best way to test this is to ask what are the defences that can be raised upon an action for infringement. Terrill, in his book on patent law, sets out nine different defences that may be raised by the defendant for an infringement of patent. For instance, he may(1) Deny the plaintiff's title to the letters patent sued upon. (2) He may plead the leave and licence of the patentee specifying the circumstances. (3) He may deny ""that he has committed the acts complained of in the particulars of breaches. (4) He may deny that the acts complained of are infringements of the letters patent. There are various other defences which may be raised by a person who, it is alleged, has committed a breach of a patentee's right. you there. man has received a particular patent, ancl he has taken action, against the person for having infringed the patent. The validity of the patent can be questioned by the defence. Another defence that can be raised in an ordinary civil action is the Many silly things are want of novelty. As one of the Judges puts it If the public once possessed of an invention by any means whatever, no subsequent patent A licensee w ill can be granted for it either to the true or first inventor himself or to any other person, for the public cannot be deprived of the right to use the invention, and a patentee of the invention could not give any consideration to the public for the grant, the public already possessing everything that he could give.

The second point that was raised by the honourable member for Flinders was that the B ill was introducing a protection for the licensee which was not afforded in the original Act to the patentee. That is to say, if a man commits an infringement and a summons is issued against h i m, he may be fined £500 under this B ill , and this is new Protection. The honourable member for Flinders pontended that the original grantee did not have the same protection as the licensee would now have. cases are similar. favour the suspension may have been made ought only to get what the original patentee had. The right of the patentee under the original Act had something in it in the nature of a monopoly. He had the right to manufacture and sell a particular article, and could bring an action for damages and recover compensation against any person who infringed his rights. There is merit in being an original inventor; but so far as the licensee is concerned, the position is different. He obtains the right to sell any particular article by virtue of the fact that he is the first man in . first man at all. The Government might grant three or four licences. generally speaking, the position is as I have stated. The point is that, inherently, the licensee is not entitled to any merit in connection with any discovery. Such a right is given to the original inventor to stimulate and encourage the exercise of the inventive capacity in man. But the licensee has not done anything of that sort. He takes advantage of another man's invention; but it seems now that the Attorney-General is justified in giving him something in the nature of a monopoly if a licensee says, "" I am prepared to put my capital into this venture and manufacture the article for the good of the public."" what would be the position? four men want a licence, and will manufacture, in time of war like this, it might be given to each. I know from experience that at one time certain medical requisites were required, and it was essential that they should be manufactured. Now, if a man were willing to manufacture, and said, "" In ordinary times it would uot pay me, but I amprepared to do so in the public interest if I get a monopoly,"" and if it could be shown that competition after the war would close up his factory, it would be right and proper to give him something in the nature of a",36,Patents Trade Marks An D Designs Bill No 3

The point that we look at is this: When we do give a man a licence, what is the nature of it? How is it to be safeguarded and protected ? Then, if he has that privilege, the person who commits an infringement ought to be able to prove that the man was not entitled to it on the ground of want of novelty, or the other ground of invalidity. It is also doubtful whether we ought to enforce it by the penal provisions. I u this matter we are only trying to assist the Minister. In time of war, we ought to relax patent measures so as to be able to carry on all those industries that are essential to Australia. I have listened with a great deal of in terest to the clear exposition of the legal position by the honourable member for Flinders and the legal members who have followed him. granting licences is one which no responsible Minister will consent to except after the most exhaustive investigation into the particular character of the patent, and to the nature of the application. The principle of the B ill should be to embody or carry over into the licences just exactly that measure of protection which is afforded the original patentee. tration of one instance to the contrary ? Government laid down conditions under which the freezing factory should be erected in the Northern Territory. know that it is not quite on all-fours as an illustration, because a patent is a monopoly, and the granting of a licence by the Crown, generally speaking, is not on all-fours with the monopoly rights that exist under our patent laws. A t a time like this, it is advisable that there should be some elasticity in the Act , and discretion allowed the Attorney-Generali n the administration of any law of this nature. For instance, in Australia we might have 500 patent rights held by Germans, and in the public interest it might be advisable for the Attorney General to cancel or avoid 480 or 490 of them to allow of the manufacture locally of articles that were formerly protected.

I cannot understand the intention of the Government with regard to the penal clause in the case of a breach of the licences. I cannot understand why that clause was put in. I know that that is the policy of the Government, and I take it to be acceptable to the Opposition generally; but, in my opinion, although in a majority of cases it might be desirable in the public interest that the patents held by enemy subjects should be suspended or avoided, it might also be advisable, in particular instances, for the establishment of indusThe question of tries useful to the Commonwealth, for the Administration to go beyond the patent rights to give security to capitalists. licence now. greater rights are transferred to a licensee than were possessed by the original patentee. As a matter of general principle, that is as it should be; but in certain cases it may be advisable to give to licensees more protection than was possessed by the patentees. Generally, I am in agreement w i th the views expressed by the honourable member for Flinders, and I accepted by thc Attorney-General; but I think that there might be a reserve power which would enable a licensee to be given greater security than was possessed by the patentee, in order that important industries may be established in the Commonwealth. I do not know how f a r the treatment of the baser metals is dependent on patent rights, but what I suggest might be found very useful in regard to that matter. think that the Opposition is inclined to exaggerate the danger attendant upon the vesting of power in the A t torney-General.

The Opposition must trust the Government in this matter, as those who are now supporting the Government would havo to trust its successor. It is clear that there w i ll not be a rush to secure suspended patent rights. Patent questions are delicate matters to handle, and great expense would have to be incurred before any new industry of importance could be established. To successfully jump any claim would need very clever men. It is necessary to hedge w it h more than the ordinary security those licensed by the Goveniment to use patent rights. They r u n the risk of having the rights taken from them at the conclusion of the war, because the patents are only suspended, and in a re-adjustment following upon the war they might lose what had been granted to them. This alone entitles them to special protection while engaged in a manufacture whicli is distinctly to the advantage of Australia. I am inclined to agree w i th the opinion that their position should be made more secure than would be that of an ordinary patentee.

Why should not the right to use the patent be given to every individual who wished to use it? been applied for in these cases? it would not pay manufacturers to use the patent rights. The other alternative open to the Attorney-General was, on application, to suspend a patent altogether, in which case any person in Australia could manufacture the patented article. In regard to the thermit process, the Attorney-General has suspended the patent in favour of a particular individual. If , instead of doing that, he had granted a licence to every individual who desired to use the process, he would have done all that was needed. If a number of persons in Australia wished to take up that process, I cannot see why they should not be allowed to do so, or why a monopoly in regard to it should be given to one individual. monopoly must be assured to offer an in ducement to a manufacturer to take up the business. the Attorney-General granted a licence, and a firm commenced, to manufacture He could continue the patented article, no one else would attempt to enter the business, because it would not pay.

Sir WILLIAMIRVINE The Government -are going much further than that. year there is power to suspend patents on application. When that is done, f u l l legal protection is afforded to every person who infringes the patent rights. It seems to me that that is sufficient protection. Why should we give a monopoly to -any individual? ducement to manufacture. poly to one person? -& number of persons to enter upon the manufacture of the patented article. -a licence to manufacture, instead of suspending the patent. I see no necessity for this provision in the B ill , and, although I shall vote for the second reading, I shall oppose the measure later, unless the Government make considerable .alterations in it . The establishment of a monopoly is not si matter which troubles me very much i u this regard. I quite understand that tliere may be many businesses governed by the possession of patent rights which have been suspended, whose establishment would be very advantageous to the Commonwealth, in which, if a man could not get the whole trade into his hands as a monopoly, it would not be worthwhile to invest capital. I have risen to ask the Attorney-General whether he w ill be prepared to accept an amendment providing that where a patent is suspended, and a licence granted in respect of it , the licensee w ill not be put in a stronger position than was occupied by the original patentee. is referring to the question of the validity of a patent.

ThisB ill is of f a r more importance than it would at first sight appear to be. I take it that in this time of dire trouble, arising from the terrible war, if the Government confiscate any patent rights at all, they should hold them for the benefit of the whole community. In a case to which reference has been made during this debate, Mr Chinn, who was dismissed from his employment in connection w i th t.he construction of the K a l W h y give a monogoorlie to Port Augusta railway, because he Avas a Labour man, applied to have a certain patent right suspended. Mr Chinn, I believe, is a much-wronged man. When he made this application and sought to secure a licence to use the patent, he was opposed by another man who has been greatly benefited in connection with the railway to which I have referred; but the evidence in support of the application was so clear that Mr. Teesdale Smith retired, I believe, from the case. The patent related to the welding of rails, and certainly is an important one. As a member of the party of whom the Government are the mouthpiece, I wish to urge that if any man or body of men be deprived of patent rights in the stress of this terrible war, then all patent rights so suspended should be held by the Government for the benefit of the whole community. able in regard to a certain class of patents. patent rarely reaps any reward. The harvest is usually gathered by capitalists. That great mechanical genius, Mergenthaler, the inventor of the linotype, was allowed to die in misery in Chicago.

272,Dr. Maloney,"The inventor of atramways-that may he suspended or annulled. The honourable member for Wimmera, who interjected a few moments ago, probably thinks that it would not be worthwhile for the Government to take over the patents in respect of the manufacture of certain goods. Where that is not done, a licence granted to an individual to exercise the patent should not operate for any considerable length of time. The Government should always control the monopoly of patents. I would welcome the establishment of a Government workshop, where a man could experiment with his invention and submit it to tests. If that were done, then the Government, having assisted the man to develop his invention, should be entitled to a moiety of the benefits arising from it, or it could take over the whole patent, and allow the patentee a bonus in respect of every machine or article manufactured. tract for the Government. often have to face big contracts. We heard much the same kind of yelp when it was first proposed that the Government should take over the Post Office, the education of the young, ancl a thousand and one other public instrumentalities. over a thousand and one things. Japan, in connection with the tobacco monopoly alone, have taken over the manufacture of a thousand different things. I do not wish to delay the passing of this Bill. I have full confidence in the Attorney-General, who is to be given these practically unlimited powers. The eyes of Australia will be upon him, and I am sure he will not do anything to injure his party or to lower the glorious flag of Labour. The more we discuss this measure the greater are the difficulties with which we are confronted, and the more we have to look not so much at its legal aspects as at the objects sought to be achieved by it. I take it that the Blouse is anxious to commercialize the period of the war. We are anxious that some use shall be made of certain patents that are placed at the disposal of the community, and which deal very often with absolute essentials. They may relate to war material, to the construction of rails and other Government requirements. There are two points of view that we must not disregard. The legal aspect has been put very clearly by lawyers in the House, who have reminded us that Australia has fallen into line with all other civilized countries, in so far that it has declared by law its intention to grant monopolies for a period of fourteen years to the patentees of all inventions. By the Commonwealth Act of 1914 patents held by enemy subjects have been suspended, aud the debate to-night has centred round the question whether the Government should grant licences to manufacture or vend the goods to which these patents relate in competition with those who are prepared to take on what, I think, is a most insecure position. When the honourable member for Kooyong put the industrial side of the question before the Chamber, I did not follow him clearly. I now see that those who are going to carry on industries in this country under rights that are, to some extent, emasculated, must have a greater security than has been suggested inferentially by those who have said that no greater rights can be given to a licensee than are possessed by the holder of the patent to which it relates. I recognise that there is a good deal, from a legal, and also a moral, point of view, in the contention regarding the granting of greater privileges to licensees than we would give to ordinary patentees. This community, by no act of its own, has been deprived of the advantages which accrued to it under certain original patent rights, and we have to decide how it can make use of those patents, relating, it may be, to commodities essential to the life and well-being of the community. It can do so only by some form of concession or privilege. We cannot dogmatize as to what the exact nature of that privilege should be; but it seems to me that the Government would do well if, instead of granting licences on a wholesale scale, it would confine its attention to patents relating to commodities that are essential to the needs of the country, in the hope that the war will not be of long duration. There is something to be said for the contention that the declaration of war deprived certain people of patent rights.

T tion, and show how it is possible to get men of business knowledge and commercial enterprise to enter upon these undertakings unless they are given some form of security that, during the period of the war and for a considerable time thereafter, their right to use the patents concerned will be continued in such a way as to place them in the position of the original holder of the monopoly. The term "" monopoly "" at first causes one some alarm, but our own patent laws create an absolute monopoly for a period of fourteen years in respect of every patent granted. Any man who is prepared to take up an established industry, and to carry it on for the unexpired term of the' patent relating to it, seems to me to require substantial protection. I hope that the Attorney-General will not be disposed to pay too much attention to the arguments of the Opposition, and to so alter this Bill that those who engage in certain industries here may be insufficiently protected. As the result of the war, we are living in exceptional times, and the Government of Britain have recognised this fact in regard to the patent law. I read only a few days ago that they were ready to stand behind those who were prepared to enter upon the manufacture of dyes and other materials that are so essential to the community-anc l to stand behind them to the extent of millions of pounds. money straight out to them. as to what form thc encouragement shall take. Sir WILLI AM IRVINE -But the encouragement offered by the British Government does not take the form of prohibiting citizens from continuing to carry on manufactories which they are honestly working. The Government, by this Bill, will create a monopoly, with all the worse mischiefs of monopoly, if they validate a -bad patent. honourable member's fears will'be dispelled by the Attorney-General's reply. Sir WILLI AM IRVINE -Yes, if he will accept an amendment. honourable member says that if the Attorney-General will accept his view all will hardly approve of the sort of tacit consent that the Attorney-General has already given to the suggestion that those who are licensed to carry on certain works to which patent rights relate sliould have no more rights than were enjoyed by the original patentees. they? ber for Kooyong has replied to the honourable member's contention. I am not going to be a stickler for the legal features of this question. I shall vote with the object of trying, as far as possible, to establish in Australia industries that have previously been carried on in Germany. I wish to see Australian workmen manufacturing goods previously supplied to us by Germany. the honourable member for Flinders is so disturbed about this matter. I cannot see in clause 4 the awful danger that he sees. He has had a nightmare over the provision. Evidently he has studied the measure and come to the House prepared to debate it . Honourable members paid him every attention while he was dealing with what I admit is a very intricate subject from the legal and technical point of view. My endeavour is to bring a practical mind to bear upon the question, because I believe that it has a practical, as well as a legal and technical, Coos -B y lending the side, and my hope is that under the provisions of the Act now in existence and the Bill now before us, the Government will be able to take in hand some of the patents which it is absolutely essential should be under their control. I think that every honourable member will agree to the action taken by the Attorney General in granting the power to operate a certain patent to the Engineer-in-Chief of Commonwealth Railways instead of suspending the patent rights in order that a few of the cutest men in Australiamight get a licence to operate them.

That leads me to the position I wish to put as a layman, looking at the matter from the outside, without any reference to fiscal theories or that sort of thing. Why should we hamper the community in its industrial operations by conferring any favour upon any particular individual to the exclusion of other individuals in the community ? Many of the things in daily use are subject to patent rights. In our Post Office we use, or we did until very recently, material of an absolutely in ferior character because of the existence of patent rights. Here is a chance to relieve the community fro m a disability imposed upon it by the exercise of patent rights by German or other enemy patentees. I refer particularly to the jacks that we used to use in the telephones. Years ago, we had to use a particular type of jack, and, though th© experts of the Department said that there was a very much superior article to be obtained, we were prevented from using it because of these patent rights. I understand that that condition of affairs in some respects still continues.

Mr JO d EPHCOOK All I know is that we are legislating to put discriminating power into the hands of the Government. for the patents? tliere will be a great rush of applications for many of these patents, particularly in these days when prices are ruling high and the temptation to industrial enterprise is very great. I only want to see the best done for our industrialists in Australia, and for the life of me I cannot understand how it can benefit our industries as a whole if any one individual is given a right as against the rest of the industries of Australia. During the currency of these patents our industrial efficiency is lessened. Now, owing to this cataclysmic upheaval we are relieved of that kind of thing, yet this B ill , it seems to me, is going to take what advantage we have, as the outcome of the war, and place it at tiie disposal of the Government, with the idea of its being given again into the control of some individual as against the community as a whole. An y Government will have to use a power like this with great discrimination, for, if two or three people apply for the same patent, only one can get it . Therefore, there is to be favour. That is the word used in clause 3. Favour wil l have to be shown by the Government to one man as against another. A protecting ring is to be drawn round one man to the exclusion of all others. They may be equal in their ability to tlie man who gets into the inner circle by the rights conveyed by this clause, and I should like to hear some further argument on that aspect of the Bill-wh y there should be any discrimination at all in favour of individuals, seeing that the war has given us possession of rights that were formerly held by enemy patentees. That is the position which appeals to me under this B ill . I tude taken by the honourable members for Flinders and Darling Downs is correct, and that we should confer no further powers upon a licensee than were possessed by the original patentee. cannot conceive that any harm would come to our industrial enterprises as a whole if such a limitation were placed in this B ill . My own impression is that, by spreading the operation of the Bill over I do not know. the whole of our industries, we should be giving infinitely more relief to the community generally than we shall give by granting a monopoly to any one indiviB u t who wil l apply dual. COOK I feel sure think the House may congratulate itself that the B ill has brought from members of the Opposition expressions of opinion of a much more f r a n k and hearty character than they were disposed to favour us with in connection with a former war measure. W it h my friend the honourable member for Maribyrnong, I realize that if even a junior member of the legal profession rises to speak, his action immediately leads to the impression that he will naturally take that peculiarly technical and unstable view-ofte n unpracticalknown as the legal view, as against the view of those persons whose business it is to express practical opinions in matters of this kind. I have always felt, and I still feel, that there is not, in a matter of this kind, as wide a gulf between the technical and legal and the practical position as some honourable members suppose; and I should like to put forward one view in connection with clause 3 which, perhaps, should be more properly debated in Committee, but which has been f u l l y discussed on the second reading. Mr JosEi'ir Coon -That clause really is the B ill . main principles of the B ill , and it is a curious thing that the Protectionist argument should have been so used to buttress that clause as it at present stands. Doesi t occur to honourable members that if the Protectionist argument is to apply at all the effect of this clause w ill be to protect German patents, because these German patents are to be suspended, we assume, for a period which w ill end either w it h the termination of the war at the earliest, or some time before the expiration of the period for which the patents exist ? ing to the Attorney-General. a brief period, then as soon as the war is over we may suppose that the original I patentees w ill seek to become possessed of their patents again, together w it h a l l",44,William Irvine Ar E You Pre Rights I N Respect Of Suspended Patents

A monopoly which is open to attack could not stand the test. Sir WILLIAMIBVINE gestion, anyway. have some explanation from the Attorney General regarding this proposal. What is the object? I cannot conceive why these particular patents in the hands of a licensee are to be treated in a different way from other patents. Why should they be protected from, attack? saying in this B ill , that we w ill protect patents owned by Germans-by alien enemies? We are going to take them over, and clause 3 establishes special laws for their protection. It may be that the patent to which the law will apply will be a perfectly rotten thing. There are hundreds, I suppose thousands, of patents issued already, and to be issued, in Australia, which would not stand a moment's attack if they were to be attacked. Y e t , if they are taken over as patents issued to enemy aliens, they will have the advantage of this clause, which protects them from oil attack, because the B ill imposes a very severe penalty, as has already been pointed out, upon any person seeking to manufacture the article in question. A t the present time anybody may start manufacturing, and his righ t to manufacture is a matter to be tested under civil law. If that is Protection, it is the kind of Protection to which I do not, as a practical person, or as a legal person, propose to lend any support. understand it , is the price, or, as I prefer to call it , the subsidy, paid to manufacturers in the for m of duty to enable them to set up local industries in this country. In that case, there is some competition at the worse, unless we have absolute prohibition. In the case of these patents we have absolute prohibition. A patent may be the rottenest in the world ; it may be incapable of standing any investigation or opposition if such were applied to it ; but because it has been taken over by the Government, and a licence issued to some persons to manufacture the article, it is to be exempted from the ordinary laws relating to patent rights. If we do, as the half-a-dozen times that that is not so, or, if it be so, it is not intended. have that assurance; but the words of the B ill certainly appear to convey what I have stated, and I venture to suggest that T h a t is the sugthey may convey that meaning to the Courts when they are called upon to S u r e l y we ought to answer any question relating to such patents. ney-General) [9.17] I think the House is to be congratulated upon its freedom, during this discussion, from all the traditional ties that usually hamper its eloquence and powers, and on the manner W h y should we say, as we are in which it has approached this measure.

The period and conditions of the licences must be sucb as will induce persons to set about the manufacture of these articles in this country, and the circumstances of each case must be considered separately. Those are the principles which underlie the original measure. I venture to say that they are principles with which every honourable member in the House is in accord. They recognise, first of all, the fundamental principle-and it is a fundamental principle, although it has been of late foully violated-that private property is not subject to expropriation in civilized warfare. It recognises that a patent right is granted primarily to encourage the in ventor, and, secondly, to protect the in terests of the community. It limits a monopoly to a period, at the expiration of which the patent is free to all. And usually a patent ""is available to the community during the term of the patent on payment of a price which sometimes takes the for m of a royalty. The 1914 Act, recognising these principles, was drafted to deal with very special circumstances. In that measure the Minister is given power to suspend or avoid a patent. In all that has been said to-night, the exercise of the power to avoid a patent has not been affected or called into question, because if a patent right be avoided, then ipso facto it becomes the common property of the whole nation; if it be suspended wholly or in part, and a licence be granted I was about to say to an individual, then the matter is in a patent is avoided it becomes common It is, if you property, and any one may use it , but in deciding whether a patent ought to be I agree with the honsuspended or avoided we must look at the so that the community may get it . grant licences where you suspend the patent, do you? where we suspend the patent.

But, unless the licensee be protected, this is not possible. I come now to another phase of the matter.

Tlie rights of a patentee are safeguarded by may briefly refer to the matter. a royalty, and the rights of th© Crown are safeguarded by the same means; the royalty does not necessarily flow wholly to the patentee or wholly to the Crown. This measure has been assailed from so many different points that it is difficult to deal with them all, but I am endeavouring to do so. As I say, the royalty f u n d is not necessarily wholly at the disposal of the patentee. First of all, it has to await the terms of peace, and, secondly, its disposition has to await the decision of this or some future Parliament and the Government which exercises the Executive power. The Crown is surely entitled to some consideration for having carried on the business of the patentee; and the fees enable the Crown effort expended in carrying out these meaI w ill come to the sures on behalf of patentees and the I come now to the proposal in the B ill .

333,Mr Hughes,"the whole of Australia, the licence is granted to one person; where there is ample opportunity for several, licences are extended to several. Otherwise, no man would put enough capital into a business to insure that ample supply for the community that we desire. come to the manner in which we propose to give a licensee those rights that are necessary to induce him to invest his capital and to insure him against competition, generally, by unauthorized persons. Under the Bill we give the licensee rights that a patentee does not possess. The patentee, at the present time, has a right to sue in a Civil Court for damages for infringement. That is his only remedy; and, according to the honourable member for Balaclava, he has had no other remedy for 350 years. It has been urged tonight by the honourable member for Balaclava and others that this Bill is a new departure, which creates a new criminal offence, and that we have no right to give a licensee remedies other than those given to a patentee. That view, in my opinion, is quite wrong. It is assumed, in the first place, that the licensee is in to the unfortunate clients. I venture to exactly the same position as the patentee, but, as a matter of fact, he is not. A licensee during the war, no doubt, might be given the right to sue for infringement, just as a patentee may sue; but both during the war and after the war a licensee will be in a position quite different from that of a patentee. ""When a patentee comes into Court, he is the only person who can sue for infringement. His monopoly is complete, and excludes the whole world; he alone has the right, against all tlie world, to make or sell the Courts of this and every other country, article. If he can prove that anybody has infringed his right, the damages are measured by the circumstances. But a licensee, when he comes into Court, cannot, like the patentee, say that he has a monopoly against the world-that nobody else can sue for infringement, for he has not an absolute monopoly. He shares it with the patentee and with other licensees, for the patentee never loses his right to sue for infringement. It is perfectly obvious that the damages given to the licensee for infringement of his right cannot be those ordinarily given to a patentee. licensee get any right to bring an action revoked on the ground that it is not new, -for infringement? Mr Hughes. has any riglit, but supposing we give him that right, the question then is, is he in as good a position as a patentee is ordinarily? Obviously not. I now come to another point. I think that a licensee, I now under this Bill, should be put in a better position than a patentee is ordinarily, because a licensee is a trustee for the community, for the purpose of establishing a new industry and creating a new opportunity for the -people of Australia. He is acting as the licensed agent of the Crown for a public purpose, and we ought to protect him by some special means, in order that he may not be put to the expense and difficulty involved in seeking redress by civil process. I know that this measure is a blow at my honoured profession, and I realize that there will be some ""weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth."" I know that, under the patent law, there are opportunities for advising clients in regard to infringements-of egging them on, holding them back, or leading them this or that way-opportunitie s glorious in themselves, though perhaps disastrous say that, nevertheless, the method proposed by the Bill is absolutely fair and proper in the circumstances. We create, as it were, a new kind of patentee, who has to carry on a business for the benefit of the community. And are we not going to safeguard hinj? Are we going to throw around his neck a millstone of litigation at the end of the war? What will happen at the end of the war ? Germany will make every effort to regain her trade. She will not hesitate, in the to endeavour, with financial and other assistance, to once again get hold of that ever-increasing volume of trade that was hers before the war. We desire to provide beyond all possible doubt that these licensees shall be safeguarded, and that any man who puts his money into a business under licence shall be assured during the currency of the licence that he is safe against any attempt to chouse him out of his rights. I now come to a point raised by the honourable members for Plinders, Angas, and Darling Downs, that we are giving a licensee more than a patentee had. In an action for infringement of patent rights the defendant is at liberty to prove",48,William Irvine Ar E You Pre Rights I N Respect Of Suspended Patents

335,Mr Hughes,"I do not say that heand to set up a number of other defences. Very well. I quite agree with those who say that these defences ought to be given to defendants under this B ill . I think it is fair and proper. When the honourable member for Flinders contended that this B i ll would give to the licensee more than the patentee himself enjoyed, I did not accept his statement. I said that it would not. matter, I say that it is very questionable whether that view might not be fairly argued. When the honorahle member for Darling Downs was speaking, I said that if ambiguity existed in the B ill I would remove it by stating in plain words exactly what is intended. WhatI wish to convey is that under this measure we propose to give every licensee the rights, whatever they were, of the patentee. If the patent contains a defect we do not intend to cure it in this way. We intend only to relieve the licensee of any necessity for maintaining his righ t in a civil Court; but, if the patent itself is bad, then the welfare of the community must be regarded, and in such circumstances the monopoly will cease, and the patent rights be evenly distributed over the whole body of the people. There is one more point that I desire to make. previously-is defect in the Act of 1914, wbich took away from the patentee the right to sue for infringement, and gave that right to nobody else, nor, even to the Crown. The powers given under clause 4, and the penalties which may be imposed upon any person who makes, uses, exercises, or vends a patent, ought not in my opinion to be exercised save by the Attorney General or some person authorized on his behalf. It is not a right which should be used by any man v/ho chooses to draw a bow at a venture. It is a remedy which should be used only in a proper case. Consequently I intend, in Committee, to move such amendments as will make that position perfectly clear. TheA c t of 1914 has been used for the benefit of the community, and, although we have not been able to exercise its provisions as freely as we would have liked, that has not been clue to any f a u l t of the Government, but to the fact that very few applications have been made for suspension or avoidance of patents. The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Richmond mentioned a number of cases in which patent rights were retarding the manufacture of better or useful articles. To them. I say: "" There is the Act ; let the public take 'advantage of it . "" If there is any German patent which can be manufactured in Australia, is the enterprise of the people of this country so hamstrung as not to take advantage of it? But having since looked into the I invite them to do so, and they may rest assured that this measure will be utilized to protect the community, and to encourage the manufacture in Australia of articles which are covered by German and Austrian patents. Question resolved in the affirmative. B i ll read a second time. In Committee: Clauses1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3After section three of tbe principal Act the following section is inserted :*' 4 -(1. ) Where a patent, or the registration, and all or any of the rights conferred by the registration, of a trade mark or design, has been suspended in favour of any person, any person other than the person in whose favour the patent, or the registration, as aforesaid, has been so suspended, who during such suspension(a) in the case of a patent, makes uses This provision-as I have said exercises or vends the invention formintended to cure a ing the subject-matter of the patent; or (b) in the case of a trade mark, uses in respect of the goods in respect of which it is registered, the trade mark or a mark substantially identical with the trade mark or so nearty resembling it as to be likely to deceive; or (c) in the case of a design, applies the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation of it to any article in respect of which the design is registered, or, without the authority of the person in whose favour the registration has been suspended, sells or offers or keeps for sale any article to which the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation of it has been applied, shall be guilty of an offence. Penalty: Five hundred pounds. "" (2.) Upon the conviction of any person for an offence against sub-section (1.) of this section, the High Court may, if it thinks fit, upon the application of the Attorney-General, issue an injunction to restrain the person from committing any further offence against that subsection. "" (3.) The costs of the determination of any such application shall be in the discretion of the Court."" ney-General) [9.53] I move That after the word "" pounds,"" line 34, the following new sub-clause be inserted :"" (IA) It shall be a defence to a prosecuplained-that it may be necessary for tion under this section if the defendant satisfies the Court that a petition for tbe revocation of the patent, or for the removal of the trade mark or design from the registhe period covered by the war. BubJ ter, as the . ease may be, would be successful."" The effect of my proposal, if adopted, will be to enable the defendant to raise all the defences which could be raised in an action for infringement under the Patents Act. infringement, or a petition for revocation, certain grounds of defence may be raised. In Frost's Patent Law and Practice, V o l . 1, 3rd edition, page 297, the practice is made clear. grounds for which a patent may be revoked are that the patentee was not the true and first inventor, that the alleged invention is not the proper subject-matter, or that it lacks the essential element of utility or novelty, or that the specifications are defective, or on any one of these grounds singly It may also be revoked on the ground that it was obtained in fraud of the rights of the petitioner. directs a certain thing to be done, which turns out to be not only unnecessary, but also disadvantageous and useless, the patent may be revoked on the ground of false suggestion. I have clearly shown tliat under the general defence, which can be raised under the proposed new subclause, all the points can be urged which could be raised in an action for infringement. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE (Flinders) [9.55] I am very glad that the Attorney-General has introduced this amendment, which entirely removes the most substantial objection which had to the language of the B ill . honourable gentleman has given us his assurance that the objections which could be raised on a petition for the revocation of a patent are as wide as those which may be made a defence to the action. Without having looked into tlie matter, I am inclined to agree with him. A t all events, I accept his assurance. That removes what was to my mind the substantial trouble which I experienced in accepting this B ill . I do not raise any objection to the penalty that ia proposed in lieu of damages, though it seems to mean extraordinarily awkward method of enforcing patent rights. But it is possible-as the Attorney-General has exthe Crown to have some power to protect these patents, seeing that it is thecustodian of this private property during would ask the honourable gentleman whether it is intended that a licensee or a person in whose favour a patent is suspended should be entitled to recover damages for infringement. Under this B ill it is proposed that the Crown shall take to Under bhat Act, in an action for itself the right to protect this property. I quite appreciate that proposal. It is further intended to give the licensee blie right to secure an injunction against in fringement. That also is proper. But I Amongst the do not know whether the penalty of £ 5 0 0 is intended to be exclusive of any claim for damages in a civil suit which the licensee might otherwise have. I throw this out for the consideration of the A t torney-General. He may thinlc it desirable to consultths Parliamentary Draftsman or his own colleagues as to whether-if we are going to give these substantial rights to a licensee, and to make him pay a substantial sum of money Also, where the specification for this monopoly-w e ought to invest him, not merely with the right to secure an injunction, but with the ordinary civil right of damages for wrong-doing by an infringer. The Crown protects the patent by criminal proceedings, and I understand that it is further proposed that the Attorney-General shall alone have the right to say whether or not a prosecution shall be instituted. Bub this power is also to be used for the purpose of inducing persons to put capital into industry. If that be so, we shall be giving a very great and valuable monopoly to individuals for which I presume we shall make them pay. II f they will give a big price for this valuThe able monopoly, probably they will also wish to protect it , not merely by injunction against past infringements, but by damages for future infringements. I am rather inclined to think that that is not provided for in this B ill . A t any rate, I throw oub the suggestion for the consideration of the Attorney-Genfiral. Following on what the honourable member for Flinders has said, I suggest that the effect of the amendment w ill be that an alleged infringer of a patent operated",49,William Irvine Ar E You Pre Rights I N Respect Of Suspended Patents
336,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,Attor,51,William Irvine Ar E You Pre Rights I N Respect Of Suspended Patents
337,Mr Brendan (Batman) [10.0],"under a licence will have a greater measure of protection than such a person has in ordinary circumstances. It will now be necessary to prove under the criminal law an offence against the person alleged to have infringed the patent. Sir ""WILLIAM IK VINE -Unless there is provision for an action for damages. is such a provision. It is more difficult to prove an offence under the criminal law against a person than to merely weigh the respective rights of two individuals under the civil law and turn the balance against the same person. If , then, we do not insert some clause making provision for damages, we shall be giving a more extended protection than possibly the Attorney-General intends to a person who, following the words of the clause, ""makes, uses, exercises, or vends the invention forming the subject-matter of the patent."" I suggest that the Attorney-General should bear that in mind. nre one or two matters to which I should like to direct the attention of the Attorney-General. There is power under the regulations and under the Act to grant a licence, not only where a patent is suspended, but where it is avoided. So far as I can find out, they do not avoid patents in the United Kingdom, and for two reasons. One is that it is contrary to what is generally done between nations, because patents are not cancelled. As a matter of fact, I believe that, Germany has not touched the patent law at all so far, ancl France has only modified it to some extent. There is another reason, and that is that you cannot grant a licence for a patent that has been avoided, because if it is voided it is declared absolutely non-existent. For that reason regulations which provided, as ours do, for granting licences for avoided patents have been described as ultra vires, and to an extent absurd. I wish to know from the Attorney-General whether he intends to act upon the powers given by tlie regulations to avoid patents upon application being made, because if he does he cannot grant licences for those patents. To do so would be contrary to the policy of these Acts, because it is not the intention to destroy patents unless they could be destroyed for some reason which would have been applicable and of force before this legislation was passed. The regulations provide that a licence may be granted whether a patent is avoided or merely suspended; but this Bill provides for a penalty where there is a licence granted upon the suspension of a patent. The Bill does not touch the avoidance of patents at all. The draft of the Bill seems to me to recognise what I say is the proper policy. The Attorney-General has recognised that, or he would not submit a Bill dealing with suspension only, but in his reply to the debate on the second reading the honourable gentleman talked about avoidiug patents as well as suspending them. I understand that he stated that it was not intended to grant a licence where there has been an avoidance of a patent. it seemed the proper thing to avoid a patent where the community gets the whole benefit of the patent, but where the -There community could not get the whole benefit it was necessary to suspend the patent and grant a licence. administration, and we are only trying to help in this matter. I hope that very grave consideration will be given before any attempt is made to avoid a patent, because it is not the policy of this legislation to do that. Under proposed new section 4 "" wliere a patent . . has been suspended in favour of any person "" certain things shall follow, and apparently the intention is to grant the licence to the person in whose favour a patent has been suspended. But I point out that other persons may want licences. My own impression is that a patent is not suspended "" in favour of any person,"" but upon the application of any person. That is what the regulations provide for. Clause3 of the regulations provides thatThe Minister may, on the application of any person, and subject to sueh terms and conditions, if any, as he thinks fit, order the avoidance or suspension in whole or in part of any patent or licence the person entitled to the benefit of which is a subject of any State at war with the King.

Clause5 of the regulations provides thatNotwithstanding anything in these regulations contained, the Minister may at any time, if in his absolute discretion he deems it expedient in the public interest so to do, order the avoidance or suspension in whole or in part of any such patent or licence upon such terms and conditions, if auy, as he thinks fit. That does not touch it . That is an independent power. it. Under that regulation I am not to wait for an application. I may act of my own volition. the honourable gentleman may act on his own initiative. speaking of. Where there is an application, proposed new section 4 seems to imply that the licence shall be given only to the person who applies for the suspension of a patent. but the clause does not say so. provides thatWhere a patent, or the registration, and all or any of the rights conferred by the registrapatentee will have the right to grant a tion, or the trade mark or design, has been suspended in favour of any person, any person other than the person in whose favour the patent, or the registration, as aforesaid, has been so suspended. That refers to the person who made the application for the suspension; but there is nothing in the regulations, or the existing Act , to say that there is a suspension "" in favour of "" a particular person. There is a suspension "" on the application "" of a person. Clause6 of the regulations saysIn any case in which the Minister makes an order in pursuance of the Patents, Trade Marks, and Designs Act 1914, avoiding or suspending a patent in whole or in. part, the Minister may, in his discretion, grant in favour with the rights of the patentee at all, but of persons, other than the subject of any State at war with the King, licences to make, use, exercise or vend the patented invention. upon an application for suspension being successful, the applicant may be the person to get the licence, or any one afterwards; but then the suspension would not be in favour of the applicant, but in favour of the general public. Under proposed new section 4, it might be only the person who first applies for the suspension of a patent who would have the right to a licence. suggests the omission of the words "" in favour of any person "" ? better convey what is meant. to be considered. When the war is over, what will be the effect upon the patentee's rights?

What will his position be? Can he grant other licences? Can That is not what I am he sue for infringement by other people; or what can he do? TheB ill does not deal with that. It is a difficult subject, and I ask the Attorney-General to consider that point also. under the principal Act and this B ill , the Minister may take away from the patentee all his rights except possibly his right to sue for infringement when the war is at an end. I do not think that the licence to any one else. is not proposed by the B ill to give an exclusive licence. It gives the effect of an exclusive licence by putting other people under a severe penalty if they manufacture the patented article while the licence is in existence. But that does not deal with the patentee. point also. for Flinders has referred to the penalty. I have spoken of the international policy, and have said that it is not to interfere to cover the effect of the suspension of his rights, to protect him, and to enable the public to have the use of the patent Under that, in the meantime. This penalty will go to the Crown. W h y should there not be some provision made, by regulation or under the Act , to pay the penalty to the person whose rights are affected, and who might be tbe licensee or the patentee? There might have to be an apportionment of the penalty between the two.

Without occasion, of course, there need be no report. [10.17] -That is not quite what I want. This proposal is clearly protective. The protection is to be exercised by the Executive away from Parliament, but I hold that whatever protection is granted to individuals under this proposal should be the grant of this Parliament in the last resort. I am only asking that when the Attorney-General makes an exclusive grant of the kind, which is in its very essence protective, and intended to be protective, he should let the House know place.

If Parliament thinks I am not fit to exercise the same powers as a relatively subordinate oflicial of the Department, it had better say so. Under these measures the application has first to be made to me. The Commissioner hears the evidence and puts it before me, but makes no recommendation. I act on the evidence, and if it appears to me proper to suspend, I suspend; if it is proper to refuse the application, I refuse it ; if it is right to grant a licence, I grant it .
