WAR PENSIONS. received from the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz.:-""The unsatisfactory administration of the Repatriation Department in regard to war pensions and other allowances to returned soldiers and their dependants."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. In the early part of the session I took action with a view to bringing under the .notice of the Minister for Repatriation the position in regard to war pensions and other allowances which are administered under the Repatriation Act. Since then no improvement has taken place. motion the question of the administration of ""War Service Homes, but for the fact that in connection with 'that <ad.i-: ministration in New South Wales, a report is to be placed upon the table of the House in the near future. Upon that account I refrained from the action which I had contemplated. The matter which forms the subject of this motion is one of considerable importance, because it affects a very large section of those men who were in the fighting-line, and who, when leaving Australia, were promised that ample provision would be made for them in the event of their suffering any disability, either of a permanent or a temporary character. to-day we find that there are hundreds of complaints from returned men who are partially, or in some cases wholly incapacitated., because their pensions have either been reduced or discontinued. I remember reading the debate which took place in this chamber when the Repatriation Bill was under consideration. Upon that occasion it was pointed out by honourable members upon this side of the House, and particularly by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), that the transfer of war' pensions from the Old age Pensions Department to the Repatriation Department would prove very unsatisfactory to the soldiers themselves. I also recollect the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) moving to recommit that measure for the purpose of reconsidering this phase of the question. His motion was defeated by only nine votes, clearly demonstrating that at that time there was not a very large majority in this chamber in favour of transferring war pensions from the Old-age Pensions to the Repatriation Department. Since then it has been amply proved that the transfer was a mistake. The change has in no way reduced the cost of administration. As a matter of fact, the administrative costs under the Repatriation Department are greater than they were under the Old-age Pensions Department. In the latter Department we had officers who, by reason of long experience, knew exactly how to handle the claims of applicants for pensions. These officers were also very sympathetic with the claimants. They understood precisely how to deal with I would have included in my old people and with our soldiers. When the war pensions were transferred to the Repatriation Department a considerably increased staff had to be employed. at the request of the soldiers themselves. I am altogether dissatisfied with the way in which the clerical work of the Repatriation Department is performed. Most honourable members have a large correspondence with that Department in connection with these matters, and my own experience is that when it forwards replies to my communications it frequently omits to name the township in Yet, which the particular applicant concerned resides.. I have, therefore, either to keep a. complete list of the names of the applicants who are communicating with me, or else, to request the Department to forward me the address of"" the particular applicant whose claim is the subject' of",23,Setup

But instead of doing so it merely sends a formal acknowledgment of the request with an intimation that the matter will be given consideration. Then, probably in three or four weeks time, another letter from the Department will come to hand.

Sub-section 1 of section 7 of Act No. 6 of 1920 statesFor the purposes of this Act there shall be a Repatriation Commission, which shall, subject to the control of the Minister, be charged with the general administration of this Act. This is definite. It was intended, and was made clear, by this Parliament that the Commission, upon appointment, should be subject to the control of the Minister. made for the creation of the Commission, Parliament decided, according to sub-section 1 of section 13, thatThere shall be a Repatriation Board for each State, to consist of three members. It is the State Board which is making the mischief. member proceed to quote sections 26 and 27? to do so. I emphasize that it is the State Board which is causing the trouble. In The wording of the section testifies bestead of following the lines laid down by yond doubt that when this Parliament the Pensions Board-so .permitting local was dealing with the subject of pensions One would medical men, or medical officers appointed by the Government in various districts, to make periodical examinations in order to ascertain the -state of a recipient's incapacity-the New South Wales State Board appointed a medical officer from Sydney. Here is where the mischief comes in. He goes out into the country and examines various former soldiers who have been in receipt of pensions. He makes his investigations, asks such questions as he may deem necessary, comes to certain conclusions, and testifies thereon that So-and-so is now only two-thirds, or one-third, incapacitated, and that his pension. should be accordingly adjusted. cision is against the advice of the local medical man who has been attending the returned soldier throughout. always the case. The only construction I can put upon the consistent way in which these reports go against the views of the regular medical attendants is that the officer from Sydney desires to justify his appointment by the actual amount of saving which he is able to make for the Commission in respect of pensions paid. Section 26 reads(1) Each Bpard shall ibe charged with the duties of(a) determining whether the death or incapacity of a member of the Forces in .fact resulted from an occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the Forces, and, in the case of incapacity, the nature and extent thereof; (6) determining whether the death or incapacity of a person enlisted or appointed for service in connection with naval or military preparations After provision had been or operations in fact resulted from his employment in connection with those preparations or operations; (e) determining the extent to which persons alleged to be dependent upon a member of the Forces were in fact so dependent; and (d) assessing the rates of pensions of members of the Forces and their dependants, and determining tlie dates the honourable of the commencement of such pensions.

It reads :My Committee desire mo to convey to you their appreciation of your very fine efforts in the House of Representatives on the question of pensions. We feel sure that you are sincere in your efforts for the betterment of our disabled comrades and relatives, and hope that you are granted the health to pursue this question to a successful issue > This is what I wish to direct particular attention toI t is very hard, indeed, to have the fact brought home to us in such a dastardly manner that we are so soon forgotten, but very pleasant, on the other hand, to know that We still have friends who are not afraid to champion the rights we fought so hard for.

That, is a communication from a representative of the returned soldiers. These men opposed me at the last election; but the MinisterI am fighting for what I think are their rights. During the great crisis in 1914 and the following years, when men were being asked to go to the Front, we offered every inducement to those who were prepared to volunteer by saying that we would stand by them and see that their interests were protected. We said that they should not want as a result of their patriotism; but, although"" the war has only been over for two and a half years, the returned soldiers are beginning to realize that they are almost forgotten. endeavouring to prevent it.

I sincerely regret that there is a tendency to forget these men who did so much for us during that trying period. It does not reflect to our credit when we realize what is. actually occurring. Even to-day we hear much of patriotism and the freedom we enjoy under the British flag, but the very men who have been prating about their loyalty axe not prepared to stand behind the soldiers who went forth to preserve our liberty. On every hand inducement was offered to men to go to the Front, but now it seems that their noble efforts are to be forgotten. The men are beginning to see the true position, and it is up to this Parliament to do something to rectify*their wrongs. We can only create loyalty by making the masses contented and happy, but that result will not be achieved if we are constantly taking advantage of those who sacrificed so much for our liberty.

There are some instances in which -men who are performing light work are receiving one-half or two-thirds of what they did previously. In any case in which a man is unable to . do any work, he should be given the ful l pension. I ask the Minister to give this matter his very serious consideration.

I believe that honourable members generally are agreed that the .present method of .administering pensions is absolutely unsatisfactory. As one of those who voted for the appointment of the new Commission to deal with pensions, I want to say that, if I had the opportunity to-day, I should be very pleased to put the members of the present Commission out of office, and to restore the administration of these pensions to those who previously carried out the work. It really appears to me as if the majority of the present Commission seem to think that it is their duty to cut down every pension they can, with a view to saving money, and without consideration for the rights and justice of the cases of different individuals. is a fair statement to make. must adhere to that statement, because I of living. I shall read a letter received intend, to bring under notice one or two from the medical oflicer of the Bedford cases in which the action taken by the Commission seems to indicate that they must have had some consideration of the kind in mind. I wish to refer to some of the "" TB "" cases of men in different sanatoriums. I refer, first of all, to the case of James E. Cooke. This man enlisted and went to France. While at the Front, he was sent iiito hospital, and it was discovered that he had this fearful disease of tuberculosis, and he was sent If men were accepted for back to Australia. He was put into a sanatorium, and it was there recognised that he was entitled to a pension. His health improved, and he was allowed to leave the sanatorium. His pension was' continued for a time after he left the sanatorium, and then it was suddenly reduced, and he was granted Â£ 1 per week. The reason given for reducing his pension was that he had suffered-and this was admitted-fro m what is medically termed empyema.. This really means an abscess on the lungs, for which an operation is performed, the pus is let out, and the abscess removed, but a scar is'left medical examination of the man must have seen this scar, and, by making inquiries, could have found out the cause of it. However, the man was passed as medically fit, .and went to the Front. then. all right, and fit to go -Â» that. He was passed by the medical officer as fit for active service, but now, apparently, because of the operation of which the scar is evidence, this man's pension 'has been cut down to Â£1. This is given as a sort of act of grace, and this man suffering from this awful disease, which requires all the nourishment he can get, is now asked to exist on Â£1 per week.

The empyema operation scar was visible at all examinations, and the man must have been in good condition to justify the medical offirefer indicate that there is some one outcers accepting him for active service in spite of the history of empyema, about which, so Cooke tells me, special inquiries were made. I sliall not read tbe whole of the letter, but it goes on to say that this man might have gone through the war. perfectly fit for active service, which bears out what the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) has said. The operation performed upon him did not necessarily prevent him being a strong, healthy man, and as Dr. Hayward, the writer of the letter, says, any medical man examining him must have noticed the evidence that he had been operated upon. He was passed by the medical officer in spite of this. There was no attempt to deceive the medical officer when the man submitted himself to examination, and yet, after all this time, we say to him, "" You can live as best you can on Â£1 per week. That is all that your country is prepared to do for you."" I wish to refer now to another case. I shall not mention the name, because another honourable member is dealing with the case, and the only point I desire to mention in connection with it is that Mr A. H . Teece, a member of the Repatriation Commission, was approached by the Returned Soldiers' Association of South Australia in connection with it, and made the following statement in reply:Where the Repatriation Department alleged that a disability was existent before the war, and the-pensioner claimed that it was not, the onus of proving otherwise rested with the Department. In this case, the man has been able to produce doctors' certificates and other evidence necessary to prove that there was not a suspicion that he had suffered from this complaint or was likely to suffer from it. After receiving a pension for a short time this man is left to-day with absolutely nothing, although he is suffering from this awful disease. ' Mr Blundell. It is dated 26th will give me particulars of these cases. Minister particulars of all the cases to which I refer. I should like to say here that I join with the honourable member for Hunter in admitting that the Minister does what he possibly can. My complaint is that the cases to which I side more powerful than this Parliament in deciding questions of this sort, which should be decided by us. The lesson is that honourable members should, in future, be very chary about handing over to the He was control of any outside Commission or Board matters which should be left in the hands of Ministers who may be controlled by the Parliament. could not expect the Minister to deal with every case. be very much more satisfactory if the administration of these matters were under his control. I have to refer to two other cases, those of Messrs. Shaw and Sinclair, which are somewhat similar to those to which I have already referred. It was not denied, in either of these cases, that the men, prior to being passed by the examining medical officer, had suffered years before, and there was a suspicion that they had suffered from this complaint. There is no suggestion that the medical officer was deceived or that the men attempted to deny the facts. He passed them as medically fit; they were enlisted, went through all the camps, and went away from Australia. cheered. They came back, and to-day are suffering from this complaint; but the Commissioners say that they were suffering from it before they went to the war, and' refuse to give them a pension. In effect, the Commissioners wipe their hands of these men, and leave them to live as best they can. When we were appealing to the able-bodied men of this community to enlist, every man who offered his services was cheered, as the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) has said, and men were allowed to leave for the Front only after competent medical officers had certified to their",28,Adjournment Formal

47,Mr Blundell,"Yes, and they werefitness. The two men to whom I refer, in common with others who enlisted, were examined, not once, but on several occasions, and were submitted to a final examination just before they embarked. How, then, can it be said that they were suffering from tuberculosis before they went away? They received a pension for a little while after their return, and were then informed that it would no longer be payable to them. What is the reason for this treatment? Is it that the Commission are out to save money by treating returned soldiers in this scandalous manner, or is it because they have not a proper appreciation of what were the views of this Parliament in passing legislation with the object of doing the fair thing by our men who went to the Front? I propose now to refer to the case of a man named Bromley, who does not come under the "" T.B."" category. He enlisted, was passed as fit, and went to the Front. While there he met with anaccident, went into hospital, and ultimately was returned to Australia. On his discharge, he was given a pension, which, later on, was reduced, and finally was stopped on the ground that he was fit to follow his usual occupation. The actual facts are that as soon as Bromley was able, after his return, to get about, he was given employment at the Keswick Barracks. He was suffering from spinal trouble, and could not stoop; but the work allotted to him at the barracks did not involve any stooping, and he was able to carry on. While at the barracks he received a pension. Owing to the gradual reduction of work at the barracks, Bromley left, and got another job where he had to stoop, The consequence was that he was taken ill, and went into the Keswick Hospital. Before he went there, however, his pension had been stopped on the ground that he was able to follow his usual occupation. He remained in the hospital for months, and, although he is out to-day, he is told by medical men that he must always wear a spinal jacket, and on no account do any work which will involve his stooping. And yet the authorities say that he is fit to follow his usual occuport, received from him an acknowledgpation, and refuse to give him a pension. occupation ? labouring work, and those who certify that a man in his state of health is able to do such work should be asked to have a try at it themselves. c locally, and his appeal, I think, has been sent on. He has a wife and two children, and another little one is expected. What are likely to be the feelings of a man who is treated in this way? Those responsible for such treatment have no compassion. Their sole object is apparently to cut off as many pensions as possible. They seem to think that by making reductions in this way they are carrying out their duty. I do not think they are, and will join with others in an effort to force these gentlemen to realize what the Parliament wants them to do in the direction of carrying out effectively the duty of Australia to those who fought for it. W. Bamford) -The honourable member's time has expired. Minister( Mr EodgeTs) said a few moments ago that I was one of the most favoured members of this House. As to that, I can only say that I realize that one can get nothing out of the Departments by running hostile to their official chiefs.

Let ns go back to the old system, or adopt any system hut the present one, which is rotten and unsatisfactory all round. I join with those honourable members who say that a considerable change has been noticeable since the alteration in the system of administering the pensions. I also endorse the statement that once a man was passed by the proper medical authorities and sent overseas, from that moment the Government accepted the fullest responsibility for his future welfare, whether the decision as to his medical fitness for service was right or wrong. No doubt other honourable members have received, as I have, numerous letters complaining of f aulty ' administration of the Pensions Act, the frequent excuse for refusing to pension being that the injury received was not due to warlike operations. I may mention the case of a Gurkha, a steady, haTd-working man, married to a white woman, and with a family of three children, whose injury the Department declared was not due to the war. As a matter of fact, that man had never had a day's illness in his life before he went to the Front. After being in the trenches for about, six least four or five independent medical months, he was blown up one day and was injured in the abdomen by a piece of the falling timbers. Since then he has frequently been vomiting blood. Upon representations being made to the Department he was subsequently allowed a pension of 7s. 6d. per week and a few shillings for his wife and children. Whether his pension was reduced because he is a coloured man I cannot say, but, at all events, there was an admission that his injury was due to war-like operations, though he has been denied full penanother case, which I think, should be sion rights. I may also quote the case of a man who had an injury to the knee of many years standing, but prior to the war it was practically all right, and he was passed for active service. As the result of excessive marching and hard work in the trenches, his knee gave way again, and it is now contended that as the injury had been sustained prior to the war, his claim for a pension cannot, be entertained. I could recite case after case in a similar strain, and I have no doubt that honourable members on both sides can do the same. I know of a consumptive boy who contracted the disease on active service, and for the last six months has been looking in vain for a convalescent home in New South Wales. I had a letter from him only this week stating that he was obliged to return to his own home because he could not get into a Government institution. that no tubercular case which medical testimony states requires treatment is turned aside. If there is no accommodation in the town or city in which the patient lives, it will be found for him in some other town or city. been unable to get treatment. honourable member will give me his name privately. I can assure him that the case will be attended to immediately. man who was injured during the war and whose pension has been stopped. He has a wife and three children, and he is now living in one of the war service homes. He has no income at all now, and does not know what is going to happen.

Even thc judges on the Eepatriation Board are likely to make a mis judgment, as they have surely done in my case. This man is in the last throes of his disease, and yet he has been declared by the Repatriation Department not to be suffering sufficiently to justify a pension. When he enlisted for service overseas, none of these trifling, straw-splitting questions were asked of him. medically fit, otherwise he could not have gone. When this man, and all the others who were invited to enlist for war service, came forward, they were told that certain things would be done for them in the event of any injury, and for their relatives in the event of their death on war service. are not being honoured, and I say it is time the Government took definite action iiu-regard to all these claims. I rise to support the motion that has been submitted by the honourable member for Hunter( Mri Charlton). ThoughI do not wish to repeat the instances given by honourable members who have already spoken, of soldiers injured on war service not being sympathetically treated, I desire to point out that this lack of sympathy and consideration for returned soldiers is not confined to the Pensions Department. It seems to be general throughÂ°the whole administration of the Repatriation Department; and with other honourable members who have spoken, I think it is time the Government took drastic action to remedy the present state of affairs. Things have come to such a p'as that it is an absolute scandal in every direction. Honourable members are being inundated with letters from returned time assistance is refused to men who soldiers, or widows of deceased soldiers, have found houses already erected. in connection with their claims' for pension privileges. They say that they are being starved of the amount of pension due to them, and which this House considered they -were entitled to receive. On small saving made by interfering with the comfort of these people, who deserve our best sympathy and proper treatment, is wasted in other directions. When I had the opportunity of speaking a week a'go in regard to the assets that would remain to the Commonwealth in connection with the expenditure incurred in building war service homes and settling soldiers on the land, I was asked to give definite instances of actual waste, the cause of which is exactly the cause of the trouble in regard to pensions, and that is lack of proper organization. Undoubtedly if the administration of war pensions had been left in the hands of the Department which had been accustomed for many years to deal with pensions, the results would have been much more satisfactory. In the same way if the building of war service homes had been left to people who had been building homes for workers in the various States we would not have had the evidence of waste that confronts us to-day. I want4 to point out the lack of sympathy disUnfortunately, those promises played towards soldiers who desire to obtain homes for themselves, and to urge that the Minister( Mr Rodgers) should seize the earliest opportunity of effecting a complete change in the whole method of the administration of the War Service Homes Department. Indeed, the opportunity presents itself now by reason of the fact that there is no War Service Homes Commissioner. The Minister told us, in speaking on this subject last week, that about Â£10,000,000 had been spent on the building of these homes, but when we examine the way in which the money has been spent, and the return from the expenditure, we are met with evidence such as appears in a paragraph in this morning's press, informing us that of fifteen houses built at Maryborough, Queensland, by fhe War Service Homes Commissioner eight are not utilized by soldiers, but are let to others.",33,Chapman Edenweather Is Too Cold Fo R Any Crisis The

The same thing occurs in regard to the man who, having purchased a home, finds that the demands of his occupation necessitate his removal to a distant part, and is unable to effect a transfer of his property to another person who is anxious to buy it, but cannot do so because he is unable to present an eligibility certificate. pose, but on this debate I will not be able to answer the points now being raised by the honourable member. He will see that it is hardly fair on his part to deal with war service homes questions on a motion dealing with war pensions. However, I will afford him an early opportunity of dealing with the other matter. will afford me another opportunity of dealing with the matter of war service homes I shall defer my remarks, except to say that definite instructions ought to be given to the Commissioner or Acting Commissioner that he must not have a kind of law of the Medes and Persians dealing with the matter, and should expedite the issue of certificates of eligibility so that the building of homes may be proceeded with. a direction that the fact that homes cannot be built is not a sufficient reason for stopping the issue of eligibility certificates. hear that assurance.

In any case he cannot be expected to be responsible for the individual cases which arise every day as the result of inefficient .administration. the administration of war pensions left in the hands of those who had been administering them efficiently? the representatives of the returned soldiers that the transfer should be made. now to get the control of war pensions out of the hands of the Repatriation Commission. experience. We, on this side of the House> do not profess to be perfect. But I have risen particularly to refer to one or two instances of inefficient administration. Members could speak for hours on the general disorganization of the Department without making any progress; but as we are constantly being invited, when discussing grievances of this nature, to bring specific cases under the notice of the Minister, I shall direct his attention briefly to two. A soldier, who had had considerable service overseas, returned suffering from heart trouble, shell-shock, and fits. In the Caulfield Hospital he was subject to frequent fits, but was discharged from the institution without a pension. When he made a claim for pension rights, the generous Pensions Department opened their hearts to the extent of giving him a miserable 10s. per week for himself, a wife, and two children, although he was totally unfitted to follow his pre-war occupation. Another case is mentioned by a lady who wrote to me on the 14th May from a place in the Corio electorate.

I may be chided by the Minister for having mentioned this case before taking it to him, but complaints of this kind are general among honourable members.

I acknowledge that in several cases I have got satisfaction from him, but in others there has been considerable delay, and, in one instance, nothing has yet been done. In this last case, an unfortunate soldier was drawing the f u l l pension for a little while, and was suddenly deprived of it. Within a fortnight he claimed an invalid pension. Honourable members know how difficult it is to obtain that pension, unless the applicant is absolutely incapacitated. much easier to get a war pension. a,wife and five children. He appealed about the matter, but they passed it over, to the Department, but it was three and this doctor is still entitled to examine months before his first letter was answered, returned soldiers. No man cares to be and for that time he and his family were examined by a lady doctor. [353] starving. I then wrote to the Minister, and got from him an immediate reply; but there was a further delay of three weeks. Finally the man was told that he was suffering from a pre-war injury, and was not entitled to a war pension. Now, those who volunteered for active service had to undergo a stiff medical examination, not once, but a number of times, and there was a final examination just previous to sailing. This man must have been in pretty good health to be accepted by the authorities. I do not know whether he went beyond England, She cannot keep the wolf but he was certified to by the doctors in Victoria as medically fit when he left Australia. Had he been suffering from any complaint previous to enlistment, the doctors who examined him should have discovered that fact. This man was willing to do his bit, and, of course, if he had suffered from rheumatism prior to enlistment, the trouble would have become worse in camp here, and would have been further increased by the life on board ship. But the man was accepted as fit, and no doctor can now say definitely that he had rheumatism before he enlisted. A doctor can merely guess at what may have been the original state of things. There seems a desire on the part of some doctors to cut down the war pensions as much as they can. I asked by interjection a little while ago if the Minister had instructed the doctors to do this, and he said that rio such instruction' had been given. ment. ter's denial. Some of these doctors are exceeding their duty. I know of a case in which a soldier who was getting 42s. a week had his pension reduced to 28s. a week on the word of a lady doctor, practically without examination.

This lady's remark showed that she has little sympathy w i th returned men. Weeks have gone by, and they are still waiting for a further examination; but they will have to wait months unless definite action is taken with the Commissioner or the Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation. Not long ago the allowance of a Mrs. Young was reduced. She' has a sickly daughter, who . sometimes earns as much as 30s. a week, and she lost a boy in the war.

A son of eighteen also. lives with her, and the Department told her that it was the duty of this son to help to support his mother. He is a good.' son, but a boy of eighteen does not earn very much. It is all very well for an official who is being paid Â£1,50 0 a year to make these suggestions; but it should not be forgotten that we promised the soldiers who went away that their widows and mothers would be given a fair and square deal. cases referred to the lads who were killed did not, before they enlisted, contribute to the upkeep of their mothers' homes. That is made an excuse by the Department whenever possible. MrM c GRATH made a grave mistake in the draftin g of our PensionsA c t ; but the Act should be administered more sympathetically. Probablyi n this case the Department would say that, because the boy who was killed was not earning more than Â£ 1 a week at the time of his enlistment, he was worth only 15s. a week to his widowed mother, it being forgotten that had he not answered t h e call he would to-day be earning Â£ 4 or Â£ 5 a week, and be worth so much more to her.

They are nearly all of them partly incapacitated, and most of them are married men.

I feel sure that instruction from the Assistant Minister to the head of the Department and the doctors to be a little more sympathetic in their dealings with incapacitated soldiers will have a beneficial effect. know that there are other members who wish to speak in this debate my remarks will be brief. I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without making it clear to the Minister that I am quite in accord with the protest which has been voiced by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) and others who have spoken on this motion. It is astonishing to me that action similar to that which has been taken to-day has been necessary at least three times this session. I am surprised that the Assistant Minister has not been able to do something to, at any rate, modify the grievances that are constantly brought before him. The fact that protests have been made from every part of the House is proof that there are good grounds for complaint. Of course, the Assistant Minister realizes that honourable members are not animated by any desire to attack his administration; they have said that they have found him hard working and f u ll of sympathy for the solparents might not, at the time, need his diers. But the House cannot be satisfied with that: We must have a change quickly, for I am afraid no Government could survive for long attacks such as are being made on the administration of the [353]2 If the men cannot I rose to emphasize two matters in particular. I hold that the question of whether or not a man suffered incapacitation from warlike operations should not claim for a pension. With other honourable members, I say that if, .after a man was passed as medically fit for active service, he became incapacitated either in warlike operations or after his return from abroad> there should be no inquiry I as to whether or not the trouble was existent prior to enlistment. administration could be more sympathetic than it is. If the Assistant Minister agrees with the House generally that once a man has been accepted for war service the Government must shoulder their responsibility in regard to his incapacitation, I need say no more. These cases should be rectified at once, because they are the subject of general complaint, and I agree with the honourable member for man can say definitely, in a large number of cases, whether or not the cause of incapacitation was pre-existent. Another trouble arises in the determination of persons who may be considered dependent upon a deceased soldier. Other honourable members have mentioned that the claims of mothers of deceased soldiers for pensions have been refused because the soldiers had not been contributing towards the support of their mothers before they went to the war. The cases of these mothers are amongst the hardest of those dealt with by the Department. was never intended when the Act was passed. has already effectively argued that a young fellow who was, say, eighteen years of age when he enlisted would probably be earning very little, and his help.

The provisions of the Act governing these claims should he administered more generously, and regardless of whether or not the deceased soldier was contributing towards the keep of his mother before he enlisted she should be entitled to a pension if she is in need of it. In regard to the general question of pensions administration, I admit that I supported, the Bill to place under the control of one Department all activities relating to soldiers. I thought that by this change soldiers' affairs would be administered more effectively and more economically. However, the responsibility for the change is immaterial; the fact remains that the administration of pensions by the Repatriation ment is not what it should be, and there is no reason why the evils complained of should not be corrected. In the first speech I made in this HouseI complained that certain soldiers were not receiving the pensions to which they were nntitled, whilst other persons who were not entitled to pensions were receiving them. At that time war pensions were administered by the same Department as controlled old-age and invalid pensions, and even in those days we had ground for complaint. Shortly after the publication of that speech I received a letter from the Commissioner of Pensions asking me to cite cases in support of my allegations. cases of several soldiers and dependants who had been refused pensions to which I considered they were entitled, and I am glad to say that in most cases adjustments were quickly made, and the persons concerned received their dues. missioner then invited me to mention persons who were in receipt of pensions to which they were not entitled. plied that I was not prepared to do that. I did not consider it my duty to tell the Department of parents who were drawing pensions although they were not in need of such assistance. that one case that I brought before the Commissioner was that of the mother of a deceased soldier; he was eighteen and a half years of age when he went to the Front, and the mother was sixty-five years of age and the father seventy-one years of ac;e. The mother was told by Mr Bell. the Department that she was not entitled to a pension because she was not dependent upon her son before he enlisted. As a matter of fact, the parents were assisting the lad to pay for his education, and it was unfair of the Department to raise the question of dependence. That was realized ultimately, and the mother received her pension. I hope that this is the last occasion upon which the House will require to take action to expose the administration of soldiers' pensions. I do not often make threats, because I realize that a threat must be carried out if the maker of it is to be respected. But I repeat that no Government can long withstand criticism such as has been hurled against the present DepartMinistry on several occasions in regard to the administration of the Repatriation Department. [4.38] I have been requested by the Repatriation Committee at ""Wagga to bring before the House an extraordinarily hard case. Having regard to the seriousness of this complaint, and in order that I may have more chance of having it dealt with effectively, I shall forgo the remarks I intended to make on other 'subjects and concentrate wholly upon it. Briefly, the facts are. these: The woman concerned was living with her family of three or four children, the youngest of whom was a little girl I immediately cited the aged about one year and ten months. This woman deserted her husband and family in the most callous fashion for another man, and when the war broke out two of her sons enlisted. One of them was killed at the Front, and after his The Comdeath a question arose in regard to the allotment of his war gratuity. The woman applied for the payment of the I regratuity to herself. The Eepatriation League at Wagga took a very active part in endeavouring to secure its payment to the little girl, who was living upon the charity of a woman in the neighbourI remember hood. The child's father had died in the meantime, so that she was practically an orphan, without any means of support. This matter was put before the Board, whose lack of sympathy I am wholly at a loss to understand, because when it was called upon to decide between the woman who had cruelly deserted this little girl",38,Chapman Edenweather Is Too Cold Fo R Any Crisis The

I shall be glad if you will bring the matter forward. I did as' I was requested, and the last reply which I received readsYour favour of the 1st inst., advising that nothing can be. done in connection with this girl'B application for tbe war gratuity in respect of her' deceased brother, as her mother bas already been paid the gratuity, is to hand. This information having been communicated to my Committee, I was requested to thank yon for the assistance you gave in the matter, and to ask that you take an early opportunity of ventilating in the House this outrageous action on the part of those responsible for the distribution of the gratuity.

The Government accepted that widely-expressed desire as a matter of .policy, and thereto this Parliament assented. Sub-section 1 of section 7 of the Repatriation Act statesFor the purposes of this Act there shall be a Repatriation Commission,' which shall, subject to the control of the Minister, be charged I call the particular attention of honorwith the general administration of this Act. Machinery is provided. First, there is a Central Commission for the assessment of pensions and for general administration. Then there are the State Boards. There is a medical organization, which consists of the principal departmental medical officer assisting the Central Administration, a departmental medical officer assisting each State Board, and an advisory Medical Board assisting the Commission generally. This Board consists of some of the most eminent men in the medical profession, and,when required, the services of the most highly-qualified specialists are called uppn to deal with particular cases. specialists are the deciding factors always. .are called in to advise, hut they have no .power of awarding decisions. A pension .isassessed after the examination of the .complete medical records of a soldier abroad, and at home upon his discharge, and afterwards by personal examination by the departmental -medical officer. The soldier has the right of appeal to the State Board, and a further right of appeal direct to the Commission, and the latter body has scope of reference to the highest -medical authority in the land. I mention these details to show that the Government have provided machinery for the reasonable assessment of pensions, and 'have fortified themselves and the Commission by power of reference to the best medical advice available. I wish to say here that, during the whole of the war .period and since, the Government have been under a deep debt of gratitude to the Australian medical profession. The gravamen of to-day's complaints is more against the law, as it stands, than against its administration. I remind honourable members of the duties east upon the Commission -These are very heavy, and they cover a wide range. I have had close association with the three Commissioners for some months, and I can testify that they have earnestly endeavoured to fulfil their obligations to the country and to the soldiers individually, according to the terms in which their tasks are expressed in the Act itself. able memhers to the matters which the Commission and the State Boards are called upon to determine -They are set forth in section 25 as follow:(a) Determining whether the death or incapacity of a member of the Forces in fact resulted' from an occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the Forces, and in the case of incapacity the nature and extent thereof] (b) determining whether the' death or incapacity of a person enlisted or appointed for service in connection with naval or military preparations or operations in fact resulted from his employment in connection with those preparations or operations; (c) determining the extent to which persons alleged to be dependent upon a member of the Forces, were in fact so dependent; and (cl) assessing the rates of pensions of members of the ForceB and their dependants, and determining the dates of the commencement of Buch pensions. I listened very attentively to the remarks of honourable memhers, and endeavoured to got a general idea of the opinions held concerning the' administration of the Department which, in their judgment, is defective.

If an exemption has not been granted, will the Minister take the necessary steps to djal with the person or persons responsible for Mrs. Farr's entry into the Commonwealth in contravention of section 13 of the Immigration Restriction Act? 4. In .the event of no exemption having been granted, and viewing the allegations as to Mrs. Parr's insanity prior to her coming to the Commonwealth-sh e thus apparently being a prohibited immigrant-wil l the Minister refrain from making any order affecting Mrs. Farr's personal freedom in or removal from the Commonwealth until a full inquiry has been instituted as to her sanity or otherwise? The replies are1. and 2. No certificate of exemption was issued in favour of Mrs. Farr. 3. and 4. Inquiries are being made on certain points relating to Mrs. Farr's entrance into the Commonwealth and the arrangements made for her maintenance and hospital treatment while in Australia.

Will practically the whole of these officers, receipt of the maximum salary by 1st March, asked the Minister for 1922? 3. How many promotions from Class5 to Class4 have there been within this branch during the past ten years? 4. If there are an extraordinary number of these 5th Class officers who are in receipt of the maximum salary, and whose chance of promotion within the Postmaster-General's Department is consequently remote, has any proposal been considered in thc direction of providing them with an opportunity of transfer to other Departments where the chances of promotions are more favorable? 5. If not, will the Minister take steps to have full consideration given to such a proposal, so that justice may be done to these officers? quiries are being made, and replies will be furnished as soon as possible. Territories, upon notice1. Whether or not the man charged with the murder of the late Percy Brookfield, M.L.A.

If so, in view of the conflicting statements that have been made as to the actual happenings at Riverton (South Australia) on the morning of the shooting, and the alleged failure of the South Australian authorities to hold a thorough and exhaustive inquiry into the whole of the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Brookfield, together with the sworn statement of the local policeman at Riverton that Tomyaiff informed him that he had received the sum of Â£100 (one hundred field, will the Minister order an immediate and thorough investigation to be made into this matter? 3.

They are now classified under item 208. manufacture of these articles as well as the class of articles spoken of by the honourable member for ""Wide Bay( Mr Corser), was undertaken on a large scale in this country during the war. articles are now manufactured here in very large numbers, and they have, therefore, been taken out of sub-item A, and have been put in an item under which they w ill be dutiable. long as I know the reason for what has been done. draw my amendment temporarily. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. I cannot prof ess to have a knowledge of the importation of goods, and I wish that some members of the Committee who possess that knowledge would look into these proposals to know how they affect the trading of the country. information placed at my disposal, and from the attitude of the Minister, I am led to the conclusion that there is almost an absolute disregard of how the Tariff proposals affect the i m portation of various articles by the public. They are so mixed up in different items as to make the administration of the Tariff very difficult for the Customs Department and for the public, and necessarily, on that account, more expen-' sive for the people generally. It seems to me that throughout this Tariff the Minister has accentuated this difficulty. I know that his desire is to make the Tariff more complete, but it is possible to go too much into detail, and I must say that all thÂ© other TariffsI have read appear to me to have been framed with f a r greater simplicity than this. I point out, for instance, that if a person imported a knife,fork, and steel in a single case, it would be found that each of the articles is placed for duty under three different items. That is carrying detail to an absurdity. Most of the articles covered by the items now under consideration are imported for purposes of manufacture, and the Minister desires that they shall be admitted free of duty, but he has transferred some of the items to other items in the Tariff under which they w ill be dutiable. In the case of small articles of this kind I think that is not justified. I move That sub-item A be amended by adding:"" And on and after 27th May, 1921, buttons for attire not being partly or wholly of gold or silver; cotton featherstich braids; plain braids of one colour; piping; bindings; ferretings; filletings; statute galoon; edgings for attire; These webbings, n.e.i.; tinsel thread; boned beltings; boot laces other than leather; stay laces."" These articles are required for manufacturing purposes. them are not made here. I am satisfied so understand that none of them are made here. I ask leave to withoverlooks the fact that sub-item A is a free item. under the British preferential column, but some of the articles included in my amendment are included in sub-item B and are dutiable at 15, 20, and 30 per cent.

I am sure that the Minister realizes that I am not trying to embarrass him, or, in this case, to increase or reduce duties. WhatI am fighting for is the simplification of the Tariff, and that, I believe, w ill do a great deal of good. It would assist importers in passing their goods through the Customs.

Either we were taking out of the free list certain articles which we considered should be dutiable owing to the fact that their manufacture had been established in this country, such as clasps, slides, buckles, and certain buttons, or they were considered necessary as the result of the experience of the Department in handling certain goods. Necessarily the Department gathers experience in the working of the Tariff. to simplification, so far as the public are concerned ? all made to simplify the working of the Tariff. ference between simplification of methods of administration and simplification of the duties cast upon the public by the Tariff. simplification of administration tends to simplify the work required of the public. The two things are correlated. quite sure, from the many talks I have had with my officers over a number of those things, that when we come down to actual details, it will be found that tbere is a good and sivfficient reason for every alteration made. I do not mean to say that the Department is infallible. We may have made mistakes in some instances. clusion of bootlaces and staylaces, whicb already, under regulations, tbe Minister bas admitted free under item 404.

It would be utterly impossible to lay down in tbe Tariff a duty for everything we import in one form or another. laces are very simple things to include in this item. cluded in the item, but there are one hundred and one other things that might also be included. Instead of making the Tariff simpler by adopting the course suggested, we should make it infinitely more difficult. I feel satisfied that in regard to classifications the Committee will be well advised to leave the items as tbey stand. to departmental regulations, as bootlaces and staylaces are now, tbere is always trouble given to the public. the honourable member, in view of the fact that hundreds of things are dealt witb in that way. The trading public understand these matters, and know exactly where they stand. they can be altered from day to day. published.

[5.38] -Many of the articles in the item under review are required for what has 'become a very important business in Australia, namely, tbe manufacture and trimming of ladies' hats. The Minister bas put these goods under an item where they will be dutiable at 15, 20, and 30 per cent., because the manufacture of two or three of them has been started in Australia.

It is not sufficient _ to have three or four people who have begun to make these fancy lines in Australia, because for this particular class of business infinite variety is necessary. If tbe Minister says that this duty is imposed for purely revenue purposes, that is quite another matter. desire to press this matter a little further. Under tbe departmental by-laws the Minister has taken the power to deal with dutiable goods under item 404, under wbich "" Materials and minor articles as prescribed by departmental by-laws for use in the manufacture of goods within tbe Commonwealtb"" are free if imported from Great Britain. .""Nearly all tbe articles included in my amendment have been so dealt with. Although, this Parliament may place a duty on certain goods, the Minister, by notice in his weekly Tariff circular, can transfer them to tbe free list. Later on be can, if he thinks fit, transpose them once more to the dutiable list. whether or not an article should come in free should rest, not witb the Minister, but witb tbe Parliament itself. alteration of tbe wording of the item in connection witb buttons, I am advised, is merely a simplification. I am told that, at tbe request of the Chamber of Manufactures and the metal interests, we are to have a proposal for a duty on buttons. I shall deal with that proposal wben it comes before us. As to my amendment, I am advised tbatPlain braids of one colour should be free, irrespective of width. Webbings are only used for manufacturing purposes, and are not used for external wear. A t present they are included uuder item 106B, but are delivered free by the Minister as "" minor articles."" If the Committee decides to put a duty upon them, that duty cshould remain until tbe Parliament otherwise determines. If we say tbey are to be free, tbey sbould remain free. It is not for tbe Minister but for tbe Parliament to say what shall or shall not be free and what shall or shall not be dutiable. ' factory using tbese "" minor articles "" industry in tbe bush, will tbe Minister take the duty off tbe raw material that it requires? Any man who ventures to set up a factory in one of our cities, it seems to me, may get bis raw material free of duty, whereas tbe man in tbe bush bas to pay duty Â©n all that be requires. Is that to be tbe policy of tbe Government ? I fail to see why it sbould be possible for a man who can bring pressure to bear on the Department or tbe Minister to get his goods in for manufacturing purposes duty free, while tbe man wbo is not prepared to stoop to that sort of thing bas to pay duty on all that be requires. I submit that tbe bonorable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) is not entitled on this item to deal witb tbe general question of departmental by-laws and the powers of tbe Minister.

223,Tbe Question Of Mr James Page,"On the point ofplaining aboutrjbbe action of the Minister in allowing coal cutting machinery to come in free under item 174, I could have understood the objection raised by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton). Coal-cutting machinery was probably dealt with in that way as the result of some of the influences to which I have been taking exception. . any influence having been brought to bear upon the Minister. The honourable inember spoke ju6t now of certain advice he had received. May I ask who is advising him. ? 1 do with the honourable member 1 ber inferred just now that I had been using certain influence, and I think I am entitled to ask bim who are his advisers. it to be understood that I am not asking for lower duties. I am seeking merely for a simplification of the Tariff. If the information I have received ie correct able member's informant did not come to us in the first instance and tell us what his trouble was. ter has been placed before the Department. The Minister cannot be familiar with all the requests which are made to his Department. Tariff alterations are of weeklv occurrence. Tariff circular, giving particulars of alterations, is issued. ever since tliere was a Customs Department. tions are made to the Minister that certain dutiable goods not manufactured in Australia are required for manufacturing purposes -he transposes them either to item 174 or item 404. under which they can come in free. weekly circulars deal only with such alterations ? The Minister has made many alterations, acting sometimes, no doubt, on departmental recommendations. It is natural that many alterations should be required, but my contention is that a decision of the Parliament placing any item on the free list or making it dutiable should be varied only by the Parliament. Seeing that nearly every item I have included in my amendment has already been dealt with by the Minister under item 404, I shall certainly press it. -It seems to me that we bave reached a stage in our history when it is considered reprehensible for an bonorable member to advocate any cause but that of the manufacturers. There is something radically wrong with the present situation, seeing that we are expected to give every attention to the claims of the manufacturer, and to pay no regard to has that to the protection of the consumer. The man who has to carry the burden is not to be considered. I am in agreement with the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) in regard to tbe framing of this Tariff. In nearly every item we see a reference to departmental by-laws. It seems to me that in tbe circumstances it is unnecessary for us to discuss the Tariff. Why not hand over the whole schedule to the Minister and his officials, and let them deal with it as tbey please ?

Tbe honourable member for Maranoa( Mr. James Page) has just said that we have no consideration for the consumer. take under item 404 is in the consumer's interest, and I do not know why the honourable member cannot see it . It is easy for me, after my long experience in Healing with the Tariff, to appreciate how that item works out, b u t I can quite understand that it is difficult for any one without that experience to grip it in tbe same way. Tbere are a vast number of articles which come under various classifications, and are dutiable under the Tariff. Item 404 confers a special power which Parliament deliberately placed in the hands of the Minister, and it reads as follows: Materials and minor articles, a3 prescribed by departmental by-laws for use in the manufacture of goods within the Commonwealth. are free under tbe British and intermediate Tariffs, and dutiable at 10 per cent, under the general Tariff. cutting machines, for example. coal-cutting machines when we come to them; they fall under a different item altogether. Inasmuch as Parliament deliberately gave this power to the Minister with the intention that it should be used, surely we are not to go on collecting the duties when the intention of Parliament was that tbese articles should be free? It would be utterly impossible to enumerate and set these out in detail-as no one can tell what minor articles would be covered; the matter has to be determined when a case arises. That is done under item 404, and it is done in the consumers' interest. If we collected the duty on a variety of goods, none of which can be made in Australia, the manufacturer If the Parliawould naturally have to pass it on, and, as I say, the action, wben taken, is deliberately in the interests of the consuming public.

"" some measure of protection to the manufacturer, all we have to do is to increase the protection so that be may pay tbe duty on the various articles he has to import. mean that the Department may take a duty off one week and restore it the next ? Parliament has included hundreds and hundreds of articles in some of the group items of the Tariff. It would be impossible to enumerate them, and so we have a large group of l^nes under n.e.i., which very often covers goodness knows what. The object of item 404 is that where articles are dutiable under the Tariff, and the articles are not made in Australia, the duty may be taken of f; and if the manufacture of the articles is established, the duty is automatically imposed.

Under the circumstances it would be as well for honourable members to know that the Associated Ohamber of Manufactures met last week and came to tbe conclusion that this is a good time to ask for more duties. That chamber has sent out circulars, of which I have been able to obtain copies, suggesting that nearly everything that can be made in Australia ought to be made dutiable in the future. It has sent out word suggesting, in this case, duties of 30 per cent., 35 per cent., and 40 per cent., drawing attention to the fact that the great bulk of buttons used for the uniforms in the various public Departments are imported free of duty, whereas they could all be produced in Australia. which 'tbey are made carries a duty. that we need to import into this country, seeing that we have all metals here?

I merely want to have this objection removed if possible. I am advised that the Inter-State Commission (vide appendix to report No. 193) received a request from the Australian Weaving Company for increased duties on galoons only up to 32 ribs to the inch. This was afterwards withdrawn and an amended proposition substituted asking for this increase on certain fancy galoons only. The present proposal set out in this item covers infinitely more ground and is a vexatious interference with the local manufacture of apparel, besides imposing a higher rate of duty on ribbons, otherwise identical with those in item 106B and increasing the difficulties of classification. If the Minister says the amendment will render the item unworkable, I shall not press my request. for Trade and Customs) [6.18] I understand the item has been so worded because that class of galoons is made here, and the object is to protect our own manufacturers.

To bring them back to the former rates I intend to move to make the duties 10 per cent, and 15 per cent. There has been sent to members a circular in which it is stated that hundreds of persons in Australia, but chiefly in New South ""Wales, are employed in the making of corsets, but I am credibly informed that practically no corsets are made in this country, nearly all being imported, mostly from Great Britain. in my electorate. are known in the trade as "" maids' corsets."" Even for these, all the material used is imported, and I am told that to make proper women's corsets here it would be necessary to import skilled work-people as well. Therefore, I think that the rates of duty on corsets should not be increased. A duty on corsets is a class duty; it is a duty falling upon women as a class, because all women wear corsets. My lady buys a very expensive article, and other -women buy according to their means, but all use imported corsets. If local manufacturers had made any considerable attempt to produce corsets, I would be prepared to give them aU the protection possible, but at present they are not making any progress in this industry, although several attempts at establishing it have been made. The Minister( Mr Greene), in proposing to give increased protection to the manufacturer, is placing an additional burden on every woman in the country. discussion confirms me in the opinion that, in the interests of a great many people, there should be representatives of the opposite sex in this Parliament to assist us in the discussion of matters of this kind. I have been informed that, despite all that has been said as to the wonderful opening existing in this country for the establishment of the corsetmaking industry, there are at the present time only 175 people engaged in it, receivconcerning the present extent of manuing a total wage of Â£507 per week. have here a list of the constituents of corsets, and it proves that the whole of the materials for the industry have to be imported. The peoplo who style themselves corset manufacturers have in the past produced only about 5 per cent, of the corsets required to encircle the gracef u l forms of our ladies. The bulk of their output is brassieres, a form of bust bodice, and children's corsets. There are also certain higher-class corsets, made from silk and satin, to which I cannot refer under this item, but I think careful inquiry would disclose that only .a very small percentage of the corsets required by the ladies of Australia is manufactured locally. Can the Minister furnish the Committee witb any information to justify the increase of the Tariff from 10 per cent, to 40 per cent. British, and 55 per cent, general? for Trade and Customs) [8.22] -Unde r the old Tariff, the impost of 10 per cent. British and 15 per cent, general was nothing more than a revenue duty.. There was no considerable manufacture of corsets in the Commonwealth. It is quite true that a certain number of expensive corsets were made locally, but the corset most generally worn by ladies was not made in Australia. Tho Inter-State Commission in its report on corsets saidThe Commission is of opinion that this industry presents greater claims for consideration than some of the industries already enjoying substantial Tariff assistance, and that it is anomalous that it should receive different treatment from that extended to ordinary apparel. Compared with many articles of apparel, it involves a greater amount of labour, and, further, it is of advantage in the boxing, labelling, and printing, which are necessary for marketing the article. There is no reason why the claims of the corset manufacturers should not have equal treatment to that already extended to other manufacturers of apparel. The Commission therefore recommends that item 106 (B) in the 1908-1911 Tariff, namely, Corsets, ad val., 15 per oent. general and 10 per cent, preferential, be omitted from the Tariff, and that corsets be included in item 106 (A), apparel and attire n.e.i., 40 per cent, general and 35 per cent, preferential. That recommendation has been followed.

305,Mr Mathews,"The Minister( Mrl e has visited an establishment in which they are being manufactured upon a large scale. it. industry are erecting a large building, which they intend to extend as opportunity offers. The Minister has also stated that other large corset manufacturers propose commencing operations in Australia. ' They intend to follow the example of the manufacturers of other commodities overseas, who have intimated their intention to establish businesses within the Commonwealth. I was one of those who thought that this could not be done. I am glad to know that my opinion was not well founded. We have been told that the proposed .duty will be a sex tax. But the duty under the old Tariff was merely a revenue duty, whereas this is a protective duty, which will encourage the manufacture of corsets in our midst. I do not pretend to be a better judge of a corset than is any other honourable member, but I claim to be quite as good a judge. The article which is being locally manufactured is an extraordinarily good one, as anybody conversant with the drapery trade will admit. As a matter of fact, the more expensive style of corsets has been manufactured in Australia for many years. Ladies who could afford to pay Â£3 3s., Â£4 4s., or Â£5 5s. for a superior article have gical cases. These must necessarily be always been able to obtain it . But the present is the first attempt which has been made to manufacture corsets for general female use. The question which we have to determine is whether we desire that Australia shall become a manufacturing country. I am a Protectionist, and I want to see these goods manufactured here upon an increasingly large scale. think we are now quite satisfied that the object of the Minister( Mr under the 1914 Tariff and only three Greene) in proposing a high duty upon corsets is for protective and not for revenue purposes. But, in my judgment, the duty will merely be a revenue-producing one for many years. It will be a very long time indeed before corsets will be manufactured in Australia to the extent that is necessary to supply local requirements. corsets does not involve the use of expenpensive machinery. out that everything required in connection I , too, have seen with their manufacture must be imported. The company engaged in this MT. ""WATKINS -In my own electorate, within a short time, certain persons will be making wires for use in corsets. matter. My point is that most of the materials required in the manufacture of corsets will have to be imported, and imported free of duty. I wish-, also, to stress the fact that the women of Australia will be obliged to pay in the future considerably more for their corsets than they have done hitherto, onaccount of the duty which it is now proposed to levy upon them. The estimated value of the corsets imported into the Oommonwealth during the year ended June, 1919, was Â£875,000, and the estimated value of the corsets manufactured within the Commonwealth represented only about 3 per cent, of our requirements, or a total value of Â£26,000. As a local industry, the manufacture of corsets has never been a success. until now. the corsets manufactured in Australia have been made chiefly for abnormal figures, and also in connection with surmade from measurements, and that class of corset has been manufactured locally. But no record has ever been kept of the value represented by these manufactures. The present price of corsets is something like 100 per cent, more than it was before the war. During the year 1919-20, nine months of which was covered by the Tariff of 1914, and the remaining three months by the present Tariff, the duty collected upon corsets amounted to Â£65,200. That period comprised nine months under the Tariff of 1920. Had the duty been in force for the ful l year, the amount collected upon corsets from the TJnited Kingdom would have been Â£99;i66, and from the United States of America and Canada Â£41,981a total of Â£141,147. Canada and the United States of America, by the way, are about the only sources outside the United Kingdom from which corsets are imported. The total value of French corsets foT the same period under review was only Â£394,",57,Tariff Textiles Felts And Fobs And Manufactures Thereof Amd Attibe

He adds a further 15 per cent., and in addition there is the retailer's profit on the amount paid in duty. Honourable members should realize -what all these increases mean to the women of Australia when paying for their corsets. that the women will get them more cheaply, made here. ter's eyes have been shut or he is talking nonsense. It will be the same old story as during the war. The local manufacturer, behind this protection, will put up his prices as near as he can to the cost of the imported article. amount involved in the importation of corsets for 1920, including the 15 per cent, added to the duty by the importer, is about Â£170,000. gum which Australian women had to pay. It is of no use to say that the industry when started in Australia can immediately supply the demand. It has to be built up gradually. There is the important factor of the hygienic characteristics of the modern corset, and it involves grave consideration to any one undertaking local -manufacture. main reason, I suppose, why so large a proportion of the imported corsets comes from the TJnited States of America is because greater attention is given there to the matter of hygiene. The Industrial Australian of 5 th May remarks, regarding corsets, that ""the ever-changing fashions demand the assistance of the artist and the expert to produce a beauty of form and deportment to coincide with the mode of the moment."" This is well put, but the writer should have taken into consideration the vital point of hygiene. Almost every woman in civilized communities wears corsets, and has done so for generations, so that there has evidently been some natural and physical reason for their universal adoption. This being so, it is imperative that the health gained by a few local manufacturers in and comfort of women should be safeguarded by expert and scientific manufacture. It stands to reason that such skilled manufacture can only be obtained at its best by long apprenticeship and acquired dexterity, and that, in evolving Then new fashionable shapes, the assistance of medical surgery must be invoked for the featuring ' of successful and healthful models. In the journal which I have, just quoted, it is also stated that one-third of the local output at present-that is, after some years of work in the local factories -is discarded and sold at reduced prices as such. This shows that the Australian corset manufacturers, to gain their experience, have to supply a large number of corsets to the feminine public which cannot, from the very fact of present manufacturing inexperience, conform to hygienic standards, thereby constituting a menace to the healthy motherhood of the community. Women buy the corsets that suit them best, and their own inThe total stinct advises them that the corsets which are most comfortable to wear are most suitable to their health in every respect. I repeat that experience is necessary for That is the extra the manufacture of the type of corset which women ask for to-day. tralian manufacturers to get that experience if we continue to import? to a duty of 15-per cent. Mr 'GABB -That would not be enough to influence outside manufacturers to set The up here. I will give honorablo members an idea of the increase which has taken place in the retail rates. A certain line of corset was retailed before the war for 5s. l i d . That same article was sold retail during the war period, but before the imposition of high duties, at. 9s. 6d. It has been sold, since the high duties were imposed, for 12s. 6d -a n increase of a little more than 100 per cent. the same relative increase with respect to almost every commodity. creased duty proposed is from 10 to 40 per cent.

I do not care what duty may be imposed on American imports; but, so far as British corsets are concerned, the duty should be 10 per cent., or, at the highest, 15 per cent. [8.57] -The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) knows more about mines and mining than about ladies' corsets. He has made some remarkable statements which indicate, as a matter of fact, that there is the possibility of a valuable industry being estabbeen invested, and another is in course of lished in Australia. He failed to hit the point at which he aimed when he drew a comparison between the prices of a few years ago and of to-day. This was chiefly due to the fact that the type in fashion nowadays is utterly different. There has heen a marked change in the character of this particular manufactured article a difference which has had to do with hygiene. Apart from that altogether, however, women of to-day are asking generally for a very much superior article. And the very fact that it is a superior class of corset which women want nowadays makes the item as reasonable a one for protection as any other fancy article. I will cite, as an illustration, made-up imported costumes. A few years ago these were imported in huge quantities. manufacturer was given siifficient protection to establish the industry in Australia on an extensive scale. There is no reason why the same results should not accrue from a reasonable protection in connection with the manufacture of corsets as have resulted by imposing a duty on costumes and other articles of attire;. Encouragement should also be given to the establishment of the industry in Australia, because boxed corsets, being light and bulky, add considerably to the cost. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) said that a sixstoried factory had been erected in New South Wales. No one is likely to establish a six-storied factory in Sydney, where the land values are very high, unless there is a reasonable prospect of success. It must be admitted that a good deal of skill is required in the manufacture of modern corsets, and men who put their capital into costly buildings in Sydney and elsewhere will not be operating long before they will be able to produce an article quite as good as the imported. I admit that the Minister is asking for an extravagant rate, and if it is similar to that charged on costumes I shall support it . I cannot understand why this important industry was not established in Australia before, and I feel quite sure that the Committee will be prepared to give it the protection to which it is entitled. In the South Sydney electorate there is a factory in which nearly Â£100,000 has erection, from which, it is said, the proprietors will be able to supply corsets at a cheaper rate than is charged for the imported article. Those engaged in the industry are keen business men, and know that if they do not produce a good article they will be unable to sell it . I may remind the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) that ladies who can afford to purchase the best type of corset do not purchase the imported article, but have them made to order by local manufacturers, whose operatives work under favorable conditions. Probably manufacturers have to import some of the raw material, but that cannot be used as an argument against the establishment of the industry, because when we commenced building we had to import lead, and slates, and other necessaries. When we However, the local first undertook the construction of locomotives it was said that they would cost considerably more than if they were imported, and every argument which has been used against the corset industry has been brought forward at different times in connection with others. It is quite true that the business people of York-street, in Sydney, and Flinders-lane, in Melbourne, are endeavouring to get honourable members to keep the duties as low as possible. What for ? Not to enable them to employ more, but to keep themselves in a nice, comfortable position. The Minister is taking a step in the right direction, and we should endeavour to encourage this and similar industries by imposing a Tariff which is sufficiently protective. Every honourable member was asked on the hustings whether he was a Free Trader or a Protectionist. I said I was a Protectionist, because I wanted",59,Tariff Textiles Felts And Fobs And Manufactures Thereof Amd Attibe

During the past twelve months manufacturers have been building up industries on the understanding that these rates would remain. duties have been enforced for the period I have mentioned, and as large sums of money have been invested in buildings, on machinery, and in training staffs, it is unreasonable to suggest that the rates should be reduced by one-half. seven or eight factories throughout Australia. There are two or three in Sydney, and a similar number in Victoria. additional factories are erected it will mean the employment* of thousands of people. Dampier( Mr Gregory) referred to importations from America and France, but I think it is a slander on the ability of the Australian people to expect them to use imported articles when they can be manufactured in this country. port a duty of 30 per cent, against France and America, and 15 per cent, against Great Britain. basis ? industries cannot compete with those already established, because they have to incuT heavy expenditure in the erection of buildings and purchase of plant, whilst other firms are producing and swamping the market. New South Wales prior to Federation? number of factories has increased by 200 or 300 per cent., and Protection has made New South Wales the leading State of the Commonwealth. I trust the Minister( Mr Greene) will adhere to his decision, and give this industry the protection to which it is entitled. When honourable members were advocating increased duties on bananas and onions I did not offer any objection, because I thought they were necessary to encourage our own industries. If protection is to be given in one direction, why should it not be given in another? If any honourable member has made out a good case for lower duties it is the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley), although he is in favour of a high Protective Tariff. He has informed us that there is a large factory It is not theirs. These in his electorate manufacturing these particular articles of ladies' attire, and that there is another in course of construction. If these industries have continued successfully under the present Tariff, and new factories are being established, why should the rates be increased ?

I ' should like the Minister( Mr Greene) to consider whether it would not be possible to revert to the 1908-11 Tariff so far as imports from Great Britain are concerned, while imposing, if necessary, a higher duty under the general Tariff. The hat industry has been carried on here for many years, and although I have not been able to obtain any statistics in regard to it, I understand that it is on a remarkably sound basis. I am told that the Denton Hat Mills have done exceedingly well. hats. they have taken full advantage of the market. My observations will apply also to sub-items c and D, which deal with furfelt hats and caps and sewn hats. Having regard to the time during which the industry has enjoyed a substantial measure of protection, I think it should be able to stand under the old rates. It has not been shown that there is any necessity for these increased duties, and I can see no justification for an increase. for Trade and Customs) [9.36] -The honourable member will find that I have not raised the duties fixed under the Tariff of 1914.

Before the war we were importing something like Â£250,000 worth of fur, wool, and felt hats annually. During the war local manufacturers were able, and have been able since then, to take care of the greater part of that trade. The only class now being imported to any extent is the better make of fur hats of very high value. Even that branch of the trade is being catered for by a new factory which has been established quite recently in the electorate of the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley). I believe that factory is now turning out practically as good a hat as is produced in any other part of the world. IrfHhe circumstances, I think it desirable to allow the duty under the 1914 Tariff to stand, at all events, for some little time to come. desire to support the proposal of the Minister( Mr Greene). So far as I can see, the manufacture of felt and other hats in Australia is in very much the same position as the wool industry. I had occasion, not long ago, to purchase a new felt hat, and on making inquiries discovered that for imported felt hats preposterously high prices were asked. as a suit of clothes. the shopkeeper for a Denton hat, he produced one, and although it was only about one-third of the price asked for the imported article, it was, in my opinion, quite as good.

[9.40] I should like to ask the Minister( Mr G-reene) whether he has given any consideration to the desirableness of improving the position of that branch of the industry which is making straw hats, and all forms of plaited hats or bonnets. Many persons in Australia have been engaged in all forms of straw hat manufacture. Competition from abroad is now becoming very keen, and those interested in the local trade have only lately discovered the peculiar position in which theyj are placed. They approached me some little time ago with regard to the matter, but were rather late in putting it before the Department. If we can produce information showing the necessity for increased protection in respect of this branch of the trade before the Tariff goes to the Senate, will the honourable gentleman give us an opportunity to put that information before the Committee ? for Trade and Customs) [9.42] -The matter to which the honourable member ( Mr Mathews) has referred has recently been brought under my notice, but I have not had time to look into it.

I may remind the honourable member that quite lately we have taken action to assist that branch of the industrywhich he has in mind. instance, only to-night we have placed on the free list the straw braid which straw hat-makers use. other action in the same direction in connection with several items to assist the tra..ie.

The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) has showed great concern for the wool felt hat-making industry, and has expressed the opinion that the Government are rightly protecting that branch of the trade. Has he nothing to say in regard to the duty on f u r hats? We have in this Parliament honourable members who are never tired of attending big loyalty meetings in the Town Hall or Empire Day celebrations, and saying, most fervently, ""God bless the Empire."" With a sob in their voices, they talk of the wonderful Empire of which we form a part, and refer with particular pride to that dear old Free Trade country, England. But when it comes to showing some practical preference towards the "" dear old Mother Country,"" it is represented by a duty of 24s. per dozen on hats. I do not care how much the duties are raised against the foreigner. The hat mills here, particularly the Denton Mills, are paying exorbitant dividends, and yet we find high duties imposed in their favour from Tariff to Tariff. This duty against British hats amounts to prohibition. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) was only stating the truth when he told! us that when he went into a shop he was shown imported hats for which exorbitant prices were asked. which the price quoted was Â£4 10s. I should want a suit of clothes for that price. For that case to justify the price. the price is put up by either the importer We have also taken or the retailer. to give British preference in more than name, the duty ought to be reduoed. MT.

Mr 0ONSTOLNE -If that is so, I want to know what is the cause of all this industrial unrest throughout Australia. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Foley) informed the Committee this evening that the poorer paid workers in his division were obliged to wear cotton stockings, and in order that they should continue to do so he wants, not to improve their working conditions, but to make cotton goods cheaper. I have no desire to do that. I want the standard of living so raised that the workers of Australia will not need to wear cotton socks. I would prefer that they should wear the woollen article. I want to see every worker in this country in a position to wear the very best material that ia obtainable. the fact .that wool is so cheap! honourable member himself to answer that conundrum. He' and the rest. of his party are keen about prohibiting the importation of chaff and every other primary product that they sell, but they want other commodities to be free which they have to buy. cheap'socks. Apparently the honourable member does not. cotton socks at all. I wore thein once, not because I liked them, and I have no doubt that the workers of Australia only wear cotton goods because they are ex[354] ploited to such an extent that they cannot afford to buy the better class material. Mr .FoixvI have neverpulled a poor mouth about the workers of this country. If the people in the honourable member's division worked, as they do in mine, they would be able to have woollen goods, too. my division what they did in the .honourable member's,, no doubt I would not he here, and so I do not agree with the honourable member's line of argument in that respect. But I am sure that if he goes back to Kalgoorlie, and tells the workers that he worked overtime in this House in order that they might be enabled to continue to wear cheap cotton socks, it will not contribute much to the success of his future eleotion campaigns. Naturally, he does not want the attention of the workers in his division to be drawn to the fact that he is anxious that their wages shall not be increased to such an extent that they need not be compelled tp continue wearing cotton socks, and that he is endeavouring to bring their prices down by a reduction in the Tariff. On the other hand, we hear him talking about dumping. The Protectionist argument is that dumped foreign goods ruin the local manufacturers. The honorahle member, cannot have it both ways. He complains ahout thc high price of cotton socks and when, by interjection, I asked him how wages were fixed, he confessed they were determined by the cost of living. That has heen my contention Tight through this debate, on the Tariff, and so the honourable member's admissionproves the soundness of my. argument that the worker's wages are fixed on the -cost of the duty-paid articles. Does the honourable member contend that if the cost of living were reduced wages would remain at their present level 1 As a matter of fact, cotton socks, .as one item of expenditure for the working man, would, he considered by an Arbitration Oourt or Wages Board in arriving at a cost-ofliving estimate, and to that extent it .would influence the 'finding.
