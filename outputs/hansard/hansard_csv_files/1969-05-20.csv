Kangaroos of the State of Victoria a petition showing that kangaroos generally throughout the Commonwealth are in grave danger of extinction. Indeed some species are aheady extinct. This sad state of affairs is due to the uncontrolled shooting of kangaroos mainly for commercial purposes. Kangaroos are a native of this country and are entitled to a share of the land, also they are unique in that they are found in no other part of the world and consequently must be preserved for future generations before it is too late. The petitioners humbly pray that the Government will legislate to stop the indiscriminate shooting of kangaroos and ban the export of kangaroo skins, mounted heads, and meat. Also, it is suggested that tracts of Crown land be made available to responsible private people who are prepared to look after kangaroos. This could be done under the supervision of a government authority such as the Victorian Fisheries and Wildlife Department and would be similar to public service rendered by Justices of the Peace. Petition received. Health Insurance electors of the Commonwealth a petition showing that physiotherapy is not among the items included for benefits under the health insurance scheme. The petitioners humbly pray that an adequate refund for physiotherapy treatment ordered by a registered medical practitioner may be included within the Commonwealth benefits scheme in like manner to other medical benefits. Petition received and read. Kangaroos dents of the State of Victoria a petition Sunday, 25th May. During his absence, the showing that tbe red kangaroo, largest marMinister for Defence( Mr Fairhall) will act supial in existence and international tradeas Minister for External Affairs. 15571/69-R-[75 ] mark, through shooting for commercial interests, is being reduced to a numerical level where its survival is in jeopardy; all States have insufficient administrators to enforce any existing laws within their boundaries, and the vastness of Australia makes it impossible to apprehend and prosecute persons breaking these laws. The petitioners humbly pray that the export of kangaroo products be banned immediately-the value of these commodities does not warrant the risk of wiping out our national emblem. Until such time as a Commonwealth body is set up with powers to administrate throughout the Commonwealth, short-term measures must be taken to ensure the survival of the kangaroo. Petition received. Education citizens of the Commonwealth a petition showing that because of increased costs of educating children attending Catholic schools relief is urgently required. The petitioners pray that, as a first step in 1969 towards relieving the immediate difficulties of Catholic schools in Australia, the Commonwealth Government make grants available equivalent to a capitation grant of $50 per primary and secondary pupil, per annum, for running costs, in whatever form the Government finds it is able to make the grant and that, subsequently, the combined Commonwealth and State subsidies for running costs should be progressively raised to at least half the cost of educating a primary and secondary child in the various State systems. Petition received. Mr Speaker, I wish to inform the House that the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Freeth) left Australia on Sunday, 18 th May, for Bangkok. He will attend the 14th meeting of the South East Asia Treaty Organisation Council on the 20th and 21st May and the meeting of the Vietnam Force Contributors on the 22nd and 23rd May.",7,Setup

Therefore it should be and hospital fees now prevailing? action was not taken, as a result of the deliberations of the Nimmo committee, to stop proposals by the funds to increase benefits. Increases were held up at one stage for a meeting of the Commonwealth Health Insurance Council, because I wanted the views of that Council on whether increased funds becoming available should go to general practitioner consultations or to other items on the benefits scale. However, that took place months ago and new benefits related to fee increases were approved, particularly for Victoria. As to the rest of the honourable gentleman's question, any increases or any changes in the medical benefit scales will have to await the Government's consideration, the taking of decisions on the recommendations of the Nimmo committee and discussions with the various groups involved in the community. cate his attitude to the holding, at this time, officers of the Department of Labour and of a debate on tbe current industrial situaNational Service and the Deputy Crown tion? come a debate on the current industrial situation and I would be prepared to facilitate such a debate, but the question that really arises the question is out of order since it anticifore, in the interests of Australia generally, pates debate on a matter which is on the because the interests of Australia generally daily programme sheet which has been cirdepend on a proper solution to this present culated to honourable members. matter of the question is not before the ruled out of order. member is wrong on both counts. mild surprise that there should be objections to an attitude on a matter of this importance being stated in this House.

The question, however, is not whether such a debate should take place and be of value but when it should take place. The Government, in relation to the present industrial situation, has been and is having discussions with officers of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The ACTU Executive is to meet tomorrow and following that there will be further discussions between the Government and officers of the ACTU. Furthermore, I understand that a compulsory conference is being called for this afternoon by Mr Justice Gallagher and to this conference have been called union Solicitor. The Government is still hopeful ot reaching a proper solution to the present industrial problems which have arisen in this country, but if one thing could prejudice the arrival at such a proper solution it could be speeches made in the heat of industrial problem being arrived at as",13,Ministerial Arrangements

In the present crisis concerning sterling, is one of the conditions of the International Monetary Fund extending another $ 1,000m standby loan to Britain the Fund's demand that the United Kingdom should re-examine its policy of allowing the outflow of portfolio investment from the United Kingdom to Australia and South Africa? As last year over 40% of overseas capital inflow to Australia was portfolio investment, does the Treasurer feel that the requirement of the International Monetary Fund will have any impact on the inflow of capital to Australia? whether the basis on which the honourable gentleman asked his question is correct. It was stated that the International Monetary Fund was attempting to impose conditions upon the standby credit given by the Fund to the United Kingdom Government. Just as promptly it was denied by officials on behalf of the United Kingdom Government that this was being attempted. In any event, trying to make a forecast of what is likely to happen to policy decisions by the British Government is well beyond me and I think beyond any other member of this House. to the Prime Minister. By way of preface 1 point out that yesterday I was present at a lunchtime meeting under the auspices of the Constitutional Association of Australia, at which MT Spiegelman, President of the Sydney University Students Representative Council, said that a letter had been sent to the Prime Minister by the National Union of Australian University Students, as I understand it regarding a blanket ban on Commonwealth public servants taking part in political activities. But I see from this morning's 'Canberra Times' that Mr 3,600 personnel have had their categories Spiegelman is reported as referring to a particular case in which a public servant, I think in the Attorney-General's Department, did take some part in a political activity and, I think, was disciplined for it. In either event, I ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware of such a letter having been sent to him and whether as alleged or implied he deliberately ignored it. Department, in spite of my Department having sought to go through the records, of the receipt of any letter of the kind referred to by the honourable member for Bradfield. I do not say the letter was not sent. I just say there is no record in the Department of the receipt of any such letter. There is a record of receipt by the Attorney-General of a letter from the NUAUS concerning a Mr Sime, whose case has been the subject of debate in this House before, and I understand that the NUAUS has also written to the Chairman of the Public Service Board. IfI were to receive a letter, I would reply to it. the Navy seen recent Press reports of discontent over pay and conditions in the Royal Australian Navy? Has this discontent reached crisis proportions, as claimed by one newspaper?

In my opinion it was gravely alarmist. It should not have been. The word 'crisis' in relation to Navy pay was used. I have admitted on many occasions that we have a problem as far as Navy pay is concerned. In my opinion problems should be regarded as opportunities in work clothes. We have taken action along many lines, particularly in regard to group pay. Since group pay was introduced in October last year ten categories of sailors involving",14,Arbitration

I ask: Does the right honourable raised, the table of figures in the 'Sunday gentleman recollect that the Commonwealth Telegraph' was wrong in every respect.

29,Mr Malcolm Fraseri Have Seen,"honourable member's own electorate of St George. I have a tape recording of the speech as it was in fact given. There have been comments saying that a major policy statement on State aid would be made early in June, These statements are not correct. I said last night that this would not occur, and I think it was recognised and accepted by those people who were at the meeting in St George that such matters are ones that need to be discussed and examined in the Budget context because they have significant budgetary implications as the Prime Minister has indicated in correspondence with the Premier of New South Wales. But, on the other hand, I found last night that it seemed to be accepted by rhe parents and friends representing a very wide area of Sydney that leaders of the Opposition make promises on any day of the year. to the Prime Minister. In view of the vast industrial upheaval caused by the lack of public relations between the Department of Labour and National Service and the trade union movement, would the Prime Minister reshuffle his Cabinet and give this responsible ministerial portfolio to a Minister with more tolerance and understanding than the present Minister so that stability can be restored to industry in Australia? rather difficult, searching this House on both sides, to find a man of more tolerance and understanding than the present Minister for Labour and National Service, and, what is more, I utterly reject the suggestion that there are no public relations between the Department of Labour and National Service, and its Minister, and the trade union movement. Indeed, the discussions which have been just recently carried on and are being carried on, and which we do not wish to see disrupted, are evidence that there is touch between this Minister and his Department and the trade union movement, and I have not heard from leaders of the trade union movement Minister for Labour and National Service. such attacks on the tolerance of the Is he aware that penalties totalling about Minister as are suggested in the question. $282,000 and employers' costs of almost to the Minister for Civil Aviation. Some time ago the Minister said he was going to review the policy applying to international air charter flights. Can he now say whether this review has taken place, and if so, what decisions have been made? time ago I did indicate that I would undertake a review of the international air charter policy, and that review has been going on for some time. In October 1967 I announced the new policy in the House, and last indicated some months ago that this review would be undertaken after the end of the first effective year of its operation, because it was some months after the introduction of the policy before we could effectively judge how the procedures were going and how they were being accepted. I took it that it would be up to about the end of February 1969 before we could classify one particular year of active operation of the policy. It is very interesting to note that the policy has been most successful. In fact, during this particular period about seventy flights have been either undertaken or arranged and seven international operators have taken part in these operations. Because of the implications and the representations that have been made to my colleague, the Minister for Immigration, and other people in the House and because of the necessity to discuss these matters at length with the International Air Transport Association, with other international operators and with Qantas, it has taken some time to reach conclusions. However, I anticipate that within the next few weeks this review will be concluded. If it is at all possible I will complete the review before the House rises and make an announcement to it regarding any policy changes that are contemplated. If it is not possible to do so, I will make an announcement as soon as I can after that date.",16,Education

If so, is it not a fact that the token penalties imposed on employers are not due to their good industrial conduct but because the penal provisions of the Act are loaded against trade unionists, resulting in almost 1 million workers being in revolt against this law in Australia today? In view of the great injustices to trade unionists and the need for industrial peace, will the Minister state on what grounds, if any, he refuses to give expression to the spirit of the Act and repeal these iniquitous penal clauses? honourable member for Grayndler are roughly correct. He referred to the amount of fines imposed on employers. He might also have referred to other eloquent figures and they are that, since 1954 or thereabouts, very largely because of the background of the sanctions provisions, about $2m-agai n a round figure-has been collected from employers as payment due for wages under introduced at different times.

In view of the fact that shipments of meat to the United States of America are about 30,000 tons short over the first 6 months of our quota period, why has the Australian Meat Board given advice to eleven small abattoirs in Victoria to the effect that they cannot continue the shipment of meat to the US because they have not sold stipulated quantities to diversified markets, particularly as meat suitable for the lower price markets is not available in Victoria? will recall that last year because of an over the latest report of the Devaluation Reportsupply of meat to the US market the Australian Government was compelled to place an embargo on further shipments of meat to that country. This action caused some disruption to the local industry, but to avoid such a situation occurring again the Australian Meat Board came forward with a proposal whereby exporters could win an entitlement to the US market if they were able to diversify a percentage of their production to other markets. The Board said that this matter would be reviewed during the year in the light of the performance achieved. The Board has made a number of statements since, saying that the whole matter would be reviewed in May. For the first 5 months of the year the understanding was that for every 25% of beef and veal exported to other markets it would give an entitlement of 75% to the United States market, that referred to beef and veal. But if producers exported two-thirds of their mutton production to other markets they were entitled to export one-third to the United States market. The Meat Board has now altered its arrangement and producers need export only 20% of their beef and veal to other markets to enable them to export 80% to the United States. The figures with respect to mutton are now 60% to other markets and 40% to the United States. But if these people did not abide by the terms and conditions that were originally accepted by the meat industry the whole scheme would break down. The scheme has been an outstanding success. It has encouraged people to go out and win other markets, and yet it has ensured that we will be able to supply the American market because the percentage of exports to markets can be varied as the performance is looked at throughout the course of the year. Exporters who have not been able to win a credit for diversification to the United States market are being penalised, and the only way they can correct that situation is to get out and try to sell to other markets, as the great majority of exporters undertook to do and succeeded in doing, during the first 5 months of this year. of the Minister for Primary Industry.

60,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Ministe rMr Adermann, it was welcomed by members of all parties. Dairy industry leaders have expressed their support for the principles of the scheme, although there has been an opinion expressed in some quarters that the scheme should go further than it will under the present proposals. At meetings of the Australian Agricultural Council, State Ministers for Agriculture have expressed their support for the scheme, and their willingness to co-operate in its implementation. In a letter to the Prime Minister( Mr remaining 50% would be a loan repayable Gorton) on 24th February last, to which I shall refer again, the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Askin, reaffirmed that his Government and officers were prepared to assist as far as was practicable in the implementation of any Commonwealth scheme. In a letter to the Prime Minister on 16th April last, the Premier of Victoria, Sir Henry Bolte, said his Government agreed with what the Commonwealth was setting out to do, and was prepared to co-operate with the Commonwealth in achieving its policy. Both Premiers expressed their support subject to certain qualifications regarding the operation of the scheme which I will mention later. At various meetings of dairy farmers I have found that, although there frequently has been some initial misunderstanding about the scheme, there is strong support for it. Correspondence I have received indicates that many farmers are anxious to make use of the scheme. Indeed, several other rural industries have suggested that a similar scheme could well work to the advantage of their own industries. Having announced such a scheme for the dairy industry, the Commonwealth sought the States' co-operation. As systems of land tenure and the conditions within the dairy industry vary from State to State, the discussions were held separately between officers of the Commonwealth and the individual States. In those initial talks, the basis mine the price to be paid for farms being for the provision of finance was that the Commonwealth would provide a quarter of the funds in the form of grants and three-quarters in the form of loans. In discussions, the States claimed that this basis was not satisfactory to them as it could, they said, involve them in expenditure of their own funds. After consideration of all the matters arising in the discussions, the Prime Minister wrote to each Premier on the 30th September 1968 seeking co-operation in implementing a marginal dairy farm reconstruction scheme. In his letter, the Prime Minister indicated the Commonwealth's preparedness to make available over a period of 4 years a sum of up to $25m for use by the States in the implementation of the scheme. Of the money used by a State, 50% would be a non-repayable grant. The with interest at the current long term bond rate at the time of drawing. The loan moneys would be repayable by the State over a period chosen by the State, but with a maximum of 25 years. The period could, at the option of the State, include an initial term of up to 2 years during which repayments of principal could be postponed. While interest would run from the date of drawing, the interest accruing during any chosen period of postponement of principal repayments could be capitalised, if so desired by the State. Again at the option of the State, repayment of loan could be made on the credit foncier system, or on equal instalments of principal with interest on the outstanding balance. The funds made available to the State would be applied, first, for the purchase of farms bare-that is, without stock or plant; secondly, for the writing-off of any fixed improvements rendered redundant on resale; and thirdly, for such other purposes relevant to the scheme as the Commonwealth and State might agree upon. The Prime Minister indicated that the operation of the scheme would be defined in an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State. Within the terms of this agreement, the State would act as a principal for the implementation of the scheme. This means the State would deteracquired, the extent of write-down for redundant fixed improvements, and the terms and conditions applying to purchasers of land under the scheme, the State accepting any losses which might occur in the last mentioned transactions. The State would meet its own costs of administration of the scheme. The agreement would include, in addition to the financial arrangements already mentioned, other related matters such as the objectives being sought in amalgamation and diversification; production standards for outgoing and incoming participants in the scheme; safeguards against subsequent fragmentation of enlarged properties; restrictions on sale of ensales of land or other sources would be larged properties during a specified period after amalgamation in order to minimise speculation and last, but by no means least, a system of reporting on the progress of the scheme, including provision for consultations between Commonwealth and State officers as required. I have oudined the Commonwealth's offer in order that the House can judge for itself the efforts that have been made not only to provide a scheme that will enable an attack to be made upon the low-income problem in the dairy industry, but also to provide arrangements that will give each co-operating State maximum flexibility in carrying out the scheme, using Commonwealth money. There is another matter that should be of responsibility. mentioned. Some States are already undertaking schemes of their own to try to assist dairy farmers. The Commonwealth would instrumentalities should be the bodies who expect these States to continue this practice make on-the-ground decisions about the and not merely use Commonwealth money individual cases that will be submitted by to replace their own expenditures. On 24th dairy farmers wishing to sell their farms February 1969 the Premier of New South and others to take up the land which Wales wrote to the Prime Minister on becomes available under the scheme. The behalf of all of the States. The Premier States should then be prepared to stand made four points which be referred to as behind any decisions that their instrumenpoints of principle, and included a suggestalities make. In other words, the States tion about the mechanics of handling the should participate as active and responsible money. Let me make it clear that the States principals in the matter, and not as passive did not reject the Commonwealth scheme. agents. They have, all along, indicated that they recognise their responsibilities, just as the Commonwealth Government recognises its responsibility, to try to create conditions This we have said we are prepared to do for the betterment of dairy farmers. In his four points, Mr Askin asked the Commonto finance the farmers who voluntarily wealth to provide the whole of the funds required. He proposed that the Commonwealth should meet all losses or costs properties would be built up. We are also incurred in the operation of the scheme. He wanted the Commonwealth to meet the marginal farms. He also asked that the full costs of administration. He also considered that the States should be allowed to exercise full powers of determination in determination in matters of a technical and matters of a technical and administrative nature. Mr Askin suggested that one way to administer arrangements of the type he had in mind would be to establish, with Commonwealth funds, a dairy reconstruction fund in each State. All costs, including administrative costs, would be charged to the fund and all amounts received from credited to it. In effect, it would become a revolving fund. On this suggestion, I am informed that such a fund would be applicable where States acted entirely on behalf of, and under the. direction of, the Commonwealth. It would not be applicable where a State is co-operating under an agreement that involves a system of clear and specific repayments, as is proposed for this scheme. A revolving fund of this kind is also less appropriate . where moneys would be made available by way of a mixture of grant and loan, although that type of accounting difficulty possibly could be overcome. However, the accounting and administrative arrangements are not the crux of the issue. The real question is one The Commonwealth view is that State Mr Askin asked the Commonwealth to provide the whole of the funds required. -o n the grant-loan basis I have mentioned-for the moneys that will be used leave the industry and the farmers whose prepared to find all of the money for the writing off of the redundant assets on States should exercise full powers of administrative nature. The Commonwealth does not wish to interfere in the decision making role of any State in respect of individual applications that come before whatever instrumentality that State nominates to handle the scheme. However, as the Commonwealth and the State are both concerned for the welfare of dairy farmers and for improvement of the dairy industry, I consider it reasonable for the Commonwealth to expect that the terms and conditions under which the scheme is to operate will be agreed with the Commonwealth before the scheme is implemented. I think it most reasonable also that the Commonwealth should expect to be provided with a regular flow of information about decisions made by each State so that the Government can be assured that the scheme is operating on agreed lines. With ordinary care, losses arising under the scheme should be minimal. Over a period of years, it may not be possible for losses to be completely avoided, but my understanding is that lands administration authorities in the various States have a good record of keeping losses to a low level. In any event, if losses are incurred they should be far less than the amount of grant money available to a State after writeof New South Wales, and south west offs are financed. In short, the most that could happen would be that any such losses would be covered by grant moneys. However, the important thing is that each State should be willing to stand behind the actions of the instrumentality that it appoints to handle dairy farm reconstruction. By accepting the write-off of redundant fixed improvements, the Commonwealth is bearing by far the largest foreseeable loss. Furthermore, if, as a result of some unforeseeable occurrence beyond the control of the State, such as a major drought, a State found itself in the position where it might incur an overall loss from its operations of the scheme, the Commonwealth would be prepared to consider the provision of additional assistance. As far as administrative costs are concerned, it has long been the practice that the States and Commonwealth each bear their own administrative costs. In any case, each State will be in the position of obtaining interest on whatever part of the grant moneys is advanced to purchasers buying land and this interest should be sufficient to cover State administrative expenses for the scheme. In effect, Mr Askin suggested to the Commonwealth that the funds for the reconstruction of the low-income sector of the dairy industry should be passed to the States, and that they should be completely free to use this money according to their own discretion. The Commonwealth, for its part, has made what I consider to be a most generous offer to the States. It is, moreover, an offer in which the Commonwealth has been careful to avoid encroaching on the States' decision making role. It has been estimated that throughout Australia there are some 24,000 dairy farmers in the manufacturing sector receiving a net income of less than $2,000 a year. Many of these are operating farms on a scale of enterprise that, even with the greatest of effort on the part of the farmer, cannot provide an income adequate to maintain a standard of living acceptable in the Australian community. The problem is aggravated by the fact that these lowincome farms are mostly concentrated in certain regions of Australia, in particular south eastern Queensland, the north coast Western Australia. Nevertheless, lowincome farms exist in all States. In Victoria, for example, it is estimated that there are up to 7,500 butterfat producing farms which have a net farm income less than $2,000 a year. In the implementation of the scheme, properties purchased from dairy farmers wishing to leave the industry will generally include fixed improvements which contribute approximately 20% to 25% of the fair market value. On the other hand, these fixed improvements may have no value for the purchaser of the land wishing to build up his property to a viable level. The Commonwealth, through its grant to the States, is prepared to meet the costs of writing off the value of any redundant fixed improvements purchased from the outgoing farmer. This means that any low-income dairy farmer who wishes voluntarily to quit the industry through the scheme can obtain a fair price for his farm rather than being forced out by economic strangulation, but the farmer whose property is being built up will not be called upon to become indebted for improvements that are not of direct use to hiin. This scheme will help dairy farmers. It ment I shall for convenience refer to the will assist the economies of those regions Company Law Advisory Committee as 'the where low-income farmers are conAdvisory Committee'. centrated.

62,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa,"Leader ofJess) said that the Government would make time available to debate a matter of public importance which the honourable member for La Trobe had proposed for discussion and which, in fact, he had notified to you, Mr Speaker. I submit that the Leader of the House was reflecting on your rights in this matter. You have already received a letter from the honourable member for La Trobe proposing such a matter for debate and you also received a letter from the honourable member for Stirling proposing another matter for discussion. You chose, as you are entitled to do under the Standing Orders, the second matter for discussion. It may well beI certainly expect it will be the case-that there will be letters on the remaining sitting days, other than Thursdays, from myself and my colleagues proposing matters of public importance for discussion. If there is a renewed letter by the honourable member for La Trobe reiterating his matter then it is not for the Government to decide which matter will be discussed. It is for you, Mr Speaker, and I submit thai you should assert your rights in this case. My colleagues and 1 differed, with respect, from the decision you made when you received two letters a week ago. We, with respect, support the decision you have made today when confronted with two letters. You should assert, we submit, your rights to determine such matters this is a matter of privilege. I think the Leader of the Opposition is getting away from the matter of privilege in referring to previous letters that were brought before me.

Not only is the High Court entrusted with the special task of interpreting and safeguarding the ConstituHansen, B. P. tion, but it is also the supreme court of Harrison. E.

In 1965, other judges of the Supreme Court of New South Wales received an annual salary of $17,000 and an annual allowance of $600. The present figures are $19,550 and $750, except for the President of the Court of Appeal who receives an annual salary of $20,125 and an annual allowance of $750.

Even in the case of the Chief Justice of the High Court, the annual amount receivable by him is now only marginally higher than that receivable by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The Government has decided that the position of the High Court requires that parliamentary approval should be sought for fixing the annual amounts payable to the Justices of the High Court of Australia at the figures I have already mentioned, and the Bill provides accordingly. The new figures will operate from the date of the assent to this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Connor) adjourned. Bill presented by Mr Bowen, and read a first time. Second Reading General) [4.0]I move: That the BiU be now read a second time. This Bill is complementary to the Judiciary Bill. The latter deals with the salaries of the judges of the High Court. The purpose of this Bill is to enable increased annual amounts to be paid to the judges of the Commonwealth Industrial Court, the Federal Court of Bankruptcy, the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory and the Supreme Court of the Northern members of the Commonwealth Conciliation Territory, and to the presidential members and Arbitration Commission, which is the of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. [Quorum formed.] It will alter the salary of the judges and deputy presidents from $17,000 to $22,000 a year and that of the Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and the President of the Commission from $19,000 to $24,000. In addition, the Chief Judge and the President are to receive $1,500 a year as an allowance. The other judges and the deputy presidents are to receive an Government reviewed the salaries of the justices of the High Court, it also looked at the salaries of other Federal judges, and found the same disparity between the present salaries of those judges and State judges, to which I referred in my second reading speech dealing with the salaries of High Court judges. The present basic judicial salary of $17,000 is no longer in keeping with the standing of the judges of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and the Territory Supreme Courts, which are superior courts having jurisdiction comparable with that of State Supreme Courts. I remind honourable members that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales now receives a salary of $21,275 and an annual allowance of $1,000. The President of the Court of Appeal receives an annual salary of $20,125 and an allowance of $750. The other judges of that Court receive a salary of $19,550 and an allowance of $750. In fact, the annual amount receivable at present by the Chairman of the District Court of New South Wales-$17,595 , plus an annual allowance of $750-is appreciably greater than that receivable by the Commonwealth judges I have mentioned, other than the Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. The effective annual amounts receivable by other District Court judges in New South Wales aTe almost exactly the same as the present salaries of those Commonwealth judges. The present amounts receivable by the Chief Justice and other Supreme Court judges in Victoria also are appreciably higher than the corresponding amounts receivable by the Chief Judge and judges of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. The present salaries of the presidential",28,Judiciary Bill 1969

The President and deputy presidents of the Commonwealth Commission receive the same salaries as the Chief Judge and the judges of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. The President and members of the New South Wales Commission receive the same salaries and allowances as the President of the Court of Appeal and puisne judges of the Supreme Court. The proposed increases will remove the disparities I have mentioned in relation to both other Commonwealth salaries and State judicial salaries, whilst maintaining a proper relationship with the salaries of the High Court judges. As in the case of the Judiciary Bill, the new provisions will become operative when the Bill is assented to. I commend the BiU to the House.

No longer can this country, with its limited population and its vast areas, enjoy the luxury of letting everything go its own way without any planning. No longer can Australia allow the shipping interests to be responsible for a certain part at their discretion or the railways, the airlines and private road hauliers to do some of it. Instead of bringing down a Bill to deal with roads the Government should present to this Parliament in the not too distant future a comprehensive plan for the integration of the whole of our transport system so that goods can be transported throughout Australia at a much cheaper rate than is now possible. It is well known that transport costs are among the major costs in the economy of this country. Therefore anything that adds to the cost of production, such as place to another, should be closely examined by this Government. It is the responsibility of the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Sinclair) to bring before this Parliament at an early date a comprehensive programme for the integration of the whole of the Australian transport system.

I also appreciate the difficulties of shire councils, but at the same time some consideration has to be given to the amount of money which has been contributed by the urban taxpayer in the form of rates to local government bodies and in the form of tax on the petrol he uses to run his car around the cities. The new system which has been introduced to cater for the needs of the respective areas is a much more equitable form of distributing the revenue which has been, raised.

(b) Estimates based on the registrations ot new motor cars and station wagons. These tables show that between 1958-59 and 1968-69 the revenue collected by the Commonwealth in the form of excise and customs on petrol and diesel fuel totalled $1,930,108,000. In turn, the Commonwealth has paid to the States for roads $1,131,422,000, which shows that in the last 10 years there has been a surplus of $598,422,000. The surplus for the last 5 years is shown at $397m. So it is obvious that the Federal Government is using excise and customs on petrol and diesel fuels as a means of revenue. In the same period from 1958-59 to 1967-68 the Government has been able to raise by way of sales tax on new motor cars and station wagons a Payments to total of $1,103,234,000.

76,The Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon) Stated In,"has been most generous in increasing the allocation to the States from $750m to $ 1,252m, which will be the allocation over the next 5 years. I give the lie to this statehas it been so generous? Why has not the ment of generosity, because as far as I am concerned the Government is continuing to pursue the policy that it has pursued in recent years of using petrol tax as a means of revenue. I know that the Minister or Government supporters will come back at me at a later stage and say that when the Australian Labor Party was in government between 1941 and 1949 it did not use the whole of the petrol tax for roads. I agree that the Labor Government did not use the whole of the petrol tax for the construction of roads at that time. But let us consider how the circumstances prevailing today differ from those that prevailed in the period from 1941 to 1949. From 1939 to 1945 we fought one of the greatest wars that was ever fought in the world. How could the Government carry on a policy of road construction during a time when everything was keyed for war production? There is an obvious explanation why roads were not given priority over the supply of war materials. During the period from 1946 to 1949 the Government was concentrating on building up the whole economy to meet the demands of the nation. Since that period this Government has had 20 years to build up the economy and to develop a road system and a transport system by using all the money raised as petrol tax on roads. Other countries throughout the world use all the petrol tax they collect for the construction of roads. This Government should do likewise. As I said a few moments ago, in my opinion, the Government is still continuing its miserly policy of using petrol tax as a source of revenue. 1 have compiled two tables. The first one is based on my estimate of Government revenue for the next 5 years. This estimate is based on the average increase in the amount of custonis and excise on petrol which this Government has been able to obtain over the past 10 years. The average yearly increase over the past 10 years has been 8%. If one applied that 8% to the next 5 years, one would finish with a surplus of $459m. If we take thefiguressubmitted by the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads forecasting an increase in the consumption of petrol of about 5% a year, we find that in that period the Government will receive Si,566m in revenue. Once again if we deduct from that $ 1,252m it will leave a surplus of $314m. What is the Government's position? Where whole of this money been allocated to the States and to local government bodies for the construction of roads? Is there a need for morefinanceto be made available to State and local government authorities for road construction? Any fair minded citizen would agree with me that the Commonwealth should make more finance available to the States. On ISth March the National Roads and Motorists Association, in an editorial in its journal under the heading 'Road Grant Inadequate', stated: We will continue to press for the whole of the fuel tax to be allocated for roads. Clearly the Labor Party is not alone in this matter. The National Roads and Motorists Association, as the spokesman for motorists in New South Wales, is pressing strongly to have the whole of the fuel tax allocated to roads. If that money were added to the allocations now made to State and local governnient authorities for road construction much more could be done. These days we hear a lot about road safety. The New South Wales Minister for Transport never seems too weary to come up with new ideas for improving road safety. He has used the Breathalyser, radar speed checks and plain clothes police in unmarked vehicles in an effort to catch motorists. But in my humble opinion the real problem is that the road system is not adequate to carry the volume of traffic that it has to carr) at the speed at which modern motor vehicles travel. Motor car manufacturers are producing vehicles that travel faster than superseded models. The manufacturers boast that their new vehicles can travel at 120 miles an hour but they do not tell the public thaf our roads are not capable of carrying vehicles travelling at that speed. Until our roads are improved the fatality rate will continue to rise. I wonder whether the Government was proud of the recent announcement that the road fatality rate in Australia was the highest of any country. In New Zealand there are 5.2 road deaths for every 10.000 vehicles registered; in the United States 5.5 deaths; in the United Kingdom 6.1; and in Canada 7.2. In Australia there are 8.1 deaths for every 10,000 vehicles registered. Our figure U roughly 50% greater than the figures for New Zealand and the United States. The Government must be proud of Australia's record of having the worse road fatality rate of any major developed country. In 1967-68 there were 3,249 people killed and 81,148 injured in road accidents in Australia. The Treasurer must be aware of the cost of those deaths and injuries to the economy. He will appreciate what the lost earning capacity of the 3,249 people killed and more than 81,000 injured means to the economy. The cost of repairing the vehicles involved in those accidents would be staggering. The Australian Road Research Board has estimated that motor vehicle accidents in Australia during 1966-67-the last year for which official figures are available-cos t between $550m and $775m. Does the Treasurer think that such a staggering cost does not call for consideration by the Government? Taking the higher figure of $775m we find that it represents more than 50% of the amount which the Commonwealth , is making available to the States for the construction of roads in the next 5 years. The sum which the Government proposes to hand to the States is about $470m on my assessment, but S314m on the Government's assessment, less than receipts from the fuel tax. However, if it does anything to save Australian lives and reduce production losses it will be money well spent. The New South Wales Commissioner for Main Roads, in an article published in the journal of the Department of Main Roads in July 1968, said: It is of interest to know that on rural highways two or more vehicles are involved in 59% of all accidents whereas on the tollway only 12% of the accidents involve two or more vehicles. He was referring to the section of the Sydney to Newcastle tollway that had been completed at that stage. I stress those figures because they are important. They show what great savings in lives may be effected if you have a divided carriageway. Injuries and production losses may be reduced considerably by building more dual carriageways. This is a matter which, for the sake of road safety, the Treasurer should consider. Perhaps the young lady who lost her life only last week in an accident between a semi-trailer and a tourist bus would be alive today if the vehicles had been travelling on a divided carriageway similar to the tollway. Remember that the accident took place on one of Australia's principal highways-the Hume Highway. It is not a back rural road; it is the principal highway between Sydney and Melbourne. It is a disgrace that accidents of this kind should occur on our major highways. This is not something that we can be proud of. We shouid be working to avoid the possibility of vehicles colliding head on. In the interests of road safety it is up to the Government to provide safer roads. Road construction requires a great deal of research. I recently had the opportunity to discuss road research being carried out in the United States. I welcome the expenditure of $18m on research over the next 5 years. This is a most important matter. I think the amount should be increased. We should carry out research into the types of vehicles using our roads, the best type of road construction, gradients and so on. Research in the United States into accidents caused by vehicles leaving the road has led to the finding that banking of roads should not be too sharp. Roads should be designed in such a way that when a vehicle leaves the road it does not roll. The Government should be engaged in research of this kind. I would not oppose an increase in the proposed expenditure of $18m if it would help to make our roads safer and enable people to travel from one point to another more safely than they can now. Traffic delays lead to loss of productivity. As the representative of a city electorate the Treasurer knows of the congestion that occurs in capital cities. He knows that many man hours are lost when vehicles are forced to wait to pass over level crossings, are held up at traffic lights or are delayed by congestion on the roads. In September last year when presenting the firm's annual report the Managing Director of Mayne Nickless Ltd said: Every minute a truck is delayed in traffic or at loading or unloading points costs between 5 cents and 10 cents. Any honourable member can work out how much the nation loses when vehicles are held up in traffic. We have seen how traffic crawls during the morning and afternoon peak periods. I recall vividly how early this year I travelled across Sydney a distance of about 18 miles. The journey took If hours. I was not driving the car; the driver was an experienced Commonwealth driver who knew Sydney like the back of his hand. As a result of this congestion the economy as a whole sustains a great loss. Is it any wonder that the people who are responsible for transport in Australia today are continually complaining and demanding that more money should be spent on roads? Is it any wonder that they can produce figures such as those that 1 have quoted to the House dealing with the death rate on roads as a result of holdups and delays caused to traffic at tevel crossings, for instance? The Government should be pursuing a policy of endeavouring to eliminate rail crossings wherever this is posof this Act, be deemed to have been set aside by sible. I am not talking about rural level crossings where so many lives are lost. This is something in which I think the railway authorities responsible have a part to play. They should tackle the problem of rural roads where cars collide with oncoming trains. This system of level crossings is something about which 1 think these authorities must take action at a very early date. There are just a few features of the Bill to which I would Hke to make reference. I note with interest that the Government has broadened the interpretation of the word 'road', in terms of the use of these grants to include: (a) (b) (c) street lighting equipment; (d) (e) a bridge or tunnel for the use of pcdestrains, associated with a road. Whilst the Bill makes provision that this money may be spent on those items, I would like the Government to insist on a certain amount of this money being spent on those facilities. Under previous roads agreements, road funds could not be used for traffic control or for street lighting. It is obvious that street lighting or lighting of main roads is just as important as the other items that were covered. It is just as important that main roads be lit adequately as it is to have those main roads constructed properly. I would like the Treasurer to insist that a certain amount of this money be spent on providing lighting for main roads or for arterial roads, for the reasons that I have just outlined. That is why much safer crossings are not provided. Provision is made for better facilities. Papers that have been presented at different places have clearly established that lighting is important in road safety. I would like the Treasurer to insist that a certain amount of this money be made available for street lighting on main roads. Another point in the Bill to which I wish to refer is contained in clause 2 which states: (2.) An amount paid by a State to a municipal, shire or other local authority for a particular purpose shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to have been expended by the State for that purpose, and an amount set aside by a State for payment to a municipal, shire or other local authority for a particular purpose shall, for the purposes the State for expenditure for that purpose. I will illustrate to the House what concerns me. In his second reading speech the Treasurer said: If State and local authorities again increase expenditure on roads from their own resources by about 50% over the next 5 years, total roads expenditure, could, with a Commonwealth aid roads grant of $l,252m, reach about $3,900m, an increase of about 54%. What concerns me is that the Government, according to this Bill, has limited the minimum increase that the States are required to contribute by writing into the Bill a clause that provides that the States shall increase their allocation for roads by the increase in a road sign; tbe number of registered vehicles in the traffic control equipment; State concerned over and above the number of registered vehicles in the base year of a vehicular ferry; or 1966. mum amount. The States can allocate more if they want to do so. They can increase registration charges or obtain additional money how they like. The minimum amount is that determined by an increase in the number of vehicles registered over and above the number of registered vehicles in the base year of 1966. No provision has been written into the Bill restricting local government contributions or providing what shall be the minimum amount that a local government shall contribute. Knowing something about the road agreements in New South Wales between the Department of Main Roads and local governments, I can visualise some local government",31,Sales Tax Collected In Australia On

78,Mr Charles Jonesi Said The Mini,"authorities being placed in the most embarrassing position of being offered by the Department a large sum which, according to the formula of the Department, has to be matched by the local authority that is to receive it. This could place a council in a most embarrassing position. It might need to increase its rate substantially. I have here a table that was supplied to me by the Town Clerk of the City of Newcastle. Admittedly, it is dated 28th March 1966. I did not ask that gentleman to go to the trouble of bringing it up to date. AllI want to do is to show a percentage comparison of the difference that exists between local government requirements and Department of Main Roads grants. In the 10 years ended 1965, the Department of Main Roads allocated £1,540,141 and the contribution from the councils was £690,533. So, the councils had to provide approximately 45% of the money used for road purposes. The figure varies from year to year. I can show the House that in some years there were matching grants. In the 1956 agreement, the Department of Main Roads grant was £53,000 and the contribution by the councils was £56,000. In 1965, the grant by the Department was $311,000 and the contribution by the councils totalled $204,000. Thefiguresfluctuate year by year. WhatI am getting at is that the contripetrol tax on these vehicles. He was unable bution by the State governments is reguto give me any indication of the amount. lated under the Bill. The Bill lays down I am one who owns one of these boats. It the minimum amount that they are required is not a big one. I do not get the opporto contribute based on movements in the tunity to use it a lot, but I do know the registration of vehicles. But I point out that amount of petrol which is consumed by a local government could be placed in the craft of this kind. terribly embarrassing position of having either to reject a grant from the Departand navigational facilities for them in ment of Main Roads or of increasing its estuaries, rivers, harbours and the like so rates. I would like the Government to that the people who own these boats for make sure that some of this money is allopleasure can get some benefit out of them. cated direct to local governments, but I Under the previous agreement the States realise that in such a case a problem received some assistance from the money concerning State politics arises. What the collected from these vessels, but under this States give to local government is their Bill there is no such provision. I should like responsibility. But the whole thing is tied the Minister at some later stage to amend up with roads. I believe that some discusthe Bill to make available to the States sion should be held between the Commonsome of the money that is collected by way wealth, the States and the representatives of taxes on petrol and diesel fuel. I have a of local government-eithe r the Australian Press cutting in front of me relating to a Local Government Association or each question that was asked of Mr Davis State local government association-to hamHughes, the Country Party Minister for mer out this question of finance for roads Public Works in New South Wales. He was as it involves the Department of Main Roads and local authorities in each State so that local government authorities will not be placed in the embarrassing situation which I have indicated and which I fear might arise if the Commonwealth Government continues to allocate money to States for roads and leaves it with those States to determine to whom the money should be granted. I believe that some clear understanding should exist on this important subject, if necessary, after discussions on it. I wish to refer to one other point in this Bill. This is the question of assistance to the maritime industry. I have with me the annual report for the year ended 1967-68 of the New South Wales Maritime Services Board. It discloses that, in the 12 months period, 27,030 vessels were registered and that licences were held for the control of the vessels capable of travelling in excess of 10 miles per hour and of less than 50 feet in length. I refer to the power boat, the pleasure craft that so many people are buying today. These figures disclosed that in New South Wales alone 27,030 of these vessels were registered. We could more than double that figure to get the total number of vessels for the whole of Australia. It would be difficult to get precise figures. RecentlyI asked the responsible Minister how much revenue was raised by way of I know of the need to provide ramps asked whether he was aware that a fishing port on the New South Wales coast was in dire circumstances because there were only inches of water on the bar at low water and whether he would make available some money out of the petrol tax that was collected to enable the dredging of the port. Fishing boats and pleasure craft use these ports and there is need for the Government to consider giving some nnancial assistance to enable better facilities to be provided. I should not like to estimate how much revenue the Commonwealth collects from this source but 1 would hazard the guess that it would be at least $2m in the next 5 years. That would be a conservative estimate. If the Commonwealth gave that amount to the States and tbe States added to. it the money they collected from the registration of these boats and the licensing of tbe drivers-ever y person who drives a power boat capable of travelling at 10 miles an hour or more has to be licensed-the States could supply improved facilities at the river estuaries, ports and even outside ports for these boats. 1 ask the Government to give serious consideration to this aspect. I do not want to press, this matter further, but on behalf of the Opposition I move: That all words after That' be omitted with a view devoted to road planning and research. to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'this House, while not opposing the Bill, regrets Supplementary grants totalling about the Government's continumg refusal to plan expenditure of an amount at least equivalent to the proceeds of all the automotive fuel taxes on roads and associated facilities.' -Order! Is the amendment seconded? Mr CostaI second the amendment and reserve my right to speak later. this Bill the States are to be granted financial assistance for road works. A sum of $1,252m is to be made available over a period of 5 years. This is 67% more than the total grants of about $750m during the previous 5 years.. This is a considerable increase, regardless of what some honourable members may suggest. The responsibility for building and maintaining roads, rests with the State governments and local authorities who play an important part in this scheme of things throughout Australia. The Commonwealth's role in the main has been to make money available for such purposes. Back in 1930 it provided about $4m a j-ear but now that provision has increased to the proportions that I mentioned earlier. During the last 5 years, when $750m was made available, there was little guidance as to where the money was to be spent, except that at least 40% was to be spent on rural roads other than main roads, highways and trunk roads. There was also a stipulation as to an amount that was to be made available in respect of watercraft, but some change is proposed in the present legislation. The stipulation regarding the 40% expenditure bas, to some extent, disappeared, but we do have a basefigurethat has to be applied to rural roads other than arterial roads. That sum will be escalated at the rate of 5% compounded over the next 5 years. In Western Australia the situaiion is somewhat different because an extra amount of $40m is being made available. There are three main categories on which money is to be spent. Some $600m is to be allocated for the construction of arterial and sub-arterial roads in the State capitals and major provincial cities; almost $187m is to be expended on arterial roads in rural areas; and almost $395m is to be spent on minor rural roads. In addition SI 8m is to be $52m are to be provided to Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. Western Australia, will receive about $40m in supplementary grants. This provision is important to Western Australia. However, it is difficult to follow how the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads decided that Western Australia should receive about 8% of the total amount to be provided to the States for roads. Western Australia is almost one-third of the size of the Commonwealth and it is developing at a tremendous pace. It is of extreme importance to the Commonwealth as a whole. I do not think I am exaggerating when I say Government will be looking to Western Australia to balance the Commonwealth's books during the period 1970 to 1980. I notice that the Postmaster-General( Mr Hulme) is smiling. T do not know whether he is smiling at that statement, but Australia's balance of payments in the mid1970s will be relying heavily on mineral exports and the largest percentage of such",34,Sales Tax Collected In Australia On

81,That The Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon) And The,"exports will be from Western Australia. If sufficient exports are to be made then the Commonwealth must do its bit in helping to provide adequate roads because there is not one railway in the area of the mineral discoveries that has been built by the Government. Private money has been spent in the area. Roads play a tremendous part in this development. 1 do not treat this matter lightly. I treat it very seriously, when I consider our future balance of payments position. The west is progressing very rapidly, not only in relation to the development of iron ore deposits but also in relation to the development of the agricultural industries. In many areas in which development is taking place, road transport is the only means of transport available. There is no other form of transport. Railways have not been built up in the southern areas of the Slate of Western AustraUa. Commonwealth money was used to upgrade the railway line between Kalgoorlie and Perth, but this again was done in order to carry iron ore to Kwinana or Cockburn Sound. There are one or two other points I want to make in relation to the construction of roads in urban areas. Urban road development is now split up into two categories, but in many cases the area involved is not entirely urban. In many cases it comes within the rural sector and it takes in a number of shires which will not be able to receive assistance provided in the Bill for the rural sector. This area will depend entirely on receiving assistance provided for the urban sector. This could create some difficulties. I understand that the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Sinclair) has certain powers available to him. One of those powers is to designate the roads on which money shall just not built in rural' areas. Railways are be spent. Therefore I believe that he built only for the carriage of large tonshould look very closely at some of these nages of bulk cargo, such as iron ore, areas outside the metropolitan area, which bauxite or some other mineral. Wc have take in a considerable number of shires but an important role to see that country people which come within the urban sector as get what I call a fair go in country areas defined in this Bill. These are not urban in which road transport is the only means areas in the true sense. They may be of transport. A reasonable amount of money urban areas in 20 or 30 years, but within is being made available in this Bill, but the 5 years covered by this Bill they will the States themselves will have to do their be defined as urban areas and will not be able to receive the assistance provided in bit in making extrafinanceavailable in some this Bill for the rural sector. As the areas. In this measure the Commonwealth Minister has power to designate upon which has laid down the areas in which it is roads money should be spent, I believe he intended that the money should be spent. should look very closely at the question I have raised. The State Government in Western Australia has a responsibility in this matter. It can spend the additional $40m which it is to receive under this Bill on any road which it nominates. The Commonwealth does not place any restriction on which roads the State may nominate. Referring back to the 8% of the total amount which it was suggested should be spent on roads in Western Australia, I point out that country roads have an important role to play today. A tremendous .amount of goods is transported on country roads. The transport of the whole of the wheat crop, the wool clip and our meat production, which comprise the three major industries in Australia at the present time, has to start in country areas, and almost without exception it starts on country roads. Regarding the five per cent annual increase over the base year to be spent on roads in the rural sector, that is, other than arterial roads, the amount could well have been greater when we consider the areas in this country which rely entirely upon roads. There is no other form of transportation available in these areas. We must also take into consideration the tonnage of goods which is carted over these roads and also the fact that school buses, which are the only means of getting children to school in these areas, have to travel over these roads. There is no other form of transport available for these children, and in many areas of Australia the children just do not get to school at certain times of the year. So any restriction which is placed on the amount of money spent on roads in these areas would have a detrimental effect on these children. As I mentioned previously, railways are It has laid down three main categories in relation to roads and it has also laid down that money shall be provided for planning and research. I think it would be a good idea if the States themselves were to do precisely the same thing, that is, to lay down the categories in which money is intended to be spent by the States and local authorities in the next 5 years. They could bring forth a table which showed the areas in which they intended to spend the money, as has been done by the Commonwealth. Then all would know precisely where the money is to be spent. I should like to say a word or two about the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads and the report which it has presented. As I have mentioned, the Bureau recommended that approximately 8% of the money made available to the States for roads should be given to Western Australia. I think it recommended that Tasmania should receive about 6%-previousl y it had been receiving 5%. It recommended that South Australia should receive about 6%, Queensland about 21%, Victoria about 19% and New South Wales about 36%. I think that was the Bureau's finding. It did a cost analysis, which is part of the modern technique in arriving at answers to certain questions. When one is doing a survey on something one does a cost analysis. It is very interesting to note how the Bureau went about this matter. Of course, it did not have, a great deal of time in which to arrive at a result, and I am not in possession of a more recent report which I understand will be available. Perhaps it will be somewhat clearer. But in the report I have before me the Bureau said that the survey was not really complete. It stated:. It was not practicable to measure, in monetary terms, certain benefits and costs associated with investment in new road works, e.g. the net benefit to the community of all weather access to farm properties; improved accessibility to rural areas; damage to goods in transit; tourism; provision of parking facilities*, . . . If one cannot analyse those benefits and costs one cannot arrive at a very accurate figure. When looking at this question surely one does not take the number of vehicles containing one person travelling along the road, add up certain numbers and come to a certain conclusion. Surely one must take into consideration the tonnages of goods that are being shifted in this country, for the benefit of the country and for the very survival of the country, as well as the number of vehicles that are moving across country or city areas. The number of vehicles does not mean very much. We must consider the tonnage of the goods being carried and the number of people shifting these goods. This matter is not to be ignored in the future, because provision for planning and research .is made in this Bill. No doubt some research will be done in the metropolitan areas of Australia. I hope that some planning and research will be done in relation to industries. I certainly hope that some overall planning and research will be done, because transport is the biggest single cost in Australia. One gets into an awful mess in this country if one tries to carry out some cost surveys in relation to getting goods from point A to point B. It is interesting to note what has in fact been happening, not only in Australia but in other countries, in regard to congestion and what can be done about this problem. New York might be a good example of this. A freeway has been built in New York around Manhatten Island. This was very good for the movement of road traffic in that area. But it was recognised almost immediately by those who knew that goods moving into Manhattan Island, which is almost surrounded by finger berths, by way of water would have to go to some other place because of the congestion caused by this freeway. This road was built right against the water's edge. The people who built this road might as well have built a wall because this is exactly the result. One section of transport cannot be hemmed off in this fashion by another section of transport. But this is exactly what is happening in some Australian cities today. Sydney is a glaring example of this. The result in New York has been that shipping interests have left the area completely and have gone out to Elizabeth where they have secured hundreds of acres of territory and have started all over again. The people of Australia have to realise that our various sections of transport have to couple up, one with the other. Until this is done we will always have the tremendous congestion that we find in Australia today. This is where costs and delays are found. This is where the real problems are. We cannot carry out research or planning for roads in a piecemeal way; we must do ii in conjunction with all sections of transport. Until this fact is recognised in Australia we will not get anywhere in regard to the cost factor. There problems can be seen in major areas of the world today. Some countries have recognised the problems and have done something about them, but many areas in Australia are still in the position where walls are literally being built between different sections of transport. Until we get out of this situation we can never hope to make a success of what we are trying to do. This is a very costly process. So, I suggest to the Government that if it wants to carry out research and planning on roads thc work should be done in conjunction with all other sections of transport and should no! be tied to the section relating to roads only I would like to say one or two words country areas for the purpose of building about tbe other sections involved in the and maintaining roads the money should area of road construction.

So it is authorities such as shires. The amount of evident that not less money, but more rates paid is quite high enough in some money is required in this field. I repeat cases. There may be some exceptionsthere always is to every rule, but generally the world, it is only heavy, bulk cargoes speaking the rates are quite high enough such as metals that are carried by rail in the shires. We cannot afford to increase today or for which new railways are being the cost spiral that exists in country areas. built. In every other field the tonnage of Quite often we have heard in this House talk about the principle of one vote one value. Okay, but if any honourable members disagree with me when I say that the rates in shires in country areas are not high enough today I suggest that they do an exercise on the amount per head that is paid in the form of rates in country shires and the amount that is paid per head in the cities of Australia. I think that when this exercise is done that honourable members will agree with me that people who live in country shires pay sufficient rates. I am not suggesting that there might not be some increase in some city areas; but if this exercise is done honourable members will find that the rates are quite high enough, and in fact in many cases are far too high, in country areas. So, I suggest that if more money is required in some This is a very important measure.

83,Mr Cope (Watson) [5.9],"I listened and $56.25m for Tasmania. Included in theexcise on motor spirit before 30th June 1974 which would further increase the revenue obtained from this source. It is interesting to note that in the current 5-year plan due to expire on 30th June this year, the motor vehicle users in New South Wales and Victoria contributed approximately SI72m to the other States for their roads. For example, for each $1 contributed by the individual States in fuel tax Western Australia received back 52.05, Tasmania $1.53, Queensland $1.27, South Australia $1.06, New South Wales 83c and Victoria 67c. So it can readily be seen that Victoria and New South Wales play a major role in catering for the road needs of the other four States, particularly Western Australia and Tasmania. One important factor which has not been taken into account in this Bill, as was the case in 1964, is the question of the maintenance of roads in each State. For example, the cost of maintaining roads in New South Wales and Victoria is much higher than in the other States. This is due to the volume of traffic, particularly heavy trailer vehicles. I would venture to say that the ratio of trailer vehicle use in New South Wales and Victoria as against Western Australia and Tasmania would be at least ten to one. I shall now refer to the part played by local government authorities in the construction and maintenance of our road system. These bodies are responsible for 70% of this work. This is placing a perennial drain on the financial resources of local government bodies, and it must be emphasised that local government authorities have only three sources of income, that is, rates, loan money and Government grants. I shall categorise the three sources of finance. Firstly, rates have increased more than 500% over the past 20 years until today they have almost reached saturation point. This is evidenced by the fact that many local authorities are often faced with difficulties in collecting rates due, simply because many ratepayers cannot afford to pay them. Secondly, in relation to loan money, we find local government authorities are indebted for approximately $600m, upon which an annual interest bill of $30m is paid. The shouldering of this interest burden has been and is a major contributing factor in forcing local authorities to charge high rates which, in many areas, are deemed extremely excessive. Thirdly, Government grants average only about 15% of local government expenditure on roads. This compares most unfavourably with the grant of 27% to the States by the United States Government and 3t% to the provinces by the Canadian Government. The traffic position in the capital cities, particularly Sydney and Melbourne, is now a major problem for road authorities, and, with the rapidly increasing number of motor vehicles on the roads additional finance must be made available immediately to provide additional outlets for traffic. Unless this is done there will be complete chaos in city traffic over the next 5 years. A conference of the lord mayors of major cities of Australia several years ago stressed this point when the problem was not as acute as it is today. This is also evidenced by a resolution passed at a Pan American Congress held in Washington DC several years ago. An extract from the resolution reads: Since the need of the cities for highway development and modernisation was not, until recently, as obvious as the needs for road improvement in rural areas, the rural areas in the past have been given preferred attention. The accumulating highway needs of the cities have now become urgent. They are receiving more attention and a greater share of State nnd Federal highway tax revenue. That extract highlights the fact that our major cities traffic problems are now similar to those of the major cities in the United States of America. 1 repeat and emphasise that additional finance must be channelled into the construction of outlets for city traffic, ft is recognised by traffic experts that the slowing down of traffic and the many bank-ups of traffic in the cities are contributing in a large degree to the high cost of transporting goods. I would say that there is no completely satisfactory solution to this city traffic problem. However, I submit the position can be considerably relieved. In addition to providing finance for city outlets, the State governments should do more about the control of traffic. For example, I suggest that deliveries of goods to retail stores in the city should be made at night time. This would no doubt relieve the position considerably. Thought must also be given by the New .South Wales Government either to the erection of a second bridge to span Sydney Harbour or the construction of a tunnel beneath it. These suggestions have been mooted and discussed for some time now but as yet no finality has been reached or planning commenced. 1 should also like to speak, if I may, about some of the problems of traffic in Sydney and especially about the problems that relate to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. No government would take it upon itself to try to prevent motorists using that bridge during peak hours in the morning and evening, but we have a ridiculous situation. Many Sydney business people who live within a stone's throw of stations on the northern railway line and work within a stone's throw of Wynyard, Town Hall and Museum stations, drive their motor cars to work every day, park them in the city and pay the parking fee. The State Government should consider restricting the use of private vehicles in the city in future. I am aware that this would be a most unpopular move, but such action must be taken in the future if we are to overcome the chaotic conditions that we see in the major Australian cities now. is normal in debates relating to the provision offinancialassistance to the States for Commonwealth aid roads grants for the Opposition to be led by the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones). Today was no exception. However, it should be said that not more than 6 weeks ago, on 25th March, he raised in this House a matter of public importance which more or less related to the same subject. Today he used much the same arguments as he used on the earlier occasion. His contribution to the debate then and today centred on the necessity in his mind for the whole of the revenue collected by the Commonwealth from customs and excise taxes on petrol and diesel fuel to be used on roads by the States and the local government authorities and perhaps by the Commonwealth Government too. This proposition is fallacious. Aircraft use diesel fuel, kerosene or fuel of some kind. Manufacturers throughout Australia use automotive fuel in many of their operations. In addition, the Constitution, as far as I can make out, insists that all moneys collected by the Commonweallh be paid into Consolidated Revenue. No doubt that is the reason why the Bill, in clause 13, provides: Payments under ihis Act shall be made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly. To continue to argue that money collected by the Government from customs and excise should be paid back to the people of Australia for roads is to my mind fallacious. Another point made by the honourable member for Newcastle was that the Bureau of Roads said in its report that the revenue from fuel taxes would increase by approximately 4.9%. For the sake of rounding off the figure, the honourable member for Newcastle in March and again today used thefigureof 5%. On the basis of compound interest, we would find that the moneys spent over the next 5 years would be 27.6% more than the moneys spent over the past 5 years. I have compounded the rate of 5% per annum. In fact, the amount that is being allocated to the States for roads in the next 5 years will be 67% more than the amount allocated in the past 5 years. If we go back to a previous quinquennium -that is, from 1959 to 1964-w e find that the amount allocated for this purpose was 50% more than the amount in the previous period and not 27.6%. If we go back still further to the period from 1954 to 1959 we find that the increase was 62%. In other words, in 15 years the increases of the amount allocated by the Commonwealth for roads have been 62% between 1954 and 1959 and 50% between 1959 and 1964. The amounts now allocated will be an increase of 67% over the previous allocation. As has been mentioned, the previous allocation by this Government to the States was $750m and the amount now allocated will be $1,200m, with an additional S52m to be spent in Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. As I see it, this is a fairly simple Bill. PerhapsI should go back over the history of the allocation of money to the States for this purpose. I have always found it interesting to look at past legislation introduced into the Parliament by the government of the day. This type of legislation goes back to 1923. The Victorian Year Book states that, constitutionally, road construction is the responsibility of the States, but in varying amounts over the years the",40,Sales Tax Collected In Australia On
84,Mr Whittorn (Balaclava) [5.22],"I tCommonwealth has assisted by providing money for the purpose. In 1923 the Commonwealth Government offered a grant of $264,000 to the States on a 50-50 matching basis. This amount was to be used specifically for main roads. A distribution of 5% was made to Tasmania and this percentage has remained fairly static since then, although in the next quinquennium Tasmania will receive 6% of the total allocation. In 1923 the method of allocating the money to the States was made on thc basis of three-fifths on the basis of population and two-fifths on the basis of area. In those days, of course, the motor car was not a popular vehicle and the legislation made no mention of motor vehicles at all. Roads were the main concern then and stUl are. By reading Hansard for those days and for the intervening years I find that Treasurers of the various governments have never had the intention of invading State responsibilities. Certainly in the construction of roads the Commonwealth Government then and now always intended to assist the States in their activities and to assist them to the limit of the capacity of the Commonwealth Government. So when we read in newspapers that State Premiers claim sovereign rights as to what should be done here or should be done there, 1 feel that they must accept that this Commonwealth Government has done a tidy job. By 1st July this year we will have signed an agreement allocating to the States, in proportions already decided by them, $l,252m and there will be no strings, except several minor variations to the previous agreement. We have heard recently in questions in this House and elsewhere that one Premier has said that he will not do anything about matching the amounts that the Commonwealth Government will contribute to his and other States for nursing aid. 1 find on looking back through the records that that particular State is already spending $450,000 on nursing aid. I believe that the Premier feels that if the Commonwealth Government makes a contribution to that State he will be saddled with this $450,000 for nursing aid for all time. That Premier say that social services are the responsibility of the Commonwealth and the Federal Government accepts this responsibility. I would trade with him the $450,000 referred to for tbe $254.4m which that State will now receive in the form of a grant for roads, lf this State Premier continues to talk about the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government on the one hand and how be as a State Premier has sovereign rights on the other hand, that would be a good trade from my point of view. Since 1923 these Commonwealtb grants to the States have been given freely and by and large without any strings attached. Generally the grants to the States take two forms-genera l assistance under what is known as the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act and assistance for specific roads of national importance. All honourable members know that beef roads are of national importance to this country, that they have been a tremendous help in the development of Australia, and that they have filled a much needed want in the defence of the country. These roads, which have been built in Ihe northern and western areas, have been advantageous to the people of Australia and to tbe national economy. No doubt the legislation with which we are now dealing was discussed at the Premiers Conference held on 1.3th March this year. As a result of the discussions and the liberality of the Treasurer a sum 67% greater than the grant under the previous agreement has been granted to the States to produce really good roads in the next 5 years. The grand total of contributions by the Commonwealth to the States for the next 5 years will be $l,252m, which is an increase of $500m on that allocated for the previous 5 years. This is a fair effort. Earlier in my speech I related the tremendous percentage increase in the allocations to the States for road construction in each 5-year period. There have been several changes in the method of allocation to the States, but the formula of three-fifths as to population and two-fifths as to area remained much the same up to 1959 when the State Premiers, and no doubt the Prime Minister and the Treasurer of the day, decided to alter it to one-third as to population, one-third as to area and one-third as to motor vehicle registrations. In the period between 1923 and 1959 motor vehicles became part and parcel of our transport system and of the Australian economy and therefore some recognition in the form of money had to be given to the States to enable these motor vehicles to travel between various points. The honourable member for Watson( Mr ments to or for the States is a very interestCope) mentioned that there is a tremendous amount of congestion in various cities. Nobody can deny that, particularly when strikes occur such as there are today, a tremendous amount of congestion is caused by motor vehicles in city and metropolitan areas. In 1964 I said that when I was in New York in 1943 for a particular purpose all motor vehicles that were not carrying passengers, in other words trucks and so on, were kept out of the city limits between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. In other words, a large and thriving city like New York found it possible to keep large trucking vehicles out of the city area between those hours. When I made a visit to New York in 1967 I noticed that there had been some alteration to those restrictions. I was told that the traffic inflow was controlled by the council of the city of New York and that there was a limitation on large vehicles entering Manhatten between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. I think it would be an act of statesmanship on the part of the lord mayors who came to the federal discussion on roads some years ago if they were to think more about limiting the entry of large vehicles into city areas during the active period of the day. We all are aware of the congestion that takes place in city areas, particularly in Melbourne where we have the little streets, because of small trucks delivering tobacco supplies at one place, chocolate further up the same street and stockings, or panty hose as they are now called, at another point. Such vehicles are responsible for holding up the traffic which would normally pass through these small streets. As the honourable member for Newcastle said, there is no relation between the some of the controversy which has revolved revenue collected from customs and excise duty on petrol and the sum that is granted to the States by the Commonwealth. He did admit that when his Party was in power -it was so long ago that few of us can remember when it was-the customs and excise revenue was paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and it was then paid out of that Fund to the States by way of Commonwealth aid roads grants. I think honourable members v/ould find it interesting to know the history of how these Commonwealth aid roads grants have been increased since 1923. Table 52 on page 91 of the report of the Commonwealth's paying one. I have ascertained that between 1923 and 1950-whic h is 27 years-the Commonwealth paid to the States a total of $158m, or less than $6m a year. In the 14 years between 1950 and 1964 the Commonwealth Government allocated $928m in this form. In other words the sum of $6m per year for the previous 27 years had been increased to S66m per year. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Arthur) said that this was fantastic. I will surprise him 1 with the following information: In the next 5 years up to 1974 the Government will allocate to the States $1,250m which is a rate of S250m a year. Whereas the allocation to the States was $6m a year up to 1950, it is now to be $250m a year. I feel that since the Premiers Conference was held on 13th March last the State Premiers should accept the fact that this Government is endeavouring to do something about their State problems and about national problems. As the Treasurer has said on many occasions the Government stands for a fully employed economy and as the national government it must ensure that resources are allocated in a reasonable manner so that the economy and the work force is fully employed. Any honourable member on this side of the House, or indeed on the other side of the House, when looking at the unemploymentfiguresannounced this morning, which show a level of unemployment of less than 1%, must realise that whatever has been happening within the Labor Party this Government has been receiving first class Treasury guidance. The work of this Government since 1949 is on record and I can only use two words to describe it-pa r excellence. This is despite around the Premiers Conference which was held in 1964 and more particularly the one held this year. At the conclusion of the Premiers Conference held this year, when the Premier of Victoria went back to his State, the following headline appeared in an evening newspaper: ' Sir Henry Bolte says motor vehicle registration will not be increased to motorists over the next 5 years'. I find it difficult to understand this sort of exercise by a responsible government. It may make nice headlines and it probably makes good reading. I would find it difficult to support the Federal Treasurer if he made a statement that there would be no rise in social services or that they would rise by 25% or some other figure that he may pick out of the hat. This is the way I see the type of headline that was given to Sir Henry Bolte's statement that motor registrations would not be increased in Victoria in the next 5 years. I am a great believer in those who collect 500 miles away. the money taking the responsibility for spending it. I am a federalist to the bootstraps, if that is a good word. The State are very annoyed about the amount of governments should rake the responsibility taxation that we are paying as Commonfor collecting the money that is spent in the wealth citizens. In fact, in a question I States unless it is spent on such things as asked the Treasurer last week I pointed aviation, post offices and so on. Successive out that the rate of income tax in terms Federal Treasurers have taken the responsiof gross national product had increased bility for collecting money and endeavourfrom 30% in 1960 to 35% today. I do not ing to make an equitable allocation to the take this figure out of thin air. I use as my States for the various requirements of the backdrop for this information the Institute States. We cannot accept the demands by of Public Affairs. I say that economically the Stale Premiers. We cannot accept the we are in an explosive situation, and the demands mentioned by the honourable clerks, bus drivers, accountants, engineers member for Watson for local government and so on in my electorate feel exactly authorities. The local government authorities the same as I do about paying these have made a good case for meeting the tremendously high rates of taxation. As Commonwealth Government and for getting soon as they get an increase in salary or the Commonwealth Government to do wages they move into a new tax bracket something about their requirements by makand find that the increase is of very little ing more money available to be spent by use to them. It is all very well for the Comlocal government bodies and shire councils. monwealth Government to say that it rests However, it should be said that there are on the theory that increases in salaries at least 700 local government authorities and wages are the responsibility of the throughout Australia. In their report they Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitrahave mentioned the construction of aerotion Commission. We as a Government say dromes and wharves and the provision of to the Tariff Board: 'This is Government fire relief, drought relief and the like. Looking at some of the 700 local governto the Parliament. We should use the same ment authorities, 1 find that very few of sort of emphasis with the Commonwealth them have to look after an aerodrome.

Here again the Comgiven to these matters instead of my havmonwealth would assess the position on a countants national basis and would endeavour to help more money to local, State and Federal the local government authority concerned. authorities in the form of tax'.

I hope that 15571/«9-»¥16} councillors in the south, east and west wards trying to get back into the council at an election by promising that a library will be built in their ward. The same applies with swimming pools. This is the day of affluence and these things can be obtained by municipalities, but I am rapidly coming to the view that if councillors have to promise ratepayers libraries and swimming pools they will have to take the money from the ratepayers and not expect clerks in my electorate to pay for them when they are I have many clerks in my electorate who policy', and we thereby give it the means by which it should be able to present reports ing to say to my bus drivers, clerks, acand engineers: 'Thou shalt pay Taxation is a burden on all of us. We Treasury ofncials read this speech because we must not increase taxation in the future. Attempts must be made to reduce this burden on ordinary men and women. People earn money so that tbey can spend it themselves. They do not earn money to give it to governments so that governments can make roads, but they will accept that a certain proportion of it can be spent by governments. I say that 35% is far too high. It was not my intention to talk about taxation, but this Bill provides for a Commonwealth aid roads grant. It will be seen when looking through the legislation, and certainly when looking through the Treasurer's second reading speech, that in the past the legislation has provided that 40% of the grant be for country roads. It was realised that this amount was too high. In other words, a sufficiently high amount was not being allocated to the city and metropolitan areas where the bulk of the people live, where the bulk of the taxpayers live and where the bulk of the people who use roads live. Under this legislation there will be a tenreport is well worth reading. The infordency in the next quinquenniumI hope the tendency will grow in future quinquenniums-to make sure that most money is spent in areas where the bulk of the taxpayers live. The people who use the roads are being taxed more and more heavily. As I said earlier, if we take the money from the people it is our responsibility to make sure that they can use their motor cars in a satisfactory way and that they can use them with comfort and safety. The honourable member for Newcastle talked about accident rates. I do not have any figures on this but I do have impressions. It is my impression that the roads which have been built for current needs in Australia are really good roads. I have travelled in many countries throughout the world. But one factor overlooked by the honourable member for Newcastle is the human factor. Unless something is done about the human factor we will continue to have slaughter on the roads. Thirteen people died as a result of motor car accidents in Victoria over the weekend. It is the responsibility of governments, particularly State governments, to do a good deal more than is being done right now. State governments must concentrate on safety factors and try to establish why these accidents are taking place. More than 50% of accidents take place on good roads in country areas. It is practically impossible for State governments to do much about this situation because it is hard to correlate the results of accidents with the causes of accidents. But the State governments have a responsibility. Dr Birrell in Victoria has a lot of information on this matter of safety that could usefully be used by the State governments. As I said, more money will be spent on metropolitan roads in the next 5 years. It is very essential that this move should have been made. I congratulate the Government for making it. In the short time available to me I would also like to mention that the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads bas done a tenacious job over the past 3 or 4 years. I am told by the Press, certainly not by the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Sinclair), that the Bureau has spent $2m in that period. I cannot possibly assess from the report of the Bureau how that $2m has been spent, because we have not been able to get this information. But the mation contained in it is well documented. It refers to areas in which money should be spent in the future. It mentions toll roads and research. These things are important from the point of view of this Commonwealth Parliament when we stand up here and assist the Treasurer to pass an appropriation of $l,252m for use by the States. These amounts are getting so high that if the trend continues the time must come when our Public Accounts Committee must go into the States to see how this money is spent. After all, that Committee works on behalf of this Government; it is an arm of, or an aid to, government. It is not appropriate at this stage to refer to the amount spent per mile on roads in the various States, but I know that the variations from State lo State are fantastic. In other words, in some States the money is spent more efficiently than in others. In some States administrative costs in road construction are considerably higher than in other States. If we continue to spend these large sums of money on roads-thes e amounts are the largest public works expenditures in the States-w e will have to do something about sending the Public Accounts Committee into the States to investigate on behalf of the people whom we tax for the money. I know that such a proposal would cause an uproar, but I would repeat the point I made earlier: Those governments which collect the money have some responsibility for spending it. In other words, I am a tremendous believer in federalism. If the States continue to insist that the Commonwealth take over these responsibilities they must pay the penalty of ensuring that the Commonwealth reports back to its taxpayers. amendment moved by the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones), which is in these terms: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in r' ce thereof: It is a sad fact that our inefficient ports are 'This House, while not opposing the Bill, regrets administered by 26 different authorities.

Although Australia ranks third after the United States and New Zealand",42,Sales Tax Collected In Australia On
85,Mr Webb (Stirling) [5.51],"I support thethe United States have a greater density of motor vehicles than Australia but they have a lower fatal accident rate. The state of our roads must have some bearing on our fatality rate. All of the money collected in fuel tax should be earmarked for roads. The original Commonweatlh Aid Roads Act was passed in 1926 and from time to time the Act has been amended. From 1926 to 1968 the Commonwealth collected by way of petrol tax and automotive diesel fuel tax more than $2,600m. Over the same period less than $ 1,728m was allocated to the States. The Commonwealth has retained in Consolidated Revenue over that period $903,401,000. If the amount placed in consolidated revenue had been used for roads we would not be in the fix we are in today. All fuel taxes should be earmarked for roads and associated facilities. The governments of Japan, Sweden, New Zealand and the United States spend all of their fuel taxes on their road systems. The United States Government passed the Federal Highways Act in 1956, which created a Federal Highway Trust Fund into which were deposited receipts from fuel taxes, including petrol taxes levied on highway users. It is estimated that since the Second World War only about one-third of the capital spent on roads in the United States has come from taxation. The remaining two thirds has been borrowed. The result is that America has the best roads in the world. As the honourable member for Newhour by congestion petrol consumption incastle has pointed out, customs and excise creases by about 50%.

Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. sitting was suspended, I was dealing with the amounts retained in Consolidated Revenue, from the automotive fuel tax, above the amount expended on roads since 1926. The amount that had actually been placed in Consolidated Revenue was over £900m. In our view this amount at least should be expended on roads and on associated facilities. I was dealing also with the other Commonwealth taxes on motor car users. I drew attention to the fact that during the past 10 years the sales tax on new cars had varied from 30% to 25%. The amount collected by this tax in 196768 was $140m. Then, there is the duty on imports of motor vehicles and parts and the sales tax on commercial vehicles, motor cycles and parts. All of these are additional charges on the road user. Australian has one motor vehicle for every 2.6 persons. Road construction and maintenance have to do more than keep pace with the increase in the use of motor vehicles. They have to pick up the backlog. Congestion of traffic reduces speed and increases petrol consumption. A United Kingdom survey estimated that when the speed of traffic is reduced to 10 miles an I suggested earlier in the debate that the the attitude of the Minister for Shipping viding funds for the sealing of the Eyre",47,Sales Tax Collected In Australia On
86,Mr Webb,"Mr Speaker, when thecarry on with the Highway out of the grants that had been provided already. The total length of the unsealed section of the Eyre Highway is 361 miles. Of this, 50 miles lies in Western Australia and 311 miles in South Australia. A request had been made earlier by the South Australian Government for $6m over a 6-year period for the sealing of that section of the highway within the South Australian border. The South Australian request was supported by Western Australia and by the Australian Tourist Ministers Conference. Anyone who says this is the responsibility of South Australia takes a very narrow view. Cars from all States use this Highway and I suppose that only a very small proportion of them would come from South Australia. The refusal by the Commonwealth means that the section in Western Australia will be completed by September 1969 but that the South Australian section will be sealed only as far as Penong by 1973. Goodness knows when the rest of it will be finished. The Commonwealth recognised the importance of the Eyre Highway during the war years when it financed the construction and also it had contributed to its maintenance since 1947. But it will not bear any of the nnancial burden of sealing it. It leaves that to the States. This road is an important one for tourist traffic and for defence purposes. It is unfortunate that due to the narrow outlook of this Government the only section of the 1,702 miles of this Highway stretching from Adelaide to Perth to remain unsealed will be the 311-mile stretch that lies within the border of South Australia. The Treasurer said in his second reading speech: Provision is made in the Bill to require each State Government to increase its expenditure on roads from its own resources at the rate at which motor vehicles on register in the State increase. Premier Brand of Western Australia, through his own fault, has been placed in the position of having to call a special 1-day session of State Parliament in order to comply with that requirement. Western Australia is the only State where local authorities in country areas have the power to control their own traffic licence fees. Some time ago, an inter-departmental committeeI am speaking about Western Australia now-recommende d that the Police Department be given State-wide control in this matter. This recommendation was not accepted by the State Government. It was another instance of the Country Party tail wagging the Liberal Party dog. The provision laid down in this Act has forced the Western Australian Government to act on this matter. The Premier of the State from which I come did not put as solid a case as he could have done in support of Western Australia receiving a better deal at the recent meeting held between the State Premiers and the Prime Minister on road grants. The Premier of Western Australia should have joined with the Premiers of Tasmania and South Australia in their strong protests at the amount allocated and at the way in which it was allocated. Compared with the existing formula, the Western Australian share of the total $ 1,252m for the national roads allocation will drop from 18% of the total to about 16% of the total. If it had not been for the $40.8ro supplementary grant, Western Australia would have been in an impossible position in regard to its roads, that is, if the report of the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads had been carried out to the full. The total amount to be received for roads in Western Australia during the next 5 years will be $200.4m. This is about a 50% increase on that granted in the past 5 years. But it is pretty poor when compared with the increase of 82% to New South Wales and over 73% to Victoria. The old formula that has been abandoned was based on population, vehicle registrations and area. The area content, for all practical purposes, has gone by the board and mis is where Western Australia has gone back and will go back further in the future under this new formula unless some supplementary grants are continued as they have been continued as a matter of fact in this Bill. Referring to supplementary grants, the Treasurer pointed out that to adopt the report of the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads would have been 'too abrupt and too drastic'. He pointed out that Western Australia would have received only SI60m which was less than 20% more than it received in the current 5-year agreement. Tbis is the 5-year period that is just finishments. I do not think that these facts have ing. South Australia would have received been given sufficient consideration in the about 40% more. The Treasurer said: The Commonwealth proposes, as a transitional for the next 5 years. arrangement, to provide supplementary grants to these States, which would be phased out. This clearly indicates that it is the intenfrom a railway.

The same argument This meant an extension of the road applies also to Queensland, which has a system. About 800 miles of railway have huge overseas trading surplus. been closed in recent years and traffic has been directed to roads serving agricultural, forest and pastoral areas. This has placed overseas export of minerals, wheat, wool a burden on the road system.

Australia now buys almost $400m worth not buy so much from the eastern States. It is clear that if it were not for the 1967-68 Queensland and Western Australia earned a total overseas trading surplus of over $4,470m. In the same period New South Wales and Victoria had a total overseas trading deficit of over $5,744m. These export surpluses are swallowed up by the deficits in export trading in New South Wales and Victoria. These two States have a high level of imports for expansion of their industries and the export earning surpluses of Queensland and Western Australia assist in the expansion of industrial growth and employment in New South Wales and Victoria. Again let me emphasise that I am not objecting to the amount of funds for roads allocated to those States: WhatI am saying is that at least the whole of the proceeds from all fuel taxes should be made available for roads. This would enable a greater allocation of the amount kept in Consolidated Revenue to be made available to the developing States and for other purposes associated with roads.

General)I wish to inform the House that two cheques were received today by the Deputy Industrial Registrar in Victoria for $8,100 and $500 respectively. The larger cheque was in payment of fines due by the Tramway and Motor Omnibus Employees Association and the smaller cheque was in payment of a fine due by Mr O'Shea. I have now received information that these two cheques have been cleared. In these circumstances I have given instructions for an application to be made to the Industrial Court to discharge the order against Mr O'Shea for his examination and for production of the union's books. The question of his release will then be a matter for the Court. It is understood that this application will be heard in the Industrial Court by Mr Justice Kerr at 10.30 tomorrow morning.

BILL 1969 Second Reading Debate resumed. are very pleased to hear the news disclosed by the Attorney-General( Mr Bowen), but I suppose I cannot comment any further. We have another very important matter to discuss. Naturally I should like to have said a few words about the matter referred to by the Attorney-General just as would members of the Opposition, but I must keep myself to the subject matter of the Bill. The Commonwealth Bureau of Roads has recommended that the Commonwealth Government should continue to provide finance which, with amounts provided by the States and by local government, will enable the implementation of the Commonwealth road programme up to 1974. The programme will yield an economic rate of return. In other words, costs and benefits were compared. The costs considered were for construction, reconstruction, property acquisition and maintenance. The benefits (considered were the community benefits arising from reduced time of travel, vehicle operating costs and reduced numbers of accidents. Savings in private time were included as well as savings in commercial time.",48,Sales Tax Collected In Australia On

96,Mr Lee (Lalor) [8.19],"I am sure weI think it is right to say that it is very encouraging to see this trend in the spending of taxpayers' money. No longer are we considering roads in a piecemeal fashion with little regard to traffic density. At last we are saying to ourselves: 'Where will the community get the most benefit? Where will we receive the most value by way of return for each dollar expended?' This approach to expenditure on road problems is a great step forward, and the Government has accepted this recommendation with the proviso that there will be some modification to prevent a reduction of spending in the more outlying areas. [Quorum formed.] It is encouraging to see Labor members entering the chamber to hear my speech. I am glad that an honourable member opposite was good enough to draw attention to the state of the House. The particular problems of these regions where distances are very great and traffic density is light will be overcome by supplementary grants to relieve the problems. I should like to pay a tribute to the municipal engineers and their staff in country areas, particularly in the more scattered parts of Australia. In recent years they have performed a remarkable job on rural roads throughout Australia. These men take great pride in their work, and the considerable improvements in country roads have been the fruits of their labour. In order to assess weather. No longer can we tolerate insuffithe adequacy of the Australian road system it was necessary to carry out a large survey in 1967 and 1968. This survey threw a lot of pressure on the staffs employed by local councils. City and shire engineers had to go into this matter in great detail. The result was a very full survey on roads built and maintained with public funds, that is, with Commonwealth money, State money and nioney obtained from rates. This survey entailed a great deal of work for city and shire engineers and their staffs in country districts. This major effort was needed to provide the basic information for the comprehensive report which has been made available through the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads. The survey has disclosed that the vast sum of $7,852m based on 1967 prices will be needed for road construction between July this year and June 1974. The Bureau has recommended that the Commonwealth aid roads grant be $l,280m over this period, commencing with Si96m in 1969-70, and rising to $316m in 197374. So honourable members can see that there will be a great deal more work on city and country roads in the next few years. Indeed, I think it will be quite difficult to gear the programmes in order to spend this money. The Bureau of Roads has made some effort to define the different types of roads which make up the road network throughout Australia. There are: (a) the principal rural roads, mainly, 1 think, main highways and arterial roads running into cities and through country towns-the general highway system; (b) other rural roads-mai n roads of lesser importance; (c) city and provincial city roads, comprising city freeways and major access roads to the suburbs and beyond; and (d) other roads not covered by these former groups. The Bureau has recommended that the Commonwealth aid roads grant be divided among the above categories, the first to receive 20%, the second 20%, the third 40% and the fourth 18.8%. The remaining 1.2% of the money is to be used for planning and research, which is a very important matter. No longer can we afford to have bridges built in wrong places or to use materials which do not stand up to the wear and tear of traffic and to the cient vision in our road making. No longer can we put down a road in the wrong place and have to tear it up again within a few years. We face a period now in our highways development which was faced last century in the building of our railways. We must build freeways. We must also build dual highway systems. We cannot fiddle with the job any longer. We must build roads particularly in areas in which the investment of money will return adequate value to business houses and to the private individual as he travels, whether it be in the city or in the country. In a developing country time has become a very important commodity. We can no longer afford to have traffic jammed at intersections. We cannot afford to have roads which are narrow and contribute to accident rates. We must try to foresee the problems of tomorrow. Research is a very important facet in the road building programme. The Bureau has acknowledged that the new types of road systems will matters. I am sure that the benefits of the be more difficult to plan, design and conresearch carried out by this organisation struct than traditional roads. Over the years the Victorian Country other States are reaping some of tbe benefits Roads Board has done a good deal of of what has been done in Victoria as, of research which has shown up in the course, Victoria is taking advantage of quality of the highways and bridges within what is happening in other States such as the State of Victoria.

I am sure that a good deal of the traffic will come to the freeway near Glenroy and will move in quickly to the city that way. I think it is unfortunate that some of the roads may be in some difficulty in that area in coping with the traffic that will want to get on and off the freeway. I am glad to see the Government taking an interest in roads, if only because of the road accident problem. Some 3,249 personsa tragic number-were killed in motor accidents in Australia in 1967-68. This is a tremendous number of people to be killed on the roads in one year. Jt is an average of almost nine people per day. We can no longer afford this high accident rate. A large number of those involved are young people. The loss of human life Is the main problem; the next is the harm done to the bodies and minds of those who continue to live. In a recent copy of the 'Age' dated 9th April it is reported that eighty-one people died on Australian roads over Easter. The article said: Australia's Easter weekend road toll stood at 81 dead last night, 24 more than last year. Of course, apart from the deaths and the great injuries that are caused by road accidents there are other heavy costs. Some are borne by the individual and others by the community. I have been very interested in some details which appeared in the March newsletter of the Australian Automobile Association. Apart from the human problem concerning deaths and injuries, the Association considers that a sum approaching $225m per annum in potential income is forgone by those who die on the roads. It has been further estimated, if allowance is made for the cost of injuries and damage to vehicles, that the cost could have been between $550m and $775m during the year 1966-67. That, of course, takes into account what many young people could have done during their lifetime. Australia. This was stated by the Australian Automobile Association in a recent letter. There are now about 4 i million vehicles on Australian roads. Registrations are approaching 500,000 a year and many families have two cars. What of the future? Vehicles are becoming faster and easier to drive. Surely we are concerned about these trends. I think one day we will have to take this matter up very seriously with motor vehicle manufacturers. Mr J. R. Fraser-You are not exactly being alerted now. more concerned with them. Does the honourable member not think that this is a serious matter? Mr 3. R. FraserI think you are treating it very seriously. about these trends. Do we remain unconcerned until we come face to face with the problem of accidents within our own family and within our own circle of friends? What about other costs-the damage to public property; the necessity to provide more and more police patrols; the time involved for the legal profession, witnesses and policemen to attend courts; and the large number of hospital beds and hospital staff required to handle the victims of road accidents? There are very many side effects to road accidents. I believe that the public will have to accept more restrictions on the way it drives. If this problem is to be solved I believe the public will have to accept some restriction on its freedom to drive speedy cars and to drink while driving. But one thing is sure to me: The provision of divided highways will be a great step forward in the fight against head-on collisions. One of the most heart rending types of accidents on our roads are head-on collisions. I know of a case where a family travelling to Melbourne was involved in a collision. This happened a few years ago. Every child in the family was killed and the mother and",51,Commonwealth Aid Roads

The parents were left crippled, one of them for life. The Australian Medical Association has had something to say about this matter. I do not have a copy of the Association's report but I think it wo;:-d be well worth the study of the department concerned. I have here a publication produced by the Australian Automobile Association, and 1 would like to read from it an open letter which was sent recently to the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) by the President of the Association, Sir Norman Nock. The letter reads: This Association, of which I have the honour to be President, represents through its constituent them do. I know it is a great problem to organisations some two million Australian private motorists. For many years we have been concerned ut the steady deterioration of the Australian road system in relation to the demands made upon it. For years we have felt that responsibility for leadership in solving road problems lies primarily with the Commonwealth Government. In fact there have been encouraging indications that your Government is accepting this responsibility; the establishment of the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads was an important forward step. Now, with the Commonwealtb Aid Roads Act about to expire, your Government has an opportunity to confirm this by adopting the principle of providing road finance on a basis of need. Tbis and other constructive points are mentioned briefly in this booklet. We offer them on behalf of the great body of Australian motorists as a contribution to your discussions with your colleagues. Yours sincerely, Sir Norman Nock say? Minister's reply but I am sure that this legislation is an answer to this suggestion and I would think that the Government has gone a very long way towards meeting this request. In this document this organisation states: Now is the time for a completely fresh approach to Australia's road problems. It goes on to say that Australia must have a national road policy and this is what the Government is leading up to. I believe that this legislation will give a lead to the States. It will be a great encouragement to the States. This legislation will inject more money into this field so that within the next few years we will have a very competent road system. According to this publication, Australia now has a death rate of 8.1 persons for every 10,000 vehicles registered. This compares unfavourably with other great motoring countries such as the United States, New Zealand, thc United Kingdom and Canada. This is a very great problem for all parents in Australia today and must be faced with determination by Governments, educational institutions and the public. I know very many parents in our big cities have to stay up very late indeed until their young people arrive home. I consider it a great responsibility on the parents to see that their children are not tearing around in old bombs, as very many of discourage young people from driving. 1 do not think we should attempt to stop them altogether but they certainly need a lot of guidance in their late teenage years anc' in their early twenties. The step of providing more funds for roads is but one step in the right direction. I congratulate the for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Sinclair) for putting forward this measure. They have gone a long way towards implementing the programme as envisaged by the Bureau which has recommended greatly increased grants for the improvement of the Australian roads system. The Opposition welcomes the increased vote for the building and maintenance of roads, but I join with the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) in supporting his amendment calling for the entire proceeds of fuel tax to be devoted to the construction and reconstruction of Australian roads. No one can say that the situation today is satisfactory. I have yet to hear one speaker on the Government side declare that he is satisfied with the road systems of Australia. It has been said by a number of speakers that better roads would help to overcome the serious problem of road accidents and the resultant appalling toll of death and destruction, the wastage of human life and the long periods which people suffer in hospital waiting to be restored to health to again join the work force of our country. The importance of good roads is accepted",54,Commonwealth Aid Roads

104,Mr Luchetti (Macquarie) [8.45],"by all. Good roads are important to the economy for several reasons; for social considerations-the need for people in the country to travel to adjoining towns and villages, the educational needs of children attending country schools, in particular and for road safety. There should not be a conflict in regard to funds or how they should be distributed. There should be adequate funds for this important matter. Bad roads have caused the dislocation of trade, the wastage of motor vehicles, increased fuel demands which cost the people and this nation dearly and, as I have already said, the tragic toll of death and destruction on the road. These are matters we have to consider free from the disputation ef party considerations. The national consideration should come first in a matter of this kind. Australia's transport problem is a great and grave one. We have a great island continent of 3 million square miles. This matter was referred to by the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Webb) when he was dealing with the problem of his own State of Western Australia. In New South Wales we have the case of the strangled city of Sydney. We also have the isolated handicapped rural areas where bad roads have cost this country dearly and have cost the economy of New South Wales at least $200m a year. This problem is something that ought to be dealt with immediately. There should be no reservation in finding the funds necessary for work of this kind for we must admit that good roads can help streamline the economy and overcome the problems of delay, waste and the usage ef tyres and motor fuels. It is time the Government got its priorities straight. In my opinion transportation looms largely as one of the important questions facing this nation. We need people, we need water and we urgently need an improved transport system. How are we to get the latter? It can only come from increased votes by the Commonwealth for the purpose of developing our roads and for the construction of bridges to overcome the difliculties that face our people throughout the whole continent. If there is one area in Australia that is perhaps suffering more as a result of this Letter' of the Australian Automobile Assothan other areas it is the countryside where ciation contains some illuminating informathe people are handicapped to a degree tion. It shows that, for the 12 months ended unheard of by many people in the metropolitan areas. The rising cost of road construction is becoming a crippling financial burden for our shire councils. These bodies find that they have taxed their ratepayers to the limit. They are unable to meet the spiralling costs of road construction and road maintenance. For this reason, therefore, the Commonwealth should give consideration to this urgent and imperative need. We have noted with dismay and great dissatisfaction that, rather than increase the vote for the countryside, this Government which professes to be concerned with the country has reduced the vote for rural roads from the 40% that it was under the old formula to some 32% by its calculations or 29% according to the Shires Association of New South Wales. I intend to deal with that aspect later. For the moment I want to refer to the buoyancy of the revenue received by the Commonwealth and show that it has the capacity to make payments for the purposes I have mentioned. Let us look at the amounts collected by the Commonwealth from customs and excise on motor and diesel fuel from 1958-59 to 1968-69. The Commonwealth collected from this tax no less than 51,930m and gave to the States $1,33 lm, retaining for itself $598m. Surely this shows the buoyancy of revenue and proves that the Commonwealth has the funds and the opportunity to assist the States to meet the problems that face them in a manner that would be of benefit to all sections of the nation. Another source of Commonwealth revenue is sales tax on motor vehicles. From 1958-59 to 1967-68 the Commonwealth received $1,103,234,000 from sales tax levied on motor vehicles. Surely this shows that the Commonwealth has received the funds and that it has the money with which to do the job. We on this side of the House claim that the money should be made available for the purpose for which it is collected and that is to improve the road systems throughout Australia. No-one will deny the need for improved roads. This being so, it is imperative that the funds be provided. The March issue of the 'Federal News 30th June 1968, net customs and excise duties collected on motor spirit amounted to S233,962,000 and net customs and excise duties collected on automotive diesel fuel amounted to $18,256,000 making a total of $252,218,000. Payments to the States under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act amounted to $160m and other CommonweaUh payments to the States for roads amounted to $5,664,000, making a total of $165,664,000. The Commonwealth retained in Consolidated Revenue $86,554,000. We have established the need for better roads and we have established that the Commonwealth has collected the revenue. AU that is necessary now is for the Commonwealth of Australia to show its goodwill by making available the funds that are needed for the construction and reconstruction of country roads. I know that this subject has been debated on many occasions and that it will be said that past governments have not made available the proceeds of the petrol tax for road construction and reconstruction. With that I agree. When these levies were first introduced, it was agreed that the petrol tax, as it was called, would be made available for the construction of roads and the improvement of transport services. It has been noted previously that one of the States had set about to impose such a levy itself. This was said to be unconstitutional and the Commonwealth came in. At that time not only did the Commonwealth provide the entire proceeds of fhe tax for road construction but it made additional grants as well. Over the years from 1926 to 1968, net customs and excise duties collected on petrol and automotive diesel fuel have amounted to $2,631,135,000. Allocations under the various Commonwealth Aid Road Acts to the States have amounted to $1,669,756,000 and for strategic roads and road safety $l8m, and other Commonwealth payments to the States for roads since 1959 have amounted to $39,978,000. These allocations total $1,727,734,000. The amount retained by the Commonwealth in Consolidated Revenue over this period is $903,401,000. Surely this rum of money should have found its way into improved road services. I leave this thought with some of my city friends: They ought to realise, if they do not now, that the wealth of this nation comes from the grass roots of our economic life, from the countryside, from the mines, from the farms and from thc country towns. The wealth won in the country areas permeates and stimulates the economy and helps to make it tick and to provide the type of development that we so earnestly talk about. As this will be accepted by honourable members as they travel AustraUa during the next election campaign, they should admit now that funds should be made available to help the people in the country areas to overcome the hazards that always confront them when they travel on bad and unsealed roads. In the region whence I come, the central tablelands and the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, the shire councils have a particularly difficult task in trying to find funds to complete work on the roads and to seal roads. This is urgently needed in the mountainous area that I have the privilege and honour to represent. But not only should the Commonwealth do more; the States also have a responsibility to do more. 1 have here a list of the motor registration fees and taxes in the States and Territories. In the Australian Capital Territory the tax on a Holden is $17.50 a year, on a Chrysler Valiant $18.90 and on a Ford Falcon $18.20. In the Northern Territory it is $14.0 on a Holden, $15.12 on a Chrysler Valiant and $14.56 on a Ford Falcon. In New South Wales it is $22.50 on a Holden, on a Chrysler Valiant it is $24.30 and on a Ford Falcon it is $23.40, with an additional motor registration fee of $3 and stamp duty of 40c per $100 value in each instance. In Victoria the rate is $31.38 for a Holden, $32.82 for a Chrysler Valiant and $35.10 for a Ford Falcon. In Queensland it is $34 for a Holden, $35.55 for a Chrysler Valiant and $38.02 for a Ford Falcon. A stamp duty of $1 for each $100 of value is also levied. In South Australia it is $36 for a Holden, $36 for a Chrysler Valiant and $40 for a Ford Falcon. A stamp duty of $1 is payable for every $100 of value. In Western Australia it is $29 for a Holden, $31 for a Chrysler Valiant and $30 for a Ford Falcon. In Tasmania it is $27.20 for a Holden, $28.44 for a Chrysler Valiant and $30.42 for a Ford Falcon, fn addition to motor taxes in Tasmania, a registration fee of $3 is payable, a, stamp duty of 50c for every $100 of This is a disgraceful state of affairs. It is a value, $1 for number plates and 10c for a shocking and disturbing revelation of the registration label. These charges indicate that the States are gone unheeded by the Commonwealth Gogetting their share of a rich reward from a vernment. Surely thesefiguresmake the Goburden borne by motorists throughout vernment realise the urgent need to get on Australia. It may be said that the people in with providing the funds which are so the country areas of Australia can afford necessary for the sealing of our country these charges. RecentlyI made some roads. Surely the people in country areas research into the earnings of people in the are just as entitled to sealed roads as are country who pay taxes, particularly those people in any other part of Australia.

Nevertheless it is very was devoted to these roads previously. much better than the amount recommended Some people are confused because the addiby the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads tional $40,130,000 was not allotted under and it is very much better than the this legislation; it was money which New original proposal by the Commonwealth.

Surely it would be a simple thing always have reasonable access to some to change the State legislation and provide means of public transport, whereas people more State money for class 1, class 2 and who live in the country are confined to class 3 roads so that those roads may be their own means of locomotion. The shire maintained at the same rate as roads in councils in New South Wales are classes 4 and 5 are maintained. The classification of roads is something that has caused a good deal of confusion in the minds of people in many States. [QuorumI was saying that the classification of spend on rural roads. Under this legisla-",55,Commonwealth Aid Roads
105,Mr Armstrong (Riverina) [9.15],"I was disturbed to hear the Treasurer speech that the transfer of funds earmarked for one class of road to another class of road would be allowed only in exceptional circumstances. I hope that this proviso will be applied with reasonable leniency. If New South Wales does not have power to divert funds from one class of road tn another it could mean that there will be a shortage of funds for roads in classes 1, 2 and 3. This would be a very serious matter in rural areas. The Bill also empowers the Minister to extend the time for expenditure of an annual allocation to 18 months or. in certain circumstances, longer. These are necessary points of flexibility in the legislation. Formerly the legislation was far too rigid. I agree with the honourable member fer Canning( Mr Hallett) that the States should express more clearly than they do now the areas in which they intend to expend money on roads. Several speakers tonight have said that the time is overdue for research into all forms of transport. They have urged greater co-ordination of transport. I fully support these submissions. Of the money spent on roads in the last 5-year period one-third came from money provided under this legislation, more than one-third from ratepayers and slightly less than one-third from State funds. This proportion will be altered in the next 5-year period. It is well that this should be so because rates in rural areas almost everywhere in Australia have reached saturation point. There can be no question but that people living in rural areas cannot meet any increase in the burden of costs without suffering serious financial embarrassment. It is only wise from the point of view of justice that the allotment of funds to roads should be balanced proportionately between cities and rural areas, with added provision for rural roads; it is purely a basic economic problem. Reference was made to this matter in a letter published in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' on 20th March this year. The letter was written by Professor D. F. Orchard, Professor of Highway Engineering in the University of New South Wales. 1 do not think I can do better than read the letter. Professor Orchard wrote: The mere building of expressways in our capital cities, while it might give temporary respite from traffic congestion, can only ultimately intensify the problem unless it is backed up by measures to prevent concentration of activity and therefore traffic. Such measures are decentralisation, the proper disposition of land use and control of the intensity of development. In this connection it is distressing to see the headlong rush going on in the centre of Sydney at the moment to build more and more tall buildings and therefore large traffic generators. If this continues it will, even given elaborate expressways, result in incurable traffic congestion. It is encouraging to see from your March 12 edition that the folly of this does appear to be recognised, but it is uncertain whether the imposition of a floor space index or ratio as high as six as mentioned will be really adequate. May I emphasise once more that decentralisation, the need for which is so pressing, in order to improve urban traffic conditions, and in particular reduce the growth of Sydney, cannot be achieved unless adequate attention is paid to country roads. It is gratifying that Mr Askin (March 15) has promised that the State Government will supplement the Commonwealth funds available for country roads in New South Wales. Several Opposition supporters have said that in their opinion all funds collected by the Commonwealth from the excise on fuel should be devoted to roads. They have claimed that in the period between 1926 and 1968 the Commonwealth collected in excise on fuel $900m more than it allocated to the States for expenditure on roads. In the complexity of taxation what honourable members opposite advocate is hardly practical. It was said by no less a person than a former Labor Prime Minister, the Honourable J. B. Chifley, that this proposition had no more logic than the proposition that the excise from liquor should be applied to the construction of hotels. There is no doubt that in a country developing as fast as Australia is developing a great many projects will have a high priority. I think of education, health, social services, water conservation and transport, all of which must be bracketed together from the point of view of priority. Defence and security of course are overriding priorities. Without them, we cannot have the other things that I have mentioned. It is difficult to say which of the fields that I have mentioned deserve greatest priority. There are others, too. I do not accept the proposition that has been put forward by the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones). He, as have other speakers in this debate, mentioned something that concerns every thinking Australian. That is the road toll. I cannot accept the proposition that we should be building roads to accommodate the motor vehicles of today because most",60,Commonwealth Aid Roads
106,( Mr Mcmahon) Say In His Second Reading,"modern motor vehicles can go at speeds reaching 100 miles per hour to 120 miles per hour. To accommodate them, we would need speedways. A great many things agitate our minds when we consider what brings about the disastrous situation in which on the average nearly 10 people, almost 70% of whom are under the age of 27, die every day on Australian roads. We are told that 80,000 people are injured on our roads, some quarter of whom suffer injuries of a permanent nature. This is an alarming situation. The causes of it are fairly hard to define in any particular way. I do not accept the theory that we should build roads to take the vehicles that people drive today. If we did so, in certain circumstances we could add to the seriousness of the situation rather than detract from it. The provisions of this Bill are not all that I personally would have liked. I know that the Bill is not all that a great many shires and rural areas would have liked. It is an increase on the previous requirement that at least 40% of the Commonwealth aid roads grants be spent on construction and maintenance of minor rural roads. The provision is for 5% per year compounding. It is an increase and it should keep up the momentum which has been gained already by local government bodies in their construction of roads. I hope myself that this does not represent just a toe in the door for the next period and that the differential applied to rural roads will continue to be whittled away. It is vital that our highways, our byways and our rural roads are maintained on a basis that will allow people in rural areas to carry their goods and to maintain themselves with reasonable amenities. In his second reading speech, the Treasurer used the term 'minor rural roads'. In part, he said: Although it is not proposed to continue the systems to the States and the municipalities requirement that at least 40% of the Commonwealth aid road grants be spent on construcuon and maintenance of 'minor rural roads'. . . . I suggest with respect that these roads are far from very minor rural roads. Although they are outside the categories of main roads, highways and trunk roads, these roads are very far from being minor roads. Some of these roads connect quite large centres of population. A great many of them link up with main roads. Without these feeder roads, which is a better term to us2 in describing them, it can be said that it is not much good building up main roads, trunk roads and highways to a high standard unless people in rural areas have access to those roads by reasonable feeder roads. The Commonwealth Government and local government bodies can take their share of credit for what has been done regarding our roads system. I think that it is fair to say that people who enter the sphere of local government are very reasonable people who give an awful lot of their time for no reward. Those concerned with local government are probably closer to the people than those concerned with any other form of government. Therefore, those connected with local government are subject to more criticism in a great many cases. They are people who do give a very great service to the community and we should, as a nation, be grateful to this system and to the people who give their time in most cases for little or no reward. I think that this present proposal will go a long way towards overcoming our difficulties. We all knew that the States needed more money. No thinking person argued against that proposal at all. I have said this consistently. But, personally, I would have liked to see a slightly larger proportion of the grant given to rural roads because the impetus that they have gained should be maintained. Deputy Speaker, if ever we were looking for the first glimmer of a national road plan for Australia, we would find it in this legislation. In this place 12 years ago, I urged the creation of a national roads plan. 1 think that I was the first member of this Parliament to make this approach here. I sought a national road plan in which thc Commonwealth would take over tbe financing of the Australian highway system, leaving the secondary and municipal road The plan before us now goes a long way towards putting the responsibility for our highway system where it should be and that is at the feet of the Federal Government. We realise that the States are dependent almost entirely on this Government for their veryfinancialexistence. Their costs are rising at a greater rate than the Commonwealth is able to meet by increased financing. Any further burdens on the States for",61,Commonwealth Aid Roads
107,Mr Duthie (Wilmot) [9.35],"M rexpansive road expenditure are beyond them. So, it is becoming more and more the responsibility of the Commonwealth to provide for roads. What is embodied in this Bill is not a nationalised road service, but it is getting towards that with the Commonwealth financing such a wide expanse of road construction and maintenance as this Bill envisages. The general plan briefly is this: $ 1,252m will be allocated in the next 5 years by the Commonwealth to the States for roads in three categories. The first category is urban roads. This is a revolutionary development as far as this Commonwealth Government is concerned. During the next 5 years $600.69m. or 50.06% of the principal grant, will be spent In this field. The second section relates to national trunk roads. This section will receive $186.76m or 15.56% of the principal grant. The third classification deals with rural roads. This classification will receive $394.55 or 32.88% of the principal grant. In creating the new classification of urban road development under this next 5-year plan, this Government is taking off the shoulders of State governments and city councils what could be described as one of the running sore problems with which they have been dealing for many years. Unfortunately, this move indicates the growth of centralisation rather than decentralisation. We would far sooner see the trend the other way with a vast increase in the grants for rural development through rural roads and not urban roads. But the very fact that the Government now has had to face this grim reality of developing and expanding cities is seen in this legislation. This provision will help city councils enormously in developing proper types of ingress and egress roads from their sprawling cities. I wish to mention at this stage the effect that this new agreement will have on my home State of Tasmania. Under the new formula for the next 5 years, 1969-1974, Tasmania will receive $56.25m which is an increase of $18.75m on the amount it received during the previous 5-year plan. We are grateful for tffls increase. But there are limitations whjch I wish to outline in a moment. I point out that $22m of the $56.25m granted must be spent in urban areas, mainly in Hobart and Launceston. An amount of SlOm will be spent on the principal highways and $19m in rural areas. Included in the amount is $2.5m for administrative costs of the Public Works Department over the 5-year period. Only about $4m of our own revenue raised in motor taxation will be available for this Department. Tasmania's main grant bas been reduced from 5%, which it has been for many years, to 4.5% of the total principal grant. If the 5% had been retained Tasmania would have received $60m for the next 5 years instead of $56m, which would have meant an additional $4m for the country roads in Tasmania. Most observers realise that the Tasmanian road system is rather difficult because of the mountainous nature of the island. Our roads are more costly to construct than roads across the plains of Victoria, the western plains of New South Wales or in Queensland. We probably spend more per capita on country roads than any other State because of the mountainous nature of such a vast area of the island. It may be of interest for the House to know that at present 2,000 miles of our roads are sealed and that at the end of the 5-year plan before us only 300 more miles will have to be sealed. This is a wonderful tribute to the energy of the Tasmanian Public Works Department. Visitors from Queensland recently commented on the splendid road system in Tasmania. We are at present widening the Bass Highway from Launceston to Devonport, a distance of 65 miles, and the main Midlands Highway from Launceston to Hobart, a distance of 123 miles. This work has been proceeding for 5 years and it will take another 5 years to finish but it will give us a wonderful highway system. Our present highways are taking a pounding from semi-trailers of 20 tons weight which are coming over from thc mainland on the 'Princess of Tasmania' and returning again fully loaded. These interstate hauliers are putting tremendous pressure on our road system, but we cannot charge them a cent for the damage they are causing because of section 92 of the Constitution. New South Wales put a toll on these fellows in the early 1950s but one of the big carriers operating between Victoria and New South Wales challenged this charge in the High Court and the Government lost the case. It cost the New South Wales Government $6m in repayments to interstate hauliers of the money taken from them to try to help maintain its highways. Section 92 is watertight and these big fellows know it. It is a pity that the States cannot, in some way, be recompensed for the damage the hauliers do to their highway systems. Our main complaint is that under tbe proposed agreement the rural section will be no better off than it was under the previous agreement. It would seem that the urban development programme has been introduced at the expense of the rural section. My colleague, the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti), emphasised this most effectively. I am not going to cover all the ground that he covered, or the roads that he covered either, but he made beyond question the point that the rural section will roads better for motorists and the cities not be better off under the new agreement. This will apply especially to Tasmania and possibly to Western Australia. In other words the Tasmanian rural section will not benefit in comparison with the other classifications under which it will benefit, namely, tremendous importance of agricultural in respect of the trunk highway system and urban development. The Tasmanian Premier, at the Canberra meeting where all this was decided, applied to have the Tasmanian north west coast road system included in the urban development classification. Queensland made a similar application in respect of the Gold Coast road network and I understand that this application has been granted by the Commonwealth Government. Tn other words the Gold Coast will be included in the urban development in Queensland and will be entitled to share in the expanded allocation for urban development. We want the north west coast sectiona distance of about 30 miles from Devonport through Ulverstone and Penguin to Burnie -wher e the towns are only a few miles apart-as o to be included in the urban classification. This would enable us to spend more on our main highways. However, it still does not solve the problem of the rural system which definitely has been reduced in my opinion and in the opinion of the Tasmanian Premier and Mimster for Lands and Works. These two road systems-the Gold Coast and the north west coast of Tasmania -bot h traverse holiday areas. The Tasmanian area has a Teal agricultural hinterland as well and is in the electorate of the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies). It is similar to Queensland's Gold Coast in geography and population and I believe it should be included in the urban classification. I hope that a decision will be made soon in favour of the Premier's application. We are not going to decry the urban classification. I think it is an excellent idea. It is the Commonwealth's recognition of the importance of urban road development, and for the first time the Commonwealth will be accepting financial responsibility for what has been a serious problem for city councils. We should get some excellent freeways from this scheme and probably many accident spots will be wiped out as money is spent around our cities making easier of access and easier to get out of. Tasmania is disappointed that its country roads will not get a better deal under the 5-year plan. Along with others who have country electorates and who appreciate the industries to the Australian economy I make a plea for country roads. Many of the needs of agriculture-machiner y and so forth-ar e transported by road from the cities. There is a two way traffic and roads are the lifeline of our economy. There is no question that roads are the lifeline of our agricultural and secondary industries. A country that does not have a good internal network of roads cannot expect to defend itself properly in any great conflict. Hitler proved this beyond doubt in Germany. He rushed through the construction of an enormous concrete road system which eventually enabled him to do tremendous things militarily in Germany and for Germany in the early stages of the Second World War. We believe that the internal road link is the lifeline of our transport system as well as of our agriculture. I am not deprecating what the railways do, but we cannot exist with railways alone or with roads alone. They complement each other, but ir many parts of Australia there are no railways at all and such areas are dependent on a good road system. Any money spent on country roads as an investment is far more valuable to Australia than a similar amount spent on urban roads. This is a good point to stress economically while we debate this Bill. The countryman knows that without a road he is impoverished. When any new settlement is opened up, the first thing that is built is a road. Roads are also constructed in forestry areas, in hydro-electric development areas and in isolated areas where dams are being bum. Later these roads become tourist roads. In my own State of Tasmania we are spending approximately $120m on the Mersey Valley hydro-electric scheme. The scheme Is in about its fifth year. It is opening up entirely new virgin country. Six large dams are being built. Two rivers are being diverted into the central river. It is a gigantic scheme. When the dams are completed the roads which are being built by the Hydro-electric Commismission will become State tourist roads. So wherever a road is built it adds to the development of the area, and this helps in the building up of our economy. Roads are the friends of everybody, even though the death rate on them is frightening and appalling; but that is another aspect of the matter. There are 2.8 persons per motor vehicle in Australia, which makes Australia the third most densely motorised country in the world behind the United States and New Zealand. In 1967-68 road passenger miles travelled in Australia totalled 43,825 million over 545,467 miles of roads and highways. In the same year there were 3,249 deaths and 81,148 persons were injured on our roads; many of the injured later died. All of these things point fo the vital necessity for the construction of road and highway systems of the highest possible quality. Forward planning is very important for our country and city councils. The Bill before us, under which the various authorities know how much money they will receive over the next 5 years, is the answer to the haphazard approach which councils have been forced to adopt in financing their road programmes in past years. Under this Bill the authorities will know exactly how much they will receive each year and they can budget accordingly. This is one of the strong points of the Bill with which we are dealing tonight. Forward planning is possible only when it is known how muchfinancewill be available year by year. This is the great advantage of a 5 year programme in oui economy, not only in relation to roads but also in relation to other matters. State governments and municipalities can plan wisely once they know how much finance they are to receive each year from the central authority. I feel sure that country councils throughout Australia welcome that aspect of the legislation. A first class road system is vital to the tourist industry in every State of Australia. Tasmania will need to allocate its share of the new road grant very wisely in order to gain the maximum overall benefit for the tourist industry in our island, which is growing at a rapid rate each year. I should like to mention here that in the widerfieid of roads and road users, the Austrahan Automobile Association has pointed out that investment in roads brings great benefits, greater industrial activity, a more competitive export situation, the saving of congestion which already costs Australia more than $l,000m annually and, of course, saving in accident costs. The5 year plan before us sets in motion a further attempt to improve the road system throughout Australia. It may be of interest to the House to note that according to the Australian Automobile Association next to Victoria Tasmania appears to have the busiest roads in Australia. Records just compiled by the Association indicate that Tasmania has 85 vehicles per mile of classified highways, trunk and main roads. Victoria has 88 vehicles per mile of classified highways, trunk and main roads, New South Wales has 73, South Australia has 61, Queensland has 54 and Western Australia has 36. These are interesting statistics which the Australian Automobile Association has compiled, and tonight I pay a great tribute to this organisation for the massive amount of research it does in the field of roads throughout Australia. All honourable members probably receive a weekly or bi-weekly copy of the organisation's magazine, which contains statistics from other parts of the world. I certainly pay a tribute to the Australian Automobile Association for what it is doing to try to keep this Government abreast of the vital needs for our roads. One thing that came out of the representations of the Association and of honourable members on this side of the House is the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads. We have been fighting for the establishment of some centralised body to take over road planning. When the Bureau of Roads was formed we were, and still are, cynical about it because we believe that it is not the complete answer. It is an advisory body. We believe that there should be a body which has more executive powers than the Bureau has. However, the Bureau has been in existence for a couple of years and it has made the massive report which was before the Government when it brought down this new 5-year road plan. The Bureau did a tremendous job in bringing down this report, which contains a great deal of detail and a number of recommendations. Not all of the recommendations were accepted by the Government, but at least the report has helped the Department of Shipping and Transport to acquire up to date figures and facts which were needed when this legislation was planned. I feel sure that when we become the Government we will give teeth to the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads; we will give it more executive authority. At this stage I want to refer to the collection of petrol tax, or fuel tax as we call it. The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) moved the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill: This House, while not opposing the Bill, regrets the Government's continuing refusal to plan expenditure of an amount at least equivalent to the proceeds of all the automotive fuel taxes on roads and associated facilities. By that amendment we mean that all money which this Government collects in fuel tax should be spent on our road systems. During the last 5-year road plan the Government put into Consolidated Revenue an amount of $397,246,000 from the moneys it collected in fuel taxes. The Government is spending on our roads systems about 85% of the money it collects in fuel taxes, but the other 15% is being put into Consolidated Revenue. If this $400m were spread over 5 years, it would add another $80m a year to the money spent on our road systems. When we become the Government we will change the system and allocate the total amount of money collected in fuel taxes to our road systems. We have said this for a few years now. It is about time that some of the country people in Australia woke up and realised that there is an alternative government which is prepared to make this sort of grant. We are not fooling around with this-thi s is an absolute fact. It is what we will do when we become a government. Finally, I would like to say a word about the tragic accidents that occur in Australia. I do not have before me the figures of those killed since the last world war, but taking an average of about 2,500 deaths a year and multiplying this figure by 24 we arrive at the total of those who have perished on our highways since the war. It is 60,000. This is another war, it is the undeclared war. This is a war in a peacetime setting. We have a war on the roads. Tragic murders are taking place and no-one gets put in gaol for life and no-one is threatened with hanging or anything else when he commits murder on our roads. But this is going on day and night. The House should know that 64% of deaths on the road is due to alcohol one way or the other. We hear excuses all the time for those caught with drink in them after an accident. All the time people are trying to say: 'Oh, it is only 20% or only 30% of road deaths that are due to alcohol'. Dr Birrell has done tremendous research on this in Melbourne. He has come up with the irrefutablefigures-and the beer manufacturers know this is true but they deny it all along the line-that responsibility for 64% of the road deaths in Australia can be levelled at alcohol in one form or another. tests? test is all right. I feel that this is an excellent way to judge whether a man is under the influence. But when a driver who has wiped a family out in a flash-in one moment of time-is afterwards charged with driving under the influence of drink, the charge really should be murder. I do not know why our courts do not start to call it murder and deal with the person responsible as they do with murderers. I have no excuses for anyone",62,Commonwealth Aid Roads

But the people behind liim ought to be blamed too-thos e who serve this person alcohol knowing that I.e is going to walk out of a pub into a motor car and become a potential murderer. Let us stop the hypocrisy of trying to make out that alcohol is a very minor cause of road accidents. It is a major cause. I can quote case after case in the last 6 months in my own State of people who are no longer with us. These people have been the innocent victims of murderers who have walked out of pubs full of drink. Our laws should be tightened up. We are playing with the problem of the driver who is under the influence. We are playing with this problem and we are letting more and more get away with it What happens when persons charged with drunken driving are convicted? They are lined. Very few are ever gaoled or have their cars taken away from them. The laws that operate in Australia today for the drunken motorist who has murdered a person are wishy-washy, sickening and weak. We as a Commonwealth cannot do anything about this; it is not our responsibility. The States make these laws and it is their responsibility and the responsibility of magistrates to see that these murderers on our roads are dealt with as such. The sooner they wake up to this type of person the better. He is getting away with it today. In every State there are different laws for different road accidents. Why cannot we get a bit of uniformity? The same sort of death on a similar road in different States should be dealt with uniformly. But at the moment in one State he might get 6 months if he has been convicted of being drunk behind the wheel of a car and wipes out a family, whereas the penalty in another State might be different. The penalty varies in each State. It is not right that this should be so. People convicted of this offence should receive the maximum penalty that we can have on our books. Their cars should be taken from them, as well as their drivers licences, for 2 years or longer. If we do this drivers might think twice before driving after drinking and so help to reduce the tragic death toll on Australian roads. on the Commonwealth Aid Roads Bill realising that it is an improvement on the pre-existing legislation that provided for an expenditure for the quinquennium 1964-69 of $750m and is in keeping with the progressive thinking of this Government. The Government enlisted the aid of the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads and this instrumentality undertook a thorough survey of the road situation existing in Australia. This comprehensive assessment took into consideration future population trends and other factors essential in determining road requirements in the various States and the Bureau made a recommendation that $ 1,280m was required to supply these needs for the ensuing 5-year period. As the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Armstrong) said, we did not all agree with the assessment for the needs of rural roads. Nevertheless it was a good report and I commend the Bureau on it. The Treasury saw fit to reduce this sum to S1,200m as a principal grant. However, it no doubt realised that although this amount was about 60% more than the grants of the previous 5 years, if this was adhered to there would be justifiable objection from the smaller States of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. Because of this a further amount of $52m, or just a little more, was provided in the form of supplementary grants for those States and I commend the Government for this action which otherwise would have created considerable ill will between the Commonwealth and the States concerned. also believe that the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads' recommendation of $ 1,280m should have been adhered to as there are many ways in which this additional money could be used, particularly in rural areas. I do realise, of course, that the increased allocation for urban roads will enable the States to provide more money for rural roads. I hope that this will prove to be the case. Having studied the increased allocation for the States, I notice that New South Wales has been granted $380.4m compared with $209.lm or 82% more than for the previous 5 years. Victoria has received 72%",66,Commonwealth Aid Roads

I feel it is fair to recognise the tremendous problems which exist, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, where urban development is causing many headaches for the State governments. 1 realise that in the Sydney urban area road planning involves costly bridge works and additional money must be provided to cope with such additional expense. However, when we consider that Western Australia was originally granted a 19% increase, South Australia 39.5% and Tasmania 44% on the previous amount made available for roads, it is no wonder it was decided to find further money to bring these States up to at least 50% more than was received in the previous 5 years. Western Australia, ot course, is a State that is bursting with activity as we all know and it is essential that urgent transport needs should be attended to. The honourable member for Barton realises wealth Government has, of course, provided the potential of South Australia. I feel that an annual grant for the maintenance of this more money should have been allocated to road but 1 believe it has been a case of Western Australia as it is undoubtedly of throwing good money after bad because it great importance to the nation's economy is a hopeless battle to keep it in a good and is contributing in no small way to our state of repair.

It is long this House will be presented with a comprehensive report of these surveys and that the Minister will be in a position to recommend a further allocation of funds to the State Government in order that work might commence on the most important task of forming and sealing this road to the border. With respect to roads expenditure, the States have been required to provide matching finance and the broad objective of the 19S9 roads legislation was to ensure that State allocations increased each year to year as part of its matching contribution in keep pace with the contributions made by the Commonwealth. Under the 1964 Act, a State Government was required to spend an equivalent amount in excess of the amount which it was required to spend in 1963-64 in order to qualify for its share of provided by the old legislation. This has the matching grant in that year. It is interesting to note that every State Governa State may be permitted a longer time to ment has recently been spending more than this required amount. In South Australia, for instance, the amount required to be spent in 1966-67 was almost $ 11.9m. The actual amount spent was $13.16m.

It is estimated that the State Government will spend $13.5m in the current 1968-69 financial! year when it is required to spend only $13.2m.

The Commonwealth has, therefore, in its wisdom, proposed that government will be able to count the excess in such a year of unusually high expenditure in a subsequent that year. That is quite a sensible provision. There could also be some difficulty experienced by the States in spending the Commonwealth funds within the 6 months after the end of a particular year, as was been recognised and as a result of this Bill spend a particular grant provided, of course, that it can be shown that efforts have been made to spend the money. This, I believe, will meet with general approval. There is also a certain amount of licence given concerning the spending of money on certain classes of roads. Here the legislation provides for a State to be allowed limited transfers of funds to enable them to carry out roadwork of a different classification. This naturally would be approved only in exceptional circumstances, but it does road in extenuating circumstances so that the funds can be used to advantage.

126,Mr Collard (Kalgoorlie) [10.22],"Commonwealth generally. Under it the Commonwealth provides money to the States for financing roads during the next 5 years. This year the Government had decided upon a method that is different from that used previously for apportioning the moneys amongst tbe States and 1 will refer to that in more detail later. AsT see it. the Bill will have a detremental effect on roads in country areas and particularly in remote areas. The amount that the Commonwealth Government has seen fit to provide for the next 5 years totals $ 1,252.05m. Of this New South Wales will receive S380.4m or 81.9% more than it received in the last 5 years. Victoria will receive $254m or 73.2% more than it received in the last period. Queensland will receive $23 lm, which is an increase of 69%. South Australia will receive $129m, Western Australia $200.4m and Tasmania $56.25m, which in each case will be an increase of 50% over the last period. These increases may at first glance look rather good and may suggest that the Government has been quite generous in the grants it has made for roads. However, it must not be forgotten that the road users themselves are providing the finance through the fuel tax they pay. When this is examined we find that the Government is not quite as generous as it appeared to be. The difference in the percentage increases for the several States has also meant that the percentage of the total for some States is higher than it is for others. This situation leaves plenty of room for argument. For instance, in this period New South Wales is to receive 30.3% of the total as against 27,8% in the previous period, an increase of 2.5%. Victoria in the last period received 19.5% of the total and in this period will receive 20.3%, an increase of only .8% as against the increase for New South Wales of 2.5%. Queensland will receive 18.5% of the total whereas in the last period it received 16.9%. South Australia in the last period received 11.4% of the total whereas in the coming period it will receive only 10.3%, a reduction of 1.1%. Western Australia over the last 5 years received 17.8% of the total, but during the coming period it will collect only 16%. It will suffer a reduction of 1.8%, which is fairly substantial when it is measured against the total of SI.252m. Tasmania in the last period received 5% and this time will get only 4.5%. While it may be interesting to analyse the reasons for these differences, they are rather alarming for Western Australia. Because of iron ore, salt, nickel and other mineral developments and also developments of an agricultural nature, Western Australia finds itself in a position where demands for both new and improved roads are very much greater than ever before. Most of these demands come from the remote and high cost areas and this makes it necessary to provide additional finance beyond normal needs. Despite this demand, the Commonwealth Jr^-idcd that the State should receive a lesser share of Commonwealth aid for roads than it received in the previous period. Western Australia, with a population of fewer than 900,000 or only about 7£% of Australia's total population, has an area of 1 million square miles or about one-third of Australia. Unfortunately the Government has decided on this occasion to change the formula for the distribution of moneys and area has not been taken into account. This decision has had a very serious effect upon Western Australia's share and has, on the other hand, proved to be of benefit to the more populous States. Population has apparently been accepted as being of far greater importance than development. Yet, if development did not occur, this country would not receive the finance which directly and indirectly flows from development and in turn we would not have an upsurge of population in the smaller States. Western Australia has always faced a tremendous problem in trying to provide sufficient roads of reasonable structure over its huge area and that problem bas been greatly increased by the very rapid development in the mineral fields that I have just mentioned. Honourable members will recall that in 1958 the Labor Government of Western Australia asked the Commonwealth Government to lift the ban on the export of iron ore. The Commonwealth for political reasons, knowing that it would help Labor in Western Australia if it did so, refused. However, in 1960, after a change of government in Western Australia, the Commonwealth Government reversed its decision and lifted the ban. As a result very large iron ore deposits have been opened up in the north of the State and other deposits have been taken up and are ready for development when the time, price and demand are right. I think it will be found that something like 90% of the known iron ore deposits in Australia are located in fhe remote areas of Western Australia. They are located in areas where, prior to I960, there were practically no roads and where, even prior to 1964, the roads that were usable were very rough and of such a nature that only four wheel drive vehicles could travel over them. Not only are 90% of the deposits of iron ore located in Western Australia, but approximately the same percentage of the locations in Western Australia are situated in what is known as the Pilbara, at a distance of 700 to 900 miles from Perth by road and the ports from which the iron ore will be exported are between 800 and 1,100 miles from Perth. The road distance from the deposits to the port of export is from 200 to 2S0 miles. I state those mileages to give honourable members some idea of the cost of providing a reasonable road to those several areas of export. While it can and may well be argued that the companies themselves should provide more towards roads and certain other conditions and amenities, the fact cannot be overlooked that hundreds of miles of roads are required beyond what the companies would use in relation to the developing and carrying out of their business. Also of course the increase in population and extension of housing areas at the port towns has meant that the local authorities are faced with road programmes the cost of which is well in excess of their finances. There has been an increase in traffic over the roads between Perth and the iron ore projects. For instance, about 90 miles north of Carnarvon on the north west coast highway-and that is about TOO miles from Perth-the traffic has more than doubled. On the Great Northern Highway also, which is the highway going inland from Port Hedland, traffic has doubled over the past 2 years. This means that at the junction of those roads the road traffic has increased four times. While much may be said about the increase of traffic in the cities and the more populous States it cannot be claimed that it has increased by anything like the increases to which I have just referred. I think it is fairly elementary that as traffic increases the roads will deteriorate unless you provide them with a bitumen or concrete surface. Of course where you have unsealed roads, many miles of which we have in Western Australia, the greater the traffic the greater the problems that arise. It is obvious that if those roads could be sealed it would cause a great saving in the long run. Every year we witness the grading and repairing of these roads to keep them in traffickable condition. In some areas of the State it is possible to carry out this road work only during certain times of the year. This poses a further problem in that more machinery is required to carry out repair work or to effect improvements than is required in the more populous States. While it can be argued that the more populous States have a far greater number of vehicles and more road users, it can be argued also that the percentage increase in road use is far greater in the developing States like Western Australia. Not only has road use increased but also there had been and will be substantial increases in population in centres hundreds of miles from the metropolitan area. For instance, during the past 4 years the population in the Pilbara division has more than doubled, and it is claimed that by 1975 the population could be ten times as much as it was 4 years ago. It could reach about 33,000, while the total population north of the 26th parallel is expected to grow from 13,500 in 1961 to 59,000 or 60,000 in 1975. This population increase is expected to have taken place shortly after the expiration of the legislation which we are at present debating. Therefore by July 1973, the last year in which this legislation will operate, above the 26th parallel we could have a population increase to at least 50,000 or a percentage increase of 400%. Imagine what this will mean in relation not only to road needs but also to town requirements. Local authorities will be hard pressed, with the finance available to them, to provide the necessary things in the towns for which they are responsible without having to build and to maintain roads. Let us look at Port Hedland, the major port for iron ore. In 1967, the local shire, with an area of almost 9,500 square miles, included 271 miles of formed road, 264 miles paved roads including streets, and 148 miles of unprepared roads. This mileage has increased considerably, and it will increase a great deal more during the next few years. Many of these roads and street extensions will require a fairly extensive outlay of money. It is all right to argue about how many vehicles and owners are using the roads of the more densely populated States, but it must be remembered that in the majority of cases they are using good bitumen or concrete roads which are kinder both to vehicles and users than rough roads, or roads of only narrow bitumen strips with very bad shoulders. So that while the people as a whole pay more in fuel tax, as individuals they pay less. They also pay less in sales tax on tyres, motor vehicles and motor vehicle repairs because motor vehicles have a much shorter life on bad roads than on good roads. One thing that always makes me savage is to see good roads in metropolitan or near metropolitan areas being torn up and relaid. If those roads were in the outlying areas they would be regarded as first class. Perfectly good roads are done away with and new roads laid simply to get rid of a slight bend or rise, or to cause a minor shortening of distance. This goes on notwithstanding the fact that many other roads are not only in a poor condition but also in a dangerous state in that they may cause accidents. They have large and deep potholes, bad and broken shoulders on narrow bitumen strips, or bog or dust holes where there is no bitumen. Despite the need for better roads in the outback or country areas, and the spending of money on metropolitan roads which is not actually warranted, as I have pointed out, on this occasion the amount to be allocated to be spent on rural roads within the States has been reduced from 40% to about 33%. The area factor in relation to the formula is removed. Over the next 5 years New South Wales In other words, they do not support uniwill receive Commonwealth aid towards form taxation as being the best thing for roads amounting to $380.4m. On the other Australia. Apparently they would not care hand, Western Australia will receive only if, for instance, Western Australians and S200m. As the title of this Bill shows, the South Australians had to pay much higher money is for roads. One would expect, as taxation so long as the taxation of people New South Wales is to receive almost twice in New South Wales or Victoria was as much as Western Australia, that New lowered. In the tong run this would never South Wales must have a far greater mileage of roads in total, and must also have a much greater mileage of roads other than highways. The fact is, however, that New South Wales has a total of 131,303 miles, while Western Australia has 109,180 miles. Whereas Western Australia has other roads which can be classed as subsidised by State road authorities to a total of 44,041 miles, New South Wales has only 4,286 miles in this category. New South Wales has 102,682 miles of unsealed roads and Western Australia has 95,375 miles of unsealed roads. Those figures show that the allocation of money has no relationship to actual road needs and existing road conditions. If it did Western Australia would receive not a great deal less than New South Wales. A survey of other States would show that Western Australia should receive more than the others, including Victoria. The money is not allocated, it seems, with a view towards meeting the demand for new roads. If it was, Western Australia again because of its road needs in the outer and developing areas, would need to receive an allocation second only to New South Wales. So we come back to the argument that the most money must be spent in those States where the most revenue is collected from fuel tax or, in other words, the States with the greatest number of vehicles must get the biggest share of Commonwealth aid. Apparently this is done irrespective of whether they have a greater or lesser need in relation to roads. The argument in this respect is no different from that used by many people in the more populous States in relation to the allocation to the States of moneys collected by the Commonwealth from taxes of a general nature. I have frequently heard people from New South Wales and Victoria-and some who should know better, including the Premier of Victoriaargue that all moneys collected by or from those States should be spent in those States. work out in the interests of the Commonwealth. I suggest that the same thing applies which require urgent attention in the north in relation to the development of, or of Western Australia. Yet despite their developments in, a State. Developments in urgency and the urgent needs in other areas a State benefit not only that State but Ausof the State the Commonwealth has tralia as a whole. Therefore, in this matter, decided that over the next 5 years Western if there is an urgent need for new roads or Australia's share of the Commonwealth aid improvements to existing roads to increase roads grant is to be 1.8% less than it was or enhance the development or possibility over the period of the last grant. In my of development, surely those needs should book the very least we could have expected not be secondary to simply making money was the same percentage as we received available on the basis of the number of in the period from 1964 to 1969. Of course, people or number of vehicles in a State. No one can convince me that money more important from the accident angle and spent on roads and streets in capital cities, also from the point of view of the cost of no matter which, is always wisely spent or transport and haulage. One of the reasons spent because it is necessary to spend it. for the high cost of living in the north is Most of it is wasted in the true sense when the condition of the roads and the resultant we look at the needs over the whole Comheavy wear on tyres and vehicles generally. monwealth. If it comes to an argument as If my memory serves me right, the Loder to where the money should be spent to Committee in its report on northern transderive or give the greatest benefit to road port said that wear and tear costs in the users, much of the money that is now spent north were almost double what they were in capital cities would have to be spent outin the south. Because of the aspects to which side the cities. The same argument applies I have referred I hope that the Government, to the amount of money being spent in the while it has not seen fit to give Western different States. My argument is not that Australia a greater share of the funds will New South Wales, Victoria or any other arrange for substantial specific grants to State should receive less money; my arguallow the important work on northern and ment is that Western Australia should rural roads to be carried out. receive more because of its heavy commitments for new and better roads, because the cost of such roads is so very high even to bring them to a reasonable trafficable north we have had considerable developstate. In support of those remarks I point ments in new land settlement in Western out that the sealing of the North West Australia. Between 1952 and 1966 over Coastal Highway between Carnarvon and 7,850,000 acres of new land were opened Port Hedland, a distance of 550 miles, was up. That area was equal to something like estimated to cost $17. lm in 1966. Because 37% of the total acreage of land that was of that cost and the state of finances the opened up in the whole of Australia during programme had to be spread over 9 years, those years. This increase in land developeven though the sealing of that road is of ment means that here again additional and very great importance to northern developbetter roads are required.

Those roads are just a couple of those good roads are not just important from the angle of comfort or convenience. They are In addition to the development in the the hilt already. Finally, I want to point out that Western Australia has a high percentage of exports in relation to population. If it is good enough to look at population in relation to usage of motor vehicles it should also have a place in relation to exports. Increasing production from Western Australia's primary industries, which include minerals, wool, meat and wheat, is making a significant contribution to the economy of this country. Figures show that, with only of the total population of Australia, Western Australia imports only 5% of the total imports and exports almost 14% of the total exports. The latter figure will rise in the near future, particularly if roads can be improved. I refer now to a document called 'The member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones), Problem of Urgent Road Development in which calls on the Government to make Remote Areas of Western Australia' and the whole amount of that tax revenue written by the Commissioner of Main available under roads aid. At present the Roads. It contains the following table: Overseas Export tax revenue for general revenue. This is Earnings Per 1965-66 1966-67 money would become extremely important Western Australia Queensland South Auslralia Tasmania Victoria New Soulh Wales The percentage increase for Western Australia-namely , 30.3%-wa s considerably ahead of that for any of the other States. Of course, the Western Australian figure will increase in the near future with the further development of the north, particularly if finance can be put into roads as it should be. Let me now read out what the Commissioner of Main Roads in Western Australia had to say. He said: The export trade surplus generated in Western Australia is therefore playing a big part in covering the substantial import requirements for promoting industrial growth in the eastern States. However, it is because of the very nature of the pace of growth and road requirements of these primary industries in Western Australia that there is a large deficit between the revenues available for road construction and our urgent road needs. The backlog of inadequate road construction in these areas is not diminishing with time and the present year's (1967-68) allocation of $600,000 for new land settlement roads, which is an all time high, is nowhere near enough. There are many other problems encountered in these remote areas, such as the lack of suitable road building materials, the extreme climate, isolation and the problem of obtaining and retaining an adequate labour force. However, these problems are reasonably easily overcome given the necessary finance. It is the tremendous size of the task and the extreme shortage of funds which are the main problems found in trying to satisfy the urgent demands for roads in the rapidly expanding remote areas of Western Australia. If it is good enough to allocate roads aid on the basis of giving the greatest amount to the States in which the greatest amount of revenue from the fuel tax is gathered, surely it is good enough to distribute the whole of the revenue from that tax-no t just a portion of it-so as to ensure that the purpose of the tax-namely , better roads-is carried out. I heartily support the amendment moved by the honourable Government retains about 15% of the not good enough. It reaches a fairly high Head of figure over several years.

Of course, this has all come about since the return of the Liberal Party to office in that State. Before the Liberal Party came to power there that State had the greatest rate of unemployment in the Commonwealth. It really was a backward State. However, thanks to the good management of the Liberal Party, Western Australia is now a very prosperous State. I congratulate the honourable member for Kalgoorlie on bringing this fact before the Parliament. Events in Western Australia foreshadow what Tasmania can expect if the Liberal Party becomes the Government in that State. Instead of remaining in the doldrums, as it has been for 35 years, Tasmania, with all the wonderful resources available to it, will follow tbe pattern of Western Australia and become a very prosperous State.

The Bureau also rescheduled projects to take account of physical and labour resources. I think that one of the main contributions that the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads has made, although I do not agree is that at least it has brought uniformity to the classification of roads. As many people, including local councillors and aldermen will not be able to obtain a copy of the report by the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads to this Parliament and as I hope to a point of order.

The other classifications refer to arterial roads. I will not bother about them as we are more concerned with rural roads. When the difficulties regarding the classification of roads are ironed out, I feel sure that the problems now facing the shires will be solved. In New South Wales, under the present scheme, 90% of the Commonwealth's grant to the State was spent on rural roads. But the new scheme provides for an increase in the grant for urban roads. It should be remembered that most of the big cities have resulted from a lack of decentralisation within the States concerned. In my opinion it is foolish to build up huge cities and to allow much of our country and coastal areas to be denuded of population. I have spoken previously of the fact that the rectangle based on a line joining Wollongong and Newcastle and extending SO miles inland could not possibly be missed by any potential enemy using nuclear or atomic weapons. I do not know why we follow the trends in the whole of our shire'. I said to him: overseas.

This has been the general state of affairs on most sitting days. Quite a number of members opposite have gone home by now. Under the present arrangements all aid roads money received by a State during a financial year either must be expended or set aside for expenditure by the State within the year in question. Those moneys set aside within the financial year must be expended within 6 months of the end of that year. A similar provision has been incorporated in the new arrangements. However a State which has difficulty in spending part of its grant within the required time may seek an extension of the period by applying to the Treasurer. In addition an amount of the principal grant payable for expenditure on one of the classes of road may be approved by the Minister for Shipping and Transport for expenditure on a different class road. This is where the diffiPortion of a road, for instance, may be classified as a class 3 road and a few miles further on the road may be in a different class. I understand that the Minister will be the arbiter as to what classifications these roads will take. Of course, he will be advised by the State road authorities but he will bc the sole arbiter and it would seem to mc, from discussions that I have had with shir? councillors, that difficulties will arise as to those roads classified as class 3. I am sure that the Minister will realise the difficulty that shire councils have in constructing and reconstructing these roads, but he will be able to relieve the burden of those shites which have a surfeit of these roads. I am pleased to be a member of the party fhat has had the foresight and determination to bring in a Bill such as this. BeforeI conclude I should like to refer to a delegation of shire councillors which came to Canberra. One shire councillor pulled me to one side and said: 'We haven't one bad road and the extra money that the States will get will enable suburban roads, which have not received the attention that they should have received in the past, to be brought up to the standard of other roads that have been properly maintained.

I go back to the period 20 years Patterson, H . A. ago, 1948-49, when $14,202,000 was the Scholes, G. G. D. total of the Commonwealth funds given to the States. Ten years later a total of TeUers: $309m was given to the States for the 5 years between 1954 and 1959. In the next quinquennium an amount of $500m was provided. In the 1964-69 quinHulme, A. S. quennium an amount of $750m was provided. The legislation before us raises the Jessop, D . S. total to $l,252m for all States excluding Kelly, C.

The amounts payable each year over the period to which I Peacock. A . S. have referred range from $ 14.2m to Pettitt, J. A. $316.8m.

I conmy electorate and by many councils in sider it my duty in this House to record the many protests which have come to me. They include protests from the eight shires with headquarters in my electorate, other local government bodies, political organisations, a few individuals, the Press in a number of cases in its capacity as an instrutraffic. ment reflecting the wishes of the people, progress associations, ratepayers associations, regional development committees and industry organisations. All those have written to me about this matter and I have represented their views to the Ministers concerned. The Government made its decision, having as its guide one major factor-the report of the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads. [Quorum formed.] When I was interrupted I had pointed out that the Government made its decision having as its guide the report of the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads. Much has been said by previous speakers and much will be said by following speakers about this report. I think that at this stage I should say something about the road needs survey which was conducted in 1967-68. I point out that we are discussing this Bill while that report is not yet complete. Further information will be provided to us in a document entitled 'Australian Road Systems of 1968'. I particularly look to the information in that document about the cost benefit survey that has been made. The report of the Bureau of Roads is the basis upon which this Bill was framed; it is the basis upon which the Government made its decision. I think I should recall some of the protests made by shire councils. Letters of protest and presidential minutes from shires were forwarded to me as a result of a statement attributed to the New South Wales Minister for Local Government, which appeared in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of 29th March 1967. Whatever we think about the statement now, the objection is not raised for the first time at this moment; the objection arose 2 years ago or earlier. The Minister's statement was interpreted as indicating a strong move to break down the present 40% allocation of Commonwealth aid roads money to rural councils. The report of the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities and the road needs survey of the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads came next. They caused a reaction by every council in New South Wales. I cannot go beyond that from personal experience. The shires urged me, in short, not to lose sight of the problems of the shires and not to lose sight of the vast distances they have to cover and their heavy dependence on all-weather Although much has been said about the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads report, not very much has been said about the tremendous work which has been done by the shires, the great expense load on the shires and the field work undertaken over and above the normal engineering duties to make this report possible. Their main problem was the adoption of tolerable standards by the Bureau of Roads. I would like to look at one or two of the most important standards. Firstly there is the tolerable safe travel speed. I will read to the House the definition of a tolerable safe travel speed. It is a speed which would be adopted in the prevailing traffic conditions by a conscientious, experienced law abiding driver unfamiliar with the locality so that he could travel the road concerned correctly positioned on the roadway and in confidence that traffic situations likely to arise could be handled calmly. DareI say at this stage that such a person would be a normal driver? If we look at some of the tolerable speeds that were laid down and on which the whole report and the Bill were prepared, we find that on a class 3 road the highest tolerable speed is 45 miles per hour for flat country and 35 miles per hour in undulating country. For class 4 roads, which constitute substantially the bulk of shire roads, the tolerable speed is 35 miles per hour. This means that in the great bulk of shire roads, provided a vehicle can travel at 35 miles per hour no realignment or resurfacing is required. In my view, the adoption of these standards as tolerable standards is a retrograde step. They are, in fact, intolerable. The definition provides that no sealing is and Transport asking him whether he warranted for roads which carry less than 100 vehicles per day, and only 16 feet of gravel surface is permitted. Single lane sealing is provided for roads which carry up to 140 vehicles a day. AH road authorities will tell us that whilst single lane sealing can be carried out quickly and fairly cheaply it presents a great danger to traffic. This type of sealing causes a lot of our highways to be referred to as crystal highways because of the amount of glass that is left along the side of these roads from broken windscreens and headlamps. The standard for single lane bridges is a traffic load of up to 100 vehicles per day. In my opinion single lane bridges should be prohibited in this country. 1 think I am a little less tolerant than the Shires Association of New South Wales which permits single lane bridges on access roads which have a rate of sixteen vehicles per day. Although 16-foot pavements in New South Wales were abandoned 16 years ago, the road needs survey sets this as a tolerable standard in certain cases. Single lane 12-foot roads are a menace to traffic safety. [Quorum formed.] The people on whose behalf I speak and to whom this legislation is of great importance are most interested, I know from great experience, to learn just who is on their side. I think tbey can see from the attendance of members of the Opposition in this House tonight just who is not on their side. I repeat that single lane 12-foot trafficways are considered to be a menace to traffic safety. They are entirely unsuitable in undulating or hilly country and, contrary to a lot of beliefs, they are highly expensive to maintain. I could go on with a number of other features of the tolerable standards set out in the survey. Suffice it to say there are many experts about who constantly tell people in the country to get with it, to be a little sophisticated and to make themselves efficient. I say that for modern inland traffic, which consists largely of heavy transport traffic, and for agricultural machinery, which is moving about on rubber tyres to a greater and greater degree, the tolerable standards laid down in the road needs survey are intolerable. It is not just something new which has occurred to me. Right back in 1967 I addressed a question to the then Minister for Shipping realised that this survey was causing real concern to local government bodies and whether he considered that unrealistic tolerable standards of engineering and road speeds provided a seriously misleading view of the position. He replied, in short, that he did not and finished by saying: I suggest to the honourable member that we should all possess our souls in patience This would have been very nice but 2 years ago there were a lot of people who were not prepared to possess their souls in patience. This is the kind of answer that endears the Minister to many private members. The next week the honourable member for Cowper asked a more detailed question on the same matter and he got the answer. . . the Government cannot be regarded as being irrevocably committed to the division ot Australian road funds which requires 40% to be spent on rural roads That was 2 years ago so the die was well on the way to being cast. The Bill deals with the allocation within the States as set out in the schedules. Two noticeable features come to mind. First of all over $600m out of $l,252m-clos e enough to 50%-goe s to urban arterial roads under an entirely new policy on the part of this Government. No-one would disagree that there is great need for funds to be spent in urban areas in the major capital cities. Anyone who has moved there, driving his own vehicle, travelling by public transport, or even wanting to cross the street, will agree. The Treasurer ( Mr McMahon) in his second reading speech says that this is a new policy and that for the first time these Commonwealth funds will be set aside specifically for this purpose-the construction of major urban roads. The need is readily seen. The figure of 50%, however, seems to me to be quite a bit too high. It will be interesting to see the reports at the end of the year as they come in under the proposed legislation to see how much of the $600m will be spent on reclamation work. The second feature-and this has been brought in before but for the sake of rounding off my argument I repeat it-is that taking 1968-69 as the base year the Bdl increases the amount for certain rural roads by 5% per annum compound. I have used the expression 'certain rural roads' for a purpose. The Prime Minister( Mr Gorton), in a statement made on 13th March, used the term and I shall quote his words: . . . roads in rural areas otber than highways, trunk roads and main roads. I do not want to get tangled up in definitions but I want to point out the difference between that statement and the phrase used in the Treasurer's second reading speech. He used the expression 'rural roads other than arterial roads'. We know by the definitions in the beginning of the Bill that it is competent for the Minister to specify what are rural arterial roads. That means that the remainder, of course, must be matched up with the terms which the Prime Minister used. I say now that we people in the country look to the Minister to see that when these definitions arefinalisedthe terms of the statement of the Prime Minister on 13th March and the terms used in the Bill will coincide. The rural population and shire councils can now look forward to only a 5% increase and I emphasise that this is on today's values. What of 1973-74? I should like to take the first note in the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads report. I cannot tell the House which page it is on because the pages are not numbered but note 4 on recommendation 1 which is on the second coloured page says that a provision for future cost rises in respect of road works at a rate of about 2.5% per annum would be appropriate. So they mention there 2.5%. But if we go a little further in the main report we see a note which reads: A rate of price increase of 3.5% per annum, the average rate for public works for this purpose, has been used to convert from current prices to constant prices in this Table. The Bureau itself used a figure of 3.5% per annum increase. So when we subtract this from the 5% which is coming it can be seen that no great change is going to take place in finance for rural roads. I could quote from quite a number of documents. The Treasurer, in a speech at Bathurst on 9th May referred to the consumer price index and to weekly earnings rising by 6.3%. I am not an advocate of low wages, but I mention that to give emphasis to the fact that the cost of the construction of roads will increase because the labour factor is quite a substantial one. The Treasurer referred to the inflationary trend which is still continuing and said it was the No. 1 economic problem. The speech of the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Anthony), when opening the United Graziers Association Conference, covered three pages in dealing with inflation, not only as to its causes but also as to who should be dealing with it. These factors all give weight to the argument that costs are going to rise. I could refer to a number of other sources but I do not think it is altogether necessary to bring out my point that for the shire councillor faced with a budget in the future the 5% increase is not going to do much more than just hold the line. All these figures are given to show that there can be little, if any, acceleration in the construction of rural roads. It will be largely a matter of the status quo. I see no increase occurring in the country work force and I see no increase in the number of shire jobs available. At this late hour I feel that I can cut down a little on what I was going to say but there are quite a number of aspects of this most important subject to the people I represent that I would have liked to touch upon. I direct attention to two matters merely to let the people in rural areas know with whom they are dealing. I refer to the 'News and Views of the Australian Motor Industry' as set out in the 'Commonwealth Automotive Review'. This publication states: The present policy of requiring States to spend not less than 40% of Commonwealth road moneys on rural side roads . . . That is its term, not mine . . . was restrictive and unrealistic. There we have the view of the motor industry itself. Then in the next issue-stil l with the same number, which shows how efficient it is-the following statement appears: Not only have the allocations been inadequate, but a completely unrealistic condition has until now been imposed: viz -The provision that at least 40% of the grants had to be spent on rural roads other than main highways connecting major centres of population. I think that the users of the motors of all types in rural areas should keep those remarks in mind. I also have here another publication put out by the Australian Automobile Association which points out that: Traffic engineers estimate that the cost of conamendment, for this reason: It is quite ungestion on Australian roads runs as high as SI.000m per year. That is one of the best arguments I have ever seen for decentralisation, and I take it as such. The publication also states: The provision in the present Commonwealth Aid Road Act, under which 40% of funds provided to the States have to be spent on rural roads, should be reviewed. 1 think the people in country areas should know that this comes from the Australian Automobile Association, which has as constituent members every major motor organisation in every State, including in New South Wales the National Roads and Motorists Association. I wonder what the NRMA delegate to this body was doing when that motion was passed? The Australian Automobile Association claims to represent some 2 various organisations, and one of those organisations is the Australian Road Safety Council. What with 12-foot bridges and 12-foot carriageways, I think that somebody has slipped up somewhere. I shall have a quick look at the accident figures for the State of New South Wales, which were the only ones available to me today. The latest figures available are for the 12 months ended 30th June 1963, and they show that the number of accidents in the County of Cumberland was far greater than that outside the County of Cumberland. But the number killed outside the County of Cumberland was far in excessby 681 to 493-of those within the county. This accident rate is undoubtedly due to the density of traffic, and the high death rate or the more serious character of the accidents in the country are, in my opinion and in the opinion of many other people, including the Road Safety Council, caused by the less favourable relationship or juxtaposition between the traffic speed on the one hand and traffic engineering on the other. Perhaps it is time for us to look at the people who deal with these particular matters and put out this particular material. Perhaps it is time for the rural motorists -the stock transport drivers, the long distance transport drivers, the commercial lorry drivers and interstate transport drivers -to get together, have a look at who is representing them, and possibly make some other arrangements. 1 conclude by saying that 1 dismiss thc realistic to ask the Government to alter a long-standing policya policy for which it has a reason-jus t as a result of an Opposition amendment to a Bill. I agree wholeheartedly with the grand total that has been provided. I have heard no adverse comment, or very little adverse comment, on that particular point. I have no reason to disagree with the distribution between the States, but I have to record on behalf of the people who have been in contact with me strong objection to the distribution that has been made within the States. Overall, however, I am in a position where 1 must support the Bill. The weight is in its favour. I agree with the first two factors; so far as the third is concerned, it has been said that this is not a contractual agreement. Maybe it is not, but it is however an agreement million Australian motorists on that has already been entered into by the Prime Minister on the one hand and the State Premiers on the other, without any substantial amendments being made. In fact, there have been no amendments with regard to distribution within the State. A firm public announcement has already been made to the people by the Prime Minister, and the various sectors that are affected know about the proposed allocation. I think it would be completely unrealistic to expect a reallocation of funds at this stage. No additional funds could reasonably be expected to be fed into the rural sector. I therefore support the Bill. The hour is late and 1 think the details of this Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement have been covered fully by many speakers. However, there are a couple of things that I wish to say. The first thing that 1 should like to do is offer my congratulations to the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads on its reports. All too often we see first-class reports pigeonholed and perhaps forgotten. Therefore it is good to see an excellent report adopted and implemented with such alacrity. I congratulate the Government on that. I think this is the first time that a truly objective look has been taken at our whole road problem. There is no doubt that one",78,Pairs
134,Mr Street (Corangamite) [11.44],"of the greatest needs in the country is a first class road system. Such a system is essential for primary industry to get its products to the centres of population and to the ports for export. It is essential for secondary industry to distribute its products to the consumer market and, of course, it reduces costs to the consumer. So a good road system has an effect far beyond the immediate area that it serves. It was somebody in America who first said that good roads do not cost, they pay. By enabling a better use of resources, they reduce costs and therefore pay their way. I am glad to see that in the new agreement very much closer attention will be paid to the various classes of roads and the new series of classifications. This aspect has been dealt with previously by honourable members in this debate. There is no doubt that it will enable more precise answers to be given to the question as to the types or classifications of roads that will need special consideration and how much that special consideration should be. There is an obvious requirement for more and better urban roads and freeways. There is a point here that I would like to bring up and it is expressed in the rather clumsy phrase 'the diseconomies of scale'. There is no doubt that when cities reach a certain size the cost of providing roads, power and all the public services becomes so large that it is cheaper to provide the services in other areas. As cities get bigger, one of the largest of these costs arises from the provision of the freeway system. Some evidence is coming from America to show that the cities there have already reached the size of diseconomies of scale, and I have no doubt that the same position will be reached in Australia. We must be ready to recognise this effect when it starts to appear and give serious consideration to providing the essential services in decentralised areas. I am particularly concerned, as many adequate level of spending on rural roads honourable members who have taken part substantial funds will be needed from the in this debate have been, at the elimination States to complement grants from the Comof the requirement to spend 40% of the monwealth. I hope that this fact will not be Commonwealth grant for roads on other lost sight of by the States when they come to rural roads and on this question of classificamake their allocations. tion by the Minister. Everything depends, of course, on his classification of what are rural arterial roads. Until we know what the adjourned. arterial roads are, we will not know exactly how much money will be available for the other rural roads. My understanding is that these ministerial classifications will be reviewed annually, so that if it is seen that there is an inequitable situation at least it need not persist for more than 12 months. It can be rectified at the annual review. I am also pleased to see that, while the general increase in funds was 67%, Victoria's increase was 73%. I am pleased to see this recognition at last of Victoria's need for a fairer share. There is no doubt that Victoria has been penalised for many years by the old formula. larger percentage for Victoria is a clear recognition of that position. The other classification I was interested to see is that of urban arterial roads, which applies to Melbourne, Bendigo, Geelong and Ballarat. This should provide a welcome boost to the possibility of these provincial cities building the very much needed ring type of arterial roads around them. We must remember that even a grand total of $1,252m from the Commonwealth for roads represents approximately only one-third of the total amount which will be available for roads, about 66% of the amount required coming from the States. By assuming increased responsibilty for urban roads and freeways the Commonwealth has made it possible for the States to spend very much more on other road projects. I sincerely hope that this will result in substantial State funds being available for areas such as rural roads, which I mentioned a moment ago and which at the moment seem to be something of a grey area until ministerial decisions aTe made. These other rural roads have not shared in the increased Commonwealth grants to anything like the same extent as other classes of roads. They have received about a 5% compound annual increase as against an increase overall of 67%. To maintain an Debate (on motion by Mr Corbett)",82,Pairs

The Opposition feels that today certain things are going on in Australia which are critical to this country's industrial future and that, of all places, the national Parliament should have been the forum where some aspects of this matter were raised. I understand that because the Government does not have the weight of numbers in another place the matters which are denied ventilation here have been debated there of the Opposition at the way the business in what is supposed to be a parliamenta representative assembly-is being conducted.

137,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [11.52],"The following answers to questions upon notice were circulated: Double Island Lighthouse Reserve (Question No. 1203) Mr Hansen asked the Minister for the Interior, upon notice: 1. Is his Department considering the surrender of part of the Double Island Lighthouse Reserve to the Queensland Government? If so, why? 2. Is the area to be surrendered the same as that which was recently offered as a beach mining lease? 3. If the land is to be surrendered, will he insist on conditions which will ensure that the isthmus joining Double Island to the mainland will be preserved? able member's question is as follows: 1. Consideration is being given to the return lo the State of Queensland of part of the reserve. This is basically for the reason that the reserve is much larger than is now required for the purposes of the lighthouse establishment, and because increasing numbers of casual visitors are causing damage and disturbance to the land, and the Commonwealth officers responsible for the operation of the lighthouse cannot be expected to supervise the activities of casual visitors on such an extensive reserve. 2. No area has been offered as a beach mining lease. The land being considered for return to the State includes certain sand dune areas in respect of which tenders were invited some 3 years ago for the right to mine mineral sands, but no licence was granted. 3. As the proposal under consideration is to return the land to the State because it is surplus to Commonwealth requirements, it would not be appropriate for the Commonwealth to stipulate conditions that would bind the State of Queensland concerning the future use of the land in question. However, any arrangement for return to the State of portion of the reserve would naturally be subject to the preservation, in favour of the Commonwealth, of rights of access to the headland across the isthmus. Curtis Island (Question No. 1210) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for the Interior, upon notice: 1. Did his Department, jointly with the Queensland Government, cause several residents of Curtis Island the expense and inconvenience of packing furniture in connection with tbe proposal to settle Nauruans on the Island? 2. Can he say whether one resident sold at a loss after buying property elsewhere and another incurred expenditure of $100 as a representative of property owners to interview State and Federal authorities regarding the proposal? 3. What compensation was (a) offered and (b) given to Curtis Island property owners to recompense them for this expense and inconvenience? able member's question is as follows: 1. Preliminary negotiations with residents did not proceed to the stage where acquisition of properties was negotiated, and no persons concerned were asked to move. 2. No. 3. None. As acquisition did not proceed beyond the proposal stage, no such rights to compensation accrued.

Can he give information on Australian Capital Terrilory and Northern Territory revenues and expenditures analogous to that provided for the States in his answer on 27th November 1968 OHansard, page 3383)? honourable member's quesdon is as follows: 1.

Percentage increases on preceding year: Australian Capita! Northen Territory 1967-68 1968-69 (Estimates) . . 15.0 It might be noted that in order to provide information that is analogous to that given for the States it has been necessary to exclude items of a capital nature from the expenditure figures. This is because these items are not usually included to any significant extent in the Consolidated Revenue Fund expenditures of the various States. In providing the information on State revenues and expenditures, I indicated that, for a number of reasons, the figures were not fully comparable as between States or as between years. For the same reasons, the figures given earlier for the States are not fully comparable with the figures now presented in respect of the two mainland Territories. No attempt has therefore been made to distinguish between 'local government' and 'State government' type expenditures and revenues. It is also pointed out that changes in accounting arrangements can affect the comparability of the figures as between Territories. For example, the significant percentage increase in Northern Territory revenue in 1967-68 is mainly the result of an accounting change whereby payments previously credited to appropriations were brought to account as revenue. The revenue collected by the Commonwealth (other than for business undertakings) in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory is paid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund and is not applied directly to Territorial expenditures as these are financed from the Commonwealth Budget. Because of this, it is not possible to provide figures for the Territories that are analogous to Commonwealth grants to the States. It is, however, possible to relate revenues derived in the Territories to expenditures and this is done in the following table: Revenue Derived in Territories as a Percentage of Expenditure (Excluding Business Undertakings and Expenditure of a Capital Nature).

149,Mr Freetli,"The answer to the honourhonourable member's question is as follows: Details of the components of gross national expenditure and the gross national product are available over the period requested for financial years only. Most of these figures may be found in the following publications: 1949-50 Accounts, National Income and Expenditure, 1948-49 to 1964-65 (table 2); 1953-54 Accounts, National Income and Expenditure, 1953-54 to 1966-67 (table 2); 1958-59 Accounts, 1967-68, Preliminary Statement No. 1, Gross National Product at Current and Constant Prices (table 1). 'Gross domestic capital formation' is equal to the sum of gross fixed capital expenditure (private, public enterprises and public authorities) and increase in the value of stocks. 'Government consumption' is net current expenditure on goods and services by public authorities and 'domestic expenditure' is gross national expenditure. Information not contained in the tables mentioned above comprises: (a) the breakdown of government consumption into 'defence' and 'civil'. Defence expenditures are as follows (Sm): 1949-50 1950-51 1951-52 .. 329 1952-53 1953-54 1954-55 1955-56 1956-57 1957-58 -1958-59 .. 376 1959-60 1960-61 1961-62 1962-63 1963-64 1964-65 1965-66 1966-67 1967-68 These figures include an adjustment made for the purposes of the national accounts; equipment purchased overseas is included in the period when delivered, not when paid for. -Civil' expenditures may be derived by the deduction of the above series from total public authorities net current expenditure. (b) 'Income from abroad' and 'income paid abroad' presumably refer to the items in deriving 'net income payable overseas' in the national accounts (i.e. property credits and debits in the balance of payments).

156,Mr Mcmahon,The answer to the,93,Answers To Questions Upon Notice
157,Mr Mcmahon,"The answer to thesuch relief measures. Commonwealth assistance takes the form of loans where the State itself makes loans and grants where the Slate makes grants. Thus, the Commonwealth is providing assistance, in the form of grants, in respect of freight rebates on the movement of stock from drought areas before they are declared 'starving'. There are special provisions in the Commonwealth Income Tax Assessment Act which relate to expenditures by primary producers on fencing and fodder storage facilities. Social Services: Pensions Appeals Tribunal (Question No. 1445) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Social Services, upon notice: Has consideration been given to establishing a tribunal to decide appeals against the refusal of age or invalid pensions under the Social Services Act similar to the Assessment Appeal Tribunals which decide appeals against the refusal of service pensions under the Repatriation Act? honourable member's question is as follows: The question of establishing an appeals tribunal has been raised from time to time. However, after careful consideration, the conclusion has been reached that the present practice of reviewing departmental decisions on receipt of representations to the Minister, or the Department, which are treated as appeals, generally works well. The establishment of a statutory tribunal could well introduce elements of rigidity and delay that would not be to the advantage of pensioners, particularly those of advanced age. AS honourable members are familiar with the administration of the present system and if a member provides particulars of any unsatisfactory application of the relevant provisions of the Social Services Act a further review will be made of this matter.",93,Answers To Questions Upon Notice
