We have put forward a somewhat similar amendment. Then there is the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Mallee, which seeks to disturb the formula whilst giving the whole of the proceeds to the States.

11,Mr Turnbull,"A really good laughthat I always have admired about the honourable member for Mallee, and that is liis capacity for simulating sagacity. Look at him now. Does it not justify all that I am saying? But the honourable member is not as wise as be thinks he is. What he proposes to do, if effected, would interfere with the future development and defence of this continent He is a good Australian; there is none better. But in relation to this measure he is adopting a narrow parochial attitude. I am as good a Victorian as he is, but, above all else, I am an Australian. We cannot serve this country in this Parliament unless we adopt an Australian attitude to all tbese matters. I would rather suffer the hostility of my contemporaries in Victoria to-day for the attitude I adopt to this measure than incur tbe contempt and censure of posterity. We have got a job to do at this moment. It is to hold this country. To hold the country, we must build roads and railways and develop the nation as fast as we can. But we shall not develop this continent if we say to the standards with which to build roads at people of tbe most heavily settled part of Australia, the State of Victoria, "" Y o u can bave all the money that is collected in your State from tbe petrol tax, regardless of what happens anywhere else in the continent"". I bave no doubt that this country will be attacked again some time in the future, it may be 20 or 40 years in the future. The attack will come from Japanese imperialists, Chinese Communists or Indonesian nationalists aud no one else. No invader will spare tbe people living south of the Murray any more than tbey will spare tbe people living north of the Murray. iu my mind. I do not want to see a river Murray line, drawn in connection with road construction and development in this great Australia of ours. The State of Victoria would be in a much better position in putting forward a case fnr revision of the formula if it did .two ihines. about which the honourable member fnr Mallee probably knows little or nothing. In any case I do not know whether he is aware of two facts. Firstly, in the State of Victoria not all the nioney that is collected from motor registration fees is appropriated by the VictorianParliament for road-making purposes in that State. Some of it goes into general revenue and is used to finance other undertakings. am always happy to oblige the honourable member for Deakin by enlightening him. After all, I was once the Minister for Information. The second fact of which the bonorable member for Mallee is probably unawareI hope he is unaware of it, because I sbould not like him deliberately to deceive the House-is that in Victoria motor registration fees have not been increased since 1926. Mr TijRNBuivi:. -What is wrong with that? think that any honourable member of this Parliament would claim that motor registration fees should be based on 1926 1956 costs. small-minded they are. of some of them. When the Victorian Parliament inereases its motor registration fees to the average of the six other Australian States and pays tbe full receipts of its motor registration fees to the Country Roads Board of Victoria for the construction of Victorian roads outside the metropolitan area, the State will be in a much better position to impress the conference of-Commonwealth and State Ministers and this Parliament that it is entitled to more consideration than it is receiving at the present time. All this week I have seen school children sitting in the galleries of this House, and when I have looked into their bright, honest and innocent faces-and I am not looking for votes fifteen or sixteen years henceI have wondered what their future will be if this Parliament in our time is not sufficiently Australia-wise to pass legislation which will ensure that their chances of survival will be better than they might otherwise -be.

19,Mr Calwell,"That may be truein the way that he has done. All that he is concerned about is tbe electorate of Mallee, which is one of 33 electorates in Victoria. In this respect, as in everythink that Victoria covers about 90,000 thing else, he has adopted the parochial attitude. When it comes to primary produce, all that he can think of is dried fruits, Raisin Joe and concentrated sunlight. wants the petrol for tbe parish pump. able member for Fremantle ( Mr latitude, it will pass through Carnarvon Beazley) has interjected, the bonorable member for Mallee only wants petrol for the parish pump. I should like bonorable members to listen to some of the ngures connected with the registration of motor vehicles in Victoria, as compared with registrations in Queensland. Victoria is a State of about S8,000 square miles, and Queensland's area covers about 668,000 square miles. Tliere are about twice as many people in Victoria as there are in Queensland. tbe honourable member who interjected to.draw me into making a comparison in regard to the quality of Australians, because they are all good from my viewpoint, and, in any case, comparisons are odious. The motor registration fee in Queensland is based on power-weight units, and it is 6s. a unit. In Victoria, it is only 3s. a unit, and the honourable member for Mallee has stated that he wants to keep it that way. And even the honourable member for Corio( Mr £8,000,000 ought to be given and, in my Opperman) says that that fee is quite enough. Who will pay for the making of the roads if certain people do not want to pay sufficient motor registration fees? On a 'Holden motor car the registration fee in Victoria is £6 3s., and in Queensland, £12 6s., or an average for the six States of £8 16s. 7d. On a Ford Customline in Victoria tbe registration fee is £9 9s., and in Queensland £18 18s. with a States average of £13 13s. 5d. On a Morris Minor, in Victoria, one will pay £3 13s., in Queensland £7 6s., and the average for the Commonwealtb is £5 4s. l i d . When we consider the State of Western Australia with an area of^ about ten times that of Victoria times the size of Victoria. square miles and Western Australian about 900,000 square miles. Western Australia is at least ten times the size of Victoria and may be eleven times as big. However, I shall not query a frac7 tion. In Western Australia, there is a very small population to hold about one-third of the Commonwealth. If one draws a line along the 26th parallel of in Western Australia and Bundaberg in Queensland and divide Australia into precisely two equal parts. To the north we have practically no population, and only one good road; to tbe south -we have some good and many poor roads, and practically all our population. The present Government is concerned with this matter, as is obvious from a copy of a press statement. I have in my hand, issued by the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator Paltridge) on the 24th February last, which readsA road development works programme needed over the next decade to Tiring the Australian roads' system up to the geometric standards considered necessary to cater for the rapidly expanding needs of road transport, was estimated by State road construction authorities to eost ""at least £1,000,000,000-£558,000,00 0 for new capital works on primary roads and £442,000,000 for capital and maintenance works on secondary roads £8,000,000. view, could easily be saved from the defence vote. ber propose that we rely for the defence of this country entirely on roads? more roads built. It is impossible to defend or develop a country without roads. What we need is a co-ordinated transport policy for the next twenty years-road , air, rail and sea. No country in modern times was developed without railroads and ordinary roads. What else lay behind tbe great development and success of America but tbe great numbers of people who streamed westward as the railroads were pushed across that grea*",12,Speaker Mr C F Discussion Which Has Taken Place Has

We would not now have a road, in the modern sense of the term, between Darwin and Alice Springs had it not been for World WarI I . ; but for that war we would still have tbe same old bush road running alongside the telegraph line. We certainly do need more roads in Australia, particularly in the undeveloped and most vulnerable parts of the continent, and I think the Minister for Shipping and Transport was perfectly right in stating our needs and that nothing less than £1,000,000,000 is required to be spent on roads in the next ten years. would not get too much of it from the honourable member and other vehicle owners in Victoriai f the Victorian registration fees were kept at their present The honourable member sliould remember low rates. If we are to develop our road that this is not a taxing bill, but a measure system somebody has to pay the cost. for the distribution of money. The necessary money cannot be got out of thin air.

When this Parliament decided to vacate the land tax and entertainment tax fields some States imposed increases in their own similar taxes, either in part or in whole. In the entertainment tax field three States, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania imposed increases. In the land tax field Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania increased their imposts, but in New South Wales and Queensland there has been no increase of land tax. In Western Australia, land valuations bave been increased, and additional revenue has been raised in that way. Had New South Wales imposed the land tax that this Government abandoned on behalf of the Commonwealth, it could have raised £1,656,000 in 1951-52.

I have heard it said even that some of this money is being used to make streets in Perth. I do not believe that. If it were being done, it would be a wrong thing to do. But I have no objection to the Queensland and Western Australian Governments retaining that money, and getting as much more as they can, against the time when materials and man-power will be available for the construction of roads that are so necessary to the continued retention of this island continent in the Pacific as our home, and so necessary as an insurance against tbe day wben we are attacked again. in Western Australia is committed for jobs, but the actual payments have not yet caught up. there has been too much development on Australia's eastern seaboard, and not enough in the outback areas. How we may counteract that tendency, I do not know. It is continuing, and it is being aggravated. Some day we shall be able to build the roads, and undertake all the other works, that are so vitally necessary in the less-settled States. I cannot mention in detail the expenditure needed for works other than, roads, but it is obvious that, if £1,000,000,000 is spent on roads, other expenditure must be incurred at a later stage on water supply and sewerage, irrigation, forestry, land development, the provision of electricity and gas services, the supply of coal and briquettes, the construction of houses, schools, hospitals, post offices and aerotralian people.

One .£140,000,000. The total capital and of those commodities was petrol. The maintenance expenditure for new water years will probably exceed £500.000,000. We have to face these facts, whicli concern our very survival. Wp. must find the money to construct the roads and to undertake the other works that 1* have enumerated. Unless we realize that we are not a nation of lotus-eaters, and that, except when we were threatened by Japanese aggression, we were never in more danger than vve are in to-day, we shall fail to discharge our responsibilities to those who live to-day and to those who will come after us. The honourable member for Watson( Mr Cope) referred to the redivision of electoral boundaries. That will come in time as the population of Australia increases. When the committee to be appointed to review the Constitution meets, it might be well for it to discuss the question of making the Commonwealth Parliament responsible for the building of arterial roads and main highways connecting capital cities. The Commonwealth Parliament could accept a defined responsibility for this by a constitutional amendment, and I suggest that such a course would hasten the development of those parts of Australia that are in great need of it. Another important factor is that we in this Parliament would not be governed, as members of State parliaments often are, by tbese. prejudices, phobias and desires to extend preferential treatment to one part of a State over another. I commend the bill. I assure the Honse that there will be a division, and we shall see just how many will support my friend, the honourable member for Mallee, in what I believe to be a retrograde move, that cannot improve our standing and prestige witb the Australian public to tbink big and act in a give them the appropriate lead.

56,Mr Dean (Robertson) [11.2],"ThisbiU under discussion sets out the way in which the extra taxation on petrol will be distributed. It has been made clear during this discussion that of the additional 3d. tax a gallon, Id. will be expended upon roads and 2d. will go into Consolidated Eevenue. Both inside und outside the House there have been various pleas and certain disagreements in connection with the manner in which this extra 3d. should be used. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr say that the majority of Australians bear Calwell), who has just resumed his seat, speaking on behalf of his colleagues, made a plea that has found favour outside this House as well. He asked that the whole of the 3d. a gallon be expended npon roads. One of the most popular statements made is that as petrol tax is a tax solely npon motorists it should be used solely for the construction of new roads and the maintenance of existing ones. Those wbo argue in this way entirely overlook the fact that whereas the tax was first introduced in 1902 no grant was made for road construction and maintenance until 1923. Honourable members will resume their seats and maintain silence. honourable member reading. The honourable member for Werriwa bas no right to reflect on another bonorable member. Every honourable member has the right to express his opinion. been overlooked is that although, under this bill, only Id. a gallon is to be devoted to roads, the other 2d., which is to be paid into Consolidated Eevenue, will be used to finance State public works; and we in this place know only too well the assistance that has been increasingly given by tbe Commonwealtb to the States over recent years, but especially during this Government's regime. If honourable members need any reminder of this fact, it is provided in the statement which the Premier of New South Wales is reported this morning to have made in regard to the extent to which transport generally in his State has now deteriorated. So there we have two very major reasons why all the money collected from the petrol tax should not be spent on roads. There is a third one which I think is even more important than the two that I have stated. It is this: Well over 65 per cent, of the petrol used in Australia is used by commercial vehicles, and it has been made quite clear that the tax is passed on to the consuming public by the carriers. Therefore, it is true to the burden of petrol tax. Not all Australians use the roads; .some have no cars. Therefore, as payers of the tax, it is fair that they should receive in return for tbeir contributions, some benefits by way of other public works and increased amenities. The other matter to which I should like to refer is this: The suggestion is often made that the Commonwealth should take over the responsibility for constructing and maintaining roads throughout Australia. However, it is not just a matter of tbe Commonwealth taking over the responsibility for roads any more than it is a matter of the Commonwealth just taking over any other responsibility such as education or hospitals. No doubt honourable members have had such a suggestion put to them from time to time. It should be realized that the Commonwealth cannot just take over these functions and services. Under the Constitution, the States may voluntarily hand over the powers, or the Commonwealth may gain them by means of a referendum. I think it is true to say that the only reason why theso requests are made for the Commonwealth to take over these services and responsibilities is that the States bave met with such a. disaster in their administration of those services. Merely because the States have made a mull of it is not a good basic reason for the Commonwealth to take over extra responsibility. When these matters are ' being discussed I think we ought to give due thought to where We stand because, on each occasion that the Commonwealth takes over a responsibility of the States, another nail is driven into the coffin of federalism.

Honourable members may recall that I introduced this topic by saying that it was one of the matters which could be dealt with by way of conference, and as an encouragement to the States. Australia as a whole has a responsibility for the maintenance and extension of roads. Although r a i l transport is suitable for carrying certain goods, the tonnage passing over the roads w ill increase greatly. B y "" tonnage "" I do not mean only the quantity of goods carried; I mean the weight of the goods, plus that of the vehicles. Consequently, in the planning of new roads, due consideration must be given to providing roads that will be capable of carrying these heavier loads. My final plea is that, in view of all these factors, the Commonwealtli should take the lead and encourage thc States to accept their f u l l , individual responsibilities. every part of Australia, in the cities and in the country, problems and difficulties have been created as a result of the increase in volume of motor traffic.

The question now is whether the entire proceeds of the 3d. a gallon tax increase shall be paid to the States, or only one-third of it. The committee is invited to decide whether the States should get the whole of that money, or whether the Commonwealth should retain £8,000,000 of the £12,000,000 so collected, and use it for ordinary budgetary purposes. I repeat, the Government could very easily give the £8,000,000 to the States, and recoup its loss at the expense of the defence vote, economical if they were. They are being not all of which will probably be spent in any case. Only in one year, when the budget estimate'was £200,000,000, did that happen, and in that year £215,000,000 was spent. Evidence given the other day before the Public Accounts Committee revealed that a high-ranking public servant had been asked to increase the defence estimate by £9,000,000 so as to bring the total up' to £200,000,000.

More and more people are using motor transport and therefore we must have more and better highways. Not all our manufactures and primary products are-carried around our coast in vessels, or on our railways, although it would be very much more largely carried on the roads which, in many instances, are breaking up under the tremendous loads that pass over them. Indeed, if , ultimately, there is a coordinated roads plan and the Commonwealtb, as a result of constitutional amendment, accepts some of the responsibility, it might be necessary to force a number of tbese very heavy transports off the roads.

The second thing I want to say is that I consider this debate, as conducted by the Opposition, to be not only irresponsible but also fantastic in the light of what bas been done in relation to the imposition of this additional 3d. a gallon tax on petrol. I shall state tbe position as I see it, and I think that this taxation to be devoted to roads. I remind is the logical view to take. The Government presented to the Parliament an economic statement which called for certain increases of taxation for tbe purposes referred to in tbe economic statement. described in that statement. Honourable members will remember that I dealt with this matter yesterday. Those purposes were set out perfectly clearly and were, on the one side, to prevent tbe growth of inflation, and on the otber side, to provide finance with which to carry out public works in the various States. One of the matters referred to in the economic statement was this increased tax on petrol. As I say, the economic statement referred to the need to dampen down the importation from overseas of petrol and oils, the value of which had reached the colossal total of £100,000,000 a year, and also to the need to .raise money for State public works. That economic statement was the subject of a division in this chamber, and it that it is fantastic for tbe matter to be was approved by the Parliament. Tbat is why I say that this discussion is fantastic. The Parliament already has approved of the imposition of this additional tax of 3d. a gallon on petrol. In the light of that, where is the need for all the discussion that we have heard yesterday afternoon, and again to-day, about what should or sbould not be done with this tax on petrol? It is altogether wrong that such a discussion should be taking place about the needs of our roads. No one is denying the needs of the road systems of Australia. I pointed out yesterday that this Government has done a magnificent job in that respect, and that its efforts have been far greater than it would have increased the petrol tax by those of any previous government. There is no need for me to repeat the figures in relation to the allocations for roads purwould honourable members opposite have poses made by this Government. We have to deal with this specific measure which proposes to provide addithe generosity of its heart, and because of its recognition of the position of Australia's roads, the Government provided, in the economic statement, for this one isolated item by allocating part of the additional revenue for a specific purpose. In the economic statement, provision was made for £4,000,000 of the additional the committee that the other £8,000,000 of the total sum of £12,000,000 already has been committed to the purposes If the amendment were adopted and the £S,000,000 also were used for roads purposes, it would mean that the Government would have to provide another £8,000,000, from other sources, for the purposes referred to in the economic statement, and that would be diametrically opposed to the principles underlying that statement which, I again remind honourable members opposite, has been approved by this Parliament. It would mean that that additional £8,000,000 of new money would be pumped into an already inflationary economy and, to that extent, would defeat tbe very purposes underlying the economic statement. That is why I say that this is an irresponsible amendment and wby I think debated on tbe basis that we are debating it. The Government can have no truck with this amendment at all. We might bave been saved all this unnecessary talk. When I say that, I do not mean that the matters that have been discussed are unworthy of discussion. The Government appreciates, as I appreciate-and no doubt every other bonorable member does too-jus t how necessary it is to develop our road systems, but what I am trying to say to the committee is that that subject has no connection at all with' the bill that we are now discussing. Tf. for instance, the Government were seeking only to provide money for roads, no doubt Id. a gallon, so that there would have been only £4,000,000 available. What said then?

I think that the remarks that I have made also appertain to the other forecasted amendments. I suggest to the committee that it is not possible to deal with this additional £8,000,000, over and above the £4,000,000, in any other way than that provided for in tbe economic statement. That is perfectly clear. think that the other amendment is irresponsible too? any amendment that proposes to take this matter out of its context in the economic statement already approved by the Parliament is completely out of order and quite wrong. SoI suggest to you, Mr The elimination of the difficulty caused Temporary Chairman, that there sbould be no further discussion about this matter, because tbe chamber has already approved of it. Further discussion would be only idle words and an effort to make the public believe that this Government should accept tbe amendment as a means to improve roads, when, in fact, the £8,000,000 is not available for that purpose at all. listened with attention to the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer). In effect, he said that the object of this taxation is America to endeavour to get American to reduce the consumption of petrol. I remember that wben this Government came into power, petrol was rationed. In order to increase the consumption of petrol, the Government abolished the rationing. If the Government desires merely to reduce the consumption of petrol and ration it by means of its economic plan, there is a just and obvious method by which to do so. Do it by the system of direct rationing, but do not do it by the method of increasing the price of petrol! By increasing the price, certain sections of the community are disadvantaged compared with other sections. Those wbo use petrol for tbe purpose of industry are disadvantaged compared with the wealthy people who use petrol for ordinary pleasure transport. An bonorable member on this side of the House asks, by interjection, "" ""Why raise money merely from a tax on motor vehicle owners ?"" That, of course, is a legitimate objection to the proposition put forward by the Government. This is sectional taxation. If the Government wishes to raise a certain amount of money for general purposes, then the revenue should be raised from every section of the community in proportion to the ability to pay. If , however, the Government raises money from the motor industry, then that money should be used to remove the difficulties that exist in every part of Australia as a result of increased motor transport. Every city of Australia has bottlenecks that are unable to carry the motor traffic. Melbourne has Sydney-road, Chapel-street, and other main roads that are unable to cope with the volume of motor transport. by traffic congestion is a legitimate charge upon the motor transport of this country, if millions of pounds are raised by taxation, portion of it should be used to get rid of the bottlenecks in metropolitan and sub-metropolitan areas throughout Australia. In Victoria, there is the necessity to roof the Jolimont railway yards, mainly because of difficulties created by motor transport. ""What a humiliating position! Not only every Victorian but every Australian was embarrassed wben the Premier of Victoria announced that he was going to business interests to roof tbe Jolimont yards in the City of Melbourne. Millions and millions of pounds are collected in taxation from motor transport, upon which it is a legitimate charge, but the money is being used for other purposes. There is a reason why the whole, and not a portion, of the moneys that are being raised in this way should be devoted to the elimination of traffic problems and the extension and improvement of our road system. As a result of the congestion in city areas and the narrow roads in country districts, hundreds of people are being maimed and killed",22,Pairs

75,Mr Peters (Scullin) [11.46],"Iannually. To relieve that tragic position is an obligation that rests upon motor transport. If motor transport pays the money and foots the bill to the -Government, and this Government -diverts that money to other purposes, then this Government is responsible for all those difficulties that confront the people of this nation arising from traffic problems. It bas been said here that roads are needed in the north of Australia, in New Guinea and in the islands to the north of Australia for defence purposes. All those things are left unattended by a government that diverts millions and millions of pounds that are directly raised from the motor industry to relieve the wealthy of their proportion of taxation that should be paid, and should be collected by the Government on the basis of ability to pay. This Government, of course, will never do that. It was always the instrument of sectional and monopolistic interests and it still remains their servile servant to-day. I believe that vast motor industries in this country are not adversely affected by the proposition of the Government. While motor transport is being inequitably taxed, those interests are being relieved in their individual taxation assessments of vast amounts of money that legitimately should be raised from them to serve the Government's present purposes. I have nothing further to say, except to reiterate that, as the Ministhe tax one day longer than is necessary, ter for the Army said, our words are absolutely wasted on the Government. However, we speak not to the Government but to the people of this country and we draw their attention to the actions of a government that should never have been put in charge of the treasury bench. opposed to this amendment because I believe and hope that this additional petrol tax will not remain in force a day longer than is necessary. The economic situation apparently demanded the collection of extra money, and this was a means of raising it. Nobody will convince me that, if the States are given additional money out of the extra tax, when that tax is removed-as I hope will be very soon-w e shall be able to say to the States, ""We are very sorry; the tax has now disappeared and you no longer can have the extra money"". On that ground alone it is very undesirable for any one to vote for this amendment. The additional tax that the Government will impose Mr Clark interjecting, The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member for Darling is not making a speech. porary Chairman. I do not think I need his help at the moment, but if I do I will call on bim. Tbe additional tax that the Government has imposed must increase the cost of transport, and nobody will imagine that because of this additional tax less petrol will be used. I have never found that to be so. Thefiguresfor sales of petrol do not reveal that in any way. Quite clearly, we need the extra money that is being raised by this additional tax. Let us be quite frank about it. We need it for the States, because we cannot raise sufficient by loans. Tbis is one means of raising that money; and it is a temporary tax. Tbe additional tax on petrol will force up tbe cost of transport, and Australia is so dependent on road transport that the higher tax must increase tbe cost of living. Therefore, I hope that this Government will not retain because I do not believe it will achieve what it set out to do, beyond raising extra money. It must inevitably add to tbe cost of transport. It must add to the cost of primary production, to the cost of food and goods and everything else which comes into or goes out of the country. I believe that this problem must be tackled in a wide' field. The amount of money which is necessary for roads is staggering. A very good report was prepared by the Australian Transport Advisory Council, comprising State and Commonwealth Transport Ministers, wbicb meets once or twice a year. The council thrashed out this problem. I think it is one of the most successful Commonwealth-State organizations.",23,Pairs

Mr Duthie interjecting,. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN"" Order! The honourable member for Wilmot must remain silent,. me for a moment, he might learn something. Advisory Council has the assistance of road-making experts, and it states in one of its most valuable reports that on main roads alone the expenditure of another £301,000,000 is necessary, and that it is unable to arrive at an assessment of the expenditure necessary on secondary roads. The report states that interminable additional funds are necessary beyond the £442,000,000 which will be spent by local government bodies during the next ten years. £1,000,000,000 is necessary for expenditure on roads during that period. We cannot conjure up money or raise loans of this magnitude. We cannot divert sufficient funds from taxation to make available this staggering amount. therefore suggest that the Government should seriously examine the possibility of raising this money overseas. It has been very successful already in raising funds overseas. It should raise loans in countries which specialize in the production of heavy earth-moving equipment suitable for road-making, and induce large road-making contracting firms to follow this foreign money to Australia, to bring in materials, man-power and know-how, and get on with the job. We are so far behind in the construction and maintenance of highways and secondary roads that a major concerted effort is necessary, such an effort as was made by the Government in connection witb the Snowy Mountains scheme. The success of that scheme exemplifies the benefit to tractors and, where necessary, material, and proceeding quickly with the job. There are large road construction firms in Italy, France, the United States of America and Germany, which could bring in their teams and suoh materials as are in short supply here. For the most part in this country we have adequate road-making materials. The real suggest that the Government examine this suggestion, because to raise a. little money is merely to scratch the problem. We know what the problem is. A bold attack is needed. Let the Government proceed to raise money overseas, as this matter is of great national importance. [12.0] -The Opposition is acting very consistently in proposing this amendment. The Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer) stated that the Parliament approved the Government's economic statement, and so approved the application of the proceeds of this additional tax in the manner wbicb the Government desires. I wish to say that we on this side of the chamber did not approve of it. If the Minister meant the honourable So at least member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), or if he was referring to any one else who voted in favour of accepting the statement, he is quite in order, but we on this side of tbe chamber did not approve, and we are now trying to I remedy what we believe to be the wrong course taken by the Government in imposing a sectional tax. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Howse) mentioned tlie amount of money that is needed for expenditure on roads, and be said that the small amount involved in this additional tax would not go very far. He said, further, that the Government should borrow money overseas in order to build roads. Does be believe that that suggestion can be taken seriously?

81,The Australian Transport Mr Thompson (Port Adelaide),"wrong to believe that the adoption of this suggestion would overcome our difficulties. I contend that to impose on the motorist whether 3d., lOd. or ls. is adequate, but an additional petrol tax of 3d. a gallon is to engage in sectional taxation. The motorist is the man who has been hardest hit in the Government's endeavours to raise extra money for revenue purposes. In addition to tbe proposed increased tax of 3d., we sliould remember the burden which has been imposed on the motorist in the form of sales tax. It is wrong that the Government sbould say to tbe motorist, "" You must pay an extra 2d. a gallon in order to make up the amount of money which we need for general purposes "". Petrol and motoring involve tremendous nnancial expenditure by the States. Let us consider the polioe forces. In Victoria, New South ""Wales and South Australia, proposals have been made that special road patrols of plain-clothes men sbould be used in order to prevent motorists from travelling at excessive speeds and to make tbe roads safer. Accidents resulting from motoring dous costs. We say that if more of the proceeds of this additional tax were diverted to the States-the 3d. instead of tbe Id -the y could use some of it to police tbe roads, to improve bospital services, and in other fields which are controlled by the States. We are not acting irresponsibly. We are not acting as persons who are not prepared to accept the responsibility which we should accept in the National Parliament. I , for one, agree with the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) that the Commonwealth should not be the sole source of revenue for expenditure on roads, but I do believe that if we impose a tax on road users the proceeds should be used for road purposes. I agree that our own late leader and others have said over the years that the petrol tax is not intended solely to raise money for roads, but that does not prove that this Government is following the correct procedure in this matter. It does not mean that the man who is using the roads sbould be fair game and tbe subject of extra charges in order to meet the ordinary expenditure of the country. member retain this tax? prohibitive rates of petrol tax would be necessary to provide £1,000,000,000 for road purposes. I contend that the Government, instead of imposing a tax on petrol, whether it be at a rate of up to LOd. a gallon, sbould have evolved a reasonable scheme for taxing those persons who are destroying the roads. I refer to tbose wbo are using big transports. The diesel trucks are doing the greatest damage to our roads. The bonorable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn). stated that on any day of tbe week more than 400 big motor transports use the Hume Highway. I do not know whether that is correct. is suggesting tbe imposition of a State tax. a tax on distillate. I am not speaking of higher registration fees, which the involve hospitals in tremenowners of heavy transports should also pay. I contend that the owner of a big motor truck should pay a commensurately higher ""registration fee than the owner of a motor car. However, I am directing my attention to the fuel that is used in vehicles. As we know, the owners of diesel-operated vehicles, which are doing great damage to the roads, pay practically no tax on the fuel tbey consume. The Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) made what I considered to be an audacious statement when he said that about 70 per cent, of tbe petrol used in this country was used for commercial purposes, and that the owners of commercial vehicles would pass on the additional tax on the petrol consumed in those vehicles. That means that the additional tax will be passed on to the buyers of goods. The Opposition believes that if the Government wants additional revenue for general purposes, it should collect the money by taxation imposed equitably on all sections of the community. If it wants additional money for roads, it should say so straight out, and impose taxation for that purpose on petrol and the fuel used by the heavy vehicles which are destroying the roads.",25,Pairs

85,Mr Thompson,"I am speaking ofMuch 'has been said about defence roads. I do not think that big hauliers and commercial travellers should be allowed, without making an adequate contribution to the cost of road maintenance, to use the roads excessively in order to make big incomes while the cost of constructing and maintaining certain roads that are regarded as defence projects is defrayed from general revenue and the railways are run at a loss. We must remember that although roads are constructed for defence purposes, there might not be another war for 30 years. En the meantime, certain people make a lot of money by using those roads for commercial purposes. Let us not tangle up this general question of roads with defence. When we impose a tax on petrol, let the proceeds of tbe tax be given to the States to construct and maintain the roads. I do not want to be misunderstood in this matter. £ do not think that the whole of the cost of roads should be borne from the proceeds of the petrol tax. I believe that the States sbould collect revenue on an equitable basis from those who use the roads and sbould use it to meet some of tbe cost involved. The Labour party is not inconsistent when it rejects the proposition that the petrol tax sbould be increased in order to avoid a cash deficit. Wben tbe financial statement was being debated, we said that we would not support an increase of the petrol tax for that purpose, but that we thought it would be preferable for the Government to increase income tax in accordance with the principle of ability to pay. We made it clear that Ave did not think that a sectional tax sliould be imposed in order to bolster general revenue. [32.81 I think there is a lot to be said for tbe principle of allocating all the addiopinion. I do not think that we should, tional proceeds of this tax to roadsa great dpal. They aro not conclusive arguments, for certain reasons that I shall give in a momrnt, but they are objective arguments, and there is something in the proposition. As the committee knows, the Commonwealth's receipts from excise come mainly from drink, tobacco and petrol. Petrol is rather different from the other two, because they are objects of final consumption and they do not, perhaps, give anything more than personal satisfaction, whereas petrol does enter into the cost of various commodities. There is a logical distinction there. It is, I think, quite reasonable that we should endeavour to balance the transport system by allocating to the improvement of capital facilities the proceeds of taxation that we levy on any section of tbe community. That seems to me to be not entirely unreasonable. It might be saidand said with reason-that some petrol is used for pleasure motoring only, as indeed it is, and that it does not enter into costs; but I remind the committee that the Government does retain from the existing tax-befor e the new impostsome part of the proceeds to cover that part of petrol consumed which is pure consumption and does not enter into other production. Having said that, let me say that I think there are, in the amendment before the committee, difficulties to which attention has been directed by other speakers. First, the Government has announced that this is a temporary, not a permanent, impost. We should be taking steps to pay the money, not to the States as part of the normal road allocations, thus giving the procedure a character of permanency, but into a special fund which could be used for the specific purpose of road building, so that it would not be regarded as a recurring amount upon wbich the States would become dependent. In the second place, the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer), who was sitting at the table when the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) was addressing the committee, was perfectly correct in saying that there was an anti(Mackellar) inflationary element in this present financial measure. I agree entirely with that here and now, be paying this money away, because if we did so we would not bp serving the best interests of the road users, as there is a shortage of labour and materials at present. By putting it into a reserve fund for eventual expenditure on roads, those disabilities would not apply. I hope to traverse this aspect of the matter in more detail at a later stage of this debate, but just let me point out that",26,Pairs
86,Mr Wentworth,"whatever the honourable member for Port Adelaide may bave said, no charge of inconsistency can be brought against me personally because, during tbe debate on the economic statement, I indicated that while I approved of the statement as a whole, and would vote for it as a whole, I did disapprove of this particular part. I am in exactly the same position as a member wbo votes for the second reading of a bill and then supports a small amendment to one of the clauses when be has, in his speech on the motion for the second reading, foreshadowed that he would so vote. I thought that the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) was right to warn us that we should not allocate this money in such a way that it could be frittered away or used in subfrittered away on a number of small stitution for other moneys. We want to get more and better road construction. For that reason, I felt that his criticism as the right honourable member for Cowper of the amendment was soundly based, although I also felt that it did not apply to put first things first. in any degree at all to an amendment that I hope to have an opportunity to move later. It is true that the States could not be quickly geared for the expenditure of these extra moneys during this month and next month. If we were to give them extra money now, they would not, perhaps, be able to spend it-or , if they did, they would spend it wastefullyduring that period. I can only say what 1 have been told, because I have no personal knowledge of it. I believe that both Queensland and Western Australia have unexpended balances of road moneys. Tf that is so, tbere is no point in adding effect; but both honourable members have fuel to that particular fire. What we should do, rather, is to give them an opportunity to devise plans for more effective use of tbe funds that are availThey go so far as to acknowledge outable to them for expenditure on roads. I believe that this ties in with what the right honourable member for Cowper said. They should be given access to a pool of heavy road-making machinery, because if we are to get good value for the labour, materials and money that we put into our roads, we have to modernize the road-making plant throughout Australia. I believe that to get in a reserve the Opposition has very real virtue. In now that would enable us to get ahead of view of the obvious confusion that exists tbe plant game would make a great difference to the efficiency of the whole of our future highway construction programme. I feel that there are four factors which operate against this amendment, but I hope tbe House will forgive me for saying that I think none of them would operate against the amendment that I hope to move later. They are as follows:-First, the amendment cuts across the Government's anti-inflation plan; secondly, it does not take full cognizance of the fact that the petrol tax is a temporary tax; thirdly, the States are not necessarily ready to spend the money in the best possible way; and, fourthly-and this applies to the remarks of the honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn) last nigbt-w e do not want this money to be works. We sbould restore some sense of proportion to our roads programme, and, reminded us a few minutes ago, we need Mr R. W. HOLT (Darebin) [12.16] The remarks of bonorable members opposite during the debate on the amendment have revealed a very wide disparity in their conception of the Government's motive in imposing this tax. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Howse) has alleged that it is purely a revenue measure, .and the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), in supporting the statement of the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer), has alleged that it has. been designed to control inflation and that it is anti-inflationary in its stressed the need for the expenditure of the increased revenue, which, of course, would not have an anti-inflationary effect. right that it is being treated by the Government as a means of raising revenue. There has been an amazing degree of conflict about the purpose of this measure, and it seems to be agreed on both sides of the House that its objective of assisting to halt inflation will not be achieved. Tbe amendment that bas been moved by in the minds of the Government and its supporters about the reason for this tax, it than to withdraw the measure even at would be fitting for the Government to withdraw the bill and, in the light of the constructive criticism that has been advanced, not only by the Opposition, but also by supporters of the Government, to review the incidence of the formula, which, I think, is at the basis of the trouble. HereI am on common ground witb the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), who has forecast an amendment which I do not think goes far enough. I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) that we cannot look at this matter from a parochial viewpoint. It is well known that the formula, which was drawn up during the last war, will not do justice to Victoria until at least 1958. Another example of tbe present ineffectiveness of the formula-condition s have changed radically since its inception-is the fact that, if Victoria were to increase its registration fees, in effect it would not obtain increased revenue because, under the formula, the amount paid to that State would be reduced. Only as time goes by shall we see tbe Victorian Governinent looking with any hopefulness at the question of increasing registration fees. The matter was considered in 1953, but the main reason for its rejection was that the return would be offset by a reduction of tbe amount payable under the formula. In otber words, it was a question of robbing Peter to pay Paul. No doubt by 1958, wben a formula, which automatically adjusts these injustices, comes into operation, we can expect a move along these lines to be made, I point out to tbe honourable member for Mallee that the formula operates unjustly against mainly because of the action of previous governments. I repeat that, in view of the confusion, tbe contradictions and the innocent misrepresentation of honourable members opposite, and in view of tbe very salient reasons that have been advanced by Opposition members, the Government would be displaying its bigness if it were asked the question-""Why not re-introto say, "" Yes, we admit that the measure is not perfect and that it can be improved "". It would be acting in keeping with the principles of parliamentary R -[86 ] democracy if it were to do nothing less this late hour, and, having regard to the criticisms of its own supporters and the case put forward by the Opposition, reconsider it constructively. The honourable member for Darebin( Mr It. W. Holt) is very well known for bis independence of thought and action. I was delighted to hear bim say that he supports my contention about what I regard as being an injustice, and that be supports the amendment that I shall move. Mr R. W. HOLT I did not say that. member has indicated that he is opposed to the formula under wbich the petrol tax is distributed. As my amendment will seek to strike a blow at that formula, it is only natural that any logical thinker would conclude that, when I force a divisionI will do so, if I can-w e shall see the honourable member for Darebin again display his independence of action and not allow himself to be controlled by tbe Labour caucus. Mr R. W. HOLT -Tb e bonorable member's proposed amendment does not mention tbe formula. what the honourable member will do. I listened very intently to the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson). He said that he disapproved of the economic statement wbich foreshadowed an increase of the petrol tax but that, to make the best of the situation, the Opposition had moved an amendment to provide that all the money should be allocated to road purposes. He further Victoria said-and I wrote down his words to avoid misquoting him-""We are greatly opposed to sectional taxation"". As be spoke, he waved his arm as though to indicate that bis remarks embraced all tbe members of the Opposition, including the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns), whom I heard ask recentlyand other Labour members have repeatedly duce the land tax ?""

Petrol tax is becoming less sectional since workers drive to their place of employment, but land tax, on the other band, is a very sectional tax. Therefore, the statement of the honourable member for Port Adelaide that the Opposition is opposed to a sectional tax, does not carry very much weight. I , of course, am going to oppose thia amendment and I think it is only right that I should give my reason. I do not believe in adding to an injustice. If I were sure that, the £12,000,000 would be distributed according to tbe formula contained in the amendment I propose to move, I would give consideration to supporting the amendment now before the committee. carried the distribution of the £12,000,000 come into this Parliament and tell us will only tend towards increasing the evil that will be brought ahout by the present formula. Of course, we know that Western Australia is up in arms about the formula.

No more justification exists for building a bridge in metrome, "" Will you support it ?"" My answer politan Perth from the fund than for building a bridge like the Sydney Harbour bridge. It should be paid for out of loan money. It is appropriate that rhe Narrows should come into this discussion because there is no doubt that the attitude of Western Australia is a narrow, parochial one, and the name is very appropriate. I desire to say a few words about the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr honourable member for Melbourne has Calwell), who moved this amendment. What be said is beyond my comprehension and I cannot encompass his mode of thinking at all. Both the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters) and the honourable member for Melbourne talked about city roads all the time. The honourable member for Melbourne used two expressions-""If one travels on the highways"" and "" If one views the roads from the air"". Fancy viewing roads from the air! Has any one ever heard such rot as that? He said that a number of earth roads can be seen from the air. Perhaps city men do not know that a good earth road is often better than a bad bitumen road. As far as the great wide open spaces of Victoria or Western Australia are concerned, the knowledge of the honourable member for Melbourne, wbo is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this House, starts when be steps off a footpath to get into a government car and ends when he makes a jaunt along a highway on a Sunday afternoon, or perhaps wben he makes a trip to some other capital, keeping on the highway all the time. I am interested in outback roads where a school bus might run. I am not concerned all the time with city roads. It is high time that the honourable member for Melbourne got out of bis aeroplane and got down to earth, because roads are built not in the air but If this amendment is on the earth. It is ridiculous for him to about the state of our roads after he has looked at them from an aeroplane and then move an amendment as he has done. I think I can be excused when I say it is beyond my comprehension to understand that type of thinking. Under no consideration would I support this amendment. As a matter of fact I think it is quite open for me to say that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) said to to him was, "" Will you support my amendment?"" He wanted to have onesided co-operation. Mr R. W. HOLT -What did the Leader of the Opposition say? I do not know whether that will influence the honourable member for Darebin or not.

Of course, a very important point is that the money is being raised by special taxation for a special purpose. Because of that the Government has a very strong case for voting against the amendment. I will vote against the amendment and, at a later stage, I hope to have the opportunity to move the amendment which has been distributed in my name; and I hope that all the independent thinkers in this Parliament, and all honourable members from Victoria, will vote for it.

This policy was enunciated by the transport committee of the Labour party, of which.

Neither is the honourable member for Mallee( Mr nected with the defence of Australia. Turnbull) who talks with one voice one. moment and with another the nen.t. The Labour party believes that all of this £12,000,000 should be given to the States, making a total of £46,000,000 in the next financial year. The amendment that has been moved is in keeping with the national road policy of the Labour party, which was the first party to make roads a part of national policy, and ono of the planks of a platform.

The honourable member for Mackellar is not the first to enunciate this principle; it was enunciated by the Labour party late last year and, as I have said, became part of its general election programme. We are supporting the amendment for two reasons, first, because it is our policy that all petrol tax should be devoted to roads; and, secondly, because it is in keeping with tbe Labour party's national road plan for Australia. Of course, we would give to the States complete autonomy in deciding which roads should be constructed each year. We would recommend to the States that they draw up a priority road plan over a period of five years. We would recommend that a part of the plan should be implemented each year in each State, that the States sbould carry out the work aud that the Commonwealth should provide the money, from both the petrol tax revenue and the defence vote.

The Australian Transport Advisory Council has calculated, on some basis, that we should spend £1,000,000,000 on roads. What is the use of having an advisory council to give advice to tbe Government, if the Government does not take any notice of its advice ? This council should be sacked immediately. All that it does is to gather certain information and pass that information on to the Government, which then does nothing about it, other than to file or pigeon-hole the documents by which the information is communicated. The council has suggested that ive spend £1,000,000,000 on roads. What is the Government doing to give effect to that suggestion? There is no hope that a scheme of that magnitude will be brought to fruition, unless we devise a national roads plan. At present, it is merely a waste of time and paper for the council to put forward suggestions of that kind. Tbe TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! Tbis is not a second-reading debate. not intend to give effect to such ideas. Under Labour's scheme, £560,000,000 could be made available for roads in ten years, without direct or indirect taxation being increased by Id. There would be no need to borrow money from overseas. The entire proceeds of the petrol tax should be allocated to roads. An allocation of £46,000,000 a year for ten years would amount to £460,000,000. Roads are vital to defence. If £10,000,000 of the defence vote were allocated to roads each year or ten years, that would bring f in another £100,000,000. In that way, £560,000,000 could be raised for roads purposes in ten years, without increasing taxes by Id. or borrowing from overseas. The honourable member for Calare has talked about borrowing from overseas first sight, Mr Temporary Chairman, at a high rate of interest in order to get the amendment moved by the Opposition £1,000,000,000 to finance a roads programme. Honourable members on this side have been told that they should come down to earth in this matter. In view of what I have just said, it would appear that it is the supporters of the Government who should come down to earth and tell the Australian people just bow they propose to tackle this tremendous national problem. The press of Australia agrees with Labour's scheme almost to-shal l I say? -a column or a letter. The press supports a national roads plan. It is about time that the Government woke up. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) said yesterday that it was a Rip Van Winkle Government. I think that was an excellent summing-up of its performances.

I feel that I am entitled to put my viewpoint to the committee. During the next financial year, £46,000,000 will be raised by tbe petrol tax, of which £32,000,000 will be allocated for roads. So, 66 per cent, of tbe petrol tax revenue will be devoted to roads in future. Last year, £34,000,000 was raised by the petrol tax, of which £28,000,000-o r 77 per c e n t was allocated to roads. So the result of the operation of this bill will be to reduce, by 11 per cent, of the total, the proportion of the petrol tax revenue which is allocated to roads. The Opposition has moved its amendment in the hope that the Government wiil accept its responsibility to Australia in respect of roads.",31,Pairs

102,Mr Downer (Angas) [12.40],"A twauld command a good deal of sympathy, at any rate from those who represent eountry electorates-and there are many in the Liberal party. The difficulties of maintaining Australian roads have been voiced frequently in this chamber over the years that I have been sitting here. Every time a measure of this kind has come up for discussion, heart-felt complaints have been made about the comparatively appalling state of our national . highways and, even more, about the feeder roads system in every part of the Commonwealth. As my friend, the honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn) most sensibly pointed out last nigbt, it is incontestable that, with the increasing volume of road transport and the development of commercial road traffic, what ought to be the great national routes are declining steadily in condition month by month, and very little indeed is being done to improve subsidiary roads. So far as I am aware, the amendment moved by the Opposition has been supported by quite a number of local governing bodies. One can well understand their concern in this respect. But the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer), speaking for the Government earlier this morning, stated very concisely the crux of the objection to what honourable members opposite are proposing. He said, iir, that this bill is just one facet of the Government's supplementary budget. If the amendment is carried, this £12,000,000 will have to be raised elsewhere. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), suggested that we should lop £10,000,000 from the defence vote. He rather thought that that would not be spent in the current financial year. I am strongly opposed to any cutting of the defence vote in the circumstances of danger and difficulty in which we find ourselves in the world to-day. The fact that the whole of tbe defence moneys was not spent in a previous year is no premise for saying that the total sum allocated, £190,000,000, will not be spent this year. C think that it will be spent. I hope that honourable members generally, irrespective of tbe usual party divisions, will be opposed, on grounds of national security, to any diminution of tbe defence vote at the present time. R -[87 ] Other honourable members opposite may suggest a more socialistic approach to this matter. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) bas given us the benefit of his views on fiscal questions from time to time during the sliort period he has been in the House. If I interpret his words and his thoughts correctly, he would say that the answer would be to increase direct taxation-incom e tax, land tax-the re-imposition of which be bas suggested-estat e duty, death duties generally and gift duty. I noted with great interest those suggestions of his, because we on this side differ so emphatically from him on that point. Sitting suspended from 12.1,5 to 2.15 p.m. was so cruelly interrupted by the suspension, the points I was trying to make were, briefly, that I expressed sympathy with the amendment put forward 6y the Opposition, but at the same time. I gave it as my opinion, supporting the Minister for the Army, that if the amendment were adopted by the committee it would strike at the architecture of the Government's supplementary budget. It would certainly, to some degree, lead to a re-casting of the .Government's proposals. In any case, I have long felt that a far more radical approach is needed to the whole of this roads problem than what the Opposition has put forward to-day, and for that matter what the Government is advancing, too. We are arguing in this committee, in effect, about the way we are going to allocate to the States £31,000,000, in a full year, or £39,000,000. The sum of £8,000,000 is at issue. But I think all honourable members will agree-tbos e who have a real knowledge about the national and rural roads system-that this figure is trifling compared with the magnitude of money that requires to be spent on Australian roads if they are going to be made commensurate with tbose in other civilized countries of the world. Honourable members have devoted some of their attention to the question of how this very large .sum of money should be raised. I myself have long felt that we want to be thinking in terms of spending at least £100,000,000 a year",32,Pairs
103,Mr Downeb,"Before my speechon roads services, not something in the nature of £20,000,000, £30,000,000, or £40,000,000, if we are going to be serious in solving this problem. So we pass from that to the question of how this sum is to be raised. It is quite obvious that it woulcl be extremely difficult, and it woulcl not be advantageous to the economy, to raise it by direct taxation. That is, unless it became generally conceded that a very sharp increase in income tax was economically justified for that purpose. I do not believe that it would be. We then come to tbe next proposition, that tbe money should be raised by loan; and I say at once that I subscribe to it. But here again, if we look at the state of the internal loan market, it is perfectly obvious we are not going to raise a very large sum supplementary to what the Australian Loan Council is already engaged in doing for this purpose. We are simply deceiving ourselves and beating the air if we think we can. SoI was glad when my friend the honourable member for Calare( Mr Howse) this morning put forward an idea which has been adumbrated in these debates before, that we should lookabroad and see whether it is possible and practicable to raise overseas money for this purpose. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) dealt with the matter quite inadequately and unrealistically in scouting this suggestion. We bave had trouble in the past-sinc e the end of the war-in raising substantial overseas funds for the development of this country. One may perhaps take some hope from some of the activities not only of the world bank but of the United States Government in what they are doing for Asian countries. As we all know, the United States, by a most extraordinary spirit of generosity, is engaging in tremendous reconstruction and developmental tasks in various parts of East Asia. Considering the importance of Australia in the strategic scheme of things in thc Western democratic world, I do not think it should be beyond the bounds of possibility or reason to suggest that the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Eadden) should make an approach to the United States Government for financial assistance for the development of a great national road system in Australia so that in the future we can play an even better and more efficient part in the general planning of western democratic strategy, particularly in relation to our obligations and responsibilities in South-East Asia. But then merely to borrow money, even assuming through our advocacy that we can obtain it, is not enough. We have to obtain the man-power so that money and equipment we could buy in the lending country could be efficiently and expeditiously used. Again, I find myself in support of the ideas of tbe honourable member for Calare that we should bring in migrants for this purpose. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The bonorable member's time has expired. -On e thing upon which all honourable members agree is that there is a great need in this country for good roads. I am sure that we also agree that tbere is a need for a vast sum of money to be expended to bring about this desired state of affairs. Consequently, I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell). That amendment is at least practical, it is honest and it fairly faces up to the task that we have before us in the light of our present circumstances. I was rather astonished to learn how honourable members who have spoken about the need for money for roads would set about finding that money. Many of tbem who realize the great need for money would apparently refuse to accept the £8,000,000 which is available to-day to make a start on the tasks which lie before us. That attitude seems to need a considerable amount of explanation. The suggestion made that we should borrow money for the purposes of going ahead with our roads programme seems to me to be just so much talk, when one remembers that we have the necessary money at present in this country. I suggest that if the Government were prepared to practise economies in its administration, then considerably more money would be made available and thei-e would be no need for the Government to quibble about the",33,Pairs

That is the point I want to make, and I think it is important. If we are to develop this country, to increase its population, we must have better roads. It is little consolation to people in countryAnderson. C. Q. W. districts, who are often isolated because of storms and flooded rivers, to know that some hundreds of miles away there is a glorious highway on which city dwellers and others can speed at 80, 90 or 100 miles an hour if their vehicles are capable of those speeds. One of the important things about a road is that people can meet other people on it. They can go to town; they can take their children to school and their merchandise to market. Those things are important. I suggest that if we were to apply the sum of £8,000,000, which we are now discussing, and which the Government says should not be made available for road purposes, to the building of bridges in country districts, it would represent a substantial contribution to the development of Australia. I make these observations because I believe it is necessary that some forthright comment should be made in regard to tbose matters. The right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) asked whether it would be wise to make this money available to the States, because we do not know how they would spend it. We might as well ask ourselves whether it is wise to make available to the States the money which is being allocated to them, nnless we are thoroughly satisfied, and absolutely sure, that it is to be used for the well-being of Australia. I agree witb the honourable member for Melbourne that in this matter we have to be good Australians first. Tbe TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! Tbe honourable gentleman's time has expired.

That is tbe only way we can look at the matter. I have heard many people talking in the corridors of this building about the defence roads that are needed in both the east and the west of Australia. Eoads to Carnarvon and other places have been mentioned. You, Mr mula. The representatives of Queensland Temporary Chairman, know that provision is made in the federal aid roads grants for allocations for strategic roads. Therefore, the proper method of obtaining funds for defence roads is to move tnat the grant for strategic roads be increased. member move to that effect? want it done should move that it be done. Tbey sbould not, in order to defeat my amendment, advance arguments that bave no weight and no substance in fact. The honourable member for Melbourne bas said these defence roads. Surely a road required for Australia's defence' is a strategic road, and action should be taken in tbe right quarters to provide finance for it. Instead of taking action in the rigbt quarters, the honourable member has suggested that I am not an Australian but a Victorian. I speak in this Parliament this afternoon, first, as an Australian, and, secondly, as a Victorian. I referred earlier to the great productivity of Victoria, which produces primary produce worth 70s. an acre from 56,000,000 acres of land. I realize that we need strategic roads, but it is still true, as it was in Napoleon's day, that an army marches on its stomach. amusing to some honourable members. The 70s. worth of primary products produced from every acre of 56,000,000 acres of land in Victoria is vital to the defence and future progress of this great nation. Tbis production is one of the vital needs of the times, in spite of the great amusement that is evident in this chamber. Present conditions could not be foreseen in tbe days when the aid roads grants formula was introduced. Some honourable members say that Victoria is not suffering from an injustice; I say it is. If it is, how can the injustice be overcome? These matters concerning the formula are decided at conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers, at which there is always a majority of the States that receive most under the forand Western Australia always say that they take the great national view, but they are really concerned only about getting tbe money.

Whether the Victorian Premier belongs to the Australian Labour party, the Australian Country party, or tbe Liberal party, his case is rejected, no matter how legitimate it may be. Some bright soul, on one occasion, said, ""Why not put the matter to the House of Representatives ?"" I said, "" I shall do so, but I know what its fate will be "". Nevertheless, I am trying to get something done in a practical way to-day. Of all the matters that have been considered in this Parliament since federation, this is the only subject on which the House of Eepresentatives divides not on party lines but on State lines-althoug h not entirely on State lines, because some Victorians dare not vote against the wishes of the party to which they belong. That is how things stand to-day. No one can fairly complain that I have put my case with bias. I have exhibited no bias. It has been said that unexpended moneys from the aid roads grants are being retained in Western Australia for the construction of a bridge across the Narrows in Perth. There is no more justification for retaining aid roads funds of sheep. I am sure the people of Vicfor that purpose than there would have been for the retention of such funds to pay for the Sydney Harbour bridge. Such projects should be financed out of loan moneys. In order to speed Australia's progress, the money that some States cannot spend should be allocated to the States that can spend it. The Opposition does not wish to take up rhe time of the committee ou this amendment. Its views have been well stated already. The Australian Labour party does not consider that this is a party matter. Honovable members are free to express their own true views. As the representative of a Victorian electorate, and as tbe member for Melbourne, by the grace of God and the sturdy common sense of more than 50 per cent, of the voters in the electorate, I take a broad national view. worn thin. ber for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), has said that he is an Australian first and a Victorian second. The committee could be pardoned for believing that he did not put the position wholly correctly. He then retreated to the Napoleonic wars and told us that an army inarches on its stomach. I should like to bring bim a little more up to date with an allusion to the American Civil War of 1860 to 1865, in which General Eobert E. Lee decided he would fight for Virginia rather tban for the Union. Those of us who take the broad Australian view to-day are determined to save Australia, if they can, by what they do now, regardless of the possible temporary effect on the fortunes of individual States. The honourable member for Mallee, of course, says that he is not biased. I would say that he is only impartially prejudiced! He is certainly doing bis best to persuade himself that his remarks are both in accordance with the facts and in the national interest. No one knows better than he does that he will have very few supporters when the vote on this amendment is taken. When we separate tbe sheep from the goats, there will be a lot toria entirely support the formula that has been used over tbe years. They need some revision of it, and, when Victoria does the right thing by bringing its motor registration fees into line with the average of the fees of the other States, and by appropriating for road works all tbe money it receives from registration fees, Victorians can turn to this sole champion of reaction-thi s man who is not an up-to-date Victorian but a mid-Victorian-to champion their cause. Until that time arrives, let us get on with our business.

I take the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) to task for presenting the case for Victoria in a very wrong light. He should know as well as any one that if we take the actual expenditure on roads, examine where the money comes from and then calculate the amount Victoria is spending on its roads in comparison with the expenditure being incurred by other States for that purpose, we must realize that the Victorian population itself is making a magnificent contribution to the lifeline of roads in other parts of Australia. I propose citing ngures from the report published following the conference of the Australian Transport Advisory Council relating to expenditure on roads. The State with the largest expenditure is New South Wales with £25,861,000. Victoria comes next with £21,202,000, which compares favourably with New South Wales when we take the expenditure on a population basis. The expenditure in Queensland was £17,500,000, in South Australia £8,600,000, £5,700,000 and in Tasmania £4,100,000. Any one listening to the honourable member for Melbourne might be led to the conclusion that Victoria was not paying its share towards the financing of roads. Eirst of all, I present the case that, based from local government funds represents on its overall expenditure, Victoria has stood up as well as has any other State to its roads obligations. To assist it in this direction, it receives only 17.9 per cent, of its expenditure on roads from the Commonwealth Aid Roads Fund, as compared with 65.5 per cent, for Western Australia. There are two other sources from which the States obtain money for road-making. Tbe first is from State funds. Nobody can point the bone at Victoria in this connever, which would be used only by a nexion because, although Tasmania's expenditure from State funds is slightly higher than that of Victoria, I point out that Victoria, with 43.5 per cent., is very close to Tasmania's expenditure of 44.7 per cent, of its State funds for this purpose. Further down the line, we find that Western Australia's expenditure on roads from State funds is only 10.2 per cent., compared with Victoria's 43.5 per cent. In other words, Western Australia is spending only one-quarter the percentage Victoria is contributing to road construction from State funds. This, I believe, cuts across the federal system to some extent. After all, roads are still logically and constitutionally the responsibility of the States, despite the fact that the Australian Government, over the years, has gone out of its way to make these vast contributions to the road funds of the various States. AlthoughI believe in developing the outback areas as strongly as anybody else does, I have to look at the problem from the point of view of those hard working municipal councillors who are shouldering the burden in Victoria. I feel that these municipalities are making an indirect contribution to the roads in other parts of Australia. Therefore, we must look at what local government funds are being spent in the overall expenditure on roads. It is in this feature that Victoria outstrips every other State. Victoria's expenditure from local government funds amounts to 38.2 per cent, of its in Western Australia total expenditure, and that percentage is considerably higher than the figure in any other State. Taking the worse case again -that unfortunate State of Western Australia-w e find there that the expenditure 24.3 per cent, of the total spent on roads. This is only slightly over half the amount spent by Victoria. Tbe remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne are most unfair and unjust to his own State. Further, if we are to look at this question from the defence angle and suggest that it is more reasonable to develop a heavy-duty road system within the highly settled defence production area than to build roads across tbe neverfew kangaroos and emus, my mind goes back to the time during the last war when I was in North Africa. There the magnificent road running along the north coast west from Alexandria was destroyed so that it could not be used by the enemy. That is the type of thing that must be considered in these matters. I do not wish to take up any more of the time of the committee. I have put the case for Victoria to the hest of my ability. The glimmer of light that was obviously in the mind of the honourable member for Melbourne when he said perhaps there is a case for a revision of the formula was, I believe, the real activating force behind the honourable member for Mallee in moving his amendment. If we can bring these facts to the notice of the public of Australia, 1 am confident that there are sufficient fair-minded people in those States which are perhaps receiving more than their share of the road funds, who would be prepared to have a revision of the formula, a revision which, I believe, is being pushed along its first step by this amendment. The speeches of the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) and the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr going to pursue a policy of abstract jusMackinnon) have a very familiar ring to me, coming from ""Western Australia, because to my mind tbey are secessionism in reverse. In my childhood, I was brought up on the fear of the grievances of ""Western Australia under federation. Now, since the adoption of uniform taxation and other similar expedients, we have the grievances of Victoria within the federation expressed in very similar terms. The arguments of the honourable member for Mallee and the honourable member for Corangamite logically presuppose that taxes ought to be spent where they are raised. That is the logic they are adopting. ""We can extend that without alluding to the other consequences of federation, if we like. The tariff policy of the Commonwealth, for instance, has concentrated secondary industries in New South ""Wales and Victoria. It has concentrated, therefore, the Tbe expenditure is"" £56,000,000 and the highest incomes in New SouthW ales and Victoria. The trade position as between tbe west and the east, the last time. I looked at it, was that Western Australia bought £70,000,000 worth of goods from the eastern States and sold back £19,000,000 worth; and we balance through London. In other words, the relationship of Western Australia to the industrialized east is exactly identical with that of New Zealand to Australia. If it had not been for the tariff policy and a lot of other fiscal provisions, Western Australia, no doubt, would have been buying cheaper from London. But, since the emergence of uniform taxation, where federation always operated lopsidedly in favour of the States which had the greatest concentration of protected industries, and therefore, the highest incomes, we now have a tendency in federal operations to distribute the money back. In other words, the tariff system which operated against all agricultural areas, even within New South Wales and Victoria, and the purely agricultural States, now, at least as far as the agricultural States are concerned, bas changed to the extent that the system of uniform taxation offsets that, and so do all tbese types of grants. If the honourable member for Mallee and the honourable member for Corangamite are tice in every little nnancial measure that comes before the Parliament by referring to the grievances of Victoria, they should at least recognize that such a policy opens up the whole question of the entire fiscal policy of the nation, and that very strong segments of farming and agricultural opinion consider that the agricultural States are at a disadvantage under the basic fiscal system of the Commonwealth; and that those segments will support this type of measure because it has some equalizing effect. The figures cited by the honourable member for Corangamite disclose thatWestern Australia is spending only 10 per cent, of its own resources on roads. I point out that this represents £8 per head of the population of the State. population 700,000. Victoria spent £21,000,000 but, as its population is 2,500,000, that expenditure averages £S per head also. In all the States, the expenditure on roads is about £8 a head. So the story that, somehow or other, there is an unfair discrimination in tbe final result, and that a State is not getting a fair deal, does not seem to square with the figures actually quoted by tbe honourable member. .",39,Tempobaby Chairman Mb States With The Exception That The Allocation
121,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [3.3],"I am sure tkat no member of this Parliament has been more persistent than the honourable member for Mallee( Mr about the formula has been canvassed TurnbuU) in attempting to get for Victoria a fair share of the receipts from the petrol tax. I appreciate that his proposed amendment will achieve that purpose to a large measure. I support the amendment mainly because I believe that Victoria needs more money from this allocation because of the use of Victorian roads by heavy interstate trucks from other States. But I do see three objections to the proposed amendment. I think, firstly, that the amendment does not go far enough and that it should a Ppiy *o all the money that is being distributed ,under the formula, and not just to Id. a gallon. Secondly, I do not think it will be as effective as tbe suggestion I made during the second-reading debate on the bill last night. However, I do not propose to take up the time of the House by going over those suggestions. Thirdly, I want the imposition of the extra 3d. a gallon tax on petrol to be only of a temporary nature. If a State is given a vested interest in this money then it will tend to want that imposition to be retained as long as possible. But in spite of these objections, I believe that even a small slice is better than no bread. Therefore, I give the amendment my support. Minister for Health) [3.7] -The Government is not able to accept this amendnient for a very simple reason. In fact, we do not consider the alternative that has been proposed by the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon) is a true alternative. We believe that the choice is not between having fully adequate roads in Victoria and long and unused stretches of road somewhere else, but between having adequate roads in Victoria, and also having adequate roads in relation to population and area in other States. It is well known that tbe formula is based, not on area alone, but on population and area. We believe that the best interests of the country as a whole are served by adhering to the present formula. For those reasons the Government is unable to accept the proposed amendment. I do not want to detain tbe committee for any lengthy period. This argument over the years, not only in this Parliament, but also at conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers and at other meetings, and the weight of opinion is against any change. I think that the Parliament is indebted to the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) for his remarks this afternoon, because he bas given people on this side of the continent some idea of the disabilities and disadvantages that tbe State of Western Australia has suffered over tbe years. I rise mainly to put something straight on the record. When the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) spoke this morning he quoted certain ngures. I have heard similar ngures quoted a number of times, more particularly by people in Victoria. I was surprised to learn, this morning, that the ngures came from the Commonwealth Treasury. Speaking from memory, I think the honourable member for Melbourne said that New South Wales had 477,000 vehicles, Victoria 457,000, and Western Australia only 95,000. Why, bless ray heart and soul! They are only the figures for the metropolitan area in Western Australia. In that State, there are 141 local governing authorities; and in my own division, tbere are at least 39 of them. Even blind Freddie would be able to go around any of those roads districtsj which are the equivalent of what are called shire councils on the eastern seaboard, and count at least 400 vehicles in any one of those local areas. Consequently, there are 56,000 vehicles in those roads districts. ber referring to the bonorable member for Perth( Mr Chaney) as blind Freddie? able member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) would know, if he had been paying attention to debate this morning, that the honourable member for Perth interjected when the honourable member for Melbourne was speaking, and said that only 53 per cent, of the vehicle licences were held in the metropolitan area.

I believe that it is all other States. It is a very good one, the best thing that has come out of this and I recommend other States to use it debate so far, despite the utterances of rather than have all vehicles registered the honourable member for Melbourne by one central authority. But the point ( Mr Calwell). There is wisdom in what 1 make is this: Before a Commonwealth the Minister said, but there is only department issues figures to members of humour in what the honourable member Parliament and organizations, let it for Melbourne said. check the position exactly and give authentic figures, not figures which one ( Mr Beazley) said that Western Auswbo is acquainted with the position in a tralia suffered in some ways and was particular State knows are entirely recompensed in other ways, and that if wrong. Before the committee votes on my amendto the grievances of their State, they ment, I want to answer one or two things should recognize that it would open up that have been said. Pirst of all, it has the entire fiscal policy of the nation. But been contended that if my amendment the honourable member only spoke about were carried to its logical conclusion, it population. He did not refer to the area would mean that the money collected in in Western Australia that does not proa metropolitan area such as Melbourne duce anything and wbicb has no chance, could only be spent in the metropolitan in 100 years' time, of producing anyarea. Nothing could be more illogical thing. He has not taken areas into conthan that reasoning, for the simple sideration. He only mentioned populareason that tbe Commonwealtb Aid tions. Of course, that was a good debatBoads Agreement provides that a proporing point, and we appreciate bis debating tion of the money granted to the States power, but the logic of his statement falls for roads purposes has to be expended to the ground.

The honourable member for spent in Melbourne falls to the ground. Fremantle cannot hope to convince anyNo credence can be placed on it. I was very pleased that at least I got something from the Minister for Health (Dr. Donald Cameron). He said that the assistance given to me by the honorthe real requirement was to have adequate able member for Corangamite ( Mr roads in Victoria, Western Australia, Mackinnon) and the bonorable member Queensland and every other State. I for Wimmera( Mr Lawrence), but I do agree with him, but that is something not agree with the honourable member for that has not been achieved, and that is Wimmera wben he says that the suggeswhy this amendment has been moved.

When a naturalized person asks an honourable member to make representations to tlie Minister for the admission to Australia of relatives and friends, does the Minister, in some cases, reply in general terms that tlie nominee does no't fulfil our immigration requirements and, in a confidential note, say that the rejection is on security grounds? 2. As Australia does not have immigration, consular, diplomatic or, presumably, security representatives in some of the countries of origin of nominees, e.g., Spain and Yugoslavia, does the department rely on United Kingdom. American, French or West German representatives, or on commercial, ecclesiastical, or refugee sources, for security information in those countries? .'). Ts the department as vigilant in excluding persons who have acquiesced in Fascist, Nazi, Falangist and Iron Guard regimes as in excluding those who have acquiesced in Gommunist and Titoist regimes ? 4. If a rejected nominee lives in a country where he cannot he interviewed or observed by Australian officials, would there be any objection to permitting him to know the basis of rejection and, if not to face his accusers, at least to counter the accusation? the honorahle member's questions are as follows:1. As most honourable members will know, it has long been the practice, as far as possible, to meet requests by honourable members for advice as tn reasons for decisions in immigration matters. Very often, because of the nature of the grounds for a migrant's rejection, they ean only bc stated in very genersil terms and then only on a confidential basin. The honourable member has himself had experience of this practice in ' the course of hia tion. 2. In matters of security, my department relies on the advice of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. In countries when: there is no Australian post, the Tjnited Kingdom representatives issue vises for Australia, nn the basis of general instructions from my Department of Immigration. In no circumstances does the department rely on the representatives of foreign governments or on nongovernmental sources. 3. The department tries to be equally vigilant in dealing with all applications for permanent residence in Australia. 4. No application for a vise for Australia is rejected by other than Australian ofncials. In those cases in which applicants reside in a country where no Australian omciai is based, the f u l l facts are referred by the Britisli authorities, who act on behalf of tlie Commonwealth, to an appropriate Australian post or the Department of Immigration, Canberra, for a decision. If reasons for rejection of sucli people were given, it would place tlie persons, resident in a country where they cannot be interviewed or observed by an Australian official, in a more favorable position than those who are seen by Australian officials. In cases where character or security grounds happen to result in rejection, action to enable thc applicant to face his accusers may compromise the sources available for screening migrants. The honourable member may rest assured that information received from other than reliable sources is not regarded as sufficient to warrant rejection of any application.",45,Turnbull S Amendment
