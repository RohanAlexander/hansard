146,The Speaker,"Order! It being 9.30 children.The following answers to questions were circulated: Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws (Question No. 1458) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 February 2003: (1) Has the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) at any time over the last seven years retained any barrister who has used bankruptcy as a means of avoiding taxation obligations; if so, (a) which barrister or barristers, (b) on how many occasions was each barrister retained and (c) what was the most recent date that each barrister was retained. (2) Has the ATO at any time over the last seven years retained any barrister while that person was bankrupt; if so, (a) which barrister or barristers, (b) on how many occasions was each barrister retained and (c) what was the most recent date each barrister was retained. (3) Was question No. 2455 asked by the Member for Barton on 26 March 2001 unanswered by the time of the dissolution of the 39th Parliament in October 2001; if so, why. (1)-(2) In the majority of cases, the ATO retains its barristers through the office of the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS). In such instances, the ATO is reliant on the checking processes utilised by AGS. AGS engages counsel consistently with the requirements set out in the Legal Services Directions issued by the Attorney General’s Department pursuant to section 55ZF of the Judiciary Act 1903. Wherever possible, AGS relies on existing knowledge of a barrister’s reputation and, in particular, that the barrister has not used bankruptcy as a means of avoiding taxation obligations. Similarly, in those instances where the ATO directly briefs counsel, the ATO relies on prior knowledge of the barrister’s reputation that they have not used bankruptcy as a means of avoiding taxation obligations. (3) Please refer to Hansard. Taxation: Legal Profession Project (Question No. 1548) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 March 2003: (1) Why does the 2001-2002 annual report on the activities of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) omit a chapter titled “Legal Profession Project” (LPP) which appeared in the 2000-2001 annual report. (2) Where can the report of the activities of the LPP be found for the period 2001-2002. (3) Does the LPP still exist; if so, what is the nature of its work and to whom does it report.

147,Mr Costello,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,130,Questions On Notice
148,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Further to the information provided at page 63 by the Commissioner of Taxation in the annual report of 2000-2001 that 590 barristers had income tax debts of about $52 million, what is the current sum of the outstanding tax debt to be collected from barristers in NSW. (2) Does the drop in the number of barristers with outstanding debts from 590 to 432 from 1999-2000 to the 2000-2001 demonstrate the success of the Legal Profession Project (LPP); if so, how; if not, why not. (3) Is the success in the project supported by the statistics cited by the Commissioner of Taxation on page 63 of the 2000-2001 annual report that overall the number of cases for barristers decreased 26 per cent, and the total debt dropped 14 per cent; if so, how; if not, why not. (4) Did he see that segment of the annual report at page 64 titled “Be more involved with trustees” in which the cases of Re: Davison– Special Case to the Full Court of the Federal Court and subsequently reported as In the matter of Davison, Donnellyv Davison [2000] FCA 1396 (6 October 2000) are cited; if so, how has the Commissioner of Taxation more vigorously pursued debt recovery involving barristers using trusts to avoid tax. (5) Has he been made aware of the five judgments in the Federal Court of Australia of (a) Prenticev Cummins [2002] FCA 1140 (13 September 2002), (b) Prenticev Cummins [2002] FCA 1165 (19 September 2002), (c) Prenticev Cummins [2002] FCA 1172 (19 September 2002), (d) Prenticev Cummins (No. 4) [2002] FCA 1215 (2 October 2002) and (e) Prenticev Cummins (No. 5) [2002] FCA 1503 (5 December 2002); if not, why not. (6) In the matter of Prenticev Cummins No.5 (Fed Ct Ref N7481 of 2002) is he aware that the reported judgment notes that Mr Cummins became bankrupt by his own petition in December 2000 and that between 1995 and early 2000, Mr Cummins failed to lodge any income tax returns and owed an estimated $955,672.92 in unpaid taxes to the Commissioner of Taxation. (7) Is he aware that the said report in N7481 notes that the trustees of the bankrupt estate of Mr Cummins seek to recover certain property or funds said to have been transferred by Mr Cummins to his wife and to the trustee of the Cummins Family Trust. (8) Is he aware that, in like fashion, there was also an intent to transfer property out of the reach of creditors in the pending proceedings before a full examination by the Federal Court of Australia on 19-20 February 2003 in the matter of Mr Stephen Archer, a former barrister now the subject of his third serial bankruptcy. (9) In light of the similarity of facts between the Cummins and Archer matters with intent to transfer property out of reach of creditors, can he say whether the Commissioner of Taxation is prosecuting with full force, his powers under section 121 of the Bankruptcy Act and elsewhere, with respect to those 590 barristers deliberately transferring property or other assets so as to defeat creditors, principally, the Commissioner of Taxation; if so, how; if not, why not. (10) What is the number and percentage of those 590 barristers who are engaged in activities to defeat creditors involving (a) the transfer of their personal assets into family trusts, (b) the transfer of their personal assets to their spouses and (c) other transfers, gifts etc. whilst still having significant outstanding debts to creditors, principally the Commissioner of Taxation. (11) Is he able to say how widespread is the practice of what may be described as asset stripping amongst barristers in NSW and in the other membership lists of the Bar Associations of all the States and Territories; if so, how; if not, why not. (1) to (4) Refer to the Commissioner of Taxation’s Annual Report for 2002-03. (5) to (8) The matters referred to are on the public record.",130,Questions On Notice
149,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(9) to (11) In the majority of cases the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is able to enter into payment arrangements which enable full payment of outstanding amounts of tax. The ATO has fully pursued those cases where it appears that bankruptcy is being used as a ploy to avoid paying tax, for example, cases where the ATO is the sole creditor. In a few of those cases it would appear that assets have been transferred under family law arrangement to put assets out of reach of creditors. In the recent case of Prenticev Cummins (No 6)[2003] FCA 1002 the trustee has been successful in recovering assets transferred to the wife to pay outstanding tax debts. Taxation: Lodgment of Returns (Question No. 1550) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 March 2003: (1) Further to the Commissioner of Taxation’s annual report of 2000-2001 in which it is reported that the Commissioner has demanded that 771 barristers lodge tax returns, (a) how many returns have been lodged by those 771 barristers and (b) how many returns are outstanding. (2) What are the details of the “outstanding years” of those 771 barristers who have one or more years of outstanding tax returns. (3) With respect to the Commissioner of Taxation’s report that only 56 per cent of the NSW Bar Association were current with their tax returns, what are the current numerical and percentile breakups of both data and statistics in number of years for outstanding non-lodgments of tax returns by barristers in NSW. (4) What action is being taken to arrest the high percentile of barristers who have one or more years of outstanding income tax returns. (5) What does the Commissioner of Taxation define as a serial offender of non-compliance with taxation law, in particular, non-lodgement of tax returns. (6) Is a serial offender a barrister with a history of (a) two or more consecutive years of non-lodgement or (b) two or more years of non-lodgement, whether consecutive or not, or is there some other definition; if so, what is that definition. (7) What is the total number of barristers registered throughout all Bar Association Registries in each of the States and Territory Bar Associations, who have described themselves by this occupation when filing and for the purposes of lodging their tax returns. (8) Can he confirm the existence of certain barristers who declare themselves to be within either (a) Australian Taxation Office Business Industry Codes (BIC) or (b) other occupations other than as barrister as defined under the BIC or as a barrister yet lodging under another BIC, yet still be practising effectively as a barrister for fee for service; if so, what is the number and percentile of those barristers practising yet not declaring themselves to be barristers for taxation purposes. (1) to (8) Refer to Commissioner of Taxation’s Annual Report 2002-03. Taxation: Lodgment of Returns (Question No. 1572) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 5 March 2003: (1) Is he aware of reports that Mr Clarrie Stevens, QC, did not lodge an income tax return for twenty years whilst practising as a barrister between 1976 and 1996; if not, why not. (2) Is it the case that Mr Stevens has acted for the Taxation Commissioner; if so, on how many occasions has he been retained by the Taxation Commissioner and for what periods of time.",131,Questions On Notice
150,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) What checks does the Taxation Commissioner undertake before retaining the services of a member of the legal profession. (4) Is he able to say whether the Taxation Commissioner considered the question of whether Mr Stevens is of good fame and character before retaining his services; if so, what were those considerations and when was this question considered, if not, why not. (5) Is there a procedure whereby the Commissioner of Taxation determines the good fame and character of a legal practitioner retained for the purposes of assisting/representing him in litigation, policy advice, and/or legal work; if so, what is that procedure, if not, why not. (6) Are there criteria by which the Taxation Commissioner appoints, retains, employs or otherwise engages legal practitioners on a fee-for-service basis; if not, why not. (1) Yes. (2) Mr Stevens was engaged by the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) to provide legal services to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) on several occasions during the early 1990s. (3) In the majority of cases, the ATO retains its barristers through the office of the AGS. In such instances, the ATO is reliant on the checking processes utilised by AGS. AGS engages counsel consistently with the requirements set out in the Legal Services Directions issued by the Attorney General’s Department pursuant to section 55ZF of the Judiciary Act 1903. Similarly, in those instances where the ATO directly briefs counsel, the ATO relies on prior knowledge of the barrister’s reputation that they have not used bankruptcy as a means of avoiding taxation obligations.

Taxation: Tax File Numbers (Question No. 1588) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 6 March 2003: How many (a) barristers, and (b) solicitors or lawyers, registered with any Bar Association or Law Society, do not have a tax file number. (a) and (b) Nil. Taxation: Legal Services Occupations (Question No. 1589) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 6 March 2003: What is the total number of taxpayers recorded by the Australian Tax Office under the industry code No. 78410 it uses to identify taxpayers engaged in the following legal services occupations: advocates, barristers, conveyancing services, legal aid services, notaries and solicitors.

152,Mr Costello,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,133,Questions On Notice
153,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) What was the amount of taxpayer-debt carried by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) immediately before the introduction of the New Taxation System. (2) What is the current amount of taxpayer-debt carried by the ATO. (1) to (2) Details of amounts of debt carried by the Australian Taxation Office as at 1 July 2000 and at 30 June 2003 are available in the Commissioner of Taxation’s Annual Report 2002-03. Taxation: Tax File Numbers (Question No. 1614) Ms Burke asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 March 2003: (1) How many Tax File Numbers (TFNs) have been issued by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). (2) How many TFNs have been: (a) associated with the lodgement of a tax return in the last 12 months, (b) not associated with the submission of a tax return in the last 12 months and (c) found by the ATO to be inactive or no longer operational. (3) What are the criteria for determining the continuing use or functionality of a TFN. (4) Has the ATO found cases of the issue of multiple TFNs to any individual; if so, (a) is there any legitimate reason for an individual to be issued with multiple TFNs, (b) how many instances of multiple TFN issues have been found, and (c) what is the highest number of TFNs that have been issued to an individual. (5) Does the issue of multiple TFNs provide opportunities to attempt the commission of taxation fraud. (6) Does the ATO undertake any data matching to reduce the instances of multiple issue of TFNs. (7) What steps has the ATO taken to eliminate or reduce instances of multiple TFN issue. (1) As at 17 November 2003, the total number of TFNs issued by the ATO is: Individuals: 20 921 867 Companies: 2 103 566 Partnerships: 1 975 124 Trusts: 1 438 915 Superannuation funds: 614 030 Total: 27 053 502 *Government 23 374 (2) (a) For the 2002 financial year 12,257,743 TFNs (including Individuals 10,465,663) were associated with the lodgement of a tax return. For the 2003 financial year 7,647,171 TFNs (including Individuals 7,212,690) have been associated with the lodgement of a tax return. However the lodgement period has not yet concluded. (b) For the 2002 financial year 13,769,040 TFNs were not associated with the lodgement of a tax return. (c) For the 2002 financial year holders of 7,264,074 TFNs have not been required to lodge a tax return. (3) The TFN has a use that is broader than lodgement of an income tax return. Currently there is no single factor that renders a TFN inactive. A TFN may not be active because the client has died, departed Australia and has no further need to lodge returns, or the TFN is a duplicate record.",133,Questions On Notice
154,Mr Costello,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,134,Questions On Notice
155,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Clients who have departed Australia may need to use their TFN to lodge returns in relation to Australian sourced income. Therefore departure from Australia is not a bar to the continued use of the TFN. In the case where clients have an indicator that states that ‘further returns are not necessary’ or ‘not necessary’ for a particular year they may not have a taxable income or it is anticipated that they will not earn sufficient income to be liable for tax. However, these clients may still use their TFN as they may have a future or alternative present need to do so, eg quotation to Centrelink or financial institution. (4) Yes. (a) Generally there are two circumstances where a person may legally be issued with more than one TFN: If a person discovers that their TFN has been compromised, ie has come into the possession of a person not authorised to have that information, then they may apply to the ATO for a new TFN. In those circumstances the two TFNs are linked as duplicates to prevent the client using both for separate purposes. In a situation where a person has been issued with a new identity and that identity is protected, that person may apply for a new TFN to prevent their identity being discovered. In these circumstances the TFNs are not linked for security reasons. (b) A total of 187 104 instances of multiple TFNs issued to individuals have been found and resolved since 1989. (c) The highest number of multiple TFNs suspected to have been issued to an individual is 37. However, this is an allegation only at this stage as the case is currently before the courts. The highest number of TFNs proven to have been issued to an individual is 28. (5) to (7) The ATO checks the identity details of TFN applicants against the existing client register using identity-matching software to determine whether the person already has a TFN. A quality assurance process is conducted on a random sample of actual applications to identify the incidence of duplicate records. Complete checking of all TFNs issued in the preceding seven days is conducted weekly through a data warehouse data matching process. The ATO is currently identifying historical duplicate records through internal matching of the entire client database using a hierarchy of matching criteria. Other ATO initiatives to reduce the instances of multiple TFNs include: the implementation of an auto registration process for Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) clients where identity details are confirmed by ongoing participation in the Australian Crime Commission’s identity fraud register (since February 2002); ongoing actioning of referred identity cases from external (eg Centrelink, Police) and community sources; and ongoing use of the Births, Deaths and Marriages’ Certificate Verification Service (since May 2001), although only NSW and Victorian registries are online. Prospect Electorate: Baby Bonus (Question No. 1681) Mrs Crosio asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 March 2003: (1) How many people in the electoral division of Prospect received the Baby Bonus in 2002-03. (2) How many people in the electoral division of Prospect received a payment of $2,500 in 2002-03. (3) How many people in the electoral division of Prospect received a payment of $500 in 2002-03. (4) How many people in the electoral division of Prospect have applied for a Baby Bonus payment in 2002-03 and been rejected. (1) to (4) The Australian Taxation Office does not collect information on the basis of electoral boundaries. Where a claimant’s taxable income is $25,000 or less they will be entitled to $500 (although this amount is reduced where the claimant did not have legal responsibility for and care of the child for the whole year). Taxation: New South Wales Bar Association (Question No. 1885) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 May 2003: (1) Can he confirm whether the Commissioner of Taxation replied to the President of the NSW Bar Association’s letter dated 9 February 2001, on 14 February 2001, to the effect that “…the ATO has not disclosed information about individual barristers to Mr Paul Barry”. (2) Has the ATO disclosed any information to Mr Paul Barry of The Sydney Morning Herald; if so, (a) what was that information, and (b) will he make it public; if not, why not. (3) Can he confirm that the letter from the Commissioner says: “As you would be aware, our understanding of our secrecy and privacy obligations under the law is that we cannot provide you details of individual cases for the purpose of considering whether to bring proceedings against a barrister for professional misconduct”. (4) Does the Commissioner recommend that the NSW Bar Association “consider being more specific as to what conduct would, under the Bar Rules, constitute professional misconduct”; if so, how would this clarification affect the Commissioner’s assertion that information about particular barristers is precluded from release under privacy and secrecy laws. (5) If no relationship between clarifying rules of professional conduct under the Bar Rules and privacy and secrecy law exists, then will he call upon the Commissioner of Taxation to explain what his policy on release of information is; if so, when; if not, why not. (1) Yes. The Commissioner has replied but it is inappropriate to comment on the terms of the reply. (2) Yes. In response to requests for information from Mr Barry, the ATO provided general information in aggregate form about compliance issues associated with NSW Barristers. (3) to(4) See (1). (5) Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 prevents the Commissioner of Taxation from discussing the affairs of individual taxpayers with others except when expressly empowered to do so under the Act. The NSW Bar Association is not an entity to which the Commissioner can provide such information. Throsby Electorate: General Practitioners (Question No. 1894) Ms George asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 26 May 2003: (1) What was the number of (a) general practitioners, and (b) specialists in the electoral division of Throsby in (i) 1996, (ii) 2000, and (iii) currently.",134,Questions On Notice

In general terms, practitioners with at least 50% of Schedule fee income from non-referred (GP) attendances in the June quarter of the years in question were considered to be general practitioners. All other practitioners, including optometrists and some dentists, who provided services under Medicare, were categorised as ‘other practitioners’. These statistics were compiled from Medicare data by servicing provider postcode. In compiling statistics for the electoral division of Throsby, since some postcodes overlap Federal electoral division boundaries, statistics by servicing provider postcode were mapped to electorate using data from the Census of Population and Housing showing the proportion of the population of each postcode in each Federal electoral division.

(8) (a)-(c) DIMIA has specific responsibility for the investigation of offences against the Migration Act 1958 and the Australian Citizenship Act 1948. Allegations under the Migration and Citizenship Acts may be investigated where there is sufficient information to indicate that fraudulent activity has occurred. DIMIA does not have the power to ‘charge’ offenders; instead, a DIMIA investigation may proceed to a ‘summons’ issued by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. There is no specific crime under the Migration Act that relates to the employment of unlawful noncitizens or to the ownership or management of brothels. Therefore, there have been no investigations finalised by DIMIA on the basis of an individual’s ownership or management of a brothel. Investigations are not recorded in DIMIA systems by the occupation of the individual under investigation but rather by offence and the suspect’s name. The Department has, however, provided assistance to other agencies in their investigation of matters relating to the sex industry. The Department is aware that some of these investigations have resulted in the prosecution of brothel owners and managers by these agencies. Some of these persons may have been involved in DIMIA compliance activity during the period specified; others may be under investigation for other offences such as making false statements and false representations in relation to visa applications. (9) The AFP has carriage of the investigation of people trafficking and sexual servitude offences with DIMIA playing a key role in identifying and referring people trafficking matters to the AFP. A matter has been referred to the AFP for investigation as a result of the operation that took place in Melbourne on Monday 11 August 2003. (10) This is the responsibility of the AFP and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. Aviation: Airport Noise Levels (Question No. 2335) September 2003: (1) Is he familiar with the sixth message of the Community Panel Report to Sydney Airport Corporation in June 2003 recommending that the residential noise insulation program be expanded in line with the impacts of airport expansion. (2) What is the current status and level of activity of the residential noise insulation project. (3) Is he able to say whether there will be any future expansion of the insulation area; if so, where is that expansion likely to take place. (1) I understand the Community Panel Report forms part of Sydney Airport Corporation Limited’s consultation process for the preliminary draft Master Plan. I will consider the draft Master Plan in due course. (2) Of the 4085 eligible residences included in the programme, 4060 have now had insulation work completed, with work on the remaining residences nearing completion. (3) No. Boundaries of the residential insulation area are reviewed on an annual basis, based on annual Australian Noise Exposure Index maps for the airport. Any expansion in the insulation area would be dependent on changes in the relevant noise exposure contour lines, which might occur in the future as a result of aircraft operations at the airport. Taxation: Reef Tax (Question No. 2370) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 September 2003: (1) Did the Government, between 1998 to present, make assurances to marine operators on the Great Barrier Reef in North Queensland, including the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators (AMPTO), that the GST would not apply to the Reef tax; if so, on what authority were such undertakings made. (2) Was he aware of these undertakings at the time; if not, when did he become aware of them. (3) Were any representations made to him to support the undertaking of non-compliance with the GST legislation. (1) to (3) The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer advised the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators (AMPTO) that the Environmental Management Charge (EMC) would be listed in the Treasurer’s Determination relating to Division 81 of the GST Act. This Determination lists those taxes, fees and charges that are not subject to the GST. The advice issued 5 June 2000, and the Determination issued 1 July 2000. Taxation: Reef Tax (Question No. 2371) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 September 2003: (1) Has the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) determined that the GST applies to the Reef tax; if so, has the ATO commenced action against marine operators who failed to collect the GST payable on the Reef tax since 1999.",148,Questions On Notice

174,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Was he aware that only one or two operators had actually collected the GST on the Reef tax; if so, what action did he take in response to this situation. (3) On whose authority did the ATO decide not to continue with action to recover the GST and was he aware of the decision made by the ATO. (4) Did he or any other member of the Government direct or otherwise influence the ATO to discontinue action to recover the GST which had not been collected on the Reef tax. (5) Is it the case that the ATO has written to operators advising that the GST should be collected on the Reef tax effective from 1 September 2003; if so, (a) on what basis was this decision made, (b) who made it, and (c) how was the date of 1 September determined. (6) Is a differential application of the liability to collect and forward the GST supported by the Government. (7) Will the approach adopted for the application of the GST to the Reef Tax be applied to other similar cases as they come to the ATO’s notice. (1) GST does not apply to the Environmental Management Charge (EMC) paid by the marine operators to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. (2) GST does not apply to the EMC. However, GST applies to the final price for tourism services supplied by a tourist operator. When it became clear that only a few operators were correctly accounting for their GST obligations in this regard, the ATO worked with the industry to improve their knowledge of the GST requirements to assure future compliance. (3) to (4) The decision not to recover past tax was taken by the Commissioner under section 63 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (TAA Act) which confers upon him the general administration of indirect tax laws. (5) GST does not apply to the EMC. The ATO has worked closely with the industry to ensure that all operators are aware of their obligations. This included advice that the total price charged for tourism services is subject to GST, and that all operators would be required to account for tax on this basis from 1 September 2003. (a) to (b) This decision was taken by the Commissioner under section 63 of the AA which confers upon him the general administration of indirect tax laws. (c) The Commissioner advises that 1 September 2003 was considered to be the earliest date by which the ATO could ensure that all of the industry members were aware of their obligations and could reasonably be expected to have restructured their advertising, pricing and accounting systems to properly reflect their GST obligations. (6) The Commissioner has the general administration power to allow him to take into account the circumstances of particular cases in delivering a fair and reasonable administration of the indirect tax laws. (7) The Commissioner has advised that he will continue to make his administrative decisions based on the circumstances applicable in each particular case and in accordance with the powers conferred upon him under the taxation law.

(8) Will the Government be raising the issue of Tibet with the President of the People’s Republic of China during his forthcoming visit to Australia. (1) Australia was able to raise its full range of concerns about the human rights situation in China, including those that relate to Tibet. The dialogue agreed on the next set of projects to be undertaken as part of the bilateral Human Rights Technical Cooperation Program, including reaching agreement to extend the Program to Tibet. China briefed Australia on further steps it was taking to minimise the potential for human rights abuses. The delegation passed to the Chinese a list of cases of individuals of concern. Nine individuals whose cases we had raised with the Chinese during and since the last round of the Dialogue in 2002 have since been released. (2) No. (3) The Chinese delegation advised that Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the boy identified by the Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, is well and being given all necessary care and attention, including education, and his parents have asked that he not be disturbed.

Transport: Rail Security (Question No. 2434) 18 September 2003: What steps has he taken since 11 September 2001 to (a) enhance the security of (i) railroad infrastructure, (ii) major rail facilities, and (iii) key rail hubs, (b) enhance the security of passengers travelling by rail, and (c) ensure that cargo transported by rail does not pose a threat to Australia’s national security. Responsibility for the rail system in Australia rests with the State and Territory Governments. Commonwealth involvement in the operation of rail infrastructure is limited to the intercapital standard gauge network managed by the Australian Rail Track Corporation. The remainder of the commercial rail system is operated by either State Government entities or the private sector. In these circumstances the security of rail infrastructure, the associated facilities, hubs, passengers and freight is primarily the responsibility of the relevant State and Territory Government entities and the private sector rail owners and operators. However, rail infrastructure and facilities are being incorporated in the development of the Australian Transport Council’s National Transport Security Strategy together with other land transport infrastructure. The strategy will assist transport operators to incorporate information about the threat from terrorism into security assessment and planning processes. The State and Territory Governments have also identified critical transport infrastructure including elements of the rail network as part of the National Critical Infrastructure Protection Process. This process involves developing security measures for the identified infrastructure that can be implemented to respond to changes in the nature or level of threat.

187,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:them. In publishing these risks and describing what is being done about them, the ATO is demonstrating that the tax system is being managed in an open and accountable way, and that it is balancing education and enforcement functions in a way that is acceptable to the community and sustainable in the long term. The Commissioner invites feedback on how the tax system is being managed. As well, whenever possible, the ATO engages community representatives and other specialists in decision-making forums, including rulings panels and accountability and integrity committees. The Commissioner has identified the legal profession as one of a number of areas of risk requiring attention, and is utilising a range of education, enforcement and consultation strategies to effect improvements in compliance. (2) Yes. The ATO has been funded in accordance with the Output Pricing Agreement, which provides an increased funding base of $1,885.5 million over the three years, 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06. The Agreement includes funding for specific strategies outlined in the Compliance Program 2003/04. (3) The ATO’s compliance strategies seek to maximise the number of people who choose to comply by making it as easy as possible for people to understand and meet their obligations and by ensuring there are approaches in place to deter non-compliance. Risk assessment is a key factor in determining the nature and timing of activities undertaken. The ATO also seeks to ensure its responses are appropriate and proportionate to non-compliance activities it detects, including the firmest possible enforcement response to those who deliberately set out to avoid their obligations. (4) As mentioned in QoN 1597, the Commissioner has not received complaints about the legal profession from staff via the “ATOconcern” service. Taxation: Income Tax (Question No. 2452) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1641 (Hansard, 15 September 2003, page 19411), what is the breakdown of occupations listed as ‘Accounting services’ under which 18 percent pay the top marginal tax rate, in particular, is it possible to break down this group into ‘Accountants’, ‘Accounting services’, ‘Auditing services’, ‘Bookkeeping services’ and ‘Tax agents’; if not, why not. (2) What is the reason for aggregating such disparate sub-business industries under global BIC listings such as ‘Accounting services’. (3) How is public scrutiny facilitated by such BIC aggregations. (4) How is the public to know whether a particular sub-business industry group or BIC group is paying their correct share of taxation. (5) Will he consider an inquiry into the reasons why the providers of ‘Accounting services’ have such a low percentage of their business industry population paying the top marginal tax rate; if so, when; if not, why not. (1) The answer to Question No. 1641 on accounting services relates to ANZSIC industry code 78420. Auditing services, Bookkeeping services and Tax agents. As these sub-industries are all grouped into this industry code, it is not possible to conduct a separate analysis on each of the sub-industry groups within the code. (2) The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) industry coding regime is based upon the four digit Australian and New Zealand Standard Industry Classification (ANZSIC) system which is maintained by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). However, the ATO adds a fifth digit of",159,Questions On Notice
188,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:ATO ANZSIC for internal purposes. This fifth digit is utilised by the ATO when a business requirement is identified which necessitates a finer disaggregation of the ABS ANZSIC. (3) The industry aggregations available to the ATO are at least as disaggregated as those maintained by the ABS (Australian Standard). (4) The ATO regularly undertakes risk assessment activities across the entire taxpayer population, and this sub-industry group is included in this process. This process informs the ATO’s active compliance program which aims to ensure that all taxpayers are paying the correct amount of tax. (5) The ATO will continue to examine the tax compliance of professions, including those in the accounting services sub-industry population.

(2) What effect will the changes in flight paths have on the ANEF Contour lines currently used to determine the applicability of Australian Standard AS2021 to particular properties. (3) Are revised ANEF Contour line maps publicly available for noise affected properties under the flight paths of aircraft arrivals and departures for Sydney Airport; if so, where can these revised maps be obtained; if not, when will these maps become available.

On 21 March 2001 the former Attorney-General wrote to me to ask that my Department and agencies within my portfolio take steps not to brief counsel who have become insolvent to avoid their taxation obligations. Following this I issued instructions to my Department and portfolio agencies to comply with the Attorney-General’s request. I should point out that Departmental officers do not conduct litigation. Litigation, which includes the engagement of counsel, is conducted on the Department’s behalf by its panel of legal service providers.

190,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Government Departments: Legal Services (Question No. 2469) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: Further to the answers to questions Nos 1620 to 1635 and 1637 (Hansard, 12 August 2003, page 18283) what are the Chief Executive Officers of the Minister’s departments and agencies doing to ensure that they do not retain the services of any barrister or solicitor who has previously been made bankrupt. The Commonwealth policy in relation to such matters, which is set out in the letter of 21 March 2001 from the Commonwealth Attorney-General to all Ministers, is intended to ensure that Commonwealth Departments and agencies do not engage counsel ‘who use insolvency as a means of avoiding tax’. The policy is not directed at preventing the briefing of all counsel who are, or have been, insolvent. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade DFAT has contracts with two commercial law firms and the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) to provide legal services to the Department. Specifically, the Deeds of Standing Offer require each legal service provider to: have financial viability provide appropriately skilled and qualified legal practitioners have a good reputation and standing within the legal service community. In addition, all legal work done by, or on behalf, of DFAT must be done in accordance with the Attorney-General’s Legal Service Directions on Counsel Engagement. These Directions bind Commonwealth agencies which are subject to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. The Attorney General could provide further detail concerning these policies. AusAID AusAID has Period Offer contracts with two commercial law firms to provide legal practitioners. In addition, the Australian Government Solicitor also provides legal practitioners under a Record of Understanding. The Period Offer Deed and the ROU require the above organisations to provide appropriately skilled and qualified legal practitioners. The various Australian legal admissions boards are required by legislation to determine whether applicants for practising certificates are of good fame and character and fit to be admitted. The AusAID contracts have similar requirements. Under the legislation, all applicants for admission to practise must advise the admissions board(s) of any actions (including bankruptcy) which may impact the Board’s decision. Following the issue of a certificate, legal practitioners are required to advise their Board of any action which could cause the Board to review a decision to issue a certificate. The Board is then required to determine whether or not to cancel or suspend a certificate. Personnel without a practising certificate are therefore not “appropriately skilled and qualified” legal practitioners and would not be acceptable personnel under the Contracts or the ROU. Australia Japan Foundation The Australia-Japan Foundation generally uses the in-house services of officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Legal Branch for its legal requirements. For occasional other services, the Foundation employs the services of a major domestic legal firm. That firm was recently subject to an exhaustive tender process to provide specialist legal services to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. As part of that process, the firm had to satisfy Australian Government procurement requirements, including on financial viability and probity, that would minimise the risk of the Foundation engaging a barrister or solicitor who had previously been made bankrupt.",161,Questions On Notice
191,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Export Finance and Insurance Corporation EFIC maintains standing agreements with several commercial law firms to provide legal services to the Corporation as required. Typically, EFIC engages counsel on the advice and recommendation of those firms. In exceptional circumstances, EFIC may engage counsel directly. EFIC understands that at the time of a person’s application for a practising certificate from the Law Society or Bar Association in New South Wales (as applicable), and upon application for annual renewal of that certificate, the applicant is required to disclose to the relevant authority any action that could cause the authority to review a decision to issue or renew a certificate, including whether the applicant is an undischarged bankrupt. The authority then determines whether to issue, cancel or suspend a practising certificate or to impose conditions on its renewal. EFIC understands that similar considerations apply in other States and Territories and by virtue of legislation governing the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Legal service providers who do not hold a practising certificate, or who hold a practising certificate on conditions of the type described above, are not appropriately skilled and qualified legal practitioners for EFIC’s purposes and the Corporation would therefore not seek to retain them. Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Government Departments: Legal Services (Question No. 2474) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: Further to the answers to questions Nos 1620 to 1635 and 1637 (Hansard, 12 August 2003, page 18168) what are the Chief Executive Officers of the Minister’s departments and agencies doing to ensure that they do not retain the services of any barrister or solicitor who has previously been made bankrupt. swer to the honourable member’s question: The Department and portfolio agencies use their panel firms of solicitors to instruct barristers where required. Engagement of barristers is done in accordance with the Attorney-General’s Legal Services Directions on Engagement of Counsel. The Australian Government policy in relation to such matters, was set out in the letter of 21 March 2001 from the then Attorney-General to all Ministers and is intended to ensure that departments and agencies do not engage counsel who use insolvency as a means of avoiding tax. The policy is not directed at preventing the briefing of all counsel who are, or have been, insolvent. The Department’s Deed of Standing offer with its panel of legal service providers stipulates that panel firms must inform the Department of matters relating to the financial capacity of the service provider or any sub-contractor, such as a barrister, which may affect their ability to perform obligations under the Deed. The Deed further provides that the Department may terminate the firms’ services in the event of insolvency. Our agreement with panel firms also stipulates that they must comply with relevant professional standards and Commonwealth and Departmental policies. ComSuper and the Commonwealth Grants Commission (CGC) utilise the services of the Australian Government Solicitor exclusively in respect of all legal matters. The PSS and CSS Boards use a select number of leading national law firms to provide legal advice. These firms are selected and briefed on the basis of their expertise in investment, superannuation and related matters. The Boards have not briefed counsel directly on a matter in recent years-this would",162,Questions On Notice

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) retains a panel of legal advisers who have been subjected to a rigorous evaluation and selection process. The law firms appointed to the AEC’s Legal Panel were required to confirm the bona fides of all legal personnel assigned to providing legal advice and assistance to the AEC. It is a requirement under the terms and conditions of the National Legal Panel contract that this requirement be maintained, particularly when, or if, a member of the nominated legal team is replaced or additional personnel are added. Prior to confirmation of selection to the legal panel each law firm was also subjected to a fiduciary check. Government Departments: Legal Services (Question No. 2475) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: Further to the answers to questions Nos 1620 to 1635 and 1637 (Hansard, 12 August 2003, page 18283) what are the Chief Executive Officers of the Minister’s departments and agencies doing to ensure that they do not retain the services of any barrister or solicitor who has previously been made bankrupt. The Attorney-General’s advice of 2001 regarding the engagement of barristers using insolvency to avoid their taxation obligations was circulated to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and portfolio agencies. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and portfolio agencies use reputable legal firms and undertake appropriate due diligence in the process of procuring legal services. The Department has also circulated the Attorney-General’s advice to its Legal Services provider.

For example, the 14 import containers that passed through Port Hedland in the 2002/03 financial year all arrived in one shipment. The 11 import containers that passed through Portland in the same period arrived in two shipments. The industry standard is to record container statistics in twenty foot equivalent (TEU) unit terms rather than the actual number of containers. Most international containers are either 20 ft (1 TEU) or 40 ft (2 TEUs). On average, the number of containers is equivalent to 75 per cent of the number of TEUs. Customs records do not distinguish between containers received at Port Botany and Port Jackson but record the containers for both ports together under Sydney. As such, figures are not available separately for Port Botany. Kwinana is not a port that facilitates containerised cargo. (2) (a), (b) All cargo imported to Australia, including containerised cargo, is screened by Customs. The new Container Examination Facilities have not been operational for a 12-month period as yet. The figures provided represent activity from start-up date, which includes a ramp-up period. The contents of 10 per cent of the containers x-rayed in the Container Examination Facilities are unpacked and physically examined. The Melbourne Container Examination Facility examined 17,125 containers in the December 2002 to October 2003 period. Since August 2003, Melbourne has averaged 465 containers per week. The Sydney Container Examination Facility examined 13,140 containers in the March 2003 to October 2003 period. Since August 2003, Sydney has averaged 479 containers per week. The Brisbane Container Examination Facility examined 6523 containers in the February 2003 to October 2003 period. Since August 2003, Brisbane has averaged 278 containers per week. The targets for the Container Examination Facilities, when fully operational are: Sydney and Melbourne -100 containers per day, or 26,000 containers per year in each port. Brisbane 60 containers per day, or 15,600 containers per year. Fremantle 50 containers per day, or 13,000 containers per year. Container examinations in other ports for the 2002/03 financial year were: In the Port of Adelaide, 351 containers were examined, or around one container per day. In the Port of Townsville, 158 containers were examined. In the Port of Launceston, 115 containers were examined. In the Port of Newcastle, 42 containers were examined. Containers imported into Port Kembla, Port Hedland, Portland and Gladstone were screened but were not selected any for x-ray or for physical examination. No containers were imported into Geelong, Kwinana, Bunbury or Haypoint.

(2) In respect of Telstra’s claim on its website that the new package includes a clarification of the definition of an eligible pensioner, (a) how has the definition been clarified, and (b) exactly how does the old definition differ from the new definition. (3) Why was it decided that pensioners would no longer be eligible for a discount on new telephone connections and what other discounts, rebates or other advantages available on the old package are not available on the new package. (4) What was the cost per annum of the old package for people on low incomes and how does this compare with the almost $160 million worth of services claimed to be provided in “access for everyone”. (5) In respect of obligations on Telstra to advertise and publicise its pensioner concession schemes, (a) what obligations, if any, does the Government currently impose, and (b) has any review been undertaken in regards to Telstra compliance with these requirements; if so, what was the outcome of that review or reviews. (6) Are eligible pensioners informed of Telstra’s concession scheme when they apply for their pension at Centrelink. (7) Is the Minister able to say whether all eligible pensioners with a Telstra account are receiving a pensioner discount, if not, (a) why not, and (b) what portion of eligible pensioners are estimated to be receiving a pensioner discount. (1) (a) Telstra has advised that the following persons are eligible for Telstra’s pensioner concessions: (i) non-business customers who are directly billed by Telstra for line rental and local calls; and (ii) hold a current Pensioner Concession Card issued by Centrelink or Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA); and (iii) are recipients of any one of the following payment types where valid for 12 months in a full year of issue: (A) Age Pension, card code AGE or AGE BLIND; (B) Carer Payment recipient, card code CAR; (C) Disability Support Pension, card code DSP or DSP BLIND; (D) Mature Age Allowance, card code MAA; (E) Mature Age Partner Allowance, card code MPA;",167,Questions On Notice

(b) Telstra has advised that, from 1 January 2003, persons in the following categories have not been eligible for the pensioner concessions unless they were deemed eligible for the concessions by Telstra prior to this date: (i) Australian war widow or widower; (ii) Special rate disability pensioner; (iii) Extreme (or intermediate) rate disability pensioner; (iv) Extreme disablement adjustment disability pensioner; and (v) Increased rate disability pensioner. (c) Telstra has advised that the change in eligibility criteria was made to align eligibility with the pensioner category types use by Centrelink and DVA. (2) (a) See answer to part (1) (c) of the question. (b) Telstra has advised that, prior to 1 January 2003, the following persons were eligible for the pensioner concessions: (i) non-business customers who were directly billed by Telstra for line rental and local calls; and (ii) held a current Centrelink Pensioner Concession Card (including an Age Pension, a Disability Support Pension or a Carer Payment recipient) or a DVA Pensioner Concession Card, or were one of the following: (A) Australian war widow or widower; (B) Special rate disability pensioner; (C) Extreme (or intermediate) rate disability pensioner; (D) Extreme disablement adjustment disability pensioner; or (E) Increased rate disability pensioner. (3) Telstra has advised that pensioners remain eligible for a discount on new telephone connections. Telstra advised that all discounts, rebates and other advantages available to eligible pensioners under the arrangements that existed prior to 1 July 2002 remain available and, in some areas, have been significantly increased. (4) Telstra has advised that it regards the cost or value of discounts, rebates and other advantages to pensioners under the arrangements that existed prior to 1 July 2002 as being commercially sensitive information. Telstra has therefore declined to provide this information. (5) (a) The Government requires Telstra, under clause 22 of the Carrier Licence Conditions (Telstra Corporation Limited) Declaration 1997, to have a package of products for low-income consumers and a marketing plan for making consumers aware of the package. (b) The Australian Communications Authority (ACA) is responsible for monitoring Telstra’s compliance with its licence condition, on an ongoing basis. ACA’s observer status on the Lowincome Measures Assessment Committee (LIMAC), which comprises representatives of welfare organisations and has responsibilities in relation to the form and marketing of the Telstra low-income package, assists the ACA in carrying out this responsibility. Clause 22 of the licence declaration also provides for an annual report to be provided by LIMAC to the Minister on the effectiveness of the low-income package and its marketing by Telstra. The first full report is expected to be provided in early 2004. The annual report to the Minister will further assist the ACA in its ongoing role of monitoring and enforcing compliance with the licence condition. (6) Centrelink has advised that it does not advertise Telstra pensioner concessions specifically as it may be considered to be discriminating among telecommunications providers. However, Centrelink customers are encouraged, for example when they receive their Pensioner or Health Concession Card, to contact service providers to see if they offer concessions. Centrelink also advised that the ‘Guide to Pensioner Concessions’ booklet, includes a section ‘Telephone Concessions’ which states that ‘Upon application, some telephone service providers offer concessions. Cardholders should contact their telephone service provider’. (7) (a) Telstra has advised that its pensioner concessions are available on application by eligible pensioners. The concessions are not automatically applied. Telstra advised that, as at 31 August 2003, 1,315,314 Telstra customers were receiving the pensioner concessions. (b) Information provided by Telstra, Centrelink and the DVA does not enable the calculation of the proportion of eligible pensioners that have taken up the concessions or rebates offered. This would require further information on: (i) numbers of pensioners holding the relevant payment cards; (ii) of these, the numbers with a fixed telephone service who are Telstra customers for line rentals and local calls; and (iii) numbers of payment card holders living in households that receive the Telstra concessions or rebates.

201,Mr Brough,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Identification of applicants within the electoral division of Bass is not able to be computer generated as electorate information is not a required data field for processing applications. A manual search would require diversion of resources now utilised to process applications. (2) As indicated in part (1), applicants within electoral divisions are not identified. (3) & (4) The transfer of the ANSM assessment functions from Melbourne to Canberra occurred in May 2003. Since then the Directorate of Honours and Awards have implemented a number of initiatives and made significant progress in dealing with the backlog of applications.

Consent is contained in sec 93 of the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999. This allows for any person who is entitled to an income tax refund to give consent to use that refund to pay another persons FTB debt. For ease of administration, consent was limited to the debtor’s current spouse. Sec 82 of the same Act allows the Commonwealth to recover a debt from the income tax refund of a person who has given consent under sec 93. (2) In order for an income tax refund to be used to offset a spouse’s FTB debt, it is a Centrelink requirement that the Customer Reference Number (CRN) be provided to ensure the tax refund is correctly applied, where consent to use the CRN has been given. (3) and (4) Authorisation only relates to consent to use an income tax refund to pay a spouse’s FTB overpayment. The recovery of an FTB debt from the debtor’s own income tax refund is contained in sec 82 of the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999. The Legislation does not require that the Commonwealth obtain consent to use the debtor’s own income tax refund to recover their FTB debt. Foreign Affairs: Iraq (Question No. 2525) Mr Organ asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 7 October 2003: (1) Can he confirm the report in the Sydney Morning Herald on 26 September 2003 that a dozen Australian weapon inspectors have been in Iraq for four months. (2) Is he able to say on what date Australian weapon inspectors were deployed to Iraq.",171,Questions On Notice
202,Mr Costello,"The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer provided the following(3) Can he explain how the Australian jurisdiction extended to Australians serving overseas by the Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Act 2003 will apply to those Australian weapon inspectors who were deployed in Iraq before 1 July 2003. (4) Is he able to say how many Australian civilians were deployed in Iraq prior to 1 July 2003 and can he explain whether arrangements are in place, or planned, to extend Australian jurisdiction to them. (1) and (2) The first Australian Iraq Survey Group Contingent (ASISC), consisting in late October of fifteen Australian weapon inspectors, first deployed to the Middle East on 12 May 2003 and into the Iraqi theatre on 30 May 2003. The second contingent arrived in the Middle East on 2 November and deployed into the Iraqi theatre on 4 November 2003. All the members of the first ASISC contingent had returned to Australia by 14 November 2003. (3) The Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Act 2003 gives the government the power to extend Australian criminal jurisdiction to certain categories of Australians serving overseas. The Act has been drafted so that it may cover certain acts committed after 1 July 2003. The Governor General has recently approved regulations extending Australian criminal jurisdiction to Australian civilians serving in Iraq for acts committed from 1 July 2003. The legislation does not cover acts committed before 1 July 2003. In deciding to allow retrospective regulations to be made, the Government needed to be sure that Australians who were deployed to Iraq were protected by Australian criminal jurisdiction for the maximum amount of time possible. However, in the interests of fairness, the Government also wanted those Australians to be aware that criminal jurisdiction was to be extended over them. The Government issued a media release on 26 June 2003 announcing that the amendments to the Act were to be introduced and that Australian criminal jurisdiction would be applied retrospectively to 1 July 2003 to Australian civilians deployed in certain operations overseas. (4) It is difficult to determine the precise number of Australians in Iraq prior to 1 July 2003. In addition to the indeterminate time frame, Australians have been and are employed in various capacities, some of which are private and therefore not necessarily known by government. As noted in question three, the Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Act 2003 gives the Government power to extend Australian criminal jurisdiction to certain categories of Australians overseas. The legislation does not cover acts committed before 1 July 2003. Foreign Affairs: Islamic Charities (Question No. 2528) Mr Danby asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 7 October 2003: (1) Is he aware of the (a) International Islamic Relief Organisation (IIRO), (b) World Assembly of Muslim Youth (WAMY), and (c) The Charitable Foundations of al-Haramian. (2) Can he confirm whether the (a) IIRO, (b) WAMY, and (c) The Charitable Foundations of alHaramian, is (i) listed by the United Nations as a terrorist group or a group funding terrorist organisations; if so, is it illegal to handle assets or provide finance to this group in Australia, and (ii) listed by the United Nations as having links with al-Qaeda and/or the Taliban; if so, is this group proscribed under the Criminal Code.

Environment: Pesticides (Question No. 2535) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 7 October 2003: (1) Are Australian rivers, lakes, and other waterways monitored to assess whether they are contaminated by pesticides; if so, (a) which agencies carry out this monitoring, (b) does the monitoring examine whether the contamination levels threaten their suitability for drinking water or for fish habitat, and (c) which waterways in Australia have been affected by pesticides or chemical contaminants. (2) Are Australian soil micro-organisms, Australian fish, Australian birds or Australian mammals tested to assess the effects of pesticide use with a view to establishing safe limits for pesticide use, similar to the work by the United States department of Agriculture and the United States Environment Protection Authority. (3) What are the run off characteristics for commonly used chemicals on various Australian soil types. (4) What are the soil absorption rates for Australian soil types for commonly used pesticides. (1)(a)State agencies, research institutions and industry bodies undertake monitoring for pesticides in water. The Commonwealth has allocated funds from 2005-06 for a more comprehensive national program of monitoring chemicals, including pesticides, in the Australian environment. (b) The National Water Quality Management Strategy 2002 (revised) Australian and New Zealand Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Water Quality provide a methodology for deriving locally applicable trigger values (which if exceeded should trigger management action) to protect the environmental values of a water body. For protection of an environmental value of aquatic ecosystem protection, ideal testing would involve collecting data on local species. However, this data is very rarely available (see answer to (2) below) and the Guidelines provide a set of default trigger values, exceedences of which should trigger investigation. (c) As the Australian Government does not keep monitoring data on pesticides, the answer to this question should be sought from State and Territory agencies. (2) There are some programs currently developing ecotoxicological test methods with Australian species (generally aquatic invertebrates and some fish), including those run by the Environmental Research Institute of the Supervising Scientist (ERISS). Work in this area indicates that Australian species generally do not differ greatly in their sensitivity to a broad range of toxicants, although",176,Questions On Notice
205,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:some unique situations may arise, for example with the extremely soft waters of tropical northern Australia, or high temperature waters. Testing on local mammals and birds is forbidden or strongly discouraged in those States which have previously carried out toxicity testing, and testing on fish has also been discouraged for animal welfare reasons. Most testing on Australian organisms has been done using aquatic crustaceans and fish. (3), (4) Specific chemical characteristics are known to the Department of the Environment and Heritage through commercial-in-confidence information provided to the Department by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA). The Department of the Environment and Heritage assesses this information and provides the APVMA with written reports and advice regarding the potential for harmful environmental effects of pesticides (when used as directed). The Department is not able to disclose commercial-in-confidence information. However the APVMA’s website www.apvma.gov.au makes various chemical-specific reports available which can contain some of the information sought. Additionally the APVMA can make its technical reports available on request. Natural Heritage Trust: Funding (Question No. 2548) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 7 October 2003: (1) How much money has been spent through the National Heritage Trust (NHT) in total as at 30 June 2003.

Environment: Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Question No. 2553) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 7 October 2003: (1) What information does the Government have concerning the likely size of the hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica between now and December. (2) Is it likely that the hole in the ozone layer will be larger than that which occurred in 2002; if so, to what extent. (1) The Government has been monitoring the size of the Antarctic ozone hole during this spring using data from international satellites and observational networks coordinated by agencies, including the World Meteorological Organization. The hole peaked in size in September at about 28 million km2. This is about the same size reached by the hole of spring 2000. The ozone hole is now decreasing in size, also at a rate very similar to that observed in 2000. If this year’s hole continues to follow the decay path of the 2000 hole, it will gradually reduce in size to about 10 million km2 by the end of November and then rapidly decay to nothing. The speed of the decay is dependent on the strength and shape of the polar vortex; if the polar vortex subsides at a rapid rate then the Antarctic ozone hole for this spring could dissipate well before December. However, current indications are that the decay process will be very similar to that of 2000. The Government’s recently passed Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill will reduce the threat to the ozone layer and cut Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of nearly six million tonnes of carbon dioxide, or one per cent of 1990 levels in 2010, putting Australia within striking distance of its Kyoto target. The Act sets up a framework through which the Australian Government, with input from industry, can develop the regulations controlling and managing the use of synthetic gases. Industry involvement and support will be critical to the implementation of those regulations and the establishment of a truly national approach to the control of ozone-depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas replacements. The Act will also enable Australia to ratify the Beijing Amendment, the most recent amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. This amendment controls a new ozone-depleting substance – bromochloromethane – and limits trade in ozone-depleting HCFCs to countries that have committed to their phase out. The new Act covers substances such as chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, bromochloromethane, halons, and methyl bromide that are used in air conditioning, refrigeration, fumigation, foam, fire protection, precision cleaning, sterilization, laboratory and analytical research. (2) This year’s Antarctic ozone hole, at 28 million km2, was about 10 million km2 larger than the 2002 hole, but about the same size as the ozone hole observed in 2000. The size of the Antarctic hole each year depends on a number of meteorological factors, as well as on the concentration of ozonedepleting chemicals. In 2002 unusual weather patterns restricted the size of the ozone hole in comparison with those of recent years. Meteorological conditions this year were much closer to average and hence more conducive to the formation of a larger ozone hole than in 2002.",178,Questions On Notice
208,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Terrorism: Capital Punishment (Question No. 2566) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 8 October 2003: (1) Is he aware of the remarks of His Honour Justice Michael Kirby who drew attention to his view on the death penalty during his address in Melbourne to mark the Centenary of the High Court of Australia and, in particular, is he aware of Justice Kirby’s statement that imposing the death penalty is the ultimate acknowledgment of the failure of civilisation. (2) What was his response to the poll conducted in August 2003 in which 56 percent of the respondents replied that they were in favour of the death penalty for those found guilty of committing major acts of terrorism. (3) Can he confirm that he is opposed to the death penalty for all crimes and that he will campaign against those who promote the re-introduction of capital punishment. (1) I have seen media reports on Justice Kirby’s comments. (2) There has been, and will continue to be, a variety of views within the Australian community on the issue of whether the death penalty should be reintroduced. (3) I have said publicly that I do not support the death penalty in Australia. I have also said that I will not stand in the way of public debate on the issue. Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (Question No. 2568) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 8 October 2003: (1) Is there evidence of irresponsible or wasteful use of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS); if so; what is the evidence. (2) What is the cost to taxpayers of the Government’s (a) electronic media, (b) print media, and (c) pamphlet campaign titled Here’s the prescription for a healthy Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme featuring Dr James Wright.

(5) When will details of this evaluation be made available to the public. (1) Evidence of consumers stockpiling PBS prescription medicines has been found in research commissioned by the Department in February 2002 and in November 2002, and by the Health Insurance Commission in May 2003. The February 2002 research found that more than half the people surveyed believed that some people received PBS subsidised prescriptions they did not really need. A similar number thought that people should ask their doctor if they could do without medication by perhaps changing their lifestyle. The November 2002 research found that many people stocked up on prescription medicines for convenience but did not always use them. People also admitted that they often went to their doctor expecting to receive a prescription, which they then filled just in case it was required. This kind of behaviour, while inadvertent, does constitute waste. The Department’s research was supported by specific research into stockpiling of medicines, which was commissioned by the Health Insurance Commission in May 2003.

International Labour Organisation: Child Labour (Question No. 2577 to 2579) Mr Kerr asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 9 October 2003: (1) Does any Australian statistical office, department or agency have responsibility for gathering information on child labour in Australia and, in particular, the worse forms of child labour. (2) What arrangements exist to ensure cooperation between Australian law enforcement agencies and those of other countries with respect to the identification, arrest and prosecution of offenders involved in child prostitution, use of children for pornography and child sex tourism.",180,Questions On Notice
211,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) What assistance targeted at the elimination of the worse forms of child labour is Australia providing to other countries. (4) Does Australia have a national program of action to eliminate the worse forms of child labour. the honourable member’s question: (1) There is no Commonwealth office, department or agency with specific responsibility for gathering statistics on child labour in Australia. Detailed information is provided to the Commonwealth Department of Employment and Workplace Relations by the States and Territories for Australia’s annual reports to the International Labour Organization on child labour. (2) The Australian Federal Police (AFP) has developed an International Liaison Officer Network based in a number of Asian countries, which contributes significantly to ongoing investigations aimed at combating child sex tourism and related offences. The AFP monitors travel movements of paedophiles in and out of Australia through Customs, the AFP International Liaison Officer Network and Interpol, and advises host countries so they can take investigative action in the first instance. The newly established AFP Transnational Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking Team has recently been made responsible for child sex tourism matters and is responsible for the collection of intelligence and facilitates both domestic and offshore investigations into child sex tourism. Australia has signed memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with a number of Asian and Pacific countries. The MOUs provide the framework for close cooperation between the AFP and other law enforcement agencies in the region. They facilitate greater exchange of information on child sexual abuse that may assist in identifying groups and individuals involved in the sexual exploitation of children. Australia generally seeks to assist the home country in prosecution action in the first instance, but where appropriate our child sex tourism offences (contained in Part IIIA of the Crimes Act 1914) are rigorously enforced. As at 1 December 2003, in Australia 16 persons have been charged and 12 persons convicted, with one matter ongoing, under Australia’s child sex tourism offences. These offenders have largely been apprehended on return to Australia or, in isolated cases, extradited to Australia to face prosecution in Australian courts. Nineteen Australians have been arrested and charged overseas, with eight of those persons having been convicted in the jurisdiction in which they offended. A further eight of these matters are ongoing. The Australian High Tech Crime Centre (AHTCC) conducts investigations and coordinates information about online child exploitation matters, including the distribution of child pornography. The AHTCC has established and continues to enhance relationships with international law enforcement agencies bilaterally, multilaterally, via Interpol channels and through the AFP’s International Liaison Officer Network. In addition, the AHTCC has formed relationships with non-government and private sector agencies whose endeavours regularly uncover online child exploitation matters. Through these relationships the AHTCC regularly receives and disseminates information about online child exploitation to other law enforcement agencies. The AHTCC is currently formulating a strategic international relationships policy which will formalise the arrangements with its international partners. (3) The Australian aid program addresses the fundamental causes of child labour and related forms of exploitation of women and children in developing countries. Support for improved governance, in particular strengthening law and justice, human rights, democratic institutions and developing civil society, also contributes to an environment where child labour and other forms of exploitation are less likely to occur. In addition, Australia continues to provide annual core funding for multilateral agencies such as UNICEF and substantially contributes to human rights organisations for their continued promotion and protection of human rights, including those of children. Australia has held talks and workshops with a number of developing countries addressing human rights issues,",181,Questions On Notice
212,Mr Ruddock,"The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer toincluding specific discussions on children’s rights and child labour. Australia also supports a range of bilateral country programs and non-government organisations that focus on local level prevention and support for women and children vulnerable to exploitation, targeted at, amongst other things, the victims or potential victims of child sex tourism and the trafficking of persons. (4) In response to the outcomes document, A World Fit for Children, arising from the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on children in May 2002, the Australian Government is developing a national plan of action based on the commitments within this document. Among the range of issues to be addressed by the national plan is the elimination of the worse forms of child labour. Australia signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography in New York on 18 December 2001. With a view to ratification, the Attorney-General has written to State and Territory Attorneys-General, seeking advice on whether their laws comply with the Optional Protocol and requesting that the issue be put on the next Standing Committee of Attorneys-General meeting agenda. The Australian Government also strongly supports ratifying the International Labour Organization Convention 182 Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour. The Government is working closely with the States and Territories encouraging them to enact legislation that fully complies with the Convention’s requirements, paving the way for ratification. Employment: Assistance Programs (Question No. 2592) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 13 October 2003: (1) Would he provide a breakdown by Employment Service areas of the number of jobseekers expected to enter the Job Network in (a) 2003-2004, (b) 2004-2005, and (c) 2005-2006, distinguishing between eligible Job Network jobseekers and Job Search Support jobseekers. (2) Would he also provide details by Employment Service areas of the number of jobseekers that his Department anticipates will enter (a) Intensive Assistance–Job Search Training, (b) Intensive Assistance-Customised Assistance (first period), and (c) Intensive Assistance-Customised Assistance (second period) in (i) 2003-2004, (b) 2004-2005, and (c) 2005-2006. The department does not estimate the number of job seekers to enter Job Network and the various Job Network services at the Employment Service Area (ESA) level by year. Local labour market conditions vary substantially. However, to assist Job Network members to understand the new Employment Services Contract3 servicing arrangements, a range of data based on historical numbers of job seekers and average operating year information at the ESA level was released on the internet and can be located at www.workplace.gov.au/esc3tender. Housing: Downturn (Question No. 2605) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 October 2003: What assessment has the Government made on the possible impact of a housing downturn on nondeposit-taking financial institutions and associated mortgage insurers and what does this assessment show?",182,Questions On Notice
213,Mr Brough,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,183,Questions On Notice
214,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:According to the Reserve Bank of Australia, the financial sector, including non-deposit taking financial institutions, is well-placed to withstand a downturn in the housing sector. Factors contributing to this assessment include: the relatively strong position of borrowers, with around two-thirds of mortgagees being ahead of their repayment schedule; robust loan-to-valuation ratios, averaging at 65-70 per cent on new housing loans; access to mortgage insurance from sound, prudentially regulated insurers; and the use of residential mortgage-backed securities to distribute credit risk over a wide investor base, rather than the balance sheets of financial institutions. The associated lenders mortgage insurers are also well-placed to withstand a housing downturn. To qualify for the concessional risk weighting applied to housing loans for capital adequacy purposes (under APRA’s prudential standards), mortgages from authorised deposit-taking institutions which have a loan-to-valuation ratio above 80 per cent must be covered by mortgage insurance from an insurer at least A-rated. In determining credit ratings, ratings agencies require mortgage insurers to hold capital sufficient to cover a number of ‘worse-case scenarios’, including a prolonged downturn in the economy and substantial falls in house prices. APRA supervises lenders mortgage insurers and has been monitoring their resilience to potential adverse movements in the housing market. This involves assessment of claim files, reserving, reinsurance arrangements and overall capital strength. Further information can be obtained from the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Annual Report for 2003. Immigration: Unregistered Agents (Question No. 2606) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 15 October 2003: (1) Did he announce on 25 September 2002 that the Government would be acting upon all the recommendations of the 2001-2002 Review of Statutory Self-Regulation of the Migration Advice Industry, otherwise known as the Spicer Report. (2) What action, if any, has the Government taken to implement recommendation 25 of the report to ensure faster and more effective investigation and prosecution of unregistered agents and agents involved in fraud. (3) What specific action has his department taken to (a) attach higher priority to investigations of unregistered practice, (b) build stronger relationships with the Director of Public Prosecutions to facilitate prosecution and the finalisation of cases, (c) revise its guidelines to staff on referring to investigation units cases of suspected unregistered practice or fraud to improve the quality of information referred and the speed of referral, and (d) undertake wider publicity of prosecutions of unregistered practice. (1) Yes. (2) The Government has taken action to implement Recommendation 25 of the Review. This has included the establishment of a Migration Agents Taskforce within my Department in June 2003. This taskforce, has been set up to target the activities of agents, both registered and unregistered, suspected of being involved in organised malpractice and fraud. It has as its key outcomes, the disruption or cessation of these activities through both administrative and judicial sanctions where appropriate. Furthermore, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2003, which is currently before Parliament, contains provisions that will protect consumers and",183,Questions On Notice
215,Mr Hardgrave,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:assist in the successful prosecution of offenders. A key element is a provision that will ensure that civil proceedings cannot be taken against persons who provide information to my Department about the activities of agents. This should encourage clients to complain and testify against those that have exploited them and should lead to an increase in the number of successful actions taken against unregistered agents. (3) (a) Allegations of unregistered practice are given a high priority by my Department. The establishment of the Migration Agents Taskforce has further increased the focus, priority and capacity to investigate unregistered agents and registered agents involved in immigration fraud, or other criminal activities. (b) My Department already has a close working relationship with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and this relationship is being strengthened through the work of the Migration Agents Taskforce. The Taskforce is also working closely with the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Tax Office, Centrelink and the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA) in the collection of evidence and the application of the appropriate sanctions. Coordinated operations with other agencies are a priority in addressing the multi-faceted activity of some of the worse agents. (c) My Department issued a revised Administrative Circular; “Instructions for DIMIA Employees on Making Complaints about Registered Migration Agents and Unregistered Persons Operating as Agents” (AC 1068) on 27 May 2003. The revised circular assists the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) staff to refer information about conduct of concern by a registered agent, or the activities of an unregistered agent, efficiently and effectively. My department’s guidelines regarding fraud information management, “DIMIA Fraud Investigation” (AC 1008) are also progressively being revised and implemented. (d) My Department has taken several steps to increase public awareness about unregistered practice. Improved information about unregistered practice is now available to consumers via my Department’s re-developed web site. This includes more detailed information concerning the referral of information about unregistered agents to the Department, so that such allegations can be investigated. The recently established Migration Agents Taskforce is expected to produce a number of significant prosecutions of unregistered agents. Its focus is on unregistered agents and registered agents involved in immigration fraud, or other criminal activities. Once such prosecutions are finalised, I intend to capitalise on media interest in migration agent issues to further increase public awareness about unregistered practice and the need to use a registered agent.

223,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) (a) and (b). The Australian Government has not yet decided on a funding package for the Mount Lofty Ranges and Greater Adelaide Region. The funding package will be derived from the region’s investment strategy which is based on the region’s accredited Plan. A decision on the projects to be funded will be made jointly by the Australian and South Australian Governments on receipt of advice from the State Assessment Panel and Joint Steering Committee. In making its funding decisions, the Australian Government will have regard for both Australian and State Government priorities as well as regional priorities. (c) Australian Government funding will be provided through the Natural Heritage Trust extension and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. Under the new regional arrangements both these programs require that projects funded demonstrate progress towards achieving a positive change in a resource condition target. Targets have been set by the region for biodiversity and for water quality and the funding package will be structured to work towards these targets. (2) (a) The Joint State and Australian Government commitment to the Upper South East Dryland Salinity and Flood Management Program under the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAP) totals $38.3 million. These funds are sourced directly from the $186 million committed by both governments to the National Action Plan. (b) The South Australian National Action Plan regions: Murray Darling Basin; South East and Mount Lofty RangesNorthern& Yorke Agricultural DistrictsKangaroo Island, have recently submitted an Investment Strategy for consideration by the State and Australian Governments for investment under the regional delivery component of the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan. A decision on the profile and scope of Government investment in each South Australian region, including the South East region, will be made following a comprehensive assessment of each Investment Strategy, including an independent assessment by the State Assessment Panel. (c)(i) The biodiversity offset trades vegetation protection and enhancement. (ii) The arrangements are yet to be finalised by the South Australian Government in consultation with landholders and other vegetation stakeholders. (iii) The arrangements are yet to be finalised by the South Australian Government in consultation with landholders and other key stakeholders. (iv) Unrestricted grazing by domestic stock. (d) None. Funding for the Upper South East Program is sourced from the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. The $350 million commitment to water quality is accounted against Natural Heritage Trust expenditure. (3) (a) When announcing National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and Natural Heritage Trust projects, every endeavour is made to ensure that the media release includes key information such as the project proponent, project highlights and achievements (depending where the project is up to in its cycle), project funding, and species protected as a result of the project. (b) Media releases are made available on the Department of the Environment and Heritage web site immediately they are distributed to media. All Natural Heritage Trust projects are listed in the Natural Heritage Trust annual report, which is published both in hard copy and on the internet. (4) No. The Australian Government does not make project by project information of this nature available. Such an approach would be costly and time consuming to maintain and would divert resources away from supporting regional communities in addressing priority NRM issues. The Natural Heritage Ministerial Board is tracking expenditure against this commitment on an annual basis. (5) (a), (b) and (c) The $124.8 million announced on 22 May 2003 as the Commonwealth's commitment to the protection of the Great Barrier Reef refers to the funding allocated to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for the period 2003-04 to 2006-07. This commitment does not refer to funding potentially available from other sources over this period, such as the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, nor from other announced initiatives such as the Great Barrier Reef Coastal Wetland Protection Programme. Environment: Water Quality Improvement Plan (Question No. 2652) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 16 October 2003: (1) What funds will be available in 2004-05 to initiate new Water Quality Improvement Plans (WQIP). (2) In respect of the media release dated 10 August 2003 which announced a series of “interim water quality projects” for Adelaide’s Port Waterways, is the Government intending to fund interim projects for the (a) Derwent Estuary, (b) Peel Harvey, (c) Douglas Shire, (d) Moreton Bay, and (e) Port Phillip Bay; if so, (i) what projects are proposed at this stage, and (ii) how much is planned to be spent on interim projects in each of these coastal areas. (3) In respect of interim water quality projects, (a) how are they identified and assessed for suitability, (b) what types of projects are typically being funded and why, and (c) what criteria or guidelines are used for funding interim projects. (4) In respect of the statement that “there are no plans to further expand the Coastal Catchments Initiative (CCI) in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) at this stage”, how does he reconcile this position with (a) his statement on 30 January 2003, which “encouraged other local governments and catchment groups adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef to consider preparing water quality improvement plans for their area with assistance available under the Commonwealth’s Coastal Catchments Initiative”, and (b) the May 2003 draft Reef Water Quality Protection Plan. (5) In respect of the advice that only $55,000 is available during 2003-2004 for development of water quality plans in the GBR and that this is allocated to Douglas Shire, (a) has he misled the Queensland community in encouraging their interest in the CCI, (b) has the draft Reef Water Quality Protection Plan also misled the GBR community on the true capacity of the CCI to assist them to improve GBR water quality. (6) In respect of the advice that WQIPs and the findings of these Plans will be incorporated into Regional National Resource Management (NRM) Plans, (a) will the Government give priority to investing through regional investment strategies in the implementation of WQIPs, (b) will this be made clear to Regional NRM bodies and local governments that develop these Plans, and (c) will this planning and investment model be used elsewhere. (1) The Natural Heritage Trust Board is yet to consider 2004-05 funding to initiate new Water Quality Improvement Plans. (2) The Australian Government is already funding interim water quality projects in Adelaide’s Port Waterways, Peel Harvey and Douglas Shire. The Government is yet to make funding decisions on interim water quality projects for the Derwent Estuary, Moreton Bay or Port Phillip Bay. (3) In respect of interim water quality projects; (a) The Department of the Environment and Heritage identifies interim project proposals in collaboration with the agency contracted to prepare the Water Quality Improvement Plan and develops the proposals in collaboration with agencies best placed to execute the interim projects. Interim projects are identified and assessed for suitability against interim project criteria (see below); (b) The types of projects typically being funded as interim water quality projects include: establishing water quality monitoring programs, developing water quality models and decision support systems, implementing water sensitive design, pollution control licensing regulation and practice reviews,",191,Questions On Notice
224,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:identifying, assessing and implementing rural best management practices; and developing market-based instruments for water quality improvement. (c) The criteria used for identifying interim projects include that the project: addresses the pollutant(s) of concern in the WQIP; pursues institutional reforms and capacity building necessary to implement the WQIP; addresses critical sources of the pollutant(s) of concern through targeted and strategic level investments; develops tools, protocols, models or decision-support systems considered critical for identifying, implementing or monitoring cost-effective investments in pollutant load reductions; and/or addresses the cumulative impact on water quality of further agricultural and residential land use development. (4) Further implementation of the Coastal Catchments Initiative in the Great Barrier Reef catchment will be considered in the context of the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan (RWQPP). (5) No. See (4) above. (6) (a) Yes. (b) Yes. (c) Yes, as appropriate and consistent with the objectives of the National Action Plan and the Natural Heritage Trust. Environment: Water Quality Improvement Plan (Question No. 2655) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 16 October 2003: (1) Is the Coastal Catchments Initiative (CCI) the Government’s major program to reduce discharges to coastal water quality “hotspots”, such as Port Phillip Bay and the Great Barrier Reef; if not, how does the Government intend to achieve this objective. (2) Is it the case that the achievement of ecologically sustainable pollution discharges for these hotspots will require informed and strategic investments over the long term, probably over several Parliaments; if so, how will the CCI or other programs ensure an informed and long term approach. (3) What level of investment does the Government consider it necessary to make to achieve sustainable pollution loads at coastal water quality hotspots. (4) How much does the Government intend to invest in each urban water quality hotspot during the financial period 2003-2007. (5) What is the CCI budget for (a) 2003-04, (b) 2004-2005, (c) 2005-2006, and (d) 2006-2007. (6) Will the Government be seeking to implement the CCI in other Victorian coastal hotspots; if not, why not. (7) The CCI seeks to protect “environmental values” through addressing both water quality and environmental flows, (a) how is this defined, and (b) why is this approach not being used to protect all coastal wetlands of international significance. (8) Where the Government does not implement the CCI to protect the Great Barrier Reef, (a) what planning process will be used to address water quality and environmental flows in these subcatchments, (b) will the Natural Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAP) and National Heritage Trust (NHT) Regional Planning process be used. (9) Will he explain the water quality planning requirements under the NAP/NHT and show how this process is comparable to the process outlined in the “Framework for Marine and Estuarine Water Quality Protection”. (10) Has the Government been approached by the local government or Regional Natural Resource Management (NRM) Bodies with an interest in developing Water Quality Improvement Plans in the Great Barrier Reef catchment; if so, (a) which bodies and local governments have expressed an interest, (b) which sub-catchments would these proposals represent, (c) why has action not been taken to date, (d) when will the CCI be implemented in additional catchments of the Great Barrier Reef, and (e) what will be the likely priority sub-catchments. (11) In respect of the draft Reef Water Quality Protection Plan (RWQPP) which identifies possible priority catchments for management action based on ecological risk assessment, do the high risk catchments represent priorities for implementation of the CCI. (1) Yes, for Port Phillip Bay. The Reef Water Quality Protection Plan is the principal tool for the Great Barrier Reef. (2) Yes. The Coastal Catchments Initiative will provide an informed and strategic approach. It will do this by assisting the initial development of seven-year Water Quality Improvement Plans, which are to be reviewed at the end of this period. It will also support the development of protocols and tools to assist catchment planners and guide resource manager decisions. These actions will build capacity of State departments and communities to continue to address water quality improvement beyond the initial investment under CCI. (3) The level of investment will depend on the individual ‘hotspot’, the target pollution level determined, and the timeframe to achieve this target. (4) The Australian Government’s investment in each urban water quality hotspot during the financial period 2003-2007 is yet to be determined. (5) The CCI budget for financial years 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07 are yet to be determined. The budget for 2003-04 is $3,634,000. (6) The Australian Government is currently negotiating possible development of a Water Quality Improvement Plan for Western Port. (7) (a) Environmental values are defined in accordance with the relevant part of the National Water Quality Management Strategy. The environmental values of coastal water quality ‘hotspots’ are identified through public consultation processes. Environmental values for specific ‘hotspots’ determined through such processes are incorporated into the relevant Water Quality Improvement Plan. (b) This approach is not applicable to the protection of all coastal wetlands of international significance, as it does not address all wetland values. (8) Under the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and the Natural Heritage Trust, regional bodies have been designated to develop integrated regional natural resource management plans for accreditation by Governments, for all catchments of the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Regional plans provide the strategic framework through which regional communities can identify natural resource management issues in their region, assess the social, economic and biophysical drivers, develop regional targets, including water quality targets and environmental flow objectives, and identify actions to achieve these targets. Among other matters, regional plans must set out the targets to be achieved for water quality and water flows consistent with the requirements of the National Guidelines for the Accreditation of Integrated Catchment/Regional Natural Resource Management Plans and the National Framework for Natural Resource Management Standards and Targets. Associated with the regional plan will be an investment strategy which outlines the funding required to implement actions in the regional plan and identifies the returns for the investment of the respective contributors. These investment strategies will provide a basis for investments by Governments under programs such as the National Action Plan and the Natural Heritage Trust.",193,Questions On Notice
225,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Governments may invest in those public good elements of investment strategies that accord with the objectives of the relevant funding programs and which contribute to the agreed national outcomes. (9) Under the National Action Plan and the Natural Heritage Trust regional bodies are required to consider a set of minimum matters for which regional targets must be set. If there are no significant natural resource management issues raised with regard to a particular matter, a statement that a target is not applicable and the evidence for this conclusion should be included in the plan. Where significant natural resource management issues are raised with regard to a particular matter a regional target must be set. Actual target levels need to be determined according to each region’s circumstances. With regard to water quality, resource condition targets are expected to be set for: inland aquatic ecosystems integrity (rivers and other wetlands); estuarine, coastal and marine habitats integrity; nutrients in aquatic environments; turbidity/suspended particulate matter in aquatic environments; and surface water salinity in freshwater aquatic environments. Management action targets are expected also to be set for: development and implementation of water allocation plans; and adoption of improved land and water management practices. Indicators related to these matters for target are consistent with the National Water Quality Management Strategy. This Strategy is also the basis for the Framework for Marine and Estuarine Water Quality Protection. (10) Yes, (a) The Mackay-Whitsunday NRM Group, (b) The Mackay-Whitsunday NRM Group has natural resource management planning jurisdiction over the Pioneer, Plane, O’Connell and Pioneer sub-catchments, (c) Further implementation of the Coastal Catchments Initiative is consequent on the outcomes of funding decisions, (d) Implementation of the Coastal Catchments Initiative in additional sub-catchments of the Great Barrier Reef will depend on funding allocations for 200405, and (e) The likely priority sub-catchments are those sub-catchments identified in the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan as representing a high risk to reef water quality. (11) Yes. Immigration: People-Smuggling (Question Nos 2658 to 2660) Mr Rudd asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 23 October 2003: (1) Which Australian government departments and agencies are involved in working contacts with Egyptian court authorities regarding the forthcoming trial in Egypt (resuming on 25 October 2003) of the alleged people smuggler Mootaz Muhammad Hasan (aka Abu Quassey). (2) Is he able to confirm that the charge against Abu Quassey is the manslaughter of 350 people who drowned when their boat sank on its way from Indonesia to Australia in October 2001 as was reported by Reuters and ABC News on 7 September 2003; if not, what is the exact charge against Abu Quassey. (3) Is he able to confirm the report titled “Egypt court accepts Australian help” in www.news.com.au on 29 September 2003 which stated that the charge has been reduced to lesser charges of “causing death by mistake” and “aiding and abetting the entry of aliens without effective travel documents”. (4) If the charge has been reduced, was this done at the advice of Australian authorities; if so, which authorities and for what reasons. (5) Is he able to confirm the reports in the Australian press on 8 September 2003 that the Australian Federal Police (AFP) offered to Egyptian prosecutors for use in the trial “a brief of evidence and witness statements gathered from the 45 survivors” from the sinking of SIEV X. (6) Has the AFP offered Egyptian authorities a brief of evidence and witness statements obtained from SIEV X survivors who now reside in Australia on temporary protection visas (TPV); if so, (a) how many survivors in Australia provided witness statements to the AFP, and (b) what other forms did this evidence take. (7) Is it the case that the Egyptian court has accepted an Australian offer of assistance to prosecute Abu Quassey. (8) Where is the Quassey trial taking place and will the court proceedings be held in public. (9) Is it the case that Australian Federal Police recently revisited some of the SIEV X survivors living in Australia and offered to take them to Egypt to testify in the Quassey trial; if so, is it also the case that the Australian government offered to cover the costs of their travel and that some survivors have accepted this offer. (10) Were guarantees given by Australian authorities to SIEV X survivors living in Australia that if they were to go to Egypt to testify in this trial they would be able to return to Australia after testifying; if so, do the guarantees take the form of a waiver of the conditions of their TPVs that leaving Australia for any reason would result in the automatic cancellation of their TPV. (11) Has he been advised that the higher the number of survivors of the SIEV X sinking who are able to testify in sworn statements or in person before the Egyptian court, the better chance the court will have to establish the facts of the case and to ensure that justice is done and seen to be done. (12) Has he been advised that, if there is not available to the court a body of broadly-based oral or written testimony from a large number of SIEV X survivors, the provision of oral or written testimonies from the few survivors who are currently residing in Australia will place a heavy evidentiary burden on this small number of testimonies. (13) Can he confirm that there are up to 78 surviving persons who are, subject to considerations of age and health, potentially available to testify in this trial. (14) What is the Australian Government doing to encourage and assist the Egyptian Government to establish contact with the large number of SIEV X survivors who are known to be living in other countries that accepted them as refugees. (1) The Australian Federal Police and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (through the Australian Embassy in Cairo) have been involved in discussions with Egyptian prosecuting authorities about the trial of Abu Quassey in Egypt. (2) No, Abu Quassey has not been charged with the manslaughter of 350 people. Australia has been advised by Egypt that the charges against Quassey are: “Firstly: Participated with others unknown, by means of aiding and abetting, to enter aliens to the territory of the state of Australia without having effective travel documents and through points of entry undesignated for that, and to that effect he agreed with those unknown persons to enter the aliens to the territory of the state of Australia by sailing them on a sea vessel to Christmas Island and aided them by supplying the necessary money and sea vessel needed for that purpose. And as a result to this agreement and support, the crime was perpetrated. “Secondly: Caused by mistake the death (Manslaughter) of more than three persons as a result to his negligence, lack of cautiousness, and by not heeding the requirements of safety and security upon sailing a sea vessel to Christmas Island.” (3) The charges made against Abu Quassey in Egypt are as set out in the response to Question 2. I am not aware that the charges have been changed. (4) See response to question 3.",195,Questions On Notice
226,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) Australia has offered Egypt all assistance legally possible. (6) It is an offence, under section 43C of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987, to disclose any information about a mutual assistance request made to Australia. Australia has offered Egypt all assistance legally possible. (7) See response to question 6. (8) The Quassey trial is taking place before the Abdeen Court of Misdemeanours in Egypt. The court proceedings have been held in public. (9) No. (10) No. (11) No. (12) No. (13) There are up to 68 surviving persons who are, subject to considerations of age and health, potentially available to testify in this trial. However, the manner in which evidence is presented in Egyptian courts is a matter for the Egyptian authorities, and is not a matter over which Australia exercises any control. (14) The Australian Government has not been asked by the Egyptian Government to assist in establishing contact with SIEV X survivors who are known to be living in other countries that accepted them as refugees. Office of Film and Literature Classification (Question No. 2661) (1) When will decisions to classify internet content be made available on the online classification database maintained by the Office of Film and Literature Classification. (2) What work remains to be completed by the Government before this can occur.

(2) Has he informed himself of the judgment referred to in this article. (3) What steps does he propose to take to address the issues raised in that judgment. (4) Will he consider these issues as part of the current review of the interaction of family law and insolvency law. (1) Yes. On4 November, the Family Court made a further order in this matter to publish the judgment made on 15 October, which is the judgment referred to in this Sydney Morning Herald article, pursuant to s 121(9)(d) of the Family Law Act 1975.

Notes to the Tables The statistics relate to services rendered on a ‘fee-for-service’ basis for which Medicare benefits were paid in the periods in question (based on date of processing). Excluded are details of services to public patients in hospital, to Department of Veterans’ Affairs patients and some compensation cases. The statistics in question were based on data captured at the servicing provider postcode level. In compiling statistics for the Federal electoral division of Scullin, since some postcodes overlap Federal electoral division boundaries, statistics by servicing provider postcode were mapped to electorate using data from the Census of Population and Housing showing the proportion of the population of each postcode in each Federal electoral division. The electoral division of Scullin comprises the nominated selected postcodes. As some of these postcodes overlap other Federal electoral divisions, the statistics for Scullin are not identical for those of the selected postcodes. Statistics are not available at the individual postcode level due to possible confidentiality considerations. Significant work would be involved in determining if Medicare data could be released at postcode level. Electorate statistics in this response differ from those provided in response to Senate Question on Notice 1972 (Senator Evans), since these statistics relate to services provided in the electorate of Scullin while those tabled in response to Question 1972 related to patients with enrolment postcodes in the electorate of Scullin.

Council of Australian Governments: Law Reform (Question No. 2710)",224,Questions On Notice
245,Mr Abbott,The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the hon,225,Questions On Notice
246,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Prime Minister, Upon Notice, On 4 November 2003:","Has the Council of Australian Governments taken any decisions in respect of national consistency in tort law reform; if so, (a) what are those decisions, and (b) to what extent have those decisions been implemented by the Commonwealth and the States, respectively. On6 December 2002 the Council of Australian Governments endorsed a forward work program to encourage the implementation of the key tort law reforms recommended by the Law of Negligence Review (the Review) in a nationally consistent and timely way. A series of Commonwealth, state and territory ministerial meetings chaired by the Minister of Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator the Hon Helen Coonan have resulted in all jurisdictions legislating tort law reforms. The majority of the reforms fall within the legislative responsibility of the states and territories. The states and territories have recognised the desirability of moving ahead to reform tort law and have made significant legislative progress towards implementing the key recommendations of the Review. To this point, some states have, however, been prepared to embrace more marked changes in their legislative framework than others. Further progress in implementing the recommendations, and in a consistent manner across jurisdictions, would be welcomed. The Australian Government has committed to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA) to support nationally consistent reform by the states and territories. The Trade Practices (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003 was introduced into the Parliament on 27 March 2003. Further amendments to the TPA will be made to incorporate the Review’s recommendations on limitation periods and constraints on damages for personal injury claims, and to underpin state and territory professional standards regimes. Foreign Affairs: Pacific Islands Forum (Question No. 2712) (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2204, are the model provisions referred to publicly available; if so, where can they be obtained.

(1) The model provisions have been finalised and were circulated by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat to Forum members on 21 November 2003. A copy is attached. (2) To date, no country has requested in-country drafting assistance. However, countries have been urged to do so and, now that the model provisions have been circulated, requests for in-country drafting assistance are expected. (3) Since the Nasonini Declaration in August 2002, the Republic of the Marshall Islands has enacted the Counter-Terrorism Act 2002, and Samoa has enacted the Prevention and Suppression of Terrorism Act 2002. Palau has introduced a Counter-terrorism Bill. A number of other jurisdictions have legislation, or are planning legislation, to give effect to undertakings of the Nasonini Declaration. For example the Cook Islands, Fiji, Samoa and Vanuatu have established or are planning legislation to establish Financial Intelligence Units to assist in tracing flows of funds used in criminal activities including terrorist activities.

249,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Human Rights: Treatment of Prisoners (Question No. 2716) upon notice, on 4 November 2003: Has the Government taken any action to ensure that the State and Territory governments comply with the United Nations standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners; if so, (a) what action has been taken, and (b) is the Minister able to say whether Federal, State and Territory prisons and detention centres comply with those minimum rules. the honourable member’s question: The administration of, and conditions within, prisons are matters for the States and Territories. All Australian jurisdictions operate their prisons in accordance with the Standard Minimum Guidelines for Corrections in Australia. These Guidelines are based on the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the Council of Europe Standard Minimum Rules (‘the European Prison Rules’). The Commonwealth Government has supported a review of the ‘Minimum Standard Guidelines for Australian Prisons’ being undertaken through the Corrective Service Ministers’ Conference (CSMC). Consultation on the Minimum Standard Guidelines is continuing and a further report is expected to be considered by the CSMC in June 2004. The Guidelines and accompanying principles are a statement of national intent, around which each State and Territory develops its own legislation, policy and performance standards. The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the treatment of prisoners do not apply to persons held in immigration detention centres.

(2) To what extent do any other agencies have a role in setting such standards. the honourable member’s question: (1) As advised by the Treasurer in response to a Question on Notice (Question No. 2211) asked by Mr McClelland on 12 August 2003, the Reserve Bank of Australia is not responsible for setting standards that financial institutions should follow in order to identify fraud and/or money laundering activities. (2) The Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 outlines reporting and other obligations for financial institutions to counter money laundering. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) has a key role in ensuring compliance with the obligations contained in the legislation. AUSTRAC shares information with a number of partner agencies. Further information on the role of AUSTRAC is presented in the Annual Report.",226,Questions On Notice

(2) What will integration involve and, in particular, will it involve personnel being moved or retrenched from terminal control units; if so, (a) from which airports will that occur, and (b) how many employees will be affected. (1) The Board of Airservices Australia decided on 22 August 2003 to delay the consolidation of TCUs until 2012, subject to the in situ efficiencies identified by staff being delivered by the end of next year. Airservices will consult the Government before any final decision is taken to close a TCU. (2) The long lead time will allow close consultation with staff and their representatives to develop integration plans which minimise impacts on staff and give them the opportunity to arrange their own plans with a higher level of certainty. The details of numbers affected and timing will come from this planning process, but the earliest date any current controllers will be required to relocate is September 2008. Trade: Live Animal Exports (Question No. 2719) 4 November 2003: (1) In respect of the live export trade, (a) how many animals per year are involved, (b) to which countries are they sent, (c) what is the longest journey, and (d) what are the primary causes of death for animals during shipment.

256,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister For Agriculture, Fisheries And Forestry, Upon Notice, On",,228,Questions On Notice
257,Mr Truss,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Welfare concerns once the animals reach their destination are primarily the responsibility of the importing country. While remaining sensitive to cultural differences with our trading partners, Australia will continue to provide support and work towards improving welfare outcomes in the markets where we have some influence. Australia is working through the international animal health organization (OIE) to improve international standards and is in direct liaison with relevant veterinary authorities in overseas markets to improve standards in those markets. Australia’s livestock industries have invested $3.3 million to improve welfare outcomes in overseas destinations, with a key focus on the provision of technical advice and funding to improve unloading facilities, training for abattoir staff and the installation of equipment to improve slaughter practices. Another industry initiative is the permanent basing of an Arabic-speaking veterinarian in the Middle East whose responsibilities include the provision of technical advice on animal health and husbandry practices. These efforts were boosted by the joint announcement on 18 July 2003 by Ministers Truss and Vaile that the Australian Government and the livestock exporting industry will commit $150,000 to a project aimed at improving animal handling in the Middle East and North Africa. Funding of $100,000 will come from industry and $50,000 from the Government. This initiative will complement Australia’s existing programs in the Middle East and North Africa. (3) The live sheep trade is important to Australian agriculture and is a legitimate business sector. It meets particular customer requirements and demands, particularly in the Middle East. Frozen and chilled sheepmeat is not a direct substitute in many markets. Any reduction in live sheep exports from Australia will most likely be filled by live sheep exports from other countries, rather than by Australian frozen or chilled product. (4) (a) Halal slaughter involves ritual Islamic slaughter by a licensed Muslim slaughterman, usually preceded by reversible stunning of the animal. (b) Kosher slaughter involves ritual Judaic slaughter without prior stunning. Establishments undertaking Halal or Kosher slaughter are required to develop AQIS approved programs and the ritual slaughter practices are subject to supervision by accredited religious societies which certify compliance with Halal or Kosher requirements. Ritual slaughter without prior stunning can only occur where approval has been granted by the Secretary and AQIS is satisfied that animal welfare concerns are met. There are no export establishments undertaking Kosher slaughter at this time. Standard slaughter practices are for irreversible stunning to precede slaughter. (5) See answer to Question 3. Health: National Nutritional Survey (Question No. 2723) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 5 November 2003: (1) When was the last National Nutritional Survey undertaken. (2) Why has the Government failed to undertake a follow-up National Nutritional Survey. (3) Has his department undertaken any preliminary work or planning for conducting such a survey; if not, why not; if so, why has that planning not been pursued. (1) A National Nutrition Survey was administered in 1995-6. (2) The Australian Government made no commitment to undertake a follow-up National Nutrition Survey. The Australian Government draws information from a range of monitoring activities including the National Health Survey, the Women’s Health Australia longitudinal study, the",228,Questions On Notice

(3) No preliminary work or planning has been undertaken for conducting a follow-up National Nutrition Survey. The Department is investigating the most cost-effective approach to data collection on nutrition, physical activity and objective health measurements. Aviation: Passenger Movement Charge (Question No. 2735) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 6 November 2003: (1) For the financial year 2002-2003, how much was collected via the Passenger Movement Charge (a) in total, (b) for each month, and (c) at each airport where the charge is collected. (2) Has a report been undertaken by the National Passenger Facilitation Advisory Committee into Australian Customs Service immigration outward control points; if so, (a) who conducted that report, (b) who was consulted in the preparation of the report, (c) what were the report’s findings concerning (i) cost, (ii) resource availability, (iii) strategic requirements, and (iv) the effective delivery of essential functions, and (d) did the report consider the direct cost of extending the time of immigration outward control points to commence three hours prior to the first flights at all international airports, and if so, what were the estimated additional costs. (3) For the financial year 2002-2003, what were the total costs of (a) conducting immigration outward control points in Australia, and (b) the cost at each airport where outward control points are operational. the honourable member’s question: (1) For the financial year 20022003 the following amounts were collected: (a) The total amount collected was $M290.58.

Immigration: Former Child Migrants (Question No. 2739) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 6 November 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2262 (Hansard, 3 November 2003, page 21804), is he correctly quoted in the Sunday Telegraph of 2 November 2003 as stating that the Travel Fund for Former Child migrants ‘has run out of money’ and ‘had been so popular that its three-year allocation of $3 million had been used up in the first year of operation’; if so, how are these statements consistent with his answer to the House on the same matter. (2) What is the total amount that has been spent by the Fund to date. (3) What is the estimated value of applications that have been approved for which travel has not yet occurred. (4) What is the estimated size of the former child migrant population and what proportion of former child migrants is likely to benefit from the Travel Fund under current arrangements. (5) In respect to the erection of memorials in each State, what arrangements, if any, exist for consultation with groups representing former child migrants in relation to the location and design memorials. (1) My press release of 4 November made it clear that I reject claims the Travel Fund has run out of money. The Australian Government is currently meeting all eligible requests for travel from those who have not previously received assistance. (2) Expenses incurred in relation to the Travel Fund from its commencement to 31 October 2003 were $1,570,775. (3) As at 31 October 2003 there were 209 approved applicants who had not yet travelled. If all approved applicants proceed to travel (less than 86% of approved applicants proceeded to travel under the UK Fund), the estimated value of approved applications for which travel has not yet occurred is $1,382,117. (4) The exact numbers of former child migrants sent to Australia is not known. The Australian Senate Community Affairs References Committee report Lost Innocents: Righting the Record (2001), estimates (p.69 of the Report) that 6,000 to 7,500 child migrants were sent to Australia in the course of the 20th Century, with 3,000 to 3,500 being sent post World War II. The number of approved applications to 31 October 2003 is 406. (5) The nature of consultation in relation to creation of memorials is a matter for each State government. States have provided the following advice:",230,Questions On Notice
260,Mr Hardgrave,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:New South Wales The NSW Department of Community Services, in consultation with International Social Service (ISS), surveyed a number of former child migrants applying to the Australian Travel Fund regarding the form and location of a NSW memorial. Consultation is continuing. Victoria The Victorian Department of Human Services, on advice from the Child Migrant Trust in December 2002, is working with the International Association of Former Child Migrants and their families. Their representative has been involved in all discussions. Queensland The Queensland Department of Families undertook a consultation process, which included: contacting as many former child migrants placed in Queensland as possible; ascertaining the level of interest of former child migrants in the establishment of a memorial; ascertaining the views of former child migrants on the establishment of a joint memorial at Neerkol to commemorate former child migrants and former residents; and inviting the participation of former child migrants in a consultation process to establish a memorial. Western Australia The Western Australian Department for Community Development has undertaken the following consultation: Talk back radio both metro and regional radio; Advertisements in the West Australian Newspaper and the Local Community Newspapers; and Two fora were held – invitations to attend were extended to all former child migrants, all agencies who currently work with child migrants, all former receiving agency groups and all child migrant social groups. Discussions are being held between former child migrants, Fremantle City Council and the artists involved. South Australia The South Australian Department of Human Services has undertaken the following consultation on the memorial project: The terms and conditions for the funding have been discussed with a group of former child migrants active in the development of this project, and the support of the Catholic Church in Adelaide is being sought. Letters and advertisements in the newspaper will be used to contact, and seek the views, of those former child migrants not already known to the Department, or to the current active group. Tasmania The Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services will soon advertise across the state, seeking nominations from former child migrants who are interested in participating in a consultative group tasked with developing a plan for the establishment of the memorial. Commonwealth Government: Consultancies (Question No. 2741 to 2758) Mr Murphy asked all portfolio ministers, upon notice, on 6 November 2003: (1) Has the Minister seen the report by Alan Ramsey titled “The taxpayer’s bill where bill is short for billion” in the Sydney Morning Herald on 5 November 2003 which stated that last financial year consultancies let by Commonwealth departments and agencies was over $500 million, up from $313 million a year earlier. (2) How much money was spent on consultancies by the Minister’s department and agencies in the Minister’s portfolios in the financial years ended 30 June (a) 1997; (b) 1998; (c) 1999; (d) 2000; (e) 2001; (f) 2002, and (g) 2003. (3) How much money has been spent on consultancies by the Minister’s department and agencies in the Minister’s portfolio since 1 July 2003. swer to the honourable member’s questions: I am replying on behalf of all portfolio Ministers. (1) &(2) Expenditure on consultancies over $10,000 is reported in each agency’s annual report. Details of contracts, including consultancies, worth more than $2,000 are published in the Gazette within 6 weeks. It would be a significant task for agencies to aggregate the expenditure on consultancies valued at more than $2,000 but less than $10,000 over the last 7 years and the Government is not prepared to divert resources to that task. (3) As noted in the answer to part 2, details of consultancies worth more than $2,000 are published in the Gazette. Family and Community Services: Child Support Payments (Question No. 2760) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 6 November 2003: (1) Can he explain the jurisprudential basis for the assignment of responsibility for the registration and collection of child support payments to the Australian Taxation Office. (2) Is he aware that people owing a child support debt to the Commonwealth are being assessed and required to make payments in excess of the reasonable living expenses of a child. (3) What are the relevant provisions of the law with respect to the calculation of child support payments and what is the moral and legal basis on which calculations are made. (4) Is he able to explain the relationship between the calculable amount of child support debt and the estimated reasonable expenses of raising a child. (5) What is the procedure or remedy available to an individual liable for a child support debt calculated according to the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 and the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 which is greater than the reasonable expenses of raising a child. (6) Can he explain the legal philosophy underpinning the requirement for an individual liable for child support payments being compelled under threat of punishment to make payments where the assessed amount of child support exceeds the reasonable expenses of raising the child or children. (7) Is he able to explain the moral and policy basis for the existence of a system in which the child support debt calculated may be in excess of a child’s needs. (8) What action is being taken to moderate the amounts of debt owed which are in excess of a child’s needs. (1) In October 1998, the Child Support Agency (CSA) moved from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to the Department of Family and Community Services (FaCS), following the creation of FaCS under the new Administrative Arrangement Orders. Responsibility for the general administration of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 now lies with the Secretary (of FaCS) pursuant to Section 11 of the Act.",231,Questions On Notice
261,Mr Costello,The Minister for Finance and Administration has supplied the following an,233,Questions On Notice
262,Mr Anthony,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) and (4) The current system of Child Support formula assessments was established by the Parliament in order to determine what levels of support should be provided for children by separated parents. The child support formula is not based directly on the costs of children, rather it is intended to ensure that parents share in the costs of supporting their children according to their capacity. The formula takes account of the number of children, the level of care provided by each parent, the self-support requirements of both parents and the income of parents as it changes over time. While the child support formula is not based directly on the costs of children, research on costs of children was examined when the formula percentages were designed in 1988. After a review of the Child Support Scheme in 1994, the Joint Select Committee (JSC) recommended the then Department of Social Security (DSS) undertake new costs of children research. The Department Commissioned the Social Policy Research Centre (SPRC) to undertake costs of children research as part of a broader ‘budget standards’ project. Additionally, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM) was chosen to supplement the SPRC research by using different methodology. When considering the estimated average direct costs of children, both reports showed that nonresident parents with high incomes were paying more than the measured costs of children in high income families. However, at other income levels this was not the case. The Government put forward a proposal to reduce the child support liability cap as part of a package of measures reforming the Child Support Scheme. However, the proposal was rejected in the Senate in June 2001. (3) The Child Support Scheme (CSS) was introduced with the bi-partisan support of Parliament to address serious concerns about child and lone parent poverty.Private parental responsibility for the financial well-being of children, even when families have separated, rather than reliance on Government funded programs, is the underlying philosophy of the Scheme. The objectives of the Scheme were amended by the Government in 1997. They are: Parents share in the cost of supporting their children according to their capacity; Adequate support is available to all children not living with both parents; Commonwealth involvement and expenditure is limited to the minimum necessary for ensuring children’s needs are met; Work incentives for both parents to participate in the labour force are not impaired; and The overall arrangements are non intrusive to personal privacy and are simple, flexible and efficient. The legislative framework for the operation of the Child Support Scheme is contained in the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988, and the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. The child support legislation provides for administrative assessment of child support payable (the formula). (5) The Government believes that the current system of formula assessment is the appropriate method for calculating child support obligations in most cases. However, it was recognised that using formula assessments may not result in an appropriate amount of child support in every case. The Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 allows parents who disagree with an assessment to apply to the CSA for a change of assessment where 10 special circumstances exist. Additionally, parents have the option of seeking an assessment from a court with family law jurisdiction if they believe the CSA assessment is unfair. (6) Legislation determines the basis on which child support liabilities are calculated. Where child support responsibilities calculated in accordance with the legislation are avoided, the child support legislation gives the CSA extensive administrative powers to enforce child support payments. These powers include the ability to intercept taxation refunds, deduct payments from salary, wages, and Centrelink benefits, perform searches of declarations of employment made to the ATO and garnishee amounts from bank accounts. (7) This question has been addressed in the answer to Question2 above. (8) This question has been partly addressed in the answer to Question2 above. In addition, the Government is currently awaiting the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community affairs Inquiry into child Custody Arrangements in the Event of Family Separation. The terms of reference include the child support formula.

(1) In 2002-03, 96.5% of general practitioners had at least one bulk billed service processed by the Health Insurance Commission for services rendered in the electoral division of Lowe. (2) The percentage of general practitioners who had at least one bulk billed service processed by the Health Insurance Commission for services rendered in the electoral division of Lowe in (a) 1996, (b) 1997, (c) 1998, (d) 1999, (e) 2000, (f) 2001, and (g) 2002, was as follows: 1995-96 85.7% 1996-97 85.9% 1997-98 89.0% 1998-99 90.7% 1999-00 92.0% 2000-01 90.9% 2001-02 92.0% (3) (a), (b), (c) & (d) Section 19AA of the Health Insurance Act 1973 generally requires doctors who are citizens or permanent residents of Australia to have obtained postgraduate (Fellowship) qualifications before they are able to access Medicare benefits. This is important in ensuring that the long-term medical workforce is of a high quality. There are exemptions from this general requirement for some approved training and workforce programs.

The exemptions for",233,Questions On Notice
263,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:workforce programs have been focussed on areas of significant workforce shortages, such as rural areas (the Rural Locum Relief Program) or after hours work (the Approved Medical Deputising Services Program). Doctors working in the areas concerned must have achieved medical registration but need not have Fellowship. Notes to Answers (1) and (2) These statistics relate to general practitioner providers of services on a ‘fee-for-service’ basis and for which Medicare benefits were processed by the Health Insurance Commission in the year in question. In general terms, practitioners with at least 50% of Schedule fee income from non-referred (GP) attendances in the June quarter of the year in question were considered to be general practitioners. These statistics were compiled from Medicare data by servicing provider postcode. In compiling statistics for the electoral division of Lowe, since some postcodes overlap Federal electoral division boundaries, statistics by servicing provider postcode were mapped to electorate using data from the Census of Population and Housing showing the proportion of the population of each postcode in each Federal electoral division.

Job Network members are to assist unemployed job seekers into the widest possible range of job opportunities. If a job seeker is unemployed and receives Newstart Allowance, including meeting ongoing tests for active job search for all suitable available work, the Job Network member would be eligible for an Outcome Fee if the person secured employment in a seasonal job that met normal conditions as to duration and number of hours worked. However, they do not receive an outcome for placing a job seeker into a vacancy similar to one previously held with that employer.

United States Air Force: Combat Pilots (Question No. 2800) Mr Bevis asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 27 November 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question 2270 (Hansard 13 October 2003, page 21285), what steps has the Minister taken to verify and ensure that United States Air force, Navy and Marine pilots operating ADF aircraft are not using amphetamines. (2) What action has the Minister taken to ensure the United States Air force, Navy and Marine pilots operating US military aircraft in Australia are not using amphetamines. (1) All ADF pilots including United States Air Force, Navy and Marine pilots operating ADF aircraft are briefed that they can only take medications approved by the ADF as being safe to use when flying. ADF medical officers are aware that amphetamines are not listed in the approved list of drugs so are not prescribed to pilots to use while flying. (2) None. United States Air Force, Navy and Marine pilots flying United States missions within Australia follow their own operational policy and the ADF does not have any jurisdiction over the control of their missions. However, it is unlikely that US pilots flying missions within Australia would require or use such medication.

272,Mr Brough,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,252,Questions On Notice
273,Mr Hockey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The abolition of the $50 waiver provision for all passengers, to be replaced with a requirement that duty and/or tax be payable on the full value of goods within any category where the concession limit for that category is exceeded. To coincide with the abolition of the waiver provision, an allowance will be made within the tobacco concession to permit the carriage of one carton (being the current concession) and one opened packet (maximum 25 sticks) without the requirement for duty collection. The adoption of the same concession regime for crewmembers as for passengers, but with a general concession amount of $450. This would replace the current regime of concessions for crew which includes access to standard passenger concessions once per year, an allowance for alcohol and tobacco every 10 days and the waiver of duty and tax liability under $50 on any other occasion of entry. (2) Estimates of the cost of this measure on the Commonwealth can be found in AppendixA of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2003-04. The costing was determined by using ABS data on arrivals and departures and estimating the impact of passengers bringing in extra goods. (3) No. The proposed measures are waiting on the agreement from the States and Territories. (4) No. Environment: Migratory Birds (Question No. 2806) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 1 December 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2545 (Hansard, 24 November 2003, page 22602), can he confirm whether the interim goals of the threat abatement plan were met over the last five years; if not, why not. (2) Will he be reviewing the status of threatened seabirds following the outcomes of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List review published last week. (1) The interim goal of reducing seabird bycatch to less than 0.05 birds per 1000 hooks has been achieved in most Australian longline fisheries, in particular the Antarctic and Gillnet Hook and Trap fisheries. Although bycatch of albatrosses has been substantially reduced elsewhere, the interim target has not been achieved for the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery because the current mitigation measures are insufficient to manage the bycatch of flesh-footed shearwaters. This problem was not identified at the time the Threat Abatement Plan was prepared in 1998 and will be addressed in the revised plan currently being prepared. (2) No. Trade: Endangered Species (Question No. 2807) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 1 December 2003: What he is doing to determine whether or not the (a) Patagonian Toothfish, (b) Great White Shark, (c) Orange Roughy, (d) Southern Bluefin Tuna, (e) Hound Shark, (f) Blue Shark, (g) Nautilus and Allonautilus species, (h) Spiny Dogfish, (i) Maori Wrasse, and (j) Yellow-Crested Cockatoo will be listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES). The Australian Government has yet to finalise its approach to the 13th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species scheduled to be held in October 2004.

I will make public the Government’s strategy when a decision has been made. Environment: Thermal Paper (Question No. 2808) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 1 December 2003: Has he considered the issue of the use of thermal paper and its toxicity; if so, what conclusions has he reached regarding the future use and disposal of thermal paper; if not, what will he do concerning the future use and disposal of thermal paper. The Environment Protection and Heritage Council, a Council of Australian Environment Ministers which I chair, convenes a waste management working group that determines, investigates and resolves nationally significant waste issues. As the use and disposal of thermal paper and its toxicity has not been raised by states, territories or the paper industry as a nationally significant problem, no action is being considered at this time. I understand thermal paper is only used in small quantities in Australia, and as less than 1% appears in the waste paper stream, it can be incorporated successfully into mixed paper recycling processes. I am advised the barriers to recycling thermal paper are the coatings and chemicals in the paper and its low critical strength. The pulping process uses heat which reacts with the chemicals in the thermal paper, making the waste paper pulp dark in colour. Mills manufacturing ‘white’ office and stationary papers with recycled content are therefore unable to use the thermal paper. Mills producing brown cardboard grades for packaging from recycled paper do not have the same colour specification, but require high critical strength. This process, however, can tolerate small amounts of the low strength thermal paper mixed in with higher strength waste paper grades. Defence Property: Environmental Land Value (Question No. 2809) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 1 December 2003: (1) Is he aware of the possible transfer of land from Defence to the Canberra International Airport on the northern boundary of the airport. (2) What studies has the Government made of the environmental value of this land. (3) Are there any threatened, vulnerable or endangered species located on this section of land. (4) Does the Government intend to dispose of the property adjacent to Canberra International Airport, if so, what action is it taking to ensure that the environmental qualities of this property are safeguarded. (1) Yes. (2) No specific studies have been undertaken to date. Within the Majura Training Area, the Department of Defence has conducted studies on the condition of natural temperate grassland and listed species on the site. (3) There are listed species that are known to occur in the area to the north of Canberra Airport. (4) At this stage the Government has not made a decision on whether to dispose of this land.",253,Questions On Notice

277,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Insurance: Medical Indemnity (Question No. 2811) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 1 December 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2340 (Hansard, 24 November 2003, page 22578), (a) what other financial options has the Government considered in meeting the estimated $460 million incurred but not reported (IBNR) liabilities of United Medical Protection Ltd (UMP), and (b) what is the policy rationale for requiring medical practitioners to be subjected to this ‘double jeopardy’ levy. (2) What actuarial advice was relied upon by him and his Department prior to the collapse of UMP and its associated companies that resulted in the calculation of premiums for the IBNR liabilities and will he make this advice public; if not, why not. Will he establish a parliamentary enquiry into how the regulatory scheme for medical indemnity insurance could have allowed IBNR liabilities to accrue without adequate safeguards to cover such claims; if not, why not. (1) The Government announced on 17 December 2003 the replacement of the IBNR levy with UMP support arrangements. The Government will now be funding some $353 million out of the total estimated UMP IBNR liability of $483 million. (2) The Government did not receive actuarial advice prior to the collapse of UMP. Under the Medical Indemnity Act 2002, UMP was required to provide the Australian Government Actuary (AGA) with an estimate of its unfunded IBNR liabilities. On 30 May 2003 the AGA produced a report detailing UMP’s financial position based on this estimate and determining that UMP’s IBNR liabilities were $460 million as at 30 June 2002. The original IBNR contributions were set based on this advice. The report of the Medical Indemnity Policy Review of 10 December 2003 notes that the AGA estimates the aggregate IBNR for UMP at $483 million as at 30 June 2003. However, any contribution on the part of doctors’ only needs to fund that portion of the IBNR liabilities not already funded through other Government measures, including the High Cost Claims Scheme, subsidies and exemptions. It is estimated that doctors will fund $130 million of the $483 million. Following the recommendations of the report of the Medical Indemnity Policy Review the calculation of the IBNR liabilities and levy will be made more transparent. No. At the time UMP’s IBNR liabilities accrued UMP was not offering contracts of insurance and hence was not subject to Australian Government prudential supervision. Subsequently insurers have been brought under the supervision of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Government Departments: Legal Services (Question No. 2813) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 1 December 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2480 (Hansard, 24 November 2003, page 22593), how effective is this policy in preventing departments and agencies retaining such legal practitioners. (2) What legally binding effect and standing does this policy have at law. (3) Can any person challenge at law an appointment of a barrister or solicitor, or other legal practitioner, by a Commonwealth Government agency where that legal practitioner has been previously declared bankrupt; if so, who; if no person can challenge the appointment, what action",254,Questions On Notice
278,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:will she take to ensure that the law is changed such that those appointments may be challenged; if no action will be taken, why not. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The previous answers provided to the honourable member on this issue indicates that neither the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, the Repatriation Commission nor any other agency within my portfolio responsibilities, have engaged any of the named Barristers or legal practitioners who have taken refuge in insolvency as a means of avoiding tax. I believe that the policy is effective in my portfolio. (2) The responsibility for providing any such legal advice concerning the status of the policy issued by the then Attorney-General on this issue is a matter on which the honourable member will need to approach the Attorney-General. (3) Any changes to entrench this policy in law would appear to be a matter for the consideration of the Attorney-General having regard to the powers contained in section 55ZF of the Judiciary Act 1903. President of the United States (Question No. 2823) Ms Hoare asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 1 December 2003: (1) Is he aware of reports of the United States of America’s demands of the Government of the United Kingdom in relation to security measures for the visit of the President of the United States to that country, in particular, (a) the request for diplomatic immunity to armed American special agents, and (b) the request to allow American special agents to carry so-called mini-guns. (2) Were similar requests made by the Government of the United States of the Australian Government for the recent visit of the President of the United States to Australia; if so, did the Australian Government refuse the United States Government request and, if it did not refuse the request, why not. The requests made by the United States to the government of the United Kingdom relating to the security measures for the visit of the President of the United States are a matter between those two governments. I am therefore unable to comment on whether diplomatic immunity for armed American special agents was requested, or whether a request was made to allow American special agents to carry so called mini-guns in the United Kingdom. However, I can confirm no requests for diplomatic immunity for US security officers or to carry so called mini-guns were made to the Australian Government in the planning for or during the visit of the President of the United States to Australia. Australian Grand Prix: Tobacco Advertising Exemption (Question No. 2825) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 1 December 2003: (1) Will he provide a copy of the report by the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research which he considered when deciding that the Australian Grand Prix was an event of international significance; if not, why not. (2) In respect of granting exemptions from tobacco advertising restrictions for major events, can he confirm that he stated ""Economic hardship is not a factor… the Minister must be satisfied that the event is of international significance, and that a failure to specify the event would be likely to result in the event not being held in Australia.”",255,Questions On Notice
279,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Can he clarify whether he does not have to or must not consider whether having an event in Australia is good for the economy and can he explain why this anomaly was included in the regulatory framework. (4) Can he confirm that he is granting yet another exemption from tobacco advertising restrictions for the next Australian Grand Prix. (5) Does he and the Government still have a commitment, as expressed by the former Minister for Health, that tobacco advertising exemptions will be phased out by 2006. (1) A copy of the report by the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research was not included in the Australian Grand Prix Corporation’s application for an exemption for the 2004 Australian Grand Prix. The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 (the Act) does not require it to be provided. (2) Yes, I can confirm this statement which quotes section 18 of the Act. (3) In order to grant an exemption under section 18 of the Act, the Minister must be satisfied that the event is of international significance and that Australia would be likely to lose the event if an exemption were not granted. When determining these matters, the Minister must also have regard to the Guidelines made under section 18, which do not refer to economic matters. (4) I can confirm that the 2004 Australian Grand Prix has been granted an exemption under section 18 of the Act. A notice specifying the event under subsection 18(2) was published in the Commonwealth of Australia Special Gazette of 1 August 2003. (5) The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Act 2000 removes the discretion of the Minister for Health and Ageing to grant an exemption under section 18 of the Act from 1 October 2006. Australian Flag: Logos (Question No. 2838) Mr Organ asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 3 December 2003: (1) Is he aware that the Australian flag sold by BigW as part of the International Rugby Board (IRB) World Cup Official Merchandise was an Australian Flag with IRB logos attached down the side where the Union Jack is placed. (2) Is he able to say whether the IRB obtained official permission to use the national flag in this way and whether the action constitutes defacing the national flag. (1) and (2) I am advised that approval was given by my Department to the use of the Australian National Flag in conjunction with the IRB logo as the use of the logo to embellish the headband of the flag does not constitute defacement of the flag. Trade: Philippine Bananas and Pineapples (Question No. 2873) Mr Katter asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 4 December 2003: (1) Is he aware that notwithstanding scientific findings by Biosecurity Australia in its Draft Impact Risk Analysis of July 2002 that the Philippines has 22 pests and diseases that Australia does not have, the Australian Ambassador to the Philippines was reported to have said that Australia “is willing to accept Philippine bananas and pineapples but under certain conditions”.",256,Questions On Notice
280,Mr Abbott,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,257,Questions On Notice
281,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Is he aware of reports that risk management involved with a grant of access for Filippino bananas would necessitate some 20 tonnes of the toxic, ozone-depleting chemical, methyl bromide, being sprayed onto the imported fruit to decontaminate it. (3) Is he also aware that there are no measures that will efficiently control the disease Moko. (4) Is Biosecurity Australia, a Commonwealth Agency, subject to the provision of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 which states that “The Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency must not take inside or outside the Australian jurisdiction an action that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the environment inside or outside the Australian jurisdiction.”; if so, does Biosecurity Australia hold the required approval, declaration or other permit to allow it to give access to Filippino bananas and on what basis was such an approval given. (5) Will exposing Australian flora and fauna to 22 diseases and pests and/or to the heavy amounts of toxic chemicals used for risk management be likely to have a significant effect on the environment; if so, should the “precautionary principal” in the Act be applied in this case. (6) Does he intend to permit Biosecurity Australia to proceed with the decision to admit bananas from the Philippines. (1) No. (2) No. (3) No. (4) Yes, Biosecurity Australia is subject to section 28 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). Biosecurity Australia does not require an EPBC Act approval, declaration or permit. An importer would require a permit, issued by the Director of Quarantine under the Quarantine Act 1908. A decision by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency to grant an authorisation under the Quarantine Act 1908 is not an action that requires approval under the EPBC Act (section 524). (5) The potential direct and indirect impacts of quarantine pests and pathogens on the environment are considered by Biosecurity Australia, in consultation with the Department of the Environment and Heritage, as an integral part of each import risk analysis. They may be considered significant subject to the individual assessment and risks associated with a proposed import. Methyl bromide is commonly used around the world as a quarantine fumigant. Its use for quarantine purposes is presently exempt from the phase-out provisions of the Montreal Protocol. The Government has provided funding of $816,000, through the Ozone Protection Reserve, to support methyl bromide phase-out projects. This includes $72,000 to trial alternatives for quarantine and pre-shipment uses. (6) See (4) above. Employment: Job Seekers (Question No. 2882) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 4 December 2003: Over the duration of ESC2 and for each employment assistance program, what were the levels of educational attainment (i.e. did not complete Year 12; completed secondary school; holds a university qualification; or holds a trade qualification) of those jobseekers who secured employment after participating in an employment assistance program.",257,Questions On Notice
