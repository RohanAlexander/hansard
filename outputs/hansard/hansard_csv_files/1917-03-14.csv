14,I Ask The Honourable Mr Groom,"The honourable memberthe Treasurer if it has been definitely decided to make an additional payment on account of the 1915-16 wheat pool. If so, what sum per bushel is to be advanced, aud on what date will such payment be made? Sir JOHN FORREST A t the request of the Australian Wheat Board, the Treasury has agreed to make the necessary financial arrangements to enable a further payment of Is. per bushel, less rail freight and handling charges, to be made to the wheat-growers in the "" old pool,"" making a total payment of 4s. per bushel, less rai l freight and handling charges. involve making a temporary advance to the Wheat Board of a considerable amount in addition to the funds from sales coming to hand; but the whole amount advanced will, it is believed, be liquidated by the Wheat Boardi n a very few months. It ' is expected that this payment of Is. per bushel, less rail freight and handling charges, will be^made available about the end of A p r i l . that the 1915-16 Wheat Pool is, to all intents and purposes, out of debt, w ill the Treasurer be good enough to review his decision and allow the farmers a further advance of at least Is. per bushel at their railway stations? Sir JOHN FORREST mise to do anything more without consulting the Wheat Board. The proposal that has been made is a very liberal one, and the farmers have to thank the Government for it . out of their money for a long time. Board has not, received the money, because tbe wheat has not been shipped. It is only through the Government coming to its rescue that the Board has been able to do what I have just announced. made the statement yesterday that it was the intention of the Government not to charge the duty on cornsacks to the farmers. I ask h i m now whether it would not be a better course to do as I suggested last week, namely, to wipe out the duty altogether, instead of adopting the circuitous method proposed. better to do so. There are many things that could be done in that way if the House would agree, but once the portals of the Tariff are opened, where are we going to stop ? How can we draw the line between cornsacks and woolpacks? The honourable member for Maranoa has already made the suggestion that the duty on woolpacks should be remitted. ister also allow the raw material for the manufacture of cornsacks and bran bags to come in free, in order to place the This w ill manufacturers here on the same footing as the farmers? placed on the same footing, but I have ascertained that for all practical purposes no cornsacks are made in Australia. Sacks are made here, but not sacks for holding wheat. bags are made here. In view of the fact sacks. To the extent that they are made in Australia the raw material w ill be free of duty, just as the cornsacks are free of duty to the farmer. I cannot proister representing the Ministerf o r Defence a question w i th regard to the food supply at the Seymour Camp, and in order to make my position quite clear, I w ill read a very brief extract from a letter from a gentleman who writes in regard to his son and several other lads in the Seymour Camp, as follows: Hy son has just left Liverpool with a host of other Granville boys, and they are now in Seymour Camp, and every boy writes home complaining of the rotten food. My son says there will be a riot if the food does not improve. I understand that the soldiers in this camp are provided with meat which was purchased from the Queensland Government eighteen months ago, and has been in cold storage ever since. That is one of the gravest causes of complaint. orable member that I w ill make inquiries into the matter, but I think that the allegation that the meat has been eighteen months in cold storage is not correct.

The reply is as follows:Members of the Signal Corps at the Port War Signal Station, Cheviot Hill, are granted twenty-one days' leave per annum, the same as all other persons on mobilization duties. This station is somewhat isolated, but steps are being taken to insure that the men will be changed to other positions more frequently. The statement that no additional rations have been issued to the number of men employed over sixteen is not correct, as rations are issued for every man employed at the station in accordance with the ration scale. Fresh meat is supplied every day, except that a twodays' supply is issued on Saturday. The allowance is 1-J lbs. per man per day, 1J lbs. of bread is supplied to each man daily. Dry stores are supplied twice a week, the quantities PAY OF THEAUSTRALIANNAVY . being for each man:Butter, 5 ozs. per week. Sugar, 2 ozs. a day. Flour, 2 ozs. a day. Raisins, 1 oz. a day.

I late production, and provide food supplies for GreatB r it a in during the war, w ill the Government consider the question of adopting the Imperial policy of guaranteeing the farmer a minimum price for Honourable members his wheat for, say, two harvests ? ber is aware that the Governments of the four wheat-producing States, together say, by way of with the Commonwealth Government, have agreed to guarantee to the farmer a minimum price for the 1917-18 crop. If the honourable member now asks me whether we are prepared' to do the same in respect of the 1918-19 crop, I must say at once that I am unable to give that assurance. In the first place, the arrangement is one in whicli the State Governmenta jointly and severally take the liability of the amount, each for its own State, while the Commonwealth finances and, as it were, endorses their bill . Until the Wheat Board, as well as the State and Commonwealth Governments, have had an opportunity of considering the question of the 1918-19 crop, and what prospects, if any, there are of marketing that crop, I ' t h in k it would be premature for ns to speak of what the Commonwealth can do. In respect of the coming crop, however, every farmer in the Commonwealth has the positive assurance that he has a guaranteed price of 3s. per bushel f.a.q. at the station. The Wheat Board has made a recommendation, and I hope the States will agree to it , to substitute for that a guaranteed price of 4s. per bushel f.o.b. The Commonwealth Government approve of that recommendation. for the Navy any information to give the House regarding the request for an increase of pay to the non-commissioned ofiicers and men of His Majesty's Australian Navyi n consequence of the in creased cost of living ? that I have no information to offer.

I might fairly call this question a "" rascal "" ; and, if I get over it, I think I shall do pretty well, considering the difficulty of the matter, and the fact that I did not hear quite the whole of what the honourable member said. The subject is most complex; and the assistance that my honourable friend, the member for Maranoa, gave me yesterday in regard to wool packs, will help me very much. PerhapsI might be permitted to furnish the House with what information is at my disposal in regard to the transaction generally. This will, at any rate, clear up some of the points raised by the honourable member for Wannon, particularly as to what interest may be expected, and, consequently, what probabilities there are of a writing-off or setting-off, as against a later appraisement, in the amount of the settlement. As this matter ie of great importance, I make no apology for setting out. the position in detail. A t the close of last year, negotiations were concluded with the Imperial Government whereby tlie balance of the clip was sold at the flatpaid as bounties for the encouragement rate of 15Jd. per lb. of greasy wool. The necessary machinery haa been installed, and put into working order. At'first, the work of appraising the wool was slow, but, now that appraisers have had experience with the operations, excellent progress is being made. The payments regularly follow the appraisements, and a deduction of 10 per cent, is retained by the Commonwealth Government to cover any contingencies that may arise through overvaluation of wool by the experts. In other words, 90 per cent, of the appraised value is paid at the close of each appraisement, and the adjustment will be made' at the close of the final appraisement on the 30th June next. The point to. whioh I wish to direct the honourable member's attention is that the money represented by the 10 per cent, deduction is invested with the Bank of England,-and is earning interest for the whole of the time, and the proceeds will be added to the ''wool-growers? account,""'and form part) of the final 'distribution. In addition to the interest earned on the 10 per. cent.. 1 deduction, a considerable sum of moneywill be returned on earnings from exchange as between London and Australia; The Central Wool Committee have also recommended that the manufacture of wool tops for export shall be controlled by the Commonwealth Government during the war period. This has. been confirmed, and agreements have been . prepared for the proper performance of the extension of contracts for wool tops for Japan. The price obtained . for the wool tops is that, fixed by the Imperial Government, so that the buying and selling prices are controlled by the Government. Substantial monetary guarantees have been lodged for the due performance of these contracts by the manufacturer. As to profits arising from these contracts, all documents and accounts will be investigated and audited by an independent accountant, and approved by the Central Wool Committee ; and of the net profits 50 per cent, will be paid to the Commonwealth Government, and the remaining 50 per cent, will be retained by the manufacturing company. It will be seen that it is proposed to divide the profits. It is probable that if this wool scheme be extended to cover next season's wool, in addition to the clip now in hand, sufficient money will be recovered by the Commonwealth Government to equal the amount and establishment of the wool tops industry in Australia since its inception. There is this to be said, that the amount of the clip that is not required for Imperial military purposes will be sold to manufacturers* in Britain, and the difference between the flat rate of 15Jd. plus freight and insurance, and the price obtained, will be divided between the growers and the British Government. The grower, therefore, whether he hae his wool appraised early or late, is to look, first of all, to the fact that the 10 per cent, deduction is earning interest, then that he is making money out of the exchange, which he never did before, that he is getting the highest price he ever got in his life, and that he is going to get a still higher price, or half of the profit of all wool sold for other than military purposes; and, lastly, the community is to be congratulated on the fact that the wool top industry is to be kept going here, the export rates, being maintained, and we maintaining our manufacturing interest.",7,Destructi On Of Rabbits

In reply I have to say that Australian soldiers abroad seek redress, in the first instance, from their own Australian officers, who are bound by the DefenceA c t . They can then appeal to General Bird wood, an Imperial officer, who, with the approval of the Imperial authorities, was appointed by the Australian Government as the General Officer Commanding Australian Troops. The honourable member for Brisbane also referred to some other circumstances which, he said, indicated considerable dissatisfaction among the troops, and these will be inquired into, and the bonorable member advised later. honourable member has sent me a letter in which several complaints are made in a very vague way. one letter containing an allegation that, when a soldier dies the blanket in which he ia buried is charged against h i m . shall make inquiries concerning the general allegations, but, as I earlier said to the honourable member for Echuca, it would be much better if honourable members would specify time and place, and so on, so that we may at once get to bedrock.

I wish to mention one or .two of the facts of substance that this measure is in tended to cover. Its object is to provide for the men at the fron t an opportunity to vote. that freedom without which our Constitution, political institutions, methods of election and the like would be futil e and vain. They have, in the most efficacious manner, recognised their supreme duty to their country, and by their deeds at Gallipoli, in France, and in every theatre of war in which Australians have been present, have won for their native country a prestige of achievement which it is for others to emulate as well as to praise. The Ministry consider that, however difficult it may be to obtain a proper method of voting, it would be a great pity if these men were nob given an opportunity-subject, of course, to military necessities, as to which we are in communication with the Imperial Government-to discharge one of the highest functions of citizenship, by voting for candidates for the next Commonwealth.

If they are qualified in other respects, the fact that -they have discharged in the most efficacious way their obligations to the Commonwealth, and to the Empire, will give them the right to vote, even though they may not be enrolled. question was asked early in the day by the honourable member for Nepean concerning the men employed on the transports. those on a ship of war? vessel of war, and, by international law, is not subject to the ordinary contingencies of war. It would be very hard to make provision for the voting of munition workers, who may be grouped in two classes. There are, first, those Our soldiers are fighting for who went Home at the invitation of the Imperial Government, sent through this Government, and who may, therefore, be regarded as associated with our Military Forces, their names appearing on lists.

As for the voting at the front, it would be impossible to follow the methods in vogue in the Commonwealth requiring the men to vote according to the electoral divisions from which they went away. In the Commonwealth there will be six Senate ballot papers, one for each State, and seventy-five ballot-papers for the divisions returning members to the House of Representatives. The men at the front, however, are not grouped according to their States, and it would be practically impossible to provide the machinery that would enable them to vote according to State and elec-toral divisions.

102,Mr Glynn,"The voting being by the whole, seeing that the Empire is at war, and that the war has reached such a critical stage, there is some justification for saying that the ordinary electoral rights of the persons covered by this part of the B i ll must give way to a reasonable degree of caution as to the possible effect of their votes at an election. Exemptions are provided in clause 10, sub-clause 4. This clause provides that the following persons shall be exempt: (a) Any member of the Forces who is serving outside Australia; (6) any person who produces to the presiding officer a certificate signed by the District Commandant of a Military District, or an officer thereto authorized by him, that that person is or has been a member of the Forces, or is a parent, or the wife, brother, or sister of a person who is or has been a member of the Forces; (c) any person who satisfies the. presiding officer that he is or has been at any time during the present war a member of the Parliament of the Commonwealth or of a State; (d) any person who satisfies the presiding officer that he is a Christian, and either a Syrian or an Armenian. Any person who belongs to a family which has discharged its duties by sending some member of it to 'the f r o n t will be regarded as one who can exercise his right co vote. It is also thought that Christian Syrians, who are devoted to the British Empire, should be permitted to vote. A t the recent referendum, provision was made by which the parents who had a son at the f r o n t could vote; but this B ill extends that privilege to the parent, wife, brother, or sister of a person who is or has been a member of the Forces. to persons inside Australia, or only to those overseas? front are entitled to vote. The parent, wife, sister, or brother of any one who has discharged his duty in this crisis of the Empire by becoming a member of the Forces is not disqualified by the B ill . The only disqualification is that of a person who was born in enemy territory, but there is a slight modification in the proviso to sub-clause 2 of Clause 10, which readsProvided that a person claiming to vote, who was a natural-born citizen or subject of France, Italy, or Denmark, and who arrived in Australia, and was naturalized before the date upon which the territory in which he was born became part of Germany or Austria (as the case may be) shall not be deemed to have been born in an enemy country, if he produces to the presiding officer a certificate in the prescribed form, which has not been revoked. A person covered by this proviso can obtain a certificate by applying to the Electoral Officer, and submitting reasonable evidence to show that he is entitled to one. All these matters will be provided for by regulation. The efEect of the proviso is that if a man was born in SchleswigHolstein,' or in that part of Poland which, after he came' out to Australia, became part of Austria, he is not to be regarded as having been born in enemy territory. be entitled to vote abroad be likewise entitled to vote in Australia?

""Member of the Forces"" includes more than actual combatants. in two weeks of the issue of the writ, and his name is not on the roll, can he vote ? soldier can get a certificate saying that he is entitled to vote, and he can present it at any polling place and vote.

Practically in all cases the division in which he was entitled to enroll as an elector would be indicated as his residence on the military list. Returned soldiers who are enrolled would vote for the division in respect of which they are enrolled. It will be necessary to take the military lists as a guide; but, as I have said, in nearly every case, the places of residence as given on the military list will coincide with the electoral divisions for which the men are enrolled.

There is no other point to which I need draw attention at this stage.

BILL. Debate resumed from 13th March (vide That this Bill be now read a second time. -When the debate on this Bill was adjourned last night, I was discussing the method by which the Prime Minister proposes to confer certain benefits upon users of cornsacks, and particularly the farmers of Australia. I wish to emphasize my objections to that method, which, in my opinion, is very questionable. A far more wholesome and legitimate course .would have been to submit an amendment of the schedule to this Bill. might have embodied it in a small list of amendments, and have said, "" We require these amendments to be made, but are not prepared to go any further at this stage with the revision of the Tariff."" Had they done so, the Bill would have passed just as speedily as it will do in the existing circumstances. the Prime Minister unlimited power under the War Precautions Act to make regulations dealing, amongst other things, with the Tariff. If at any time an influential deputation points out some serious Tariff anomaly, and can sufficiently impress the Prime Minister, he may bring its representations before the Cabinet, and, provided that he can convince his colleagues of the wisdom of granting the request of the deputation, he may, by Order in Council or by means of a regulation under the War Precautions Act, do what the deputation asks. In this piecemeal way the Government can withdraw nearly all the benefits that the Tariff gives through the Customs House. I am not objecting to this proposal in regard to cornsacks merely because it is a concession to be granted to the farmers. In the existing conditions, I think that the remission of the duty on cornsacks would be unanimously agreed to by the House; but it is tbe method by which this concession is to be granted to which I take exception. Such a system opens the door to abuses, and will reflect no credit on the Parliament or the Administration which sanctions it. We already have a long list of concessions and innovations, made by way of regulation, in regard to various industries. As the result of a deputation which waited on the Prime Minister, and which consisted principally of the sugar growers and the sugar-millers, the Cabinet quite recently came to a certain decision with regard to the sugar industry. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which is one of the biggest combines in Australia to-day, and is in a position to make bigger profits than ever before, must be included amongst the sugar-millers. Cabinet does not alter the agreement. ber is aware that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company owns at least half-adozen sugar mills in Queensland, and controls the industry in New South Wales. rid of? way to get rid of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and of any other company which is manipulating things in its own interest and against the public, and We are giving that is for the Commonwealth Government to take absolute control of the industry. The decision at which the Cabinet has arrived in regard to the sugar industry will mean the doling out of money already in the public purse. It is a most unwise one. At the behest of a deputation, the Treasurer is told by a majority of his colleagues to dip his hands into the public Treasury and to hand out to a section of the community a very large sum of money. has been reading the Age.

If tbere were one reason more than another for the journey which the Prime Minister made to the other side of the world, it was that he should do something in this regard. That, so f a r as I was concerned, at all events, was the main reason why he undertook that mission Unfortunately, things in that regard are still unsatisfactory. If we are not to do anything for the industries of our country merely because there happens to be a certain difficulty in the way, then we are recreant to the promises we made and to the principles we espoused when before the electors. October, 1914, shortly after the elections, I suggested to the then Prime Minister a means by which this country could be placed in a f ar better position than she is now to meet the times coming after the war. Our organization is almost n i l . Wo organization can be complete in this direction without a proper T a r i ff schedule.

A t Maryborough, in 1913, the then Prime Minister, Mr Fisher, for the first time in the history of the Labour party, made the policy of Protection one of the chief planks in the platform ; and that was only as the result of continued agitation against great odds. In 1914, that declaration of policy was repeated; and then we had a kind of Tariff schedule laid on the table, We ought to and I can assure the House that it was great work to get even that mongrel schedule. In the present state of the party, there are not more than two members .who might be called Free Traders, and even they have recanted.

137,Mr Palmer,"The slowing down policyable member made that interjection. The honourable member for Dampier spoke of how the slowing down policy was crippling the steel industry in New South Wales. In refutation of that statement, we have the sworn testimony of one of the largest employers of labour in this country. manager of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company. He was questioned in regard to the adaptability of Australian workmen in connection with the establishment of steel works, and he said, on oath, "" We do require a few men who are experts at the trade, but, generally, the ordinary in the Commonwealth mills that can roll out telligent working man such as we find in Australia can do the work, and I say of the Australian that he is one of the best and most adaptable workmen in the world."" The man who used those words is one of our biggest captains of industry, and he speaks from a wealth of experience. I would refer the honourable member for Echuca to the testimony also of the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria. prise that council are graziers and farmers, and, according to a paragraph in the Affe this morning, the council had had certain work carried out by contract, and some by day labour. done under the contract system for Is. Sd. per square yard, and by day labour for Is. 3d. per square yard. That is the experience and testimony of some of the most conservative men in the community. We contend that, with proper guidance by the employer or overseer, day labour beats contract every time. Evidencei n support of that view is overwhelming. Recent experience in the Old Country has provided another proof of the efficiency of Australian workmen. putable testimony that Australian fitters and others who went to England to engage in war work are carrying out in seven hours certain operations in ^connection with the manufacture of guns that used to occupy the English workmen eleven hours. Yet these are the men who, honourable members allege, are slowing down. Men who come to Australia from America acknowledge that tbe pace of the Australian workman is too hot for them. Far be it from us in Australia to do as they are doing in certain parts of America, where men are being killed outright at their occupations. According to the finding of a medical commission which investigated I am glad the honorindustrial conditions in the United States of America, these are the four stages of ill-health through which the workmen pass:-First, fatigue; secondly, colds; thirdly, tuberculosis; and finally, death. A t thirty-five and forty years of age, men are too old and broken in health to be further employed by the large employers I refer to Mr Delprat, the general of labour. The Prime Minister ridiculed my proposal for the establishment of steel works in Australia. We are in this lamentable position, that, if anything went wrong witb some of the steel plates of tbe vessels that defend our shores, we have not in a plate. We talk about the setting up of workshops of our own for naval repairs, but we have not a mill capable of rolling a steel plate. I admit that, at Newcastle and Lithgow, steel rails are being produced, but that is only one small department of steel work. The steel industry must be extended, and Tariff or no Tariff, if private enterprise will not develop the valuable iron ore deposits of Australia, The gentlemen who comthe Commonwealth 'Government should proceed to do so. If the recommendation of the Public Works Committee had been adopted, the Government would be to-day manufacturing all its own cement, and Asphalting was would have been saving £ 2 or £ 2 per ton. Here is another important point: The honourable member for Lang stated that we ar© protected to a certain extent by reason of the seas not being free, because those foreign vessels which brought large quantities of goods to Australia are not coming to our ports to-day. That is true. But, although the competition of Germany has been shut out, goods are entering the Commonwealth from another country.

Minister in England, a number of us waited as a deputation on the Acting Prime Minister, and said that we did not consider that the Bureau of Science was doing enough for Australian industries. The Acting Prime Minister said that something more would be done. mises were plentiful, but there has been no performance. Looking at Australian conditions, not only during the continuance of this awful conflict, but also in the period to follow the declaration of peace, one cannot regard the prospect as other than gloomy. We have wonderful advantages, and a country that contains everything necessary to make our people hnppy and prosperous, and f u l l of employment and industry; yet, with 300,000 men absent from Australia, there are thousands of men unemployed throughout the Commonwealth. This is a disgrace to us as a people, and we shall be reproached by all other parts of the civilized world if , after the war, this country, still almost virgin of industries, is crowded with unemployed. A r e our soldiers, when they return, to swell the army of the unemployed ? God forbid ! We must bestir ourselves. We can do something.

Something of the same sort occurred just before the last Proelection, and the price that was paid for support by a certain section of candidates was that they pledged themselves to high protective duties. That promise had a marvellous effect, so far as Victoria was concerned. The party which offered what seemed to be wanted was returned with an overwhelming majority. It had such strength in both branches of the Legislature that it could do anything it liked, and was, therefore, under the obligation to f u l f i l the pledge by which it secured election. Therefore, shortly after the new Parliament met, an amending Tariff schedule was introduced, which increased the rates of duty on a large number of items. Those who think that the salvation of the country depends on a high Tariff were inclined to sling their hats into the air as if the millennium of prosperity was about to dawn. The amending schedule that I speak of, though it has not received the ratification of Parliament, has been in operation ever since it was introduced. Hasi t had the effect of benefiting local industries ? It is the Tariff which was introduced by those who are now clamouring for higher protective duties. According to the honourable memTo-day the ber for Maribyrnong, high duties will multiply the number of industries existing in our midst. All of us, I suppose, would be inclined to support anything that we thought would do that.

CaucusI man there I failed to get salvation 1 Are we to wait until after the war to revise the Tariff? Are we going to allow this country to be filled with tihe dumpings of all the world? That is what it will come to. In all the warring countries there is the best and most up-to-date scientific machinery; in fact, when the war is over, Great Britain will be one of the first industrial countries of the earth. America is already so, Japan is already so, and Germany and Austria will be. If we frame a real, one-column Tariff-and I do not say we have not tried or that there are not honourable members opposite who feel in the same way-w e shall be in a position, after the war, to say to all tike nations of the earth, ""Reciprocity."" finances of the world on £120,000,000 in We shall have something to sell-w e shall have a valuable market to exchange. Buti f , after the war, wo start to impose a Tariff, there will be so many divisions, so many columns, and so many preferences that our little industries will not be able to compete with 'those of other countries. In the little State of'Tasmania, nearly all the factories had virtually to close in fiscally fighting only the mainland; aud that was simply because the Tasmanian manufacturers were financially Weak, as compared with those of the other States. Great Britain was the greatest Protection-' ist nation on the earth for years, until she had built up her great industries,, and had millions of money invested. Then, when she had built up her mighty industries, and was able to manufacture . for the world, she started to become gradually Free world goods; but soon the world outside began to use Protection against her .; and when the war brokeout, she was no longer the greatest manufacturing power in the world. It was America that held that position, and yet America has [413]2 been built up by Protection, as it was Pro-' tection that built up Germany and made -that country rich. For two'years and a half Germany has beeu financing the war out of the money, credits, and wealth she gathered from the world by means of Protection. France was another Protectionist country, and is in a similar position, HowI have battled in that Britain was supposed to be a Free Trade country. Free trade, on account of her wonderful banking system, was better for Britain than Protection, in the sense that we desire it. Britain was a creditor country, and the banker of the world. London was the chief exchange city of the world for years. More exchange was written in sterling there than in all the other money denominations of the world prior to the war; but, at present, more is written in dollars. When the war is over, if Britain enters into a nonsensical trade war, she will never be the financial centre of the world again; if she does not, the financial centre of the world must go back to her. Why? not need Protection. It will be through her wonderful organization of ' banking, and .of acceptance houses. Just think of itl In 1907, Britain was operating the gold. The United States had nearly £400,000,000 in gold, and yet many of her banks closed their doors. Why1 Because she had no great organization like Britain. Why is it that America can never become the financial centre of tbe world 1 Because there is no speculation going on in America, except in American securities,On the other hand, you m a j go to Britain and speculate in any securities, almost those of MarB. That is because Britain has her bill houses, her acceptance houses, and her foreign exchanges. A Chinese merchant has tea, and a business man in Australia requires tea. The business man goes to his banker in Australia, and the banker finances him. The Chinese merchant does not know the business man, but he knows the acceptance house in London, and through it he sends the goods, the acceptance Trade. She sold all the house becoming responsible to him for the money of the Australian. This organization is lacking ih every country except Great Britain.

221,Mr Kingo ' Malley,"I was a carer getting his cheque. I looked at his cket, and then I looked at his eyes, and always knew how his internal arrangements were. The honourable member for Yarra has spoken as Leader of the Opposition, but, speaking for myself, I say that we on this side should not rest u n t i l we get a Tariff that w ill make this country independent of the world. If we desire .to deal w it h other countries, we should give Great Britain the preference, and other countries reciprocity, but an Australian Tariff we must have. There is nothing that Australia cannot produce. It . has every sort of climate. Those who aire not healthy and happy can go to Tasmania, which is a healthy, hopeful country, and those who do not like Tasmania can come to Melbourne to get into the wind storms. My impression' is that the war w i ll not last long. because of what I have read in letters written' to people in America by relatives in Germany, and, published in the press. I honestly believe t £ a t for months past Germany has been in a hopeless state of collapse. like some which appear in our press, contain lies. 80 . the Tariff now. Sir JOHN .FORREST.'-It is'impossible. think it is impossible. Some honourable member suggested that the Government should prevent the importation of motor cars. that some American scientist has discovered that alcohol, or "" stagger-juice,"" can be utilized for motor cars instead of petrol. If that discovery proves to be a success, motor cars will be so cheap that the Government will not be doing righ t in ' depriving the people living in the Australian interior of the opportunity to meet each other. The old buggy and pair are of :no use nowadays. in wet weather? horses would cost as much to feed as would pay for the petrol for a motor car. I have read that motor cars are sold in America to the trade at £ 4 9 each. The utilization of motor cars enabled the French to drive the Germans across the Marne. If the French command had not been able to transport troops from Paris to the Marne in a few hours the Germans would have been in Paris. I wish to read what Professor Anderson, ofHarvard University, wrote in regard to the labour question. My experience is that if you meet and talk w it h men they w ill always meet you on reasonable conditions. There were strikes enough on the trans-Australian' railway, and the men complained to me about their tucker-shops. Their complaint was just, and I immediately ordered the officials to put the tucker-shops in repair, and conduct them departmentally. They charged up the £600 worth of repairs to I express that view the cost of the first week's running of the establishment, in the same way as £60,000 was charged up for the expenses in connection with the establisnment of the Commonwealth Bank. I have been reading in the press constantly that the tuckershops lost £60 0 in a short period, and in the same way it was said that the Commonwealth Bank had lost £60,000 in tbe first year. If the men at the head of the T h a t is not railway had been good business men, they could have operated the tucker-shops at a good profit by charging 25s. per week. I know ladies who are doing well in MelI do. bourne by charging only 18s. .per week. I do not My name will live in connection with the Commonwealth Bank when many are dead and forgotten. The Tariff is part and parcel of the industrial life of Australia. This is what Professor AndersonI advocate that. saysI have read The question of industrial warfare nnd the great losses entailed by strikes and lockouts is indeed fundamental. Employers are often lacking in apprehension of the right relation between employer and employee. If the employers were to consider the employees from the view-point of their requirements as human beings-that is, men under the obligation in general to continue the work of the country through their children, who require to be wellborn, well-reared, and well-educated-the y might find themselves in agreement with the demands of the employees as to the living wage. There were, doubtless, few instances among A pair of the numberless strikes which totalled appalling losses in which the employees demanded more wages than would afford them even limited opportunity to advance the true well-being of their children and familiesa well-being essential to the country's future.",28,Elliot Johnson Wha T Is All Agreed I Think That Our Cities Are

230,Mr Kingo ' Malley,"Do honourable members deny that?Modern industry rests on the law of supply and demand, and, therefore, proceeds on the wrong assumption, namely, tliat the necessary labour and men and women should be paid for on tlie basis of the same law of supply and demand that determines for the product of labour. That is the cause of all the trouble in Australia between the working men and their bossesThe dominating public opinion of the Commonwealth is at last becoming enlightened as to the fundamental wrong of putting human labour and the material products of labour in the same classification as articles of barter and sale. This issue goeB deeper and broader than we can realize. We know its complexity, but it isust be solved. Strikes may be stated as the recurring protest by producers of the country's wealth against the results to them of thc various methods of distributing the product which modern civilization has developed to so high a degree. These methods of division include all business Bteps, from transortation to banking. I am profoundly condeut that the workers' hopes lie in the success of justice. The rights of the producers of wealth must, as a matter of course, come before the claims of those who, controlling the distribution of the product in its multiform equations, not only fix tbeir own salaries in the form of profits, commissions, and foes, but purpose tn continue to fix the wages of the industrial producers by individual contracts. ployers gave more attention to what is necessary for the decent living of the employees, there would be more happiness and less trouble. Haxvard was founded in the early colonial days of America, and has always been known as the home of the ' 'boodleier ' ' ; yet its Professor of Economics had the courage to state his opinions in the words I havo read. always take the stand that, because they have the management of business affairs, they should not condescend to meet their men, but discussed differences with their employees, there would be hardly any strikes. while I was in charge of the transcontinental railway? months before I became Minister there were sixty-one strikes. concessions did I grant? Very few. I allowed the men to hear the other side, and, generally, they were satisfied when they had done so. which men should be treated.

Isi t any wonder that we find in HolyW r it that the wicked fleeth where no man dares to follow 1 Men have come into this House pledged to the h i l t to a Protective Tariff, yet Australia is the dumping ground for the foreign producer. A tariff should be arranged scientifically so that the protection should be based on the difference between the high cost of Australian labour t h a i gives the Australian working man the chance of bring-, ing up his family in decency, and not under conditions of hunger and starvation and the cost of cheap labour outside. To claim that the cost of transportation is sufficient defence is useless. It is no defence nowadays. The Government should realize what a mighty country we have walled in , as it is, by great oceans, but it can only 'grow when its people have a love for it . We do not hear Australians singing Australian songs. The children If thc emin our schools do not sing about Australia as American children sing The Star Spangled Banner.

If Ministers were true Australians, and had the spirit of Australia in them; if they loved the hills, the valleys and rivers, the inexhaustible lands and mines, and the people of this great country, these would be the songs that they would be singing.. not wish to waste the time of the House as it is being wasted. The attitude taken up by honourable members of the Opposition in regard to the Tariff is quite untenable, and no one knows it better than they do. ' They know very well that the delicate balance of the nations is such that any untoward event or presumptive action on the part of any All y at this juncture might have very far-reaching effects. Therefore, all this talk about the necessity for an immediate revision of the Tariff is so much hot air. Por one thing, time will not permit of an immediate revision of the Tariff, but, altogether apart from that point, the circumstances are such that any attempt to touch the Tariff just now would be most unwise. Honourable members opposite know this f u l l well, hence it is only right that the country or, at any rate, those who read Hansard sliould know that all the talk that is now being put up in the House is merely an electioneering placard. The grandiloquent language of honourable members, and the spread-eagleism of the honourable member I propose to for Darwin, will not get us any f u r ther forward in Australian affairs. If honourable members were really honest in their protestations they would fall into line with what has been done on this side of the House, and would get their representations heard in the proper quarter. By actual contact with those on the other side of the world they would know just what it is possible for us to do at the present time. We know that we cannot act independently. The talk of some honourable members reminds, me of the attitude of the children of rich parents who, being secure in their positions for the time being, by reason of parental provision, can be impudent to all the world. These arrogant foolsI do not know that I should use those words, but certainly some honourable members are behaving as if we were not a country that, is absolutely dependent on the strength of our paternal protector. It is our paternal protector who has made it possible for us to go as far as we have gone and to be as independent as we are, and no. one knows better than honourable members opposite the extent to which they have exhausted all the possibilities of the liberties which we enjoy in this country. When they talk about flouting the advice which has been given from the highest sources, and about erecting a high Tariff barricade, they are simply courting disaster. When they reflect upon the actions of a Government which has recently gone out of office they are obviously reflecting upon some members of their own party. They know that perfectly well the Leader of the Opposition was largely responsible for the conduct of the Hughes Government. He was Minister for Trade and Customsi n the first two Labour Governments that held office during the currency of the war, and no one knows better than he does the difficulties that stand in the way of interfering with the Tariff. I do not know that the honourable member for Yarra has been urging the revision of the Tariff at this particular time, but his followers have been urging it , and, therefore, they are reflecting on their own leader, or else the honourable member has lost the wisdom that be displayed on this side of the House by the change that has taken place..

I would go so far as to say that even now if they would nominate a representative he should be sent Home with the delegates already chosen. However, that matter is not under discussion now.. They have not been satisfied to take a constitutional course. .They have not been satisfied to sink party differences and take a hand as true Australians in doing the only that it is now possible for us to do. They have neglected the constitutional method. They have spurned it ; and yet they have the presumption to charge the Government in this House with not attending to the Tariff. They charge the Government with having failed to do what they know very well we dare not do. Dr. MALOITEY -Nonsense. remark I should expect from the honorissue which must be considered. able member.

Conservatives had a majority of one, and we enjoyed ourselves very much. Since the passing of the 1908 Tariff no effort has been made to bring in such a schedule as would establish the true form of Protection. ' There are many reasons for this, and I propose to put one or two before 'tlie House. The present Parliament came into existence after the outbreak of war, and both parties avowedly supported Protection, despite the fact that both had a leavening of Free Traders. A t the last general election the Labour party came back with a majority, but with the exception of a little b it of patchwork, which was good so far as it went, nothing has been done to establish a truly Protective Tariff. The amendments brought in by our present leader, who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, provided for certain increases, but the Tariff was f u l l of anomalies in the sense that in many 'Cases the duties imposed were not sufficiently Protective. A t the close of this Parliament we are in practically the same position that we occupied in 1908. I shall not quote figures, but we know that the Tariff of 1908, to a large extent, built up industries in Australia, with the result that in 1910-11 our exports were considerably in excess of our imports. Since that time we have so gone to the bad that today our exports are about £12,000,000 less in value than our imports. There is not an honourable member, not .a thinking man or woman in Australia, whether Free Trader or Protectionist, but realizes that this cannot go on. We have to consider coolly and calmly what can be done to break down that wall which stands in the way of our doing what we know we ought to do from an industrial standpoint. This is a serious question for every honourable member, no matter what constituency he represents. Even the honourable member for Parkes, who is no doubt of the same opinion he was years ago, must admit there is something wrong when our imports f ar exceed our exports, and we are not producing gold to pay for the difference. ing millions of pounds' worth of'produce, which the lack of shipping does not enable us to include in our exports.

Of course, it is the argument of Free Traders that if we do not import goods we cannot send away our raw material-that if ships are brought here in ballast, the fact only adds> to the cost of sending away our produce. Irrespective of the fact that there are millions of pounds' worth of wheat and other commodities that cannot be exported because of the peculiar position in which we' find ourselves to-day, it must be admitted that our exports have not increased in the same ratio that our imports have. If we can import tons of commodities, we ought to be able to export produce of equal value, for it is the value, and not the tonnage, that has to be considered. However, what is our position to-day ? W& aretold that there are certain things we cannot do because of the present situation. Tbat is said by the present Government, and was said by the preceding Government, and the Government before that. There is something in the air that prevents our moving.

A r e we to understand that one section of the community may discuss such matters, while another section, which happens to consist of members of Parliament, have their mouths closed ? If so, it does not appeal to me as a fair position in any respect. I believe that tlie Protectionist associations and the Protectionist press are quite justified in the stand they have taken, but their weakness is that they opposed the referendum in the year before last. A t that time the Labour party-of course, this was before the rift-ha d decided to take a referendum on certain questions, an affirmative reply to which would, have enabled this Parliament to protect the manufacturer, the consumer, and worker alike. ever, the intrigue that took place; how the State Governments promised the present Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Labour party, to concede to the Commonwealth Parliament certain powers which would render the referendum unnecessary. Unfortunately, that offer was accepted; and we know now how it was honoured. Now we are told that there is no need for action, because the Government possess all the requisite power under the W a r Precautions Act.

When, some three When the referendum was proposed, we were told that it was a most inopportune time-that we ought not to have the turmoil and strife of such a contest while we were at war. Further, some cant was in dulged in , and we were implored to think about our boys at the front, and not to divide the people at such a time. That is the sort of stuff we were asked to listen to. The position was just as serious at the I cannot think that these front, and even more serious, in 1915, than it is to-day; and then, as now, we had these objections raised. Thet r u t h is that the Protectionist associations of Australia did not wish to give this Parliament power to fix prices and wages conditions, bu t preferred the old form of There Protection; and, unfortunately, the Free Traders helped them to gain their point. Newspapers are allowed to change their minds every three months or three days, but if a politician, after due consideration, arrives at the conclusion that he was not right in the past, he is hounded down from one constituency to another. The Protectionist leaders and newspapers said, in 1915, that the time was too serious for the submission of the Constitution Alteration Bills to a referendum, because it would rend the people asunder. I ask whether that referendum would have rent the people asunder as much as did the referendum on conscription. able members on your side, in addition to° yourself, who bother about the New Protection nowadays?

Australia is the only country in the world that has unemployed, and if there is any difficulty in deciding what shall be done by the different nations engaged in this fight in the matter of commercial arrangements, I remind the British people that Australia is in a different situation from any other portion of the Empire; and if it be necessary for them to make arrangements with our Allies as to future commercial relations, they should leave Australia out of any such arrangements, and make an agreement that relates only to the trade of Great Britain. day is one vast 'hive of industry, because a great portion of its population is engaged in producing munitions of war. A similar state of affairs obtains in the countries of the other combatants. tralia the position is different. We have not had the opportunity to engage in the production of munitions, and we have not the industrial establishments for the purpose. Moreover, we shall never have them if some specious reason is always advanced as to why we should not make our Tariff effective. I wish to read an extract from to-night's Herald. Messages of similar import have been published frequently. I do not know whether that is done for the purpose of taunting Australians, or to in cite them to gird up their loins and to make them"" realize how foolish they have been in the past.

When we see Canada getting enormous contracts from Great Britain, and have regard to the fact that the Dominion has been manufacturing munitions during the war, we must see that Australia will go by the board unless it takes some steps to protect itself. Men are returning from the front, and a large proportion of them will not be too eager to resume occupations in which they were engaged before they left Australia. The war will unfit many of them for their former trades. Of course, all the warring countries will be in the same position, but the others are industrially prepared and Australia is not. sary Tariff protection is a contributory factor, what are the other main deterrents to getting industries on a good footing ? tance is a deterrent. whether that is so or not, but I do know that the principal deterrent to an increase in our industrial activities is the insuffiof the workers. ciency of the Tariff duties. The men who have invested their money in industrial establishments are not likely to increase their productivity unless they can feel assured that they will get a ful l opportunity of making good. They are not likely to substitute new machinery for old until tbey are assured of a return on the money invested. I admit that a Tariff a thousand times higher than the present will be useless if we attempt to manufacture with the old order of machinery. But before up-to-date machinery can be installed we must give men who invest their money some security of tenure. I know that by a sudden increase of duties there will be a possibility of a peculiar situation being created; but surely there is enough common sense in Australia to devise some legislative machinery that will give security to the manufacturer and to the consumers during the transition from the present order of things to the new. I suggest, in order to prevent the inflation of prices when the increased duty is imposed, that if it is known that other countries are rushing material into Australia in order to sell before the higher duty operates, the Government should be given power to prevent that material being landed. If we are not likely to manufacture locally for a number of years sufficient of a commodity that is in much demand, and there is a likelihood of some body gaining enormously by an increase in the duty, we might make provision either that the duty should be increased by degrees, or that it shall come into operation, by proclamation, as soon as there is' a reasonable guarantee that the interests of the consumers are safeguarded. It is useless to say that some arrangement cannot be devised that will meet all requirements. An idea has been created in the minds of many people that we have no right to discuss the Tariff, but I say, again, that Australia is in a different position from the rest of the Empire. Other countries are prepared for manufacturing; Australia is not, and something must be done immediately, otherwise Australia will be made a scapegoat. there to create industries with the labour I do not know troubles we have? are brought about by the underpayment dency for the men to want the employer to take all the risk while they get all the profit ? visited a country where such a state of things prevailed, but that does not happen in Australia.

Now that we are on the eve of au election we are told that we must not breathe a word about the Tariff question.

Having heard bis plea for the protection of the dried f r u it industry, I voted for the duty that the Government then proposed. But I find in going through the files of the Age that since the war began dried fruit s have risen in price, not £ 1 per ton, but many pounds per ton, although for the last two years the crops ha/ve been better than ever before. The consumer has not benefited in the least by the duty on dried fruits. What do we gain by exchanging a f a t importer for a f a t manufacturer?

If Protection is to benefit industries in this young country, I am going to give all the reasonable Protection that any Government chooses to propose, because I believe in starting industries and in giving them some chance of succeeding. in making people use Australian goods. Goods manufactured in Australia are equal to any that are produced in other parts of the world. About three years ago, when I was in a shop in South Melbourne purchasing a pair of boots for 17s. Gd., two working men entered the establishment. They described the boots they wished to purchase, and the attendant in the shop brought along some of Marshall's boots, good enough for the King to wear. something better than that. Have you no imported boots?"" bat they are very expensive."" And what did he do but put some of Marshall's boots into a box labelled Bostock, and bring them along; but these men said they were not the right shape, and they left the shop. Protectionists, and these Victorians wanted to buy imported boots at 30s. a pair, while I , as a Free Trader, was satisbers know, they come solely from India, b u t fied with the Australian article at 17s. 6d. a pair. On another occasion I went into a shop in Swanston-street to purchase a pair of boots. I asked for Australian made boots, and they tried to palm off on me an imported pair, but I would not take them, although I am a Free Trader. It just shows what thoroughbred Protectionists will do. The iron industry is a great industry, and we have all the raw material here', millions of tons of iron ore merely awaiting the efforts of the miner to dig it out. If we give a measure of protection to that industry, and those which are allied to it , I believe that Australia will become a rich and prosperous exporting and manufacturing nation. Question resolved.in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause1 agreed to. Clause 2In this Act"" Tariff proposals "" means the proposed duties of Customs introduced into the House of Representatives on the following dates, namely :3rd December, 1914 -(Relating to the -Tariff on goods other than those imported from and the produce or manu^ facture oi the Union of South Africa). 3rd December, 1914 -(Relating to the Tariff on goods imported from and the produce or manufacture of the Union of South Africa). 12th December, 1914. I believe al?o 9th June, 1915. 12th November, 1915. honourable members yesterday that it was my desire to move some amendments to the Bill. I am afraid that if we pass this clause the proposals referred to will have been agreed to, and it will be i m possible to amend them: Therefore, I am anxious to know whether this is the right place for moving any amendment. But they said, "" We want validating provision. This is merely a definition clause. ing the Tariff proposals of 3rd December,. 1914, and I propose to move an amendment to item 129 of the Tariff proposals submitted on that date. This item deals with jute piece goods for the manufacture Victorians are rampant of cornsacks, which. I think, should be free of duty, no matter from what country they are imported. As honourable memI propose to move that they be free. I propose to take the same step in regard to item 134 dealing with cornsacks but I do not wish it to be said that I sought to remove the duty on cornsacks, and place the local manufacture at a disadvantage by retaining the duty on its raw material. I move That item 129 of thc schedule submitted on 3rd December, 1914, as follows :"" Hessians and brattice cloth; jute piece Roods; bookbinders' cloth; bunting-a d val, free, and 10 per cent."" be amended by leaving out the words "" 10 per cent."" and inserting in lieu thereof, the word "" free.""

I am anxious'that the collections of duties should be validated aa is proposed in clause 3, and I cannot see that clause 4, dealing with the construction of certain items of Tariff proposals, presents any opportunity for moving in the direction I desire. If I am assured that I cannot move any amendment on this clause, I shall have to move that the ruling be dissented from . Act to validate the collections of duties of Customs under Tariff proposals. Therefore, any amendment such as that suggested by the honourable member is necessarily precluded I contend that it is not in order to submit an amendment of tbe nature moved by the honourable member to a Bill which, merely proposes to validate the collection of certain duties. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN ( Mr the honourable member for Yarra desired come under clause 2. and so far as I can see from a very cursory glance at the B ill , it cannot be accepted on any clause. I rule, therefore, that the amendment is out of order. move that the ruling be dissented from . The Government surely did not draw the B ill in such a way that they could say, "" We were prepared to consider any amendments, but the Chairman ruled them out of order."" The words "" Tariff proposals,"" in clause 2, certainly refer to the proposals which were) laid on the table on the 3rd December, 1914 If words mean anything, then I submit vides that' for the purpose of this measure, "" T a r if f proposals"" means the proposed duties of customs introduced into the House of Representatives on a .certain date. The honourable member seeks to amend a schedule that was before the Committee of Ways and Means some time ago. That thc ruling be dissented from. I second the motion. The Assistant M i nister is apparently carrying out a win, tie, or wrangle policy, which is only in accord with the actions of the Ministryi n regard to another place. . MrW . ELLIOTJOHNS ON (Lang) [9.15] I maintain that the ruling of I do not see any other the Chairman is sound. The purpose of this B ill is primarily to validate duties which are being collected under a resolution of the House, and not by the authority of an Act of Parliament. It is undesirable, for reasons which have already been explained elsewhere-reason s of an international character-to reopen the Tariff at the present time; we cannot do it owing to the war. ThisB ill will enable us legally to retain the revenues that have been collected' during the past three years under resolution laid before the Committee of Ways, and Means. It will also legalize the collection .of these duties until such time as a new Parliament shall have been elected and can deal with the whole question of the Tariff.' If you, sir, had decided that any item could be amended, I should have claimed the right to propose reductions in a number of items occurring in the schedule before that which to amend. I should, for instance, have prooosed to make certain amendments in division 5, which deals with textiles. Asi t is, I submit, sir, that, having regard to the title of the B ill , which is to validate the collections, your ruling is correct. Trade and Customs) [9.18] I wish it to be clearly understood by the Committee that it is not the intention of the Government to accept any amendment whatsoever. Those of which we have given notice are not designed to raise or lower duties, but merely to validate the duties already imposed. that, under clause 2, we have power to move an amendment in any part of the schedule.

It is preposterous that a Ministry, without a majority in another place, should take such a stand, and absolutely put aside a definite promise made by Mr Andrew Fisher, when PrimeM i nister, that the Tariff should be dealt with in the first session of this Parliament. Meeting after meeting of Parliament has been held, and any attempt to deal with the Tariff has been blocked by the Free Tradersi n Caucus, and in the House. It is simply ridiculous to tell us, in mysterious tones, that we would ""Tremblei f we only knew a l l "" ; and I regard it as an insult to a great nation who has been our f a it h f u l ally, and carried out every pledge she has made.

I move That the following new clause be inserted: Notwithstanding anything contained in any Act, the Government of the day shall be empowered to correct any anomalies and to increase any duties by regulation under the War Precautions Act, or by any other legal process, to give Protection to our manufacturers. If the Government will accept this proposed new clause it will get them out of a very difficult position. It will enable them to remove any anomaly in the Tariff, and every one knows that the present schedule contains hundreds, if not thousands, of anomalies. Further, it w ill permit them to increase the duties on any article manufactured in Australia.

There are men who call themselves Liberals, and, perhaps, others who do not decorate themselves with the name, who can be relied on to assist the four honest men I have mentioned, if the Government seek to do any injustice in their dying days. Trade and Customs) [10.50] I am afraid » I shall have to use the same argument in relation to this amendment as I used in relation to other amendments. is one to validate something that has been done, namely, the collection of certain duties. Here is an amendment which goesquite beyond the validation of the duties, and proposes to give the Government power to increase duties. say, is quite outside the title of the B ill , member for Melbourne and his nominal and, further, it would place a wonderful power in the hands of any Government, and leave them to do practically what they liked with the Tariff. The Government have a certain power now, inasmuch as they may meet in Cabinet, and, at any time, place on the table a Tariff resolution to at once take effect. That power the clause only seeks to give in another way. cordially sympathise with both the mover of the proposed new clause and the M in ister. The latter gentleman is very naturally anxious to have the Committee assume that he is one of the four righteous persons to whom the honourable member referred in his eulogistic speech, and he is, therefore, prepared to believe that the Government could properly exercise the tremendous powers proposed. the proposal in regard to increasing duties. suggestion to the Government that they may, by Orderi n Council, reduce any duties. For the first time. I have seen If there was only some disagreement between the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Melbourne, inasmuch as the latter would give power to reduce duties. This, I take it , is a well-considered motion, submitted after consultation with the party opposite, for I am quite certain the honourable member for Melbourne would not launch a proposal of such importance without a solid backing behind him. I am also sure that the honourable member would not so change the apparent purpose of the motion without the complete acquiescence, not only of his party, but of his leader. I hope that the motion will not be ruled out of order, but that we may have a vote on it as it stands, or as the honourable member for Melbourne is prepared to see it amended.

I wish to tender my "" meed of praise "" to the honourable member for Melbourne for having displayed such confidence in the Government, especially after the hard and bitter criticism of the Prime Minister from honourable members opposite.

The honourable member for Melbourne is to be commended, and I shall certainly, throughout the length aud breadth of my electorate, emphasize the fact that, when it came to a critical point, he had such confidence in the Government as to trust them to deal with the Tariff as they choose. Why do the honourable member's colleagues desert him? They have immediately held a party meeting, and did not even wait until they got upstairs before holding it They might have waited until they got to the party room before bringing pressure to bear on the honourable member, and I appeal to that honourable gentleman not to allow pressure to be exerted on him in the House. Why should he be compelled to withdraw such a proposal ? It was the honourable member for Indi, I think, wbo brought the pressure to bear, for he rushed and brought his leader in, and now we find the honourable member for Melbourne deserted because he has shown his confidence in the man whom his colleagues have so bitterly criticised. -Accepting the suggestion of the Minister and the honourable member for Wentworth, I should like to alter my amendment to readNotwithstanding anything contained in any Act, the Government of the day shall be empowered to correct any anomalies by regulation under the War Precautions Act, or by any other legal process, to give Protection to our manufactures.

It might possibly be held by a person who has not closely studied the Standing Orders that this Bill, being merely a Customs duties validation measure, cannot be amended in the direction I have indicated; but I suggest that any doubt as to the legality of an amendment such as has been in the minds of some honourable members fails on the ground that any validating Bill can validate to any extent, and with any exceptions the House may care to name.

I have received certain information which' confirms rumours that are widely current throughout Australia as to the very harsh penalties which are being imposed On Australian soldiers who are tried for disciplinary offences. In England recently two young fellows were charged with having been absent without leave, they having lef t Salisbury Plain and visited LonA disdon.

He then almost demanded rations, and the officer replied-, I understand, "" You w ill ters of this kind would be dealt with more be wanting my afternoon lea next."" Thereupon the spirit of the young fellow asserted himself, and he insulted hiB officer because of the contemptuous treatment meted out to him. He was immediately arrested, and was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment, serving five months in Egypt, and completing the remaining seven months in the Geelong gaol only the other day. The offence was committed under the strongest possible provocation, and splendid military services and a fine record were blotted out by it . The conduct of British officers at Salisbury Plain and elsewhere towards Australian soldiers, and the severity of the penalties they impose is widely commented on. The other day I asked the Prime Minister whether, if he went Home to the Imperial Conference, he would make inquiries, with a view to getting an alteration of the system. English officers do not understand the spirit of (she average young Australian, who cannot knuckle down in the servile manner of men in some other parts of the world, and therefore come under their displeasure.
