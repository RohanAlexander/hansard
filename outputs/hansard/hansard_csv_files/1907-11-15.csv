7,Sir John Quick,"I desire to present; Youi 'Committee have examined the Petition And signatures, or what purports to be the signatures, attached thereto. Of these there are iixty-six. Letters have been written to Messrs. Heath -and Mitchelmore, tbe solicitors who prepared the Petition on the instructions of Mr James Beveridge, of Gundagai, to Mr Beveridge, and vto Messrs. Edmondson and Co., of Wagga Wagga, to whose premises, according to Mr High Court for decision the sooner it is Beveridge, the Petition had been sent for signatures to be obtained, and replies have been received giving the information requested so far as available. Your Committee are of opinion that the following names attached to the Petition purporting *o be signatures are not genuine signatures, but are, in fact, forgeries, viz. :"" Alfred Deakin, Melbourne."" "" Harry Foran, Dom., Sydney."" "" May Francis, Crown-street, Sydney."" "" Beattie Booth, Reservoir-street, Sydney."" "" H . C. Walker, Customs House, Sydney."" Your Committee find that at the bottom of .page 2 of the Petition there has been written in ink what purports to be "" W. J. Lyne, Sydney."" An attempt has been made to cover this writing with ink, notwithstanding which ihe name, and address are still visible in outline. Your Committee are of opinion that this also is a forgery. The information received in reply to the let"" ieis above referred to in the opinion of your Committee points to a certain individual as the .perpetrator of the forgeries. It is recommended that theCrown Law authorities should be requested to take action with a view to a criminal prosecution of the offender, and that the correspondence in the possession of the Committee 5>e placed at their disposal for that purpose.

In the first place, I understand that two different rates have been fixed by the Justices of the High Court. Then the Minister of Trade and Customs is discharging a similar function. may fix wages in certain industries if it wishes, and, in addition, a similar duty is being performed by the Wages Boards of the States. Minister will recognise the complexities which this condition of affairs is creating. I should like to know whether he has observed it , and, if so, whether in any contemplated legislation, means will be taken to avoid it . . honourable colleague, Mr Lockyer, the Assistant Comptroller-General of Customs consulted with me yesterday and again this morning in connection with some of the Complexities to whioh the honourable member has called attention. So far as I can form a judgment at the present time, it The Government is will be necessary, when the House meets after the Christmas adjournment, or as soon after as the information in our possession somewill admit, to submit a short measure dealing with these different standards of wages, and also with the retrospective operation of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act prior to the declaration by the President of the Arbitration Court of the scale of wages which he has approved in the agricultural implement industry.

What the honourable member desires to indicate is that there is another course open, namely, to appeal direct to the people for an amendment of the .Constitution. Without expressing any opinion on the motion, which I have just read, and without, of course, on the spur of the moment, committing the Government to any course, I am free to say that, personally, the suggested transfer is becoming obviously necessary.

But there may be specific cases of hardshirj in the application of the Act in, country districts, or where there are two sets of wages, as across the borders of States, to which the honourable member for North Sydney has called attention. Mr W. H . IRVINE goes on with the Excise Procedure B ill , it will necessarily raise, by some of the provisions, the whole question of how far the original Acts ought to be retrospective. tion. Mr W. H. IRVINE It must. not be thought necessary to raise the question, in view of the fact that we are well advanced into November, and that it will be impossible to deal with the subject without the information which we ,are now acquiring with the utmost' rapidity possible, from all over Australia. Having obtained that information, we shall be able to propose to the House means of meeting cases of hardship which exist, whether they be close at hand or in remote districts. which has been indicated by the Prime considered whether the prerogative of Minister-that he and his colleagues may mercy is to be exercised. ' have to submit some measure dealing with possible hardships, it would, I think, be only fair that those manufacturers of harvesters should in some way or other be made to know that it will be a substantial element, in any possible consideration of their cases, that they should at once conform to the rates which have been decided by the Justicei n the case of the Sunshine harvesters. Whatever we may do as to the past, the manufacturers have now a clear indication from the Court of what are considered fair and rear sonable rates, and I think it would be only fair ber asking a question ? marks in an interrogative form. I-think .it is a matter worthy of the consideration of the Government, or, perhaps, _ I should say, it is a matter worthy of consideration by the Prime Minister, that there should'be some indication that, if the manufacturers do not at once conform to the new standard their position mav, perhaps, be prejudiced. gentleman has, perhaps, not observed that It may be my colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, in whose Department this matter lies-wh o is, unfortunately, absentthis morning owing to domestic bereavementa few days ago, when receiving.a deputation said, in so many words, that the attitude which would be adopted towards the manufacturers would greatly depend on -' their immediate and frank acceptance of the rates of wages fixed by the Court.

I remember that, when the last Tariff was under discussion, the honourable member for Adelaide gave way on the duty on sewing machines without calling for a division, while the proposal to make stands dutiable was negatived on division. I have been informed that machines which cost £ 1 3 ios. are invoiced f.o.b. at £ 4 17s. 6d. It must be remembered that machines. vary a good deal-some , are very plain, while others have a lot of fancy work about them. little as 30s. each. to be reliable. In any case, the public would not get machines more cheaply if we imposed a duty of 10 per cent..on importations from foreign countries'. The effect of the duty would be to increase the prices. them by more than from 2s. to 2s. 6d. each. come to much more than that on a machine invoiced at £ 4 . It must be remembered that the parts of machines can be imported free of duty. I ask the Treasurer whether sewing machines are a fair subject for taxation? trade have already been placed upon the free list and I do not know why the women workers of the Commonwealth should be subjected to a special disability in the shape of a duty of 10 per cent. As a matter of -fact sewing machines comprised one of the items in respect of which the Premier of New Zealand on the representations of the Labour Party .of the Dominion refused to accord preferential treatment to the Mother Country. In almost every village throughout the Commonwealth women are operating these machines as their tools of trade. I trust that the Treasurer will see his way clear to place them upon the free list. When we were discussing the duty upon cream separators yesterday .the honourable gentleman requested the postponement of the item because he practically admitted that there was a consensus of opinion amongst honourable members that these articles should be admitted free. I venture to say that sewing machines are used to a much greater extent in the Commonwealth than are cream separators, and if it is fair to place the latter upon the free list surely the former should be included in the same category I ask the Treasurer whether he seriously desires to levy this duty of 10 per cent, upon sewing machines ? ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [11.37] I do not care very mucli whether sewing machines are made dutiable or not, but I am opposed to their importation from foreign countries when we can obtain them from Great Britain. I find that the importations under this heading -are valued at £ 1 7 9 , 0 0 0 , of which only £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 worth are of British origin. The balance comes chiefly from Germany and the United States. from Canada.

I have too high an opinion of the officers of the Customs Department to imagine that they could make an omission of this kind by accident. They must have done what they did by design. We do not expect mistakes of this sort to be made in a Tariff. In reference to sewing machines, I hold in my hand a publication which was issued upon the day that the Tariff was introduced, and which sets out hundreds of the tools of trade of protected industries upon fhe free list. But amongst these I can find only one connected With the .farming industryI refer to scythes. That is the only implement of the agricultural industry which has been exempted from duty. I ask honourable members to get a copy of this by-law, and to compare all the tools of trade of industries enjoying a protection of 30 and 40 per cent, which have been put upon the free list with the tools of trade of the agricultural industry which are being made free. Sewing machines are undoubtedly a tool of trade of the weakest portion of the community. I observe that about fifty different machines used in the bookbinding trade, and about 100 tools and machines used in the paper-finishing, saddlery trades, and so forth, are free; I suppose that, altogether, about 1,000 tools and machines of trade are made free by departmental regulation.

I desire to say a few words on dustry, considering that so much consideration and protection has been extended to the woollen, hat and other industries. Speaking from memory, I should say that the engineering establishments of Australia could produce some, if not the whole, of the items which the Treasurer has intimated his desire to place on the free list -The question of the duty on sewing Sir WILLIAM LYNE many of the items are produced in Australia. to the wooilen industrv and to the hat industry, and yet tliose who benefit from the high duties grudge protection to the local makers of tools and machinery. should say that any one who posed as a protectionist would give the utmost consideration to the iron and engineering industries, which are the basis of all other industries. Yet we find the Treasurer proposing to place on the free list many articles which are made by moulders, brassworkers, blacksmiths, and others. These men arid their families have to pay heavy duties on apparel and other necessaries of life, and yet they are denied any assistance under the Tariff. Sir WILLIAM LYNE tectionist speech. probably I could make a better protection' ist speech than could the Treasurer, and honourable members know that my stated intention was, if the policy of the Commonwealth had to be protection, to see that the industries in my electorate have a share.

The New South Wales. I am very strongly tempted to move that this item be postponed. Surely the Treasurer will admit that there is good reason to believe that some of the machines that he proposes to exempt could be made in Australia. The behalf of the engineering inmatter is worthy of consideration, and the artisains and mechanics concerned who have to pay a duty of 100 per cent, on hats will certainly be anxious to know what he has done to assist them. The Treasurer ought to be prepared to do for the secondary industries that which he is ready to do for the primary industries. I cannot find that machines is not now of any importance since the Minister has agreed to place them on the free list; but it seems to me that the H i g h protection is given general policy of exempting machines known as tools of trade from any duty is being carried by the present Government to what from a protectionist stand-point is I an extraordinary extreme. It will be found that quite a number of machines included in the list referred to by the honourable member for East Sydney are not diffi-. cult to manufacture. They have not been made locally, because no encouragement has been offered to local engineers to produce them. They have been free, and have been so easily obtainable from abroad that no manufacturer in Australia has cared to embark upon the enterprise of making them. Some tools of trade, however, have been made in Australia. If the Treasurer pays.a visit to the Newport Railway WorkT h is is a good proshops, he will find that a large proportion of the machine tools in use there were made. I have already said that on the premises. In the same way, quite a number of engineering firms in Sydney make their own tools. WhilstI do not think it would be justifiable to impose a high duty upon machines that are not generally made here, I think it is equally unwise to exempt them.

I do not think that protected manufacturers should complain of a desire on our part to give a little assistance to engineers who can manufacture the machinery which they use. For that reason I would urge the Government in regard, not to this item alone, but to the exemption, of machinery generally, to consider; the desirabilitv of imposing a moderate duty. T.o view the matter from another stand-point, I would remind the Committee that we have -imposed a number of revenue duties upon recommend a duty of 10 per cent. ? articles which are in daily demand by the general masses of the community. If we» need revenue duties, it is much better to impose them on articles which may be produced in Australia, although they are not being made here at present, than oh actual necessities of the poorest section of the population. From that stand-point alone the Government might fairly well re-consider the position in regard to these exemptions. honourable member for South Sydney has raised a point which undoubtedly ought to be of considerable interest to protectionists., but of which protectionists, as a rule, have fought shy. I was very glad to hear the honourable member endorse what was practically the opinion expressed by the free trade section of the Commission in regard to the exemption of tools of trade. We were struck by the anomalies in relation to these exemptions. We found that whilst tools of trade used in certain industries were on the free list, others were taxed. The anomaly appeared the more extraordinary when we found that almost invariably those industries which derived no advantage from protective duties were taxed in respect of their tools of trade, whilst protected industries obtained them free. The honourable member for South Sydney has said very forcibly that if the engineering industries of Australia could only secure the making of a proportion the benefit of protected industries, are allowed to come in free, there would be very little complaint of depression amongst them. The quantity of machinery so introduced is enormous. Undoubtedly there is force in the observation that 'whilst, perhaps, a prohibitive duty would entail hardship on those who must neces : sarily obtain their tools of trade from abroad, still a moderate duty could be imposed which would produce revenue, and at the .same time lead to an expansion of production in the engineering trade of Australia, in those directions where any chance of success is probable. Although the free trade section of the Commission, according to the comparative table circulated amongst honourable members, recommended a duty of 10 per cent, on this item, its intention undoubtedly was that it should remain, as under the old Tariff, free.",25,William Lyne These Machines Has Complained Of And Therefore It Seems

The iron industry and its associated manufactures come next in importance to the primary industries, and are probably the most helpful that any country could possess. There is a good deal in the suggestion of the honourable member for South Sydney that practically all these tools of trade should bear some duty.

I should have if I imposed a general duty 'on the tools of trade-! trade which are now on the free list could be made in Australia, and their manufacture here would give far more employment than many of the industries for the encouragement of which the Treasurer has been fighting so hard.

The introduction of one machine perhaps enables a number of others to be produced here.

I should like to see a moderate duty imposed on fire engines, to encourage their manufacture here. There may be parts which we cannot profitably make but I think that most of the parts could be made here. I urge the Government to take fire engines out of the free list. am in the main in agreement with the general policy in regard to tools of trade adopted by previous Governments and f o llowed by this one. No doubt the Australian people wish to endeavour to produce as much as possible of their. own requirements, and I think it a good thing to give reasonable protection to local manufacture. Buti f we penalize the importation of machine tools necessary for manufacture of one kind or another, we shall be hampering instead of encouraging local production"". Many machine tools are turned out by firms which, have specialized their production, and have the world for their market. and manufacture.

As our plants extend we shall extend our manufacture, even of special tools; and patent rights will expire. But it would be bad policy to penalize now the importation of tools of trade whose manufacture is protected by patent rights and carried out by specialized processes. There are many articles in the list of the Treasurer which could not be made without a special plant, and for which the demand is too small to make their manufacture in Australia profitable.

In my juvenile days I started out to make a steam engine, but I am satisfied that, had I completed it, it would not have been suitable for driving some of the plants which are used by our great primary industries. I am in thorough agreement with the proposals of the Government generally; but I believe in exempting tools of trade and other machinery which cannot be made here, set out in this and in subsequent items. sire to point out that although importations from Great Britain are free, the effect of a duty of 10 per cent, on foreign importations of patent porcelain'and steel rolls for flour mills will be to tax one of the large manufacturing industries of Australia, because the tempering and other processes necessary for the manufacture of these rollers have been perfected and patented by continental manufacturers,and they are not made in the United Kingdom. letter which I have received from the Otto C. Schumacher M ill Furnishing Worksthe only manufacturers of machinery in Victoria-it is pointed out thatThese steel rolls are the principal parts of roller mills, and' are at present not manufactured in Australia, and but very few indeed in England, and these, by the way, are inferior to other makes. When the Bounties Bill was before us we were supplied with a report in which attention was drawn to the great value of the flour-milling industry, an industry of such value to the country that it was stated that there was a desire to recommend a bounty for the production of flour for human consumption and offals for the use of agriculturists and dairymen. We recognise the advantage of manufacturing all that we can, and I am prepared to give reasonable protection for the assistance of manufacturers. But we shall depart from the.true principles of protection if we levy The Minister has consented to taxation on articles which cannot be manufactured here. The Schumacher Company advocate a duty of 25 per.cent, on steel rolls; but it seems to me that they do so on purely selfish grounds. They urge that if the duty upon this article be retained at 10 per cent., and if the frames of the machines are subject to a 25 per cent. rate, the machines will be imported in parts, and the parts will be assembled here. That w ill It is easy to make an provide a certain amount of employment, no doubt. the question.

The honourable member for Melbourne Ports poses as an advocate for a. gentleman who, in his own letter, saysSo far from these rollers being manufactured in Victoria they are only manufactued in England in a very small way, and they are inferior to other makes. Until some evidence is forthcoming of a desire to enter upon their manufacture, we should not penalize other manufacturers. Sir WILLIAM LYNE We want to make the flour mills pay something. In a question from, a selfish stand-point, because I have a flour mill which is equipped with everything that is necessary in the wav of flour-milling machinery. Buti f the manufacture of flour ought to be encouraged, it should be. encouraged by admitting free those articles which cannot be manufactured locally. I should like to add that my sympathies are. entirely with the .sempstresses and others who -are required to use sewing machines. As we do not manufacture these articles, it seems to be a very harsh proceeding to levy a duty of 10 per cent, upon them.

Surely the mechanical skill required, to produce a steel roller is not beyond Australians. These rollers are not being manufactured to any extent in Great Britain, and the whole of those used in the Commonwealth are imported from Germany.

That is all moonshine. deal has been said in reference to subjecting the users of sewing machines to a disability by levying a 10 per cent, rate upon them. Are honourable members aware that if a duty had been placed upon these machines thirty years ago, they would have been selling in Australia to-day for half their present price? I know perfectly well that in Sydney and Melbourne 'there is a firm which alleges that it manufactures sewing machines. fact, it merely imports the parts and puts them together here. I admit that it also ""does a certain amount of moulding work.

Yet that machine landed hi Australia costs only about £ 3 5s. regard to'the price of rollers for flour mills and printing machines is an exactly similar one. If these articles were protected the imported article would be much cheaper -than it is now. I hold that there is nothing remarkable in the process of manufacturing these rollers. Some of them are turned out plain, and others are corrugated, but as a matter of fact the corrugation upon them does not last. What do the Victorian millers do? They send their rollers to be re-corrugated and re-set by a firm in my electorate. of 10 per cent, upon these articles, the 25 per cent, rate under the General Tariff, and to a 15 per cent, duty under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Experience has shown that wherever a duty has been levied upon an article which has encouraged its local production, the result has always been to reduce the price for the imported article. for instance: for sugar, but I am willing to encourage the employment of white labour, even if by so doing we are required to pay a little But, in this more for our sugar. prepared to protect black, labour? clude black labour, it is essential that we A good should impose high duties upon articles in the production of which it would be engaged.

We should be very careful about admitting free of duty parts But, as a matter of of machines which can be manufactured locally.

When it was first, proposed under the McKinley Tariff to establish the tin-plate industry in the United States of America, arguments similar to those just advanced by the honourable member for Mernda were heard all over England and America. It was said that it was a farce to impose a duty on tin plate, and thousands of dollars were offered to the first man who could produce a comparatively small quantity.

Instead of agreeing to pay £ 1 4 6 , 0 0 0 for a mere service to Adelaide of 696 hours, with several old boats, and a general Undertaking to provide cool storage space, we have made a more elaborate contract for an entirely new service, a copy of which I shall lay on the table, briefly summarizing its principal terms.

Consequently, under the proposed contract we shall obtain what Australia has never enjoyed hitherto-^a much quicker service and uniform weekly arrivals of the mail boats, so as to permit of letters being answered, even from Brisbane, by return post. sidy will be a little less than is now paid, taking £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 for an increase of speed, and £ 2 6 , 0 0 0 for the service to Brisbane; besides which we obtain all the further advantages which I am about to enumerate. sidy is nearly double what the company was subsidv and extended period of service are getting a short while ago, not allowing for to be determined by mutual agreement, or calling at Brisbane. that, under the proposed contract,' the serwithin the next five or six years we shall1 vice will be carried on by a much better The State of Queensclass of boats, at a higher rate of speed, and under many other advantageous conditions.

In this matter, the Commonwealth Government, though deeply interested, is not so directly concerned as the States Governments, which have made various arrangements in regard to *he export of butter. Nearly all our delay during the last week or two has been due to our desire to defer concluding the contract until the very active, vigilant, and capable Minister of Agriculture for Victoria could have an opportunity to place before the companies concerned the complaints which H o w is such a condiare being made throughout' Australia.

314,Mr Deakin,"The criticism of thethese lines. This has followed a reduction of the butter rate to is. iod. per box for butter shipped by a rival combination known as the "" three lines."" How. ever we may view these arrangements, they are regarded as honorably binding upon the parties to them, and it has been necessary to allow the representatives of the Orient Company time to communicate with the five lines, with a view to securing their freedom. When they had done this, the larger question was raised whether it would not be possible, not merely to provide for the Orient Company forsaking the agreement, biit to induce the companies associated with it to reconsider the action they had taken under some'pressure, and thus relieve the shippers of perishable produce of certain disabilities. That has been the cause of the delay, which I have been unable to explain to the House for obvious reasons. Negotiations had to lae conducted, not only with a great number of steam-ship companies upon this side of the world, but also with their principals upon the other side of the globe. Considering the difficulties by which the whole question was surrounded, I have to freely admit that it has been owing to the unremitting attention and energy which Mr Swinburne has devoted to it that we have been enabled to arrive at what I believe will be a satisfactory conthe shippers shall not use any line charging clusion. At all events, so far as the Orient Steam Navigation Company is concerned, they now propose an agreement which the people of Australia will recognise as a fair one, and they have been able to induce their companions in this agreement to take a similar course. The proposal made is to come into force at once, before the principal contract to which I have referred has any effect whatever, except, of course, so far as regards the building of ships and the carrying out of necessary preliminaries. At present, or up till lately, the freight charged for the carriage bf butter by the mail steamers was 2S. 6d., and by the great carriers, which were not mail steamers, 2s. 3d., per box. it is slightly over. One half-penny per lb. would amount to 2s. 46. per box. a box? sure of the details . in this connection, I am sure of the fact that 2s. 6d. per box represents slightlv more than i d . per lb. [217] One halfpenny per lb. would amount to 2s. 4d a box as near as possible. The charge which has always been made by the mail steamers for the carriage of butter is 2s. 6d. per box. Had the rate been £d. per lb., the charge would have been 2s. 4d. per box. The proposed new arrangement is that, instead of the rate by mail steamers being 2s. 6d. per box, it will be a rate not exceeding 2s. 6d. per box, which, in the anticipation of several experts, is likely to mean 2s. 4d. per 'box, or Jd. per lb. As to the other lines, instead of the charge being 2s. 3d. per box as it was, it is proposed that it shall be 2s. per box by all the five lines; that is, by way of the regular lines of steamers. the arrangement? ing to come into it. These rates are to operate at any port of the Commonwealth. It is worth noting-to prevent any misconception-that the conditions for which we have been fighting, while we have been assisted so materially by Mr Swinburne, are not for the benefit of one State, but apply to all the States, witliout any distinction whatever. The condition upon which these concessions are proposed, so far as the five lines are concerned, is that less than 2s. per box. Now, the present cutting rate charged by the three lines to which I have referred is is. iod. per box, and it is intended to propose to them that they shall come into this agreement, and thus be placed absolutely on the same footing as the five lines. Then, instead of there being three lines and five lines charging different rates, there will be eight regular lines of steamers charging the same price from all ports of the Commonwealth. The producer will thus be able to send forward his butter without regard to the ship that is in port, knowing precisely the rate that he will be charged for its carriage and the facilities that he will enjoy. If this arrangement can be carried out-and I am assured by experts that it is most reasonable, that the price charged is low, and that the conditions offered to trade by this means are better than have ever been enjoyed in Australia it promises to give a very great impetus indeed to the whole of the Industries dependent upon cool storage.

Over twenty years ago, I had the pleasure of playing a somewhat influential part in securing for the Orient Steam Navigation Company the prestige of a Royal mail service. In 1883, they entered into the Australian trade in competition with that mammoth concern, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and I think that the people of Australia should have a very kindly feeling towards them, having regard to the great battle which they fought against so formidable a rival. white crews. served the Australian view of that matter that I look with far more pleasure upon a contract entered into with them than I should have looked upon a contract made with any other company. I feel sure that in all our transactions with them we shall not have any of the miserable troubles that we experienced in connection with the old abortive contract. In view of the fact that the Prime Minister has, in many eloquent speeches, expressed an ardent desire tb encourage the flow of immigration to Australia, I notice with some regret that the honourable member made no mention of any arrangement in relation to that very important subject. fixed agreement, but the accommodation provided for what were formerly known as third-class passengers is to be superior to anything that has been previously provided, and the Commonwealth or the States, whichever has the undertaking, are to be granted special rates in respect of the carriage of immigrants from the Mother Country. modation for third-class passengers? equal to the old second-class accommodation. is a delightfully vague one. upon the number coming out. pose one or two more conditions, we might as well run mail steamers of our own. the consideration of the House when we are asked to deal with this contract. I listened with the greatest pleasure to the details given by the Prime Minister as to one or two features of the contract. In the first place, I think that the least we could do for Queensland is that which the Government have done in connection with this contract. And so with Tasmania. We might fairly relieve Queensland at once of the extra payment which she has been making. I fail to see why we should wait f o i another two years before, doing so, because, by the terms of this contract, we practically acknowledge that we should have relieved her of this obligation. I shall be very glad to support any movement to relieve the people of Queensland, from the present time until the new contract begins, of the special payment which they are now making to the company. I do not wish at this stage to deal with the questions of rates and freights. There are matters in connection with the contract which require serious attention, but, subject to a fuller consideration of all its details, I wish to say that it affords me the greatest possible pleasure to know that this contract-if it prove a wise and good one-ha s been made with a company on whose promises and undertakings we can fully rely. statement that Queensland is satisfied, Tasmania is satisfied, and the primary producers are"" satisfied with the terms of this contract, sounds very well.
