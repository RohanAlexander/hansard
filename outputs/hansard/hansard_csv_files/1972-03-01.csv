Social Services Dr KLUGMANI present the following petition: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showethThat a migrant who has been a member of the Australian workforce for many years, has paid taxes and acquired Australian citizenship, and seeks to live the last years of his life in his native land or, if an invalid, wishes to see his relatives, is wan Straits maintain that there is but one denied pension transferability. Your petitioners therefore humbly prayThat the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, seek to have Australia adopt the principle followed by Britain, Italy, Greece, Malta, The Netherlands, France, Germany, Turkey, Canada and the United States of America, who already transfer the social entitlement of their citizens wherever they may choose to live. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. Petition received. Commonwealth Scholarships petition: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition nf citizens of the community of the Australian National University respectfully sheweth: That the increase in tertiary education fees for 1972 will cause increased hardship for a significant proportion of tertiary students. That tertiary fees and concomitant living costs are a formidable barrier preventing significant numbers of students entering tertiary education who nevertheless have the ability to do so. That the increase in tertiary fees for 1972 is immoral, in that Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education are being further restricted to that minimal section of the Australian population who can afford to send their sons and daughters onto higher education. That all education should be free including tertiary education. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government take immediate action to introduce in order of priority 1. Universal Commonwealth Scholarships 2. Commonwealth Scholarships on the basis of need rather than academic ability 3. Abolition of tertiary fees. And your petitioners, as In duty bound, will ever pray. Petition received. ter: Does the right honourable gentleman recall asserting on 23rd August last that acceptance of the idea that Taiwan is a province of China implies that force can be used to restore control by China? Has he noted President Nixon's statement last Sunday that the United States of America acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of tbe TaiChina and that Taiwan is part of China? The United States Government does not chaUenge that position. Has he also noted Prime Minister Sato's subsequent statement that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China? Does the Australian Government share the view expressed by its allies and partners? If not, what is now the Australian. Government's position on the status of Taiwan? question is yes. The answer to the second question is yes and there is no inconsistency between the two. The answer to the third question also is yes. The answer to the fourth question is that it is our policy to have a dialogue with China in order to normalise bi-lateral relationships between the 2 countries. It was made clear by my colleague the Foreign Minister yesterday that to put us in a satisfactory position in order to continue the dialogue we will establish an Australian diplomatic commission under the Department of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong. We hope that by this means and by quiet and patient diplomacy we will be able to achieve our objectives.

5,Mr Hamer,"Has the attention of thcin New Zealand it would retain its troops in Singapore even if the Labor Party came into power in Australia and withdrew its forces. Does the Minister believe that it would be possible to maintain the ANZUK arrangements after withdrawal of Australian forces? statement referred to by the honourable gentleman. I believe that Mr Kirk, the Leader of the Opposition in New Zealand, was reported as saying that New Zealand had made these arrangements and that if he became Prime Minister of New Zealand he would abide by any arrangements that had been made. I appreciate the bi-partisan approach in New Zealand politics which unfortunately we are unable to obtain in this House. However, I have some doubts as to whether Mr Kirk could carry out the arrangement because there would be considerable problems for New Zealand. For one thing, at the present moment Australia provides the logistics assistance to all the it would mean that if our troops were withdrawn the United Kingdom and New Zealand would have to provide the logistics support. In order to do this tbey would have to bring in something like 200 additional troops. In addition I believe it would be extremely likely that if Australian troops were withdrawn there would be a reappraisal by Britain which would naturally ask why it should send its troops 12,000 miles around the world to Singapore when Australia, the nearest Commonwealth country, was not prepared to have troops there. So it would be extremely likely that the ANZUK and Five-Power arrangements which have been worked out over a long period of time, and the freely arrived at agreement between these countries, would be upset in the event of the withdrawal of Australian troops. ing whether he agrees that the building industry and associated industries are the biggest employers of labour in Australia. Is it a fact that approvals for dwellings in January were the lowest for that month for 5 years and that commencements of new dwellings in the first half of this finanlevel of housing taking place in Australia cial year are 4.7 per cent down on the same period 2 years ago, and in Victoria and New South Wales nearly 10 per cent down? Has his attention been drawn to the statement by T. A. Dalton, Vice-President of the Master Builders Federation, that the action taken by the Government with the State Premiers was inadequate to stimulate the building industry? Does the Minister agree that unless interest rates are reduced member's question is fairly lengthy. He is giving a lot of information. Question time is for the seeking of information. I ask the honourable member to be as brief as he can. ience, Mr Speaker. I also ask: Does the Minister agree that interest rates should be reduced across the board and that the maximum loan should be increased, particularly savings bank loans? Does he agree that young people cannot afford to meet the deposit gap and make their repayments? Will the Minister endeavour immediately to reduce interest rates on home loans and to increase the maximum loan, particularly from savings banks, in order to stimulate the building industry? honourable member for Reid for asking me this question because it enables me to put into context some of the comments he has been making in recent times. But I must make this point quite clear: The alacrity with which the honourable member for Reid will embrace any interpretation of figures which are gloomy rather depresses me, as it should depress the country. He has not understood the figures he has quoted, nor does he understand the industry about which he has made some comments. So let me answer the 6 parts of the question quickly and shortly. In respect of housing activity in the country there are figures for approvals and details of completions, commencements and the amount of finance approved for housing. To grab any one piece of data and build a gloomy case upon it merely indicates a narrowness of outlook which is not appropriate to the honourable member. The answer to the other question he asked is that there is an equilibrium",13,Singapore

It is of an order which would not be encouraged were the honourable member for Reid ever to be given any responsibility in government. The honourable member for Reid referred also to some comments made by a Mr Dalton of New South Wales concerning finance for housing and other matters. I also saw a comment by Mr Dalton recently that as a result of the rise in the price of steel the cost of an average house constructed in New South Walesa house to the value of $14,000 or so-woul d increase by $280 or $290. To attract that kind of rise a house would need to have $5,500 worth of steel in it. I can only say that builders must be building castles and not houses. The last point referred to by the honourable member concerning interest rates needs to be emphasised. There have been very substantial declines in the interest rates developing special tourist attractions on housing in a number of fields over recent months. The greatest decreases in interest rates on housing have occurred with respect to welfare housing in the three fields of housing under the responsibility of State authorities, both for rental and for purchase, and housing which isfinancedthrough the home builders account of the cooperative terminating societies. Those interest rate reductions have been of the order of l i per cent. They occurred before there was a decline in the long term bond rate. Were the advice of the honourable member for Reid and the Opposition to have been followed none of the declines in interest rates would have been allowable because they opposed the Bill which in fact enabled these reductions to occur. to the Minister for the Environment, Aboritrol prices, will be give consideration to the gines and the Arts in his capacity as the taking of a referendum for an amendment Minister in Charge of Tourist Activities. of the Constitution to add prices as a new In view of the importance of the tourist placitum to section 51 of the Constitution? industry to the Australian economy, will the Minister indicate what steps are currefer to the Attorney-General the matters rently being taken to encourage a greater which the right honourable gentleman has flow of tourists from other parts of the mentioned. But I heard some sounds from world? Are maximum incentives being honourable members on the Opposition offered to assist the tourist industry and offer being publicised as widely as possible throughout the other continents? for Ryan will know that the major task of the Australian Tourist Commission is to encourage overseas tourists to come to Australia. That is done in a number of ways in conjunction with ' the State tourist authorities and the airlines. As a result of the American Society of Travel Agents conference which took place in Sydney towards the end of last year there has been a tremendous wave of enthusiasm and interest in, particularly, the United States of America where many tourists wish to come here. A great deal of publicity is now being undertaken in that country through the contacts that we made during that conference. Many other markets are also being opened up and developed at this time in, particularly, Japan as well as our normal ma»kets in New Zealand and, of course, Europe. Whether we should assist in within Australia is a matter which has been suggested to me in recent weeks by the industry. This matter is now being examined. In due course I shall be submitting information on it to the Government. resenting the Attorney-General: Will he suggest to his colleague the Attorney General that an examination be made of the recent judgment of the High Court of Australia in the concrete pipes case with a view to determining whether the Commonwealth Parliament possesses power to pass laws in respect of prices? When the examination has been completed will he advise this House and the nation of thc result of it? If it is felt that the judgment MrN . H. BOWENI will certainly,",14,Housing

It would be interesting to know how many members of the Australian Labor Party are prepared to follow the right honourable gentleman in giving effect to Labor policy on prices control. It is very clear that been treated according to the agreement since the right honourable gentleman relinquished the leadership of the Australian Labor Party many basic principles and features of its platform have been departed from when the present leader has considered that it is expedient to do so. LAKE BURLEY GRIFFIN the Minister for the Interior. To explain the question, I refer to a survey of land use and soil erosion within the Lake Burley Griffin catchment area carried out by the Soil Conservation Service of New South Wales in 1970 to assist in an erosion control programme to reduce the rate of siltation in Lake Burley Griffin. Did the survey point to extensive areas of gully erosion and stream bank erosion in Jerrabombera and Burra Creeks and the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers? Has the deserted mining area of Captains Flat caused very severe scouring of slag heaps and bare areas around the pits? Is there an advisory soil conservation service in the Australian Capital Territory and what action is being taken to reduce the rate of siltation of Lake Burley Griffin7 of tbe question is yes. A survey of the entire Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers catchment areas has been carried out by the Soil Conservation Service of New South Wales. The survey revealed an extensive area of gully erosion and erosion in the stream banks of Jerrabomberra and Burra Creeks. It also indicated erosion in the Queanbeyan and Molonglo River areas. These were the areas that were tackled in the first survey. Currently, a survey is being conducted in the Burra Creek valley region. The Captains Flat area is an old mine area. The old zinc slag heaps have been bare because of the poisonous nature of the minerals in the soil. There is no vegetation in the region. We have attempted to overcome that problem by covering the areas with gravel. There is a soil conservation advisory service in the Australian Capital Territory. It works within the Department of the Interior. The siltation level in Lake Burley Griffin is being reduced through the application of recognised soil conservation practices in the whole of the catchment area. The New South Wales section has which we entered into with the New South Wales Government in 1965 to try to overcome this problem. This is a 10-year agreement and the Commonwealth is contributing one-third of the cost of the work up to $20,000 a year, the balance of the cost being shared between the soil conservation services and the land owners in the area. It is an area that has been of some concern to us. We are giving it our utmost attention. Much concern has been shown by certain academics about the level of pollution in Lake Burley Griffin. We are conducting many surveys. We are seeking expert advice to ensure that the level of pollution does not increase unduly. the Prime Minister. He will recall saying on the programme 'Monday Conference' on 6th December last year that defence would be the key issue at this year's election. He will recall also directing the Minister for Defence to prepare a defence White Paper and expressing publicly his disappointment at the delay in presenting this paper. In view of the right honourable gentleman's promise that the paper would be ready 'somewhere about February', I ask him: Has it been completed? If not, has defence been relegated as an election issue by the deterioration in the economy and the decline in the Government's electoral support? part of the question first, I can assure the honourable gentleman that defence will be one of the most important issues that the Government and the Opposition will face at the next election. We will show a sharp cleavage between ourselves and the Australian Labor Party and its supporters in the left-wing unions. As to the first part of the honourable gentleman's question, I understand that the paper has already been completed. It happens to be a very long one and i l will need to be edited before we will be able to present it to the House. I hope to receive the paper in the course of the next few days.",15,Prices

17,Mr Mcmahon,"Answering the lastImmigration: Is it a fact, as has been reported, that the Prime Minister of Fiji who, I understand, has complained that his luggage was inspected by Australian Customs officials during transit through Australia is required to obtain a visa to enter Australia whilst his European official is not? the Prime Minister of Fiji requires a visa to visit Australia, as has been so often mischievously written in the Press. As a British subject holding an official position, the Prime Minister of Fiji is free to visit Australia without requiring a visa. I think that this should be known and understood. There is a great deal of misunderstanding about visas. It does not appear to be generally understood that the general policy of the Government is that it is necessary to have a visa to visit Australia. That general policy applies to most people in the world. There is one exception, apart from the one 1 have just mentioned which is a comparatively minor one. The exception is in relation to British Europeans. They do not need visas, for reasons which go a long way back into our history. But apart from British Europeans, everybody else in the world requires a visa to visit this country. Therefore, there is no distinction made between a Frenchman, an American, a Fijian, an Indian or anybody else in this respect.

What progress has so far been made in the Minister's announced discussions with other countries directed to obtaining reciprocal payment of social services to pensioners living abroad?

As far as I know, no country has rejected the request. I have sent them all details of our services and I have asked them to let me have details of their corresponding services. I hope within the next week or 10 days to be starting a round of the representatives here to finalise these matters as soon as possible. No delay will be occasioned by this Government, but of course the conclusion of negotiations depends not only on this government but on the other governments. I understand that the relevant legislation is to be introLiberal Party State Council meeting in Melduced during this sitting of the House, but I point out to the honourable member that no delay will be occasioned by this because the preliminary negotiations will be going on irrespective of the introduction of the legislation into this House. Mr O'KEEFEI ask the Minister for Shipping and Transport: Will shipping freight rates on exports to Japan and the Far East rise by 15 per cent as from 1st May? Could such a rise seriously affect our trade in this region by allowing commodities to be freighted in from other countries at cheaper rates? Will the Government call a conference of shippers to see whether this rise can be averted? Northbound Shipping Conference announced on 25th February a general increase in freight rates of up to 15 per cent to commence from 1st May. The honourable member has a right to be concerned about the effect this may have on Australian export industries. I am not so sure that Australian industries will be worse off vis-a-vis competitive countries because increased freight rates seem to be a general problem around the world. The facts are that shipping companies are faced with a problem of staying in business and meeting increased costs. They have had substantial cost increases in wages of crews, repairs and administration and in other areas. The whole problem is, of course, symptomatic of the general problem when you get rising costs without getting a matching increase in productivity. As to the last part of the honourable member's question, I understand that the Northbound Shipping Conference is to enter into detailed discussions with the various export trades to settle the level of freight rates for various export industries with the Northbound Conference. It would therefore appear unnecessary for me to call such a conference as the honourable member suggested. Prime Minister.

I ask him now: What progress has the Government made with the arrangements for this private trade mission to China? were in negotiation to try to ensure that an Australian trade mission led by a very distinguished Australian should go to the People's Republic of China. We waited for a considerable period of time hoping that we would get final approval from the People's Republic to go. As I have made clear to the House, immediately after the vote was taken in the United Nations we were informed-no t directly from the representatives of the People's Republic but indirectly-that the time was inopportune for a visit. the Minister for Trade and Industry. The eastern seaboaTd region of Russia, because of its distance from European Russia, its proximity to Australia and its growing population is of increasing trade importance to Australia. The Minister recently stated that his Department is establishing a trade commissioner post in Moscow. Is his Department considering or will it consider the establishment of a trade commissioner post in the eastern part of Russia? establishing a trade commissioner post in Moscow. Moscow is selected because, as honourable members possibly would know Opposition members-OhI House would want to hear the Minister's answer. I should not think that honourable members would want to impede the Minister in the manner in which they are impeding him. ber for Murray and other honourable members would be well aware that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a highly centralised form of government administration. Honourable members opposite seem amused, but I do not know what is so funny about that. It is a fact which means that all the principal decisions relatmonwealth into all the circumstances. That ing to trade are made in Moscow. We believe that it is quite important that we have a trade representative there. The honourable member has suggested that we consider the establishment of a trade commissioner post on the eastern seaboard of USSR. There is an administrative centre there, the name of which is Nakhodka, but it deals only with local matters. Our information is that major decisions relating to imports or exports of goods are made in Moscow. We will watch the situation and as we gain more experience and learning, if it becomes necessary we will give consideration to the suggestion. Minister realise that it is now over 3 years since the Government established a committee of inquiry charged with finding a suitable site for a second major airport to serve Sydney? Why is it that a second committee of inquiry can forecast at the beginning of this year that it will not be able to make a recommendation as to the choice of site until next year, 4 years after the initial inquiry? Does the Prime Minister realise that the very many thousands of long suffering citizens living in the vicinity of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport are sick to the teeth with the Government's continued cynical delaying tactics in getting on with the task of building a second airport for Sydney? Will he take early action to get this project off the ground? tion. This matter has been raised in the House on quite a number of occasions. The honourable member who has asked the question has referred to it previously and I think he knows full well the background to the position. The Government established a departmental committee at least a couple of years ago to investigate airport requirements for Sydney after the present international and domestic airports reach saturation point. This investigation was carried out and a report was submitted to my colleague the Minister for Civil Aviation. The details of that report were made known in this House.

Secondly, does the Bill of which the honourable member has charge propose to amend that section of the Act by imposing an addidonal penalty of one years's imprisonment for that offence? Thirdly, if draft dodging is not an offence, as has been alleged by the Leader of the Opposition, can the honourable member explain to the House why his Bill proposes a penalty of one year's imprisonment for it? Mr WhitlamI take a point of order. I submit that this question is out of order. Mr Speaker, whatever may be allowed in the Senate, I put to you with complete gravity that it is improper for insinuations to be made in this House about persons who are to come before the courts. There are references in the honourable member's question to certain matters which have been ventilated in the Senate by no less than the Attorney-General. The case is well known. It has been well ventilated. It is quite improper that a person come to order. It is very hard for the Chair to listen to and concentrate on the point of order which the Leader of the Opposition is putting to the Chair. opposite seem to forget that one of their colleagues, a member of Parliament belonging to their Party, is at present on trial before a judge and jury. It would be completely improper member must come back to the point of order. He cannot debate the issue. proper that anything should be said in the Parliament which would prejudice that man's trial. though, is il? the courts would deal with it. It is equally objectionable if reflections are made in the House over which you preside, Mr Speaker, on a person who is being sought by the police and who, if the police apprehend him, will come before the courts. I submit that you should not allow this House to be may prejudice or appear to prejudice the trial of persons who are being sought of the Opposition not to debate tbe issue. order? some indication of my views first. Mr ChippI would like to speak to it. for Customs and Excise to speak. honourable member for Diamond Valley no mention was made of any person who was under charge or being tried. What the honourable member did refer to was an alleged statement by the Leader of the Opposition who was reported as saying that draft dodging was not an offence. I refer to a newspaper available in the Parliamentary Library which states that the Leader of the Opposition, when questioned by an interviewer on 'PM' on 28th February, stated that draft dodging is not a crime. with what the Leader of the Opposition said or did not say. The question here is whether this question is allowable. Questions may be put to a Member, not being a Minister, relating to any Bill, motion, or other public matter connected with the Business of the House, of which the Member has charge.

56,Mr Chipp,"Standing order 143 states:because the honourable member for Diamond Valley has not mentioned anybody who is under any charge, I submit that the question is in order. Mr WhitlamI rise on another point of order, Mr Speaker. What the Minister for Customs and Excise has said on this matter is perfectly correct. I should think that person in charge of a Bill. I have never the honourable member for Diamond Valley would be completely entided to ask that question about the Bill of which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is in charge, but I object to the extraneous references which the honourable member for Diamond Valley made to the opponent of the Minister for Customs and Excise. I should have thought that the Minister would be the last person Government supporters interjecting. Mr WhitlamI submit, Sir, that you should not allow this House to be used, as the Senate is being used, to cast aspersions upon people who are due to come before the courts and who may be prejudiced by these aspersions being cast. Leader of the Opposition on both counts. I agree with him that the question is allowable understanding order 143. I also agree with him that, if the question were to have referred to a particular person or persons outside of the House and the House were to be used for the purposes he has suggested, I would have to rule in his favour. But from memory the honourable inember for Diamond Valley did not at any stage mention any particular person or persons. That is my recollection of the terms of his question. In that case, 1 would say that the question is in accordance with the Standing Orders. 1 should hope that this House would never be used as a political vehicle for any person or persons outside of it. That would be the case if any person outside of the House were to be named. But no person was named at all on this occasion. Therefore, I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Dr. J. F. CairnsI rise on a further point of order, Mr Speaker. The point of order. I raise is one which has not been raised so far and which has nothing to do with those points of order which have been raised so far. SinceI have been a member of this HouseI have never heard a clear ruling given on the question of who is in charge of a Bill. It is quite clear from the standing order referred to by the honourable member for Hotham, who is the Minister for Customs and Excise, that a question can be asked of a Minister and of a person who is not a Minister if he is a heard a clear ruling given about who is a person in charge of a Bill, but I would submit to you, Sir, that a member of the Opposition cannot be a person who is in charge of a Bill. When I speak to a Bill dealing with trade and tariff matters I am not in any way in charge of that Bill. The only person in charge of that Bill is someone on the other side of the House. I submit to you, Sir, that standing order 143 means that a person may be questioned if he is a Minister or if, on behalf of the Government, he is in charge of a Bill. It is obvious that a clear ruling ought to be given on this matter. I have not heard one given in the 16 years I have been a member of this Parliament. It seems to me to be contradictory to common sense to suggest that someone on this side of the House who does not have thc backing of a majority and who does not have the backing of the Standing Orders can in any way be said to be in charge of a Bill. A Bill is in the charge of someone who has the procedures of the Standing Orders to back him up, who has the support of the majority of the members in this House and who speaks for the Government on it. I submit that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not in charge of the Bill to which reference has been made. order that the honourable member for Lalor has raised is not directly related to the ruling I have given, but I would assume that the person who was in charge of a Bill was the person who asked for leave to introduce that Bill, who introduced that Bill and who first spoke to the motion that that Bill be read a second time. I understand that that has always been the practice in this House and in other Houses as well. Mr BerinsonI rise to order. CouldI ask for your ruling. Mr Speaker? Is the question affected by the last part of standing order 144 which states: Questions cannot anticipate discussion upon an order of the day or other matter.",22,National Service

59,Mr Speaker,"Order! The point ofSince the National Service Bill 1971 introduced by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is order of the day No. 9, does the question not conflict with that standing order? impossible to remember the exact wording of the question. But as I understand the question, it asked whether the Bill contained a certain matter. I think any honourable member is entitled to ask in anticipation of a debate-thi s applies also to Ministers-for information he may require in relation to that debate. ber for Diamond Valley asked a very long and complex question. Unfortunately, as a result of the points of order that have been taken, it is rather difficult for me to follow the substance of his question. However, I say in reply to it that the Bill which was introduced by me and referred to by the honourable member has been dealt with on 2 occasions in this House. A full explanation of all the clauses referred to by the honourable member will be found in the Hansard report of the subsequent debate. As far as 1 am aware, the honourable member for Diamond Valley made no attempt on either occasion to join in the debate. The honourable member had an opportunity to question me during that debate. Of course, the continuation of the debate was not facilitated by the Government. He refused to join in the debate. question. The last occasion on which this matter was debated in this House was about 6$ months ago. It was made clear by me at the time that I was introducing a Bill to amend the National Service Act because the Opposition recognised that the Government would never repeal the legislation. We agreed that it would be better to amend bad legislation if we could not have it repealed. The policy of this Party is to repeal the National Service Act. That will be undertaken when I have the responsibility as Minister for Defence in the next government. Finally, let me point out to the honourable member that we will be happy to continue this debate on the Bill which I introduced and last spoke on 6i months ago in this House if the Government will give us an opportunity to do 60. Opposition)I raise this matter now instead of in the usual way, which is by question without notice to you, Mr Speaker, because I did not want to take the time of question time. 1 seek an explanation of an alteration in Hansard. Yesterday's Hansard at page 352 reports that the Prime Minister, by leave, said: 1 want to add after the words 'carrying on bis business' ihs words 'with me'. . . . It is an accurate report. But what he said on page 336 reads this way: . . . but 1 for long have been very disturbed about the way in which he has been carrying on his business with me. As everybody understands and as the Prime Minister was made to realise clearly subsequently, the words 'with me' were not used when the right honourable gentleman was making his speech some time a little after 3 o'clock. I told him that we on this side would give leave to correct it as it is correctly reported on page 352 of Hansard. How is it that Hansard at page 336 has been amended to insert the words which the right honourable gentleman properly told us he had not used at that time? honourable gentleman.

Mr WmTLAMI said that it was wrong for any citizen, and that includes a member of Parliament and particularly the first law officer of the Crown, to speak of any person in terms that assumed that that person was guilty. Mr ChippI rise to order. The Leader of the Opposition has stated that he has been misrepresented. I understand that I am the only honourable member, other than the honourable member for Diamond Valley, who has mentioned the Leader of the Opposition in this context today. He has not given detaUs of the alleged misrepresentation. The inference is that I was responsible for the misrepresentation. I deny that. The honourable member has not stated how he was misrepresented and has proceeded to introduce entirely new matter. himself is now debating the matter. SinceI have been in the Chair, and for many years before, it has been the custom to allow some latitude to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the making of personal explanations and in other respects. I am extending that latitude providing grants to companies related to to the Leader of the Opposition who assured me that he wished only to complete one sentence.

Has the Prime Minister any greater privileges than has an ordinary member of this House? courtesy that I have just mentioned. There is a custom in this House. it had been put to us from many quarters that this was the single measure most likely to boost confidence and activity on the part of industry, and manufacturing industry in particular. We have now decided on another measure to assist industry. This will be the continuing of the financial incentive provided under the industrial research and development grants scheme for a further 5 year period from July of this year. The amount of incentive which the Government will provide will be significantly greater than during the first 5 year period from 1967. The incentive will be along lines broadly similar to the present industrial research and development grants scheme which is designed to encourage manufacturing and mining companies incorporated in Australia to increase their expenditures on research and development. Basically the existing scheme operates by increases in their salary and contract expenditure between a particular year-the grant year-and a fixed base year, 196566. In addition, and subject to certain requirements, the net cost of plant and equipment purchases in the grant year is also eligible for grants.

77,Mr Mcmahoni Said At The Time That,"have been induced to begin or to increase research and development activities and there has been a marked increase in employment of qualified research staff. It has also shown, however, that there is still room for more technologically based companies to commence industrial research and development and for others to lift the level of their research activities. It is estitime on industrial research and developmated that grants under the present scheme over the 5-year period of its operation will be of the order of $60m. It will be remembered that I said earlier that there will be a substantial increase over tliis amount over the next 5 year period. Grants paid under the new scheme will depend on the rate of growth of industrial research and development expenditure by Australian companies, and on the grant rate determined from time to time, in the light of current circumstances, but the Government expects that total grants paid over the 5 years of the new scheme will be significantly greater than under the present scheme. Experience with the scheme has brought to light a number of areas where improvement could be effected. Full details of all amendments proposed will be made available in legislation which it is expected will be introduced in this session of Parliament. Following is an outline of the main features of the new arrangements proposed. Under the revised scheme, the base period will be an average of 3 consecutive years with a lag of one year between the final base year and the grant year. This has been decided upon in preference to the single base year provided under the present legislation. A single fixed base has been shown to have disadvantages between companies, particularly if a company happened to have an abnormally high expenditure in that year. In addition, with a fixed base, there is a tendency, once a company has raised the level of its effort on industrial research and development, for the incentive to become less effective as a means of stimulatingfirmsto go on increasing their industrial research and development effort year by year. The Government has decided to extend the range of items which will be eligible for grant purposes where the expenditure statement. can be clearly identifiable with the industrial research and development operations of the firm. These will include such items being no objection, leave, fs granted. as materials used in industrial research and development projects, technical information facilities, repairs and maintenance, and some administration costs associated with industrial research and development. In most cases, research and development work performed by employees engaged full ment for part of the year will be an allowable item of expenditure. It is proposed that plant expenditure will be treated in a manner broadly similar to that of other industrial research and development expenditures with increases in plant expenditure in the grant year over the base period being included in eligible expenditure. After careful consideration the Government has decided to retain the requirements in the present Act regarding professional qualifications but proposes to introduce some minor modifications of this procedure. The Government has in mind also a number of amendments. One of these is to require applicant companies to declare that they will exploit on normal commercial terms the results of their industrial and research development for the benefit of Australia. It is the Government's intention that companies which increase their allowable industrial research and development expenditures including salaries, plant and materials and contract expenditures between a particular year and the base period will qualify for a general grant in respect of expenditure up to $50,000 a year. For expenditure on industrial research and development in 1972-73, the rate of general grant will be set at 50 per cent. For selective grants involving expenditures over $50,000 grants will be payable to those companies which fulfil the national interest criteria of the Act. In coming to its conclusions, the Government has appreciated the helpful suggestions that had been put forward by those interested in the success of the scheme including the Manufacturing Industries Advisory Council and the Australian Industrial Research and Development Grants Board. Further details of the Government's proposals will be made known in the near future. Mr StewartI ask leave to make a",25,Grants For Industrial Research And Development
78,Mr Speaker,"I s leave granted? Thereindustry will be pleased with the slight improvements that have been foreshadowed by the Prime Minister( Mr come back to the 50 per cent. But I McMahon) to the Australian Industrial Research and Development Act, but industry feels that the present Act does not go far enough in encouraging it to have, more industrial research and development throughout industry. The scheme can be greatly improved, I am afraid that the Government, in the foreshadowed improvements to the Act, has worked on the old Act rather than look at some new ideas in the field of industrial research and develsection of the Prime Minister's speech: opment. An interdepartmental committee has been investigating what improvements should be made to the Act. I wonder whether that interdepartmental committee was instructed to work only on the Act at present in existence or whether it was given approval to look at other Acts throughout the world. Has a decision been taken by the Government or by the interdepartmental committee that this is the only industrial (research and development scheme that should be followed in Australia? For instance, in the United States of America 65 per cent of the amount spent on industrial research and development is given by the United States Government. In Australia, according to the fourth annual report of ithe Industrial Research and Develsome minor modifications. It seems to me opment Grants Board, only 863 companies in Australia have been assisted. In the year 1970-71 an amount of only $16,250,000 was paid out for industrial research and development. Australia is a young country. It needs new ideas. It needs new products. Our companies need encouragement in order to undertake the research and development necessary for these products. I feel that the Government needs to do far more in this area than it is doing at the moment. The encouragement it is giving to industry is not sufficient. We need far greater research in selected areas. I think that the Government should lay down the areas in which it will help and should give those selected areas greater incentive payments than it has given them in the past. I note from the speech of the Prime Minister that the amount of grant that can be made will be increased to 50 per cent with a maximum of $50,000. Previously that was the amount, but for some reason the Government a year or two ago reduced the amount payable to 35 per cent. Now it has also note that that 50 per cent grant is not. to operate until 1972-73, 15 months from now. I cannot help being suspicious when this legislation is foreshadowed in an election year, with the Government holding out the bait to industry but not introducing the legislation to bring the grant back to 50 per cent until the financial year 197273. I want to make some comments on this After careful consideration, the Government has decided to retain the requirements in the present Act regarding professional qualifications but proposes to introduce some minor modifications of this provision. The fourth annual report of the Australian Industry Research and Development Grants Board shows that 32 applications for grants were rejected because the industrial research and development work had not been performed by or the grants would not provide direct assistance to a professionally qualified person. So 32 companies, although doing industrial research and development work, were not able to receive a grant because the person in charge of the industrial research and development did not have a professional qualification. The Prime Minister said that he is to make that the requirement regarding a professional degree will be maintained. A constituent of mine, writing to me on this topic, said: I write regarding the Industrial Research and Development Grants Board, or, more specifically, the Act which governs its operation. One of many conditions imposed by the Act which must be met before a grant can be made is felt by us to be unnecessarily harsh. In fact this condition bars this division of the Company from receiving assistance although we do carry out worthwhile research and development in our field. We manufacture industrial power transmission equipment-gea r speed reducers, couplings, clutches, chain sprockets etc., and most of these products are designed and developed in our own plant. To remain competitive we keep our range of products nnder review and when required completelyre-design.We also develop special products for customers through design, prototype and eventually production stages. We bave had preliminary discussions with an officer of the Department of Trade which department acts on behalf of the Board in this city, and it would appear that all these activities are eligible for consideration by the board.",26,Grants For Industrial Research And Development
79,Mr Stewart (Lang),"Mr Speaker,However, we are barred from this consideration by another requirement which states that the research and development regarding which application is made must be carried out by, or under the direction of, a person qualified within the meaning of the Act, and this qualification virtually requires a University graduate in one of the Engineering disciplines. Our research and development is carried out either by myself or under my direction, and I have no such qualifications. I would point out that I havs been actively involved in the Mechanical Engineering industry for over 20 years, starting as an apprentice filter, machinist and loolmaker; 1 have had formal education in my field in that I completed the first 3 years of study in a S year Diploma course in Mechanical Engineering with the then University of Technology (now University of N.S.W.) Since abandoning lhat course of study because of ill health, 1 have continued to develop my theoretical knowledge of my own particular field. For the last 12 years I have been involved in engineering design in Ihis field and 3 years ago tlie Company saw fit to place me in charge of this area of activity. I thus describe my record to you not as a boost to my own ego, but as backing for my claim to have made of myself something of an expert in my own field. I certainly regard myself as better qualilied to direct research and developreferred to the Prime Minister. ment in this field than any 21 year old University graduate with no field experience, however bright he be, and yet such a person can gain recognition by the Board while I am excluded. Wc realise of course that there must be some restriction on recognition in order to ensure that research and development is being carried out efficiently and thoroughly, we cannot expect public money to support inefficient operations. We do contend, however, that the current formula is not merely unsatisfactory, but quite unfair in its operation. It is unfair in that without this assistance our research effort is somewhat more restricted than it otherwise would be, while it could be that a hypothetical competitor, with the aid of this grant, could be encouraged by thc government to expand his research work, thus giving him a government backed advantage in the market place, even though his research ability may be no better than our own. It is this requirement that we feel is particularly harsh. We feel further that ours cannot be the only authorises the publication of the evidence taken company placed in this position. There must be by the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital many other companies perfectly capable of doing Territory during the Australian Capital Territory worthwhile development being thus discouraged freehold lands inquiry. from doing so by the very act which was originally intended to encourage them. I repeat that the Prime. Minister said that the professional qualifications provisions of the Act would be maintained with some minor modifications. I do not suggest that the professional qualifications requirement should be taken away but people with the experience of my constituent-the 32 companies mentioned in the annual report of the. Board must employ people with practical knowledge and experience in their field but without professional qualifications^-ar e being debarred from receiving a grant under this Act. As I said earlier this country needs research and development; it needs a lot of new products, and it needs to have them manufactured efficiently and cheaply. Until this Government faces up to the problems that industry sometimes has in paying for its own research and development 1 believe that the research and development necessary in Aus'.ralia will not be continued at the rate at which it should be continued. I ask the Minister for National Development ( Mr Swartz), who is sitting at the table, to see that the argument advanced by my constituent for special provisions to be written into the Act to allow people with practical experience to draw a grant under this Act for industrial research and development are conveyed to the Prime Minister. Mr SwartzI shall see that the matter is I present a transcript of evidence taken by the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory of the previous Parliament during its Australian Capital Territory freehold lands inquiry. The transcript is presented at the request of the present Committee with a view to the authorisation of its publication. for National Development)-by leaverI move: That this House in accordance with the provisions of the Parliamentary Papers Act 1908-1963 This evidence was taken at public hearings by the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory appointed during the previous Parliament but publication of this evidence was not then authorised.

Question resolved in the affirmative. Discussion of Matter of Public Importance from the honourable member for Bass( Mr industry. It is the future of the CAC and Barnard) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to clarify and about a possible amalgamation of these 2 safeguard the future of the Australian aircraft groups, and whether Parliament would be industry. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion lo rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places) Opposition is concerned about the future of the Australian aircraft industry in view of disturbing developments in the past few monlbs. For many years now, the industry has stumbled along at a very low level of activity. It is to the credit of all the components of the industry that they have retained enthusiasm for aircraft design and forward planning despite the lack of Government encouragement and stimulation. In this dispiriting context the industry has come forward with Project N, a short take off and landing aircraft which is certainly competitive with any comparable aircraft and is probably superior. This has been achieved with only half-hearted Government encouragement. Indeed, some sections of the Government have been actively hostile to the project, notably the Minister for Air (Senator Drake-Brockman). Tlie future of ProjectN and its market prospects in the context of the present state of thc aircraft industry is one of the issues we will raise under the terms of this motion. But first 1 want to look at plans which have been bruited about in the past year for the rationalisation of the aircraft industry. In effect these plans mean some sort of rationalisation of the plans and activities of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Pty Ltd and the Government Aircraft Factories in Melbourne. The other major component of the industry, Hawker de Havilland Aust. Ply Ltd, has plants at Lidcombe and Bankstown in Sydney. I understand that the company's forward planning envisages the integration of these 2 plants. If this were done and an effective arrangement made between the CAC and the GAF in Melbourne, this is probably all that could be achieved in rationalising the overall structure of the Australian aircraft the GAF that concerns the Opposition at this moment. In the Senate last December, Senator Little questioned the Government fully informed before any commitment was made. The answer provided by the Minister for Supply( Mr Garland) indicated that rationalisation of the operations of the GAF and the CAC was under consideration. He described the objective of rationalisation as achieving a more stable and effective organisation that could develop with Australia's needs. According to the Minister, this would be in the long-term interests of the industry and those who worked in it. I hope to demonstrate as I proceed that there is no great disagreement on this point itself. The Minister said that an in-depth study of the practicability of the merger of the 2 organisations was being made. It was not expected that any firm recommendations would be before the Government until the early months of 1972. He adroitly dodged any reference to informing Parliament about the details of a proposed merger and allowing it to be debated fully. The situation at the moment, as I understand it, is that the report on merger proposals has been received and is in the hands of the Minister. Tbe Minister can correct me if this is not the position. There bave been disquieting rumours circulating in the CAC and the GAF that a merger of the 2 organisations is imminent. There has even been some suggestion that the announcement could be made",28,Joint Committee On The Australian Capital Territory

This is why the Opposition has raised this matter today need for 1 organisation is conceded, and to allow the Minister for Supply to outline I believe the economic case is overwhelmto the House what the merger proposals ing, what form should the combination of are and what impact they will have on the the 2 existing structures take. The fear relative status of the CAC and the GAF. It is an interesting feature of the answer merging the 2 with the CAC as the given by the Minister to Senator Little that dominant partner. This would mean the the terms merger and rationalisation are GAF would lose its identity and be incorinterchangeable. There is no reason why porated into the Commonwealth Aircraft rationalisation should be synonymous with Corporation. In effect the Commonwealth merger. Rationalisation as applied to would hive off its aircraft design and prodefence organisation and production duction capability to private industry. This usually means the integration of common raises several important matters of functions. This is a much less drastic step principle. than merging the 2 organisations into a new entity.

On this basis it would for new capital spending on equipment and be intolerable that the GAF be absorbed expansion, and the phasing out of areas of completely by a smaller partner. Yet there overlap. This is one approach to the are strong reasons to believe that this is problem; to my mind it is rather closer what the Government has in mind. to rationalisation than the merger terms envisaged by the Minister. Undoubtedly of the cost structure of the 2 organisations. this scheme has many merits; it would allow more effective co-ordination of the One comparison of costs that has been activities of the 2 plants. But in the supplied to me by GAF source puts the The time has passed when the GAF and of the work force at the GAF and the suspicion of members on this side of the House is that the Government intends In making these comments I do not intend any criticism of the CAC. It has pletely to the private companies is a very grave one which must be closely analysed by this House. In the first place it would It is difficult to make a valid comparison charge per man hour at $7.50 for the GAF and SI7.50 for comparable work by the CAC. I acknowledge that these figures may be disputed by the CAC and that the source may be biased; therefore 1 do not put them up as gospel. If correct, they show that the relative cost structures of the GAF and the CAC are poles apart. Absorbing a lower cost structure into a higher cost structure is not the way to produce cheaper aircraft. Another argument against allowing a merger with CAC, with CAC being the dominant partner, is that the Government would relinquish all capacity in the crucial area of aircraft production. This would leave the industry at the mercy of market forces. All private companies have an obligation to achieve profitability. No matter how dedicated the private companies in the industries are, there could be circumstances which would dictate curtailment or even abandonment of aircraft design and production. This might not correspond with our defence requirements or the national interest. Another argument is whether it is desirable to have a monopoly of weapons production in the hands of private industry. Labor Party policy is quite explicit on this point-that the Commonwealth Government should control all weapons and munitions manufacture. Obviously this includes the aircraft and guided missiles made by the aircraft industry. There is also the issue of overseas control; 6 of the 7 shareholders in the CAC are overseas companies which control two-thirds of the total shareholding. At a time when the Parliament is paying increasing attention to the extent of overseas ownership of Australian assets, do we want to hand over the aircraft industry in to to to overseas control? This raises also the question of possible conflicts of interest between overseas companies and Australia's defences. The next point I want to emphasise is the superior design and engineering capability of the GAF. This has been the main motive force behind the design and production of Jindivik, Malkara, Ikara, Turana and Project N. Some of these have been good export earners. ProjectN has the potential to be a good money-spinner if the Government can formulate effective marketing policies for it. A. most important aspect of any merger is the future of the staffs of the two organisations. The present combined workforce of the 2 plants is about 3,800 men. It is estimated that a merger could cut this workforce to 3,000 or 3,500 men-that is, up to 800 jobs would be lost. If the GAF were merged with the CAC it would stand to lose more of its workforce by retrenchment. Many of the GAF workforce are permanent public servants who have built up leave and superannuation rights. These officers must be protected and their entitlements must be assured. This is another compelling reason why the GAF must not be absorbed into the CAC. In the view of the Opposition, these arguments add up to an overwhelming case that the GAF should be retained and should be the dominant partner in any amalgamation of the plants at Fishermen's Bend. It sbould be possible for an amalgamation to be made which would maintain the Commonwealth's share in the aircraft industry and allow CAC to maintain a profit motive. I want lo make this perfectly clear. In the circumstances where in this country we have a viable aircraft industry which should be built up and which has such a clear and close relationship to the defence of Australia-no-on e should appreciate this more than the Opposition will not tolerate a situation in which the Australian Government does not retain at least 51 per cent of the shares in any industry or undertaking of this nature. In this regard it should be remembered that the Commonwealth makes a very substantial contribution to the profitability of CAC. The Opposition believes that Commonwealth control of the aircraft industry is paramount if the industry is to be competitive, if valuable skills built up in design and engineering are to be retained and if a lower cost structure is to be ensured. This is the broad nature of the Opposition's case against the merger which the Government seems lo have in mind. Unfortunately, I have not the time to look at the plans for Project N, but I am sure this issue will be dealt with by my colleagues. This is an admirable project, f believe that the aircraft has been designed with great expertise by GAF, which has now produced an aircraft whose performance and standard must be regarded as being amongst the best in the world. Yet, in this Parliament, the Minister for Air",29,Australian Aircrafr Industry
84,Minister For Defence ( Mr Fairbairn),"th emade a statement virtually condemning the aircraft and preventing any future expansion of production and, far more importantly, preventing possible purchasers from being able to place firm orders for ProjectN and, shortly afterwards, the Minister for Defence made a statement contradicting the Minister for Air. Who is right in this matter? Who does intend to give this industry the support that it now requires? One would hope that the Minister for Defence will be in a position to give some indication to the Parliament and, more particularly, to the people of Australia what the Government intends to do about tbe Australian aircraft industry and about Project N. ProjectN is an aircraft that has this time have a specific requirement for been designed by Australians to meet Australian needs as well as offering a fair proposition for companies overseas.

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition suggested that there had been a disagreement between my colleague, the Minister for Air (Senator Drake-Brockman), and myself. Let me read to the House some of what the Minister for Air said, just to make certain that this is not so. The Minister said: As far as I am aware, the committee in the Department of Defence, comprising members of the Departments of the Army, Supply and Air is still meeting to see whether there is a military need for this aircraft and whether that need is in the Air Force or in the Army. The Minister then went on to say that the Royal Australian Air Force does not at an aircraft of that type because he pointed out that the RAAF has helicopters, Caribou and DC3s which are able to carry out part of its job, namely, transportation of say now is that obviously much broader considerations are involved than simply I am sure that the situation at the is quite clear to everyone.

88,Mr Fairbairni Am Happy To Give,"produced in Australia and just to provide some employment, if the Services do not believe that it has a high priority. After all, Australia is a country whose resources must be husbanded. We must get our priorities right. When we have had an opportunity of assessing this fully, we will see what priority ProjectN should have. It could well be that the DDL, the F ill and other forms of equipment may have a higher priority. I am not saying that they have. WhatI am saying is that an assessment must be made. It is made initially by the Department of Defence. Eventually, as ail honourable members know, every decision to purchase any form of equipment is made finally by the Government in the light of all the information it can get from the Services and from the Department of Defence and also in the light of financial and other assessments. We have to assess what are the prospects for civil sales. The Defence (Industrial) Committee has met recently and is assessing the possibilities in these fields; in other words, it is assessing fhe expected cost of ProjectN and, of course, this depends very much on the number of orders for the aircraft. If we get large sales obviously we can sell much more competitively than if we get only small sales. We have also to bear in mind the effect that the purchase of ProjectN will have on the aircraft industry generally. We, as a Government, have said we believe that there is an essential need for an aircraft industry-perhap s for a relatively small one but nonetheless a viable one. It is essential that we should have an aircraft industry because there is a lot of work to be done in the field of servicing and modifying aircraft. For example, approximately SOO modifications were made to the Mirage. Unless we have a local viable aircraft industry we will not be able to do this. The Australian aircraft industry and Australian civil firms undertake a lot of work in maintaining RAAF aircraft. So that is another matter which will have to be taken into consideration. That is the present situation. All these matters will be all go or no go. If the RAAF decides that drawn together and discussed by the Defence Forces Development Committee, with perhaps some additions, and then a recommendation will be made to the Government. I expect that such a recommendation will be available to me by about the end of April; I hope that it will be even sooner. Allowing for delays which so often occur in these matters, I believe that I will receive an assessment of the aircraft at the end of April and we will decide whether to proceed with the production of the aircraft. The other matter which I want to mention is that a great deal of play has been made in the Press of the so-called fight going on between the RAAF and the Army as to who is to fly this aircraft. I can assure the House that there is no fight of any sort because no decision has been made as to whether the aircraft will gc to production. It is true that in the past certain arrangements have been made. Basically, the arrangement in Australia has been that the really light, small aircraft which were manned by the Army would be of the Cessna type. Generally speaking, these aircraft were regarded as small aircraft. They had an all up weight of 4,000 lb or less. There is no hard and fast rule in these matters. There was such a rule in the United Kingdom, but it was broken and eventually it was scrapped altogether. Today this rule does not apply in the Army because it is flying the Pilatus Porter which has a greater all up weight if it is taking off at the maximum all up weight. ProjectN is a larger aircraft, but it really depends on what role the aircraft will fill and who will fly it. It is true that it has an all up weight of 7,800 Ib. But I can assure the House that the question as to who will fly this aircraft is not the reason for any delay in this matter. If it is decided that there is a role for this aircraft in the Army, or in one of the other Services, it will be flown and the decision as to wlio flies it will be made after considering who is the most suitable. But, as I say, this is certainly not a reason for holding up ProjectN at the present time. Let me return to the aircraft industry generally. The aircraft industry throughout the world is always subject to violent fluctuations. This is one of the greatest problems which the industry faces. It is either it wants 100 Mirage aircraft, or some other number or type of aircraft, then it wants the aircraft as soon as possible. My colleague the Minister for Supply( Mr Garland) has the unenviable task of building up the aircraft industry to try to get into production as quickly as he possibly can. Afterwards he is then faced with the period, which must inevitably follow because we will not buy the same number of aircraft constantly, in which there is redundancy in the industry, and this is an extremely difficult matter. This just does not occur only in Australia. Some of the really large aircraft corporations overseas have had their problems. At one stage even the Douglas corporation, which is probably the greatest aircraft builder in the world, experienced extreme financial troubles and it had to merge. The same problms were faced by the Lockheed corporation-agai n an enormous aircraft producer-and it had to seek assistance. Of course, we know that Rolls-Royce in England has faced the same problems. So these problems are faced throughout the whole aircraft industry. My colleague the Minister for Supply and his officers have done their best to see whether thisfluctuationcan be overcome. I get around to that policy. believe that in the future we will not again go in, to the same extent, for a very large scale programme like the Mirage or Macon it and we will continue to work hard chi programmes. I think that what we on it. But, as I say, it is not easy because would seek to do is to get what are known certain components of a highly technical as offset orders. We would seek to make in nature cannot be produced in Australia, or Australia a portion of the plane that we else Australian production is not warranted were buying, or perhaps even of another because of the increased costs. Nevertheplane for which there was demand in the less, I will give one example to the honworld. In other words, we would make a ourable member. We are to make a light fin or a tail that is fitted to every aircraft observation helicopter. We intend making in that particular series which is produced just under 200 of them in Australia. But throughout the world. Australia might buy they are costing us 41 per cent more than a few of the aircraft. In this way we would they would cost if we purchased them not get this violent fluctuation in the airoverseas. But we believe that it is worthcraft industry which has caused and is causwhile doing this in order to stimulate the ing so much trouble in the aircraft indusAustralian aircraft industry. That is trj'. We are doing as much as we possibly another way in which we are assisting the can to get the Australian aircraft industry industry. We are also assisting it by into a viable situation. We want to have arranging offset orders, and this is particuadequate work available for what I have larly so in the field of American orders for described as a small, viable aircraft indusaircraft. Only yesterday I received a cable try. I have mentioned the work that was from the head of the Boeing corporation carried out on the Mirage and Macchi concerning Offset order proposals for the aircraft. Repairs and servicing are being Boeing 727 aircraft. We hope that it may carried out on those aircraft and some be possible to continue in this field, but aircraft are still being produced. The Jindivik is still in production. This under the Government's programme of is a remarkable plane. It first flew, I think, offset orders. Let me conclude by saying some 15 years ago, yet there is still a that we are doing our utmost to maintain a demand for it. Had it not been for the viable aircraft industry. We are also proBuy American laws I am sure that we ducing the Ikara. My colleague the Miniswould have sold a considerable number of ter for Supply has just announced a quite Jindiviks to the United States. As it is, we have sold some to that country, but there was some obvious barrier to their sale. Australian laws? answer that interjection if I had time. AllI can say is that we have a policy of ensuring the utmost participation of Australian industries and Australian firms in any sort of production. Obviously there are occasions on which this cannot be done. Let us look at the F ill aircraft. We could not tool up to build only 24 of those aircraft, but we can make certain parts for it, and this is what we are doing. In fact, if the honourable member for Blaxland is interested I can give him figures which indicate that the share of Australian production in defence orders has increased very markedly over the last 4 years. even at the present moment about $5m worth of work is available to Australia",32,Australian Aircrafr Industry

The Minister's time has expired. Minister for Defence( Mr Fairbairn) has made some remarkable statements. In referring to an answer given by the Minister for Air (Senator Drake-Brockman) he held up a copy of Hansard but did not quote from it. He gave bis own version. Mr FairbairnI did not quote fully. not accurately. The Minister for Air said: But as Minister for Air, perhaps I should say to the Senate that the Royal Australian Air Force does not at this time have a specific requirement for an aircraft of the type of Project N, either to help in its own operations or to help in the operations of the Army wbich it carries out for the Army. That is a fairly definite statement. Later that same evening the Minister for Defence felt obliged to present a statement to the Press. I am extremely sorry that he did not feel obliged to present it to Parliament because Parliament could have been taken more into the Government's confidence about the future of this industry. The Minister said in his Press statement: While there was not a pressing need for the RAAF to add an aircraft of tbe type of ProjectN to its inventory at this stage the RAAF does not provide all the aviation requirements of the Army. That seems to contradict what the Minister has said today, but I do not want to argue that point at great length. In referring today to the future of ProjectN , and also in his Press release to which I have referred, tbe Minister has said it appears that evaluation of the project will be completed at the end of April and a decision taken then as to whether the aircraft will go into production. The aircraft has been flying for at least 3 months, and possibly longer. It appears to be an undue delay to wait until the end of April to make a decision. I understand the aircraft will receive an airworthiness certificate this month. Meanwhile the whole of the development team is sitting around twiddling its thumbs, waiting for the Government make up its mind whether to proceed with production. I appreciate that the Minister for Supply( Mr Garland) has been doing his best to get some movement, but unless there is very rapid action the development and future sales of tbe aircraft will be seriously jeopardised through delays in delivery dates, lt is my understanding that if production started tomorrow deliveries could not be effected until towards the end of August next year. There is to be a delay of at least a further 2 months before orders are placed, before the necessary materials and so on can be ordered for a production run. It therefore seems that delivery will not be effected before October of next year. That seems to be an unwarranted delay on a project for aircraft which would be so readily saleable on the world markets. It is a project which so obviously is desirable for Australia's defence forces. I think we paid about $lm for the Pilatus aircraft which has no greater capacity than the aircraft known as ProjectN . I understand that the military version of the ProjectN aircraft will cost about $400,000. That contrasts seriously with the way in which an Australian developed aircraft with tremendous capacity is being treated. A further contrast is provided by the F ill , to which the Minister referred. The Government was able to purchase the F ill from a rough sketch. There was no waiting to see whether the aircraft had proved itself. It was bought from a sketch, nothing more or less, and not from a detailed plan. We simply bought an idea. In the case of ProjectN , an Australian aircraft designed by an Australian Government owned industry, the Government has to wait 2 months after it has received an airworthiness certificate and wait for every test to be passed before it is prepared to invest less than $10m in a production run. The amount involved is less than the cost of one F ill , and less than the increased cost of 2 F ill s from the time they were ordered. We do not know yet what the final cost of them will be. Let us not have crocodile tears shed about getting the best value for our money, in view of the amount of defence expenditure in recent years that has gone to pay for the increased cost of the flying ostrich. The Australian aircraft industry is important to Australia's defence and it must be retained within the control of the",34,Australian Aircrafr Industry

94,Mr Scholes (Corio) (4.31),The,35,Australian Aircrafr Industry
95,Mr Scholes,"That is correct-an dAustralian Government. The major share of its assets are clearly in the hands of the Australian Government. If a merger is necessary-and there is some evidence that it is-it should be on the basis of the equity of the 2 organisations involved. A 50-50 control arrangement has been generally considered. There is no doubt in the world that such an arrangement would give effective control to a private supplier. The major shareholders in such a supplier could be firms such as Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, which seem to stand in favour with the present Government. The future of the industry is not important only to defence. It is also important to the people who work in it. I do not think it would do any harm if the Government were to give a very firm undertaking to the people working in tbe industry that their rights and conditions would be protected in any merger arrangement, especially pension rights. I understand that this type of arrangement was made when the Government gave away Bell Bay to an American corporation. I think the Government could give a clear indication to those persons employed in the Government Aircraft Factories that they will not lose the rights and privileges which have accrued to them merely because the Government wants to get out from under in the aircraft industry. There are a number of other important matters relating to the aircraft industry. I have not been able to find out the future proposals for the Avalon section of the Government Aircraft Factories. It is said that it is in the merger, and then it is said that it is not in the merger. My present understanding is that there is a proposal for the physical facilities to be retained by the Government but leased to the new company. I suggest that that would mean that the new company would control the assets at Avalon. That may not be correct, but this Parliament has not been let in on the secret. The Minister for Supply may not have finished reading the report. He may not know what the recommendations are. One other important matter that should be aired is that while a private company involved is able to employ public relations people to put its point of view it has been clearly pointed out in correspondence to representatives of the Government Aircraft Factories that if they make statements about the industry in public they are liable to prosecution. This is a rather serious situation. Employees of a private company involved in a merger arrangement are allowed to protect the interests of that company but persons concerned in the goverament industry are threatened with prosecution under the Crimes Act if they take any part in debate on the matter. Quite obviously the public can get only a one-sided argument. Considerable costs would be involved in moving machinery and other equipment in the new industry. It seems to me there is justification at least to examine a proposal to relocate the whole of the industiy at Avalon where an aerodrome facility is available. This is not available at Fisherman's Bend. An airfield is vital to the development of an aircraft industry. The present facilities at Fisherman's Bend would preclude the testing or the manufacture of aircraft of any size there. It seems probable that this proposal will be unacceptable because of the employment requirements of the existing work force. The work force is entitled to serious consideration. From the figures I have been able to obtain it would appear that there will be a reduction of about 10 per cent in the present work force. This is to be added to a very substantial reduction in the work force in the last 12 months. The figures I have show that the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation employed 2,550 personnel in January 1971 and 1,973 in 1972. I do not have the figures for the Government Aircraft Factories. So there has already been a drop of some 600 or nearly 25 per cent in the employment of CAC and I would imagine that GAF has suffered a very similar drop in the number of persons it employs. A further drop of 10 per cent on top of that will mean a very substantial decrease in the employment of very skilled persons in the aircraft industry. Both of these companies, and especially the Government Aircraft Factories, have proved themselves over many years to be one of the most worthwhile defence industries in Australia. It is up to the Government to show a far greater confidence in this industry, and for the expenditure of an amount of money less than that needed for the purchase of one F ill it can get ProjectN off the ground. It is time someone in the Government showed sufficient foresight and courage to stand up and say to the industry: 'You can prepare to enter production of this aircraft and commence the marketing of it'. If the Minister for Defence has not the courage to do this he should not occupy that position. The Government will buy an aircraft off the drawing board in one instance but will not buy another aircraft until months after it has proven itself. -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Supply) (4.42)-This is a discussion of a matter of public importance raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr has manufactured some 900 Malkaras; Barnard) and which reads: The failure of the Government to clarify and safeguard the future of the Australian aircraft industry. The honourable gentleman said by way of interjection to my colleague, the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairbairn), a moment ago that the debate was about the future of rationalisation and he wanted to know what was going on. I put it to the honourable gentleman that they are not the terms of this matter of public importance. He has pre-judged the position; he said there has been a failure. Tbat is of importance too because if one cares to look at the debates in the Senate and in this House in the course of the last year or so it will be seen that a great deal has been said about the aircraft industry by Government spokesmen. Major statements were made by my predecessor on 9th April 1970 and on 4th November 1970. He answered questions on the subject, as the. responsible Minister and I did too-o n 6th October 1971, page 1990 and 9th November 1971, page 3158. I refer to these occasions not only to reply to the point that the honourable member mentioned but also to record now that that information is there and to anyone seriously interested in this subject. I suggest that they read some of those remarks which are complementary to what will be said in this debate because I do not propose to go over a lot of that ground again. I have only 10 minutes available to me. 10157/72-R -[15 ] The Government has given a good deal of support to the aircraft industry in spite of what we have heard this afternoon in the 2 speeches from the Opposition side. MightI very briefly go over the ground. All aircraft which have been required by the Services in Australia in sufficient numbers since the end of the Second World War have been made here in the Government Aircraft Factories, the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Pty Ltd or by Hawker de Havilland Australia Pty Ltd. These aircraft include Canberras, Sabres, Winjeels, Vampires, Mirages and Macchis-al l sophisticated aircraft. Some 550 have been manufactured here to a large extent, including jet engines. This shows the remarkable capacity of the Australian aircraft industry. In addition Australia has designed guided weapons. It some 435 Jindiviks-and there are prospects of a further sale to another countryand something over 1,000 highly sophisticated Ikara missiles together with ships' gear and launchers. As we well know, the present problem is that the defence aircraft industry, which includes the 3 establishments I have referred to, employs some 7,000 men and the industry includes maintenance as well as the capacity of the commercial airlines. It is an industry which, unfortunately, as the Minister for Defence has said, has its peaks and troughs. This is so all over the world. At the moment all over the world it is in a trough. We are in a stage of lowered capacity and work load brought about by the fact that the need for aircraft which have been assembled or manufactured here-the Macchi and Mirage; the big jobs of the past-is no longer there and until replacement aircraft come along to increase the work load there must be a period of diminished activity. The reason for this clearly is that the life of these aircraft is longer than the time it takes to manufacture them. So we are in a trough and have these production programmes finishing. The work load now is mainly in respect of the Jindivik and Ikara, offset co-productive work, overhaul modifications, spares manufacture and the Turana, which is our high-speed low-level target drone. The Government is trying to develop more projects which can be handled by the",35,Australian Aircrafr Industry
96,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock),,37,Australian Aircrafr Industry
97,Mr Garland (Curtin,"Minister foraircraft industry. We are promoting sales. I was able recently to announce sales to Brazil amounting to some $20m. The manufacture of the Ikara for the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Navy is proceeding. We are promoting more Jindivik sales. Admittedly it is a tarofficially those offers and contacts are get aircraft at the end of its life but there being made in the context of selling Ausare prospects for further sales. We are continuing with the Turana development and an initial production order for 12 were received recently from the Royal Navy. Very soon there will be the selection of an aircraft which will replace the Winjeel and one can say that there will be some Australian participation in its production. In addition there is the Bell light observation helicopter project involving some 191 helicopters, most of which are to be built in Australia; however, I will not go into the details of that now. It is a contract which the Government initiated and concluded in such a way that there would be a significant work load to the industry. There is on the horizon the collaborative production and development of the replacement of the Macchi jet trainer. When overseas recently I had an opportunity to discuss some production possibilities for our aircraft industry, including the Government Aircraft Factories. The Hawker Siddeley 1182 and the Alpha-jet are 2 that the Government is looking at, and others are making representations to the defence group. In addition there is the production of Project N. A good deal has been said about that. On this I am urgently seeking a decision. The Minister for Defence has mentioned the circumstances in relation to it. It was said by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the industry brought this project forward. That is simply not so. The Government authorised this aircraft and put towards it $4.5m. The project is now at the next stage. The major question now, and one which is some way off, is what Australia can do to participate in the production of the replacement for the Mirage. Let me say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members interested that the Government is very interested in .lis industry and is making great efforts to obtain offset work for it. But such work has to be practical, economic and really beneficial to our defence capacity. We have contracts valued at some $5m in hand and there are very great prospects of further opportunities before very long. Let me make another point which is frequently overlooked. When there are suggestions of purchases by other countries of project N and Turana we should remember that tralia other aircraft or weapons. What we are offered is a package deal, not just an isolated sale. We have to consider, together with the Services and the defence group, whether a particular aircraft offered is one which will fit into our programme and is part of our requirement. It canno just be a question of blindly buying something we do not need in order to sell our own product. In the couple of minutes I have left to me in which to speak I want to say something about rationalisation. A working party to the Government Aircraft Factories and the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation has investigated this matter. Its report was given to me last Friday. I read that report on Sunday and discussed it in Melbourne on Monday morning. That is another example of the action which is being taken by the Government-comin g back to the subject of this debate-to clarify and safeguard the future of the Australian aircraft industry. I think that this matter is something which has to be considered in its proper context. I would point out in regard to the question of rationalisation that there are 2 adjacent establishments in Fishermen's Bend which employ some 3.700 people, that those establishments have considerable assets between them and that they are of a substantial size. Therefore they are of basic interest to not only the Australian economy but also the aircraft industry. I have mentioned certain work which is being done in the aircraft industry. A great deal of that work is done in that area. (Extension of time granted) I thank honourable members. In the consideration of any rationalisation proposal very serious thought would have to be given to the effect of rationalisation on the work force. I do not think that it would be possible, as a matter of practical negotiation and organisation, to get a quick result. One has to remember that in the sorting out of equipment and plant which would necessarily precede rationalisationI will return to that aspect in a moment-ther e would be, of course, a great deal of work which is other than normal work. SoI do not believe that, as a result of rationalisation, there would be any immediate difficulty insofar as the work force is concerned. I do think that I should refer briefly to some of the things that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I Mr Barnard) said. Let me assert at the beginning that I think that the report on rationalisation establishes a case for greater efficiency and capacity. What we now have to look at are the structures of management, the financial arrangements, the terms and conditions and the objectives that would be involved if these 2 organisations were to come together. Of course, it would be very much a question from now on of negotiations between the 2 parties. One of the problems which will arise is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to as the relative status. Obviously that would be fundamental. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition went on to talk about whether rationalisation meant closer co-operation or a merger. That is one of the reasons why the report was prepared. It was to examine what could be done. I think it is becoming fairly clear, and I was pleased to hear him say, the economic case appears to honourable menibers on the other side of the chamber to be overwhelming. I think that that is exactly what the report discloses. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also went on to say that it was the view of honourable members on his side of the House that the CAC would dominate any joint enterprise. I do not know what is the source for that statement, but I would suggest that it is not correct. I would also suggest that all the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said after making that assertion is invalid. I query whether the saying of such things helps in the present situation with the degree of uncertainty which exists in these establishments. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition went on to refer to the position of the Hawker De Havilland organisation. I do not want to say very much on that subject. AllI want to say is that the position of that company, which is largely its business as it is a private company, is something to which some urgent consideration is being given by the Government. Substantial aspects are involved about which the Government is concerned. I have been in personal contact with the company -as , of course, have officers of my Department-o n a number of occasions. In fact, I spoke with the Chairman of the parent company and with others in London recently. I would emphasise that important considerations are involved in the industry as a whole which will not be resolved very quickly. I believe that there are a few members of the Opposition who are very interested in this subject, but I think I should point out that only the required number of 8 members, or just a few more, were present to enable this matter to be brought forward wheu it was called on. It is perhaps a pity that this matter was raised by the Opposition at a time when the proceedings of this chamber are not being broadcast. I think it is fair to say that no tremendous interest is being shown in this matter by a great number of members of the Opposition. But I think it is my duty as a Minister involved in this area to say that I have found in the ranks of the alternative government a dilemma on this matter. I believe that the left wing members of the Opposition are opposed to defence expenditure but that they realise that to cut it off would result in men losing their jobs and that they do try to have a bit each way. There are many debates in this chamber on foreign affairs and, according to the official spokesmen for the Australian Labor Party, there is no threat or likely threat to Australia. I suppose the Opposition wants to appear to be sympathetic, hoping to please those who are employed in defence industries. I make no apologies for having a vested interest in this matter, which involves an industry that employs nearly 4,000 people who live in the electorate which I represent. Fishermen's Bend is wholly within the electorate of Melbourne Ports. I suppose it is some assurance to hear the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairbairn) say that he believes in the necessity for a viable aircraft industry and the Minister for Supply( Mr Garland) indicate that the Government is apparently hastening slowly insofar as the working out of terms of any new arrangement is concerned. I hope that both",37,Australian Aircrafr Industry
98,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) (4.56),"Ministers will keep the House informed people concerned with this matter did, the from time to time as to the progress of article by Mr John Stackhouse in. the Ausany changes that may be upon us and that tralian 'Financial Review' of 4th October any merger proposition will come before 1971. The heading stated: the Parliament for its consideration. The Minister for Defence claimed that we need a viable aircraft industry. With due respect to him, I do not think that he spelt out very clearly what are the terms of that viability. I am not too sure that the word 'viable' is necessarily the correct one to use in the sense in which that word is usually economically. The word 'viable' usually means being able to pay for itself. I think it must be acknowledged that the aircraft industry in Australia as well as anywhere else must depend basically on government orders for its existence. I think that is true even in the United States of America, but the magnitude of the expenditure in that country is so great that ordintomers for these kinds of aircraft have had ary economic criteria cannot always be applied. 1 do not mean by that that one should be reckless in one's expenditure. But one has to bear in mind that Australia is a country which is remote from most other countries and that even if it could not-and I do not believe it could-buil d all the aircraft that would ever be required in Australia it could certainly specialise in the makng of some types of aircraft and it should also be able to maintain its own aircraft, both civil and military. To that extent there is always a need to have some kind of aircraft complex behind the scenes. I think that the Government has itself from time to time said that there are really 4 arms of the defence activity. Three of those arms are the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. The fourth arm is the defence capacity of Australian industry. Here, at least, is part of that defence capacity of Australian industry which is not very certain about its future. From time to time, generally in these periods of crisis when the employees are worried about the future, I visit the Government Aircraft Factories and the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation. The employees have every right to be worried. When I visit the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation it is generally when there is some difficulty about future orders. Much has been said today about Project N. I read some months ago, as I suppose most Aircraft export prospects help bargaining stance. The article involved this question of offset orders. I think both Ministers who have spoken in the debate referred to the fact that a little give and take is involved in this matter. If we are to buy aircraft from someone else and we have an industry of a kind, we use the fact that we want to buy in an attempt to obtain offset orders. But I also found out from the management of CAC that one of the difficulties involved in export prospects, particularly for the ProjectN aircraft and more latterly because the Corporation has an interest in the selling of Cessna aircraft, is that many of the developing countries which could be cusdifficulties obtaining long term credit. I think that this is a point that well could be pursued by the Ministers involved in association with the Minister for Trade and Industry( Mr Anthony). After all, Australia must be concerned in the future to increase its exports of capital goods. Here is a chance for the aircraft industry. As with any other industry, costs would be lowered by reason of the volume of sales. It seems to me that many potential customers for the project N or Cessna type of aircraft would buy if payment could be made over a long term. It is time we used the agencies of such bodies as the Export Payments Insurance Corporation to try to encourage further sales overseas. What is overlooked sometimes in these considerations is the pride that the people who work in this industry have in the work they are doing. One of the sad things I notice sometimes when I visit the factories, is that skilled tradesmen have very little work to do because of the difficulty in obtaining continuity of orders. This is frustrating to their sense of craft as well as not being very sensible anyway. This is why it is time the Government was a little more definite as to what it really thinks are the criteria for viability in this industry. I think that the matters I have suggested bave to be taken into account. We have to be able to service both civil and military aircraft. For instance, I find that employees at the Government Aircraft Factories like to think of themselves as separate in the course of production. Even if a merger were to take place, they have suggested that they would still like to have a separate ments. In fact, they have indicated their identity within the terms of the merger. These are matters that have to be considered. I do not know how much the ordinary employees are considered when mergers take place. When I go to talk to them, I discover their feelings of unease. Many of them think that the Government will sell out to what is called the private company. I am not too sure sometimes whether some of these private interests in the company might not be prepared to do the reverse. They might like to unload their capital, put it somewhere else and leave the Government to handle the merger. I do not think anybody imagines that vast fortunes will be made in the merged industry. The experience in America and more recenly the aviation section of RollsRoyce in Great Britain indicates how vulnerable these kinds of industries can become in the face of technological change. Sums of the order of $30m to $40m have been mentioned in regard to capitalisation. I suppose that the wages bill for the 2 factories which employ approximately 4,000 employees would aggregate $15m to SI6m. So this is a significant industry. The Opposition has raised this issue way it possibly can. The RAAF has been today mainly because it feels that there is the principal supporter of the aircraft an atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty as industry in Australia for the past 30 vears. to the future of this industry. At least we Both the Government and the RAAF have have received some assurances from both supported the industry because they have the Minister for Defence and the Minister recognised that aircraft production and, for Supply that they believe an industry is indeed, all Australian industry must in necessary and that they will not transact times of emergency provide many of the any mergers without some consideration weapons, ammunition, equipment and supbeing given to the public interest.

I consider that this is the only way in which the Government can proceed in the development of the aircraft industry in Australia-wit h due caution and with what is hoped will be wise and considered judgment. I want to speak mainly of the Royal Australian Air Force and the support it has given the Australian aircraft industry and which it is giving it at the present time, representing as I do in this chamber the Minister for Air (Senator DrakeBrockman). I am sure that the facts I put on record in the House will illustrate that the Government has maintained a continual policy of supporting the Australian aircraft industry over the past 30 years and that it intends to keep doing this in every The benefits which flow from RAAF",39,Australian Aircrafr Industry
99,Mr Holten (Indi,"Minister for support of a rapidly growing and highlyFrance has not only kept the native industry in being, but also has helped to modernise it and to introduce new techniques which will spread beyond the aircraft industry into other engineering fields. Thus the placement of orders within Australia accelerates developments which might otherwise take many years to emerge, and it also encourages the growth of native skills. A few brief statistics will indicate further the support by the RAAF for the Australian aircraft industry. Aircraft purchases now total about 1,300, with about 1,000 being made locally. The decision to build the RAAF's new Macchi all-through jet trainer in Australia was another important boost to the Australian aviation industry. More recently, an Australian manufacturer was awarded a contract, against overseas competition, for 100 automatic direction finding systems for the Macchi trainer. Local manufacture of aircraft might mean some delay and possibly, as has been stressed by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Supply, some increase in costs, but the Government and the RAAF believe that the many benefits to be derived from keeping a great Australian industry in being more than compensate for these disadvantages of delay and an increase in cost. In recent years considerindustry this year. Also, all aircraft engines able importance has been placed on the negotiation of reciprocal purchasing when aircraft are bought overseas. Reciprocal purchasing can take the form of partproduction, co-production or offset procurement, as was mentioned by the Minister for Supply, and it requires that Australian industry become involved to some degree in the production of the aircraft in question or at least in work of a similar technology. It would be interesting for the House and the people of Australia to know that in the last financial year the RAAF spent in Australia S224m out of a total budget of S300m. Much of this was spent within the Australian aircraft industry. Here in Australia major contractors and suppliers to the RAAF total almost 200, whilst suppliers on a small scale run into hundreds more. These contractors include the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, the Government Aircraft Factories, Hawker De Havilland Australia Pty Ltd, Dunlop Rubber Australia Ltd and other large companies. To ensure that the maximum number of orders is placed locally, the procurement of products from overseas is constantly reviewed. If the RAAF is forced to order a product from overseas because of unavailability in Australia, the next time it is to be purchased reference is again made to tbe local industry. If the product has since been developed and manufactured locally, the local industry is given every consideration. I have already mentioned the price differential. A further matter that is taken into consideration is that any tariff protection that is given to Australian industry is added on to the price of the overseas product when the purchase is being considered. In addition to the things I have mentioned, the RAAF plays a very important part in assisting the Australian aircraft industry in the maintenance and engineering fields. In the time that I have available it is not possible for me to detail completely the areas in which the RAAF makes use of the Australian aircraft industry in the maintenance and engineering fields, but let me give one statistic that will illustrate the amount of support that it gives. On maintenance, service and engineering support thc RAAF has spent SI l i m in the aircraft are allotted to the industry for major repair and overhaul. The few facts J have given will illustrate the vital part that the RAAF plays in safeguarding the Australian aircraft industry. Those facts are also indicative of the Government's firm policy of maintaining an aircraft industry in Australia. Tn conclusion let me reiterate a couple of major points that really underlie the whole difficult situation in maintaining a satisfactorily developing aircraft industry to which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and Government speakers have referred. Honourable members will have seen instances around the world of huge companies being in greatfinancialdifficulty. The Boeing, Lockheed, Douglas and Rolls Royce companies are 4 huge enterprises which have found it extremely difficult financially to undertake successfully an aircraft industry or part of an aircraft industry. The whole history of this industry around the world shouts caution to the Australian Government, as representatives of the Australian taxpayers, in trying to invest the taxensure a continuity of work and a continuity payers' money in the wisest and most judicious way possible. Let me reassure the House and the Australian people that the Government is concerned about the future of the employees of the aircraft industry and the production of the aircraft industry, and will continue to show its interest and concern in the most practical way possible. -The Opposition bas raised today the question of the future of the Australian aircraft industry by way of this discussion of a matter of public importance because the Opposition is concerned about the future of this important industry. It is providing employment for approximately 6,600 men and women, very highly skilled people, who cannot be replaced overnight. The industry has been built up over the years to an efficient industry. All that it requires is a continuity of employment and a continuity of orders. Therefore, if it receives them from the Government-it is the Government that can provide this work-the industry can continue to expand and prosper and provide this country with a very revolved around 2 points. At the moment important defence industry. Let me make a few points before I deal ernment Aircraft Factories, is greatly conwith the subject as a whole. The statement cerned about what will happen if these 2 made by the Minister for Defence( Mr organisations merge. The Opposition supFairbairn), when he said that the Services ports the proposition that they should must consider the performance of Project merge because, first and foremost, we N before they can make a decision on believe that by a merger of these 2 orgawhether to recommend to the Government nisations we can achieve a viable economic that it be purchased and proceeded with, organisation which can ensure continuity astounds me. Surely, before the prototypes of employment and development in the were designed and developed to their aircraft industry. It should eliminate, or we present stage, the Department of Defence, hope it will eliminate, some of the overlapthe Department of Air and the Department ping which so seriously affects the industry of the Army discussed with the Governat the moment. But we support the merger ment Aircraft Factories what they would of GAF and CAG with these reservations: like to have incorporated in the aircraft and We believe that the merger should be what they would want it to do. Such things based on the value of the assets of the 2 would be of major importance. We all know organisations which are to be moulded into that most aircraft in the world today one and that the merger should include all basically depend upon a military version the operationsI emphasise the words 'all first of all being expanded and developed. the operations'-o t both organisations. The Minister's statement surprises me. I Never mind picking out and retaining for cannot understand what he meant. He also one section that portion which is finanmade reference to the fact that the light cially attractive and out of which a profit helicopters which are being purchased by can be made. It should be a matter of one the Services are costing about 32 per cent in all in or one out ail out. more because of the Australian cost component. This situation comes back once again to the failure of the Government to of experience by the Australian aircraft industry. As with the Ikara missile and the other important defence components that have been built by the Government Aircraft Factories over the years, one of the things that has hindered the manufacturers year after year has been the fact that they have received orders in tens and twelves. They have never had a real run of continuity of production. They have had small orders. Every time they get an order they have a small runthrough on it. They are tooled up for the $20m Brazilian order for the Ikara, but there is a break in the continuity of work on the various component parts as some design work has to be done. This all costs money. This is why the costs of the Australian aircraft industry are up. There is a requirement for continuity of work, design experience and everything else that goes to keep an industry up to date with what is happening throughout the world. I believe that this debate today has the industry, particularly the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and the GovIn my opinion it is most important that the conditions of the employees of the",41,Australian Aircrafr Industry
100,Mr Charles Jones (Newcastle) (5.17),"merging organisations should be guaranteed. I think one of the first things that the Minister for Supply, who stated that he had received and read a report on the proposed merger, should do is to tell the employees of these 2 organisations that their superannuation rights and existing conditions of employment will be protected. Other industries that have taken place in mergers have had to contend with this question of superannuation. The Government should make an early decision on this matter and should put the minds of people in the industry at rest. Ministers have stated that the Government is assisting the aircraft industry. I am not satisfied that it is assisting the aircraft industry to its maximum capacity. None of the Ministers who have spoken already in this debate has produced any evidence that the government is doing something positive. In the past 10 years our airline operators-Qantas Airways Ltd, Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australiahave purchased from overseas aircraft to a total value of $540m. Qantas has purchased in that period $365m worth of aircraft. TAA and Ansett have purchased $175m worth, and only in recent weeks the Minister for Civil Aviation (Senator Cotton) announced that approval had been granted to TAA and Ansett each to purchase four Boeing 727 200 series aircraft at a total cost of $67.5m. Also in the past 10 years commuter aircraft-the y are the little aircraft that carry 6, 7 and up lo about 10 passengers-to the value of $6,528,000 have been purchased for use in Australia. I have not taken into consideration the huge amount that has been spent on the F ill . I have referred only to purchases of the domestic aircraft. What has the Australian aircraft industry really got out of these purchases. None of the Ministers has given us the facts. The real position is that the industry has received offset payments to a value of a little over $5m. What a very small amount of money that is in the form of offset payments against the huge amount that has been spent overseas. Just imagine what could be done to stabilise the Australian aircraft industry if much better deals had been made. Other countries have been able to negotiate through their commercial airline operators much more favourable offset payment arrangements than we have been able to negotiate. In this field the Goverament has failed badly in maintaining a continuity of employment for its own industry. Certainly it has had the Mirage, the Macchi and aircraft of this type built in Australia. But in my opinion all that the Government did in relation to those aircraft is what it should have done; it has really done nothing to force the commercial operators to negotiate decent offset payments. Even at the present time in the replacement of the Macchi trainer there is an excellent opportunity for the Australian aircraft industry to break into the field of design and development and to have a decent throughput of work on the aircraft which was mentioned by the Minister-the HS1182, which is an English aircraft being designed by the British Government. The Government should be moving on this aircraft and doing something positive about it so that the Australian industry can develop. Finance is most important. Until such time as the Government is prepared to establish an institution on the lines of the American Export-Import Bank or the British Export Credits Guarantee Department to assist the sale of Project N, we will not get anywhere in Australia. I do not want to waste my time talking about the virtues of Projeot N, but the Government could really provide some assistance to the Australian aircraft industry in the sale of an aircraft such as Project N, and the sale of the HS1182 and other aircraft. We know that the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation missed out on the sale of Macchi trainer jets to the Royal New Zealand Air Force because of one thing only-the Corporation was not in a position to compete, not in relation to the price of the aircraft, but in relation to the financial arrangements that the British Government was able to make. Therefore we lost the sale of that aircraft. Luchetti)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. -Afte r hearing the 3 speeches by the speakers on the Government side in this debate there is really very little else that remains to be explained. I would have thought that the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairbairn), the Minister for Supply( Mr Garland) and the Minister for Repatriation",43,Australian Aircrafr Industry
101,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr,,44,Australian Aircrafr Industry
102,Mr Brown (Diamond Valley) (5.27),"( Mr Holten) had given an ample and satisfactory explanation to the House on the few points that had been raised by the nard), who led for the Opposition in this debate. In reply to the first point, that is the rationalisation for the merger of the Government Aircraft Factories and the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, I thought the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Supply made the position very clear. They said that this proposed merger has been under consideration and close examination and that a report had been prepared on the feasibility of the proposal. That report, of course, was received by the Minister for Supply only last Friday. This Government is extremely competent, but it is not within the realms of possibility for the Government to absorb such a detailed and involved report on such an important matter and to reach a decision in a couple of days. As I listened to the argument on this part of the issue I was reminded of the last matter of public importance that I debated in this House following the concrete pipes decision in the High Court of Australia. That decision was handed down by the High Court on a Friday and lo and behold on the following Tuesday we were landed with a matter of public importance berating the Government for not having legislated to the full extent of its powers which had been elucidated by the High Court only 3 or 4 days before. These things take time. My saying that is not an evasive tactic by any means. These things are important; they are involved and they take time to investigate. I have no doubt that the Government will be looking at the report on the proposed merger with all the attention and care that it deserves and that in due course a reasonable decision will be made. It is under consideration and no doubt a decision will be made fairly scon as to what the Government believes is in the best interests of the aircraft industry in work that has been done on the construcAustralia so far as this proposed amalgamation or merger is concerned. As to the terms of the matter of public importance itself the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Barnard) indicated that what he was basically concerned about was an announcement on the sale to Brazil of thc proposed amalgamation or merger. I $20m worth of Ikara missiles. I do not do not want to misquote the Deputy Leader think enough credit has been given to thc of the Opposition on this occasion or on any other occasion, but it did seem to me that he did not say unequivocally whether or not the Opposition supported the amalgamation or merger. There were a number of conditions or a number of qualifications. I for one would like to know specifically what the view of the Opposition is on this proposal. I understand that there is yet to be one more speaker from the Opposition side in this debate and no doubt he will, in view of the fact that I have invited the Opposition to do it, state clearly whether or not it supports the amalgamation. I would like to know. The other matter that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition quite rightly drew attention to was Project N. This is a project that deserves having attention focused on it. But here again the Minister for Supply gave what I would consider, looking at it objectively, a reasonable response, namely that this also is something which involves millions and millions of dollars. It is something of very great importance to the whole aircraft industry in Australia. This is under consideration, and as the Minister said, an announcement will be made in due course. But there were overtones in some of the comments made by some members of the Opposition that the Government perhaps had been less than frank or less than detailed in giving information to the country about the aircraft industry. However, the material is available in such publications as the 'Defence Report 1971' and 'Supply 1971'. If you look at the report of the Department of Supply for 1971, as well as a lot of very interesting pictures, you will see a very detailed account of the various ramifications in the aircraft industry in Australia, at least on the military side. You will see details of the programme for the construction of helicopters, details of the Jindivik programme, details of the tion of the Macchi aircraft-whic h is virtually completed as I understand it-and you will also see details about the Mirage. The Minister for Supply recently made",44,Australian Aircrafr Industry
103,Deputy Leader Of The Opposition ( Mr Bar,"Minister for Supply and the officers in his Department on arranging this contract. I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating him and his Department on the work that has gone into this particular project, the negotiations and indeed the result. It is good for the industry because it must give confidence to the industry. It is good purely and simply in economic terms. The Minister for Supply also indicated the work with respect to the Turana and he said that fairly soon there would be a replacement for the Winjeel. Of course, more work would be involved in this so far as the aircraft industry is concerned. If you look at the raw material the information is there and it has been made available by the Government, so I would reject the charge that the Government has not given sufficient details and information about the aircraft industry. Finally, may I make reference to one point that arose in a running exchange during the debate, namely the amount of money expended on defence equipment contracts in Australia compared with what has been spent overseas. If you look at the figures it is very clear that in recent years the percentage of the defence contract vote spent within Australia has been increasing. IfI may just refer briefly to some of the statistics, you will see that, for instance, in the year 1968-69 expenditure in Australia on defence equipment contracts was $193m whereas considerably more was spent overseas, namely $245m. However, the trend was reversed in the following year and also last year. In 1969-70 there was in fact more money spent within Australia than there was overseas, a clear reversal of that trend. An amount of Si84m was spent on defence equipment contracts within Australia in that year and only $150m was spent outside Australia. Last year, 1970-71, $171m was expended within Australia and much less than that, namely $115m, was expended overseas. This is a definite trend that is borne out on the figures. I think it is fair to say that it is a very commendable trend, that the percentage of expenditure within Australia is increasing compared with expenditure overseas. That is a trend which I for one would Uke to see continued. With those few remarks may I say that this matter of public importance raised by the Opposition has in my view been amply replied to by Government speakers and it seems to me quite clearly that the argument fails. would like to say a few words on this matter of public importance. I do not think that the Government has answered the Opposition's case at all. The basic factor that emerges from the debate is that there has been no planning for the Australian aircraft industry. This stems from a lack of a consistent defence policy. It has been difficult for the Service departments to set down requirements for equipment when the Government has not been able to provide them with a consistent defence policy. For years we have seen the industry in a state of peaks and troughs. At the moment it is in one of its most serious troughs. The Hawker de Havilland establishment at Bankstown, which is in my electorate, is facing a serious problem with its work load. If it does not improve in the next few months there may be retrenchments. This is the case throughout the whole industry. Not only is there a problem with actual retrenchments of men and reduced work load but also there is a real problem that Australia has to face on top of those matters and that is the loss of technology, the loss of design staff and inadequate tooling in these factories. The specialist technology on plastics and metallurgy is going right past the Australian aircraft industry because there is not a work load to sustain development in these things. With tooling there should have been a switch across to digital computer machine operated tooling equipment. I think that there have been only 2 additions of this type of plant to the major elements of the industry in Melbourne and the rest of it has just been turret lathes and this type of equipment. With this equipment we can never be competitive and we find that with offsets we will become less attractive to overseas industries because we will not have the capacity to take on the work they may offer. I find myself in complete agreement with the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) who said that the Government has done nothing whatsoever to try to stimulate offsets, considering that there were massive orders placed with overseas",45,Australian Aircrafr Industry

Yet there has been no replacement for the Macchi.

At the moment, the Government tralia. If it is not totally designed in Ausalso is considering the Rapier missile from I do not have a great deal of time standard missile from the United States of America as a replacement for the Tartar Great Britain as a defensive weapon against low flying aircraft. This is another field where the Australian aircraft industry well has the capabUity of being able to develop this type of weapon. The Government says that there are only so many orders over so many years and when the production run falls the industry must go into a state of decline. It is obvious that no-one will be attracted to work in an industry which is continually subjected to peaks and troughs in its production and in its work load. The work load should be supplemented by a work load from commercial enterprises for which the Government should plan. There are plenty of other examples of the Government from the lethargic aircraft industries throughout the world approach it has to one of Australia's most which have survived. The Government important industries. chooses to pick on Lockheed and the rest of them. The reason why Lockheed and the American companies are in trouble is -Order!

This is a that the Commonwealth will be liable serious situation. How can the Government purport to have a defence policy when the aircraft industry is losing its design staff and its technology is falling off? It has no naval design capability and its shipyards are deficient in the area of naval construction. So, I put it to the House that there is validity in the points made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Barnard) who raised this matter of public importance. The Parliament should be concerned about the declining state of the aircraft industry and the Government should be condemned for its lack of initiative and support for the industry.

106,Mr Snedden (Bruce,"Treasurer )under its guarantee for an amount currently expected to be in the vicinity of $95m, recoupment of which is estimated to take approximately 11 months. It is proposed that the Commonwealth lend to the Board sufficient funds to enable it to discharge its debt to thc Bank. It is also proposed that the Board be required to use for repayment of the loan all net proceeds from export sales of wheat of the 1970-71 pool, after the date of the loan, as well as the Commonwealth's stabilisation payment. The Bill provides that the loan to the Board be at an interest rate of 5} per cent per annum on the daily balances outstanding, with the actual timing of capital repayments and interest to be specified by the Treasurer. The interest rate is the same as that charged on last year's loan. The Bill authorises the Commonwealth to borrow up to $150m to make the ioan to the Board. This exceeds the Board's current estimate of the amount required under the guarantee but, as such estimates are subject to substantial variation, thc amount specified in the Bill provides a margin in case estimate proves too low. Thc Australian Loan Council has agreed to a special borrowing programme for this purpose for the Commonwealth in 1971-72. The terms of the borrowing will be subject to Loan Council approval.

Before the debate is resumed on this BillI would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Bill and the Television Stations Licence Fees Bill as they are related measures. Separate questions may, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, Mr Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 3 Bills to be discussed in this debate. House to have a general debate covering the 3 measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed. Opposition has grave doubts about the motives behind this Bill. Its main aims are to increase the period of currency of television and broadcasting station licences from one year to a maximum of 3 years and to amend the ownership and control provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act to protect the interests of persons and companies which since 17th December 1964 have had special privileges in being allowed to retain more than a prescribed interest in the ownership and control of television and broadcasting station licences. It is the timing of the introduction of this legislation which gives rise to the Opposition's suspicions. Now only a few months before an election legislation is introduced to extend the period for which television and broadcasting licences can be renewed. The period of extension will take those licences to within a few months of the following Federal election when a Labor government will be in office. I am not suggesting that a Labor government has any intention of taking drastic action against the present holders of television and broadcasting station licences, but we, together with a substantial body of public opinion, are not satisfied with the television services provided by some of the stations or of the standard of some of the programmes. If this legislation is passed the present conditions imposed on licence holders will still prevail and the improvements which we envisage will be much more difficult to introduce when a Labor government is in office. Our suspicions of the motives of the Government are increased when it is noted that the ownership and control provisions of the Act are again to be amended to give protection to certain privileged persons and companies in the community which have more than a prescribed interest in television and broadcasting stations and are likely to lose that protection by an alteration in their shareholding. Both amendments are designed to safeguard the interests of persons and companies which are known and acknowledged supporters of the Government. The Opposition takes a great deal of heart, however, from the clear acknowledgment that the Postmaster-General( Sir Alan Hulme) at least believes that the Government of which he is a Minister will be defeated at the forthcoming election, and he is trying to protect the interests of his friends. Let me make the attitude of the Australian Labor Party to the media quite clear. Our policy is as follows: As well as being a medium of entertainment, television and radio profoundly affect the educational, cultural and artistic standards of Australians. Because of the limited number of frequencies available for radio and television, it is necessary for government to regulate these areas in order to ensure that the public interest is protected, but, as far as possible, the traditional freedom of the Press should apply to radio and television. 1. The dual system of national and commercial radio and television is to continue. The tendency to monopoly is especially dangerous and must be resisted by appropriate legislation. 2. A fairness principle will be included in the legislation regulating radio and television so that opposing viewpoints will have a fair opportunity of expression. 3. The political independence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission should be secured by amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act and by proper administrative arrangements, includingfinancesprovided on a long term basis. 4. The Australian Broadcasting Commission should be able to determine its own programmes and, subject to the fairness applicable to commercial stations, to exercise its functions free of improper pressure from any source. 5. The general principles of the Senate Select Committee on Encouragement of Australian Productions for Television will be implemented. 6. Legislative and administrative steps will be taken to increase Australian content and to preserve a reasonable balance between material of Australian and overseas origin.",48,Australian Aircrafr Industry

It can be seen from that that commercial television station owners are not satisfied with many of the conditions Broadcasting Control Board time after television stations. The Board continually has representations made to it by thc commercial sion and broadcasting stations.

We do not expect success on this This rather complex matter has been most carewith the Board, and I am satisfied that the proposed amendment will not lead to any The last time that was said was in March 1971 when this legislation was last before the House. Now another amendment is proposed, less than 12 months after the last amendment which attempted to prevent an anomaly or loophole in the ownership and control provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act. Our reason for opposing the proposed amendment is that certain individuals and companies were granted a major privilege by this Government in 1964 in being allowed to retain more than a prescribed interest in television and radio licences. They have retained that privilege since. They have had a very fair go. Because certain individuals or companies and newspapers are in this great land of have realised or are to realise on their ours. holdings, or change the format of their companies, and this was to lead to contravention of the Act, special provisions are monopoly; in particular, it will not protect being included in the Act for them.

The honourable member for Lang touched upon this, and I think it is incumbent upon the Government through its instrument, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, to reveal just how many transgressions there have been and what penalties have been invoked for those transgressions.

115,Mr Sherry (Franklin) (8.25),"I conIn broad terms the responsibility of licenCowan. I wish to repeat for the House's sees is in the field of programming. Over the years I have received a very great number of complaints from people inside and outside of my electorate who have had enough of the predictable Christmas-New Year fare of repeats ad nauseum on television. I think some responsible direction should be given now to station managers with regard to this critical and irritating area of continual repeats of programmes. I do not exclude the Australian Broadcasting Commission from my criticism in this respect. Over the years both the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the commercial licensees have been constantly and consistently guilty of showing repeats ad nauseum. Time will not allow me to go into the reason why this practice is per petrated. I know perfectly well that basically it is for economic reasons. There is a great cry from station managers that their revenues drop off during the Christmas and New Year period. I do not argue with that, but I do think that they should display a greater sense of responsibility and maturity in their programming over the Christmas and New Year period. The arguments always advanced for repeating programmes at that time of the year are paradoxical to me. The common argument is that the television stations do not have an audience. That argument will not stand up to any scrutiny at all. 1 wish to deal now with the question of licence, a licensee has a responsibility to the quotas for Australian content in televithe viewing public and I think that that is sion generally. I have spoken on this matrelevant to the point I am making. ter on many occasions in this chamber. Events have proved that the existing legislation is not being strictly enforced. I offer some relevancy, but at the same time. I do no criticism of the Postmaster-General in not think the honourable member should saying that. Indeed, 1 have a great regard make that the main subject of his address. for him. That does not necessarily extend to his ministerial colleagues, but I do have ruling, sir. May I refer in passing on this a regard for the Minister in his position as question of programming to the enormous Postmaster-General and I do not lay any amount of moneys transmitted overseas for personal blame on him in this respect. But the buying of programmes from the the simple fact of the matter is that during United States of America and the United the concentrated campaign last year for a Kingdom. AgainI will relate this matter to greater Australian content in television the argument I am advancing for a greater some quite extraordinary statements were local content. In the year 1966-67 it was made by so-called responsible people. The $12.5m; in 1967-68 it was $12.9m; and in honourable member for Lang has already 1970-71 it was $11.lm.

The purpose of this Bill, if I may quote from the second reading speech of the Postmaster-General, is to make certain changes to the Broadcasting and Television Act in relation to commercial broadcasting and television station licences.

This certainly does not occur in the United States of America, the United Kingdom or Canada. All of those countries have ensured that their television programmes, and the licensees through them, reflect and comment on and advance their own identities. I think that that is a perfectly legiticommunity. Mistakes have been made. We mate aim and aspiration. I think the mass media has an obligation and a duty and thc licensees have a duty to reflect the identity of this country, f am quite certain that nobody on the other side of the House would dispute that statement. Very few foreign programmes appear on American television. Britain in practice limits the imported shows to 12* per cent of its total content. Canada has specified that 60 per cent of the programmes seen in prime time shall be of Canadian or indigenous content. In the time. I have at my disposal, Mr earnestly and sincerely to see that the Speaker, I wish to make a special plea to the licensee of Channel6 in Tasmania, which came into operation under stage 2 of the development of television programmes on 4th June 1960. I have discussed this matter with the Postmaster General. It is incredible to me that 12 years after its introduction a great area in the southern part of my own electorate is still unable to receive an adequate and satisI think that the honourable member for factory television picture. It is now 1st March 1972. Twelve years after its introduction there are still people in my own electorate who cannot receive on their screen, even with the great expertise and the advanced technology at our disposal, a picture which could reasonably and logically be called a decent image. I want to comment on another matter before I finish. 1 have received many complaints about licensees and the great amount of American news film shown in Australia. I have discussed this matter with the Postmaster-General. For the life of me, I cannot understand why we in this country are subjected to a very high percentage of American interpretation films of great events overseas. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is established in most areas of the world. As I understand, we have a tacit gentleman's agreement between the ABC and the British Broadcasting Corporation. I refuse to see the logic of Australians always being subjected to the American interpretation of great world events. Management has a great responsibility. A licence is not a document for profit alone. It is incumbent upon the licensee to provide a diligent and intelligent service to the are all fallible. I worked in this industry for many years. I believe in the power and the persuasiveness of television. It is a broad forum for the dissemination of ideas. It is a wonderfully evocative visual medium. It is a wonderful medium for truth and the revelation of political and governmental inadequacy and humbug. It is the forum about which my distinguished British colleague, Robin Day, has so correctly said that truth and falsehood can grapple in the critical public gaze. 1 appeal to the Government quite legislation which has been outlined, the legislation which has been amended, is adhered to by the licencees with a general regard for the welibeing of the viewing public of this country. It is essential lhat controls be tightened. In my view, it is essential that the licensees display a much greater sense of community and public responsibility. In moving these amendments, Lang has really put his finger right on the problem area. In conclusion, I reiterate that I support the amendment which he has proposed. speak briefly on this Bill. I have had little time in which to prepare my submissions. A certain amount of truth has been spoken by both the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart) and the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Sherry). But as usual, they appear to have become confused as to the exercising of control over television licences. If we take notice of what they say, there would be so many committees, subcommittees and organisations that the matter would get out of hand. In the first instance, they ask that the Bill be referred to a joint select committee to inquire into and report upon the conditions under whicb television and broadcasting station licences are granted and renewed. I have served on",55,Broadcasting And Televisio N
122,Mr Irwin (Mitchell) (8.43),"I want tomany committees and I have chaired committees. If we do not have confidence in those who are controlling broadcasting and television, we alone should make alterations. A committee would be a long drawn out exercise. Sincere and genuine people would be on the committees. But possibly they would have no special training. I do not think very much would be achieved by appointing this costly joint committee. The Opposition seeks to insert proposed new sub-sections (2B.) and (2c.) to read: (2B.) The Minister shall refer an application that are associated with the mass mediamade under this section to the Board for its recommendation as to the renewal of a licence. (2c.) Before making a recommendation, the Board shall hold an inquiry in accordance witb this Act into the application. The amendment then continues to outline the sub-sections in the existing legislation which the Opposition seeks to have omitted. This next amendment has some merit. It seeks to have the following proposed new section inserted in the Act: 124AA. A person who claims to have been defamed in a broadcasting or television programme shall be entitled, on request to the Commission or the licensee, as the case may be, and upon payment of an adequate fee, to receive a record of such programme. As I have said, much merit is contained in this last amendment which is proposed because if a man is defamed it is very difficult for him to obtain sufficient evidence to assist him to protect his good name. After all. a man's good name is his most valued possession. I had an experience when I rang a radio station be appropriate for the honourable member to discuss this matter in the Committee stage. The amendment to which the honourable member has referred will be moved in Committee. It has not yet been moved. The honourable member will be able to discuss it then. I shall defer my remarks until the Committee stage. Turning to the second reading speech of the Postmaster-General( Sir Alan Hulme) I can see no good reason in the interests of better management, control and economy why, after the granting of the initial licence for a period of 5 years, the renewal of the licence should be restricted to one year. I cannot see any good reason why a licence could not be issued for a further period of 5 years. It is also proposedI do not know for what reason-that a licence may be renewed for a period of not less than 6 months. That may be just a temporary rearrangement in regard to the shareholding and the ownership of companies. I feel that in this legislation the Government is bending over backwards to protect the ownership and shareholding in the various companies the newspapers and the broadcasting and television stations. I think the time has arrived when the owners of newspapers and the shareholders in broadcasting and television companies should realise that they hold this power in very safe trusteeship. We do not want to do anything to restrict the management of these concerns. But it is most necessary that they observe the greatest integrity and honour in the trust they hold. It appears to me that the Government is being very fair in regard to this matter. As the Anglican community of Sydney pointed out about a fortnight or 3 weeks ago, the proprietors of mass media must realise the great debt that they owe to the community and they must realise that statements made in the newspapers and by the other mass media have to be truthful and factual in every detail. I feel that there has been a lessening of standards and a lessening of propriety. There needs to be a sincere and genuine effort by the proprietors of the mass media to uphold the standards of this great trust. It is up to them to carry out their duties in a very thorough, correct and factual manner. We on this side of the House have no great objections to the proprietorship of these companies, but if they misplace this trust and if they do not honour the great confidence that the Government has shown in them, only one thing can happen to them: Very strict disciplinary action will have to be taken. I regret that some provision has not been made in the Bills for increasing the Australian content in both broadcasting and television. It cannot be denied that Australia has produced some of the greatest musicians, actors, actresses, singers and",56,Broadcasting And Televisio N

With this background, surely it is possible to bring to our free time to local government candidates screens a more wonderful and more sophisticated viewing than can be provided by overseas people. I know that tbe cost of production of programmes is very high, but we have a great amount of latent talent in Australia. IfI could not recall quickly the name of some Australian at the peak of any facet of entertainment I would be very surprised. I remember the great Oscar Asche, a great playwright and the author of the wonderful 'Chu Chin Chow'. over the period there have been other Oscar Asches although they did not have the opportunity or the determination of Oscar Asche, Lily Brayton and the other great Shakespearian actors of those days. I feel that before these licences are issued there should be complete understanding and some arrangement whereby the Australian content should be improved progressively both in quality and in quantity. Let me refer to the second amendment which deals with a person being defamed. I think that if the person's name is mentioned in a programme he should be able to get that extract just by ringing up the station. I understand that at the present time he has to go through the costly procedure of getting it through a solicitor. That is not right. If a man's name is mentioned, he should be able to get only that portion in which his name is mentioned within 7 days of application. I congratulate the Postmaster-General, whose portfolio covers many realms of great activity and expansion. How he has been able to' cope with this over the years is beyond my comprehension. I congratulate him in regard to this matter. He has been very parof a properly presented, full representation tial to the broadcasting stations. I hope and trust that they revere and respect the trust that the Postmaster-General has placed in them. the amendment. This debate relates to the candidates, Federal parliamentary candiadjustments that are to be made to the dates or, for that matter, any person broadcasting and televising of political and standing for an elected position of current affairs material. I am disappointed important community function where most that in the past-and it would appear that of the community population has the right this will happen in the future-littl e to vote or will be affected by an election. attention has been given in the issuing of I hope that in the future when granting station licences to the provision of equal who stand as independents in many areas. In particular in Western Australia, where political tickets are not run, the candidates even for shire president or town mayor are virtually unknownfigureswho, because they are fully involved in their own positions earning a living or running a business, are unable to expend the time or money to present themselves and their viewpoints to the public. The exceptions are those people who have very large incomes, and thus the field of radio and television is restricted to them. This aspect should be looked at by commercial and Australian Broadcasting Commission stations to ensure that it becomes a general practice to present to the public these very important candidates for honorary positions. Local government is the third arm of government. It is the least remunerative, the most thankless, but one of the most important arms of government. The media have an obligation to see that these candidates are presented to the public -the Government has this obligation, also-in such a way that a proper choice is made by those who elect them. It is regrettable that the legislation does not encompass this aspect. The Government does not seem to accept the responsibility for legislating in this area. The resistance on the part of a national station to spending time on this type of broadcast can be understood, but there are now sufficient diversified stations-regiona l stations-to ensure that mainly local audiences are involved. We can all realise from the escalating costs of our own electioneering broadcasts the utter impossibility of the ordinary worker or small businessman wanting to serve the community in this field, meeting the costs of himself and his policies.

127,Mr Bennett (Swan) (8.57),"I support government candidates, State parliamentarystation licences serious consideration will be given to this matter. The legislation before the House, which is aimed in one instance at a final saving of bookkeeping, will permit all licences held by one group of interests to be considered together in a total operation. This must effect some major savings not only for the stations concerned but for the Postmaster-General's Department. It appears to be in line with the Postal Department's general policy of centralisation in this field but the savings are not being passed on to the public licence holder, in particular the pensioner or the widow who has the misfortune to have to care for a growing family who are reaching their teens and who go out to work and who, because of the miserable income these children bring in, is charged a full radio and television fee. It is regrettable that the young actors or actresses in Western Aussame attention to savings is not being given to those people as is being given to the stations and the Postmaster-General's Department in this legislation. Amidst all these administrative savings and the monopoly licences and extensions which have been granted what sort of service is the public receiving in return? It was only last year that what appeared to be collusion between the private and government stations in Western Australia resulted in the screening of video tape recordings of Perth football matches on the evenings of the match days being discontinued after a dispute over the payment for the television rights with the football authorities. This was a further blow to the public, the under-privileged and incapacitated who for various reasons were unable to attend the matches. It was a blatant disregard of service to the public. The telenil. No television light entertainment provising of these matches by ABC country stations took place only after I had raised the matter in this House, and I thank the Postmaster-General for his indulgence on that occasion. Why not pay a little extra to give service? Even if something extra had to be paid to the football authorities, a television coverage of the football matches should have been provided for the public, which pays far too much for too little service. Not only the government stations but the private stations should be prepared to make some effort to give service. Let us not try to deceive anyone by saying that stations are not overall profitable enterprises. This is proven by the need for such legislation as this which rationalises the period of licence renewals, makes provisions affecting ownership of commercial broadcasting and television stations and makes provision for more usable time for the broadcasting and televising of political and current affairs programmes. I believe this legislation will lead to higher charges for broadcasting and television time and will protect the existing stations' length of tenure as licence holders. Anyone who considers what has happened to live drama in radio and television in Western Australia cannot deny that Western Australia has acting talent that should be developed in radio drama as well as in theatre. However tralia will never gain experience or employment in radio drama or television unless a wider use is made of this field. The Government is pursuing a policy of centralising radio and television production which precludes top line Western Australian actors and actresses from working in those media in their home State. There is room in today's radio media for sound art forms for radio drama to allow our young writers, producers and acting and creative talent to be fully employed. This was proven by the independent McNair Anderson radio programme surveys, which showed that in some cases ABC radio drama had an audience in excess of that of other features and that an increase in locally produced output was warranted. In the field of light entertainment in radio and television in Western Australia productions are almost duction of any note was produced in Western Australia during the 3-year period from July 1968 to July 1971. This is an appalling record of lack of service not only to the public but to the Western Australian acting fraternity organisations. This situation comes out of the system of monopoly that this legislation is substantiating. As I recently heard stated, he is indeed a superior being who does not abuse a monopoly. Let us look at the result of this monopoly in Western Australia. From 1963 to 1968 actors were used in local light entertainment productions by the ABC. Light entertainment, in conjunction with artists and musicians, on ABC radio and television used to provide employment for actors. According to actors' representatives a total expenditure on light entertainment production has been reduced from a figure of 526,570 in the peak production year of 1965-66 to about $8,000, inclusive of increased wage rates. From 1963 to 1965 radio output of light entertainment in Western Australia averaged about 70 national half hours, 60 State half hours, 30 quarter hours, 250 record programmes, 26 magazine items, 22 half hour television programmes per annum, in 1968 the figures for ABC radio in Western Australia had fallen to 13 live national half hours, 13 recorded half hours, 6 quarter hours, 7 magazine items, and 35 State half hours. In television, the figures were thirteen 10minute interludes and 13 Billy Borker 5minute programmes. The 1970-71 figures are not known but calculations among performers indicate that the number of television programmes was nil for 3 years up to July 1971 and almost negligible in radio. If we are to have licensing conditions, these provisions should be outlined as a condition of station licensing. A greater local Australian content should be a licensing condition. General) (9.6)-It seems to me that we have a peculiar amendment before us. The latter part of the amendment deals witb only one matter, that is, a committee which it is suggested should inquire into and report upon the conditions under which television and broadcasting station licences are granted and renewed. It seems to me perhaps appropriate that one should first of all remind the House of what is contained in the Bill itself. The first thing that is contained in the Bill is a provision for licences to be renewed not for one year as provided in the Act at the present time but for a period of not less than 6 months nor more than 3 years. It has been obvious to me from that which has been said in the debate this evening that not a great deal the Australian content of television proof concentration has been given to the provisions of the Bill. I indicated In my second reading speech why it was believed that the provision relating to the period of renewal was necessary. Firstly, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, which has the responsibility of making inquiries and recommending to the Minister renewals of licences and which also makes recommendations in relation to initial licences, has a fairly substantial job on its plate. Honourable members perhaps do not appreciate that no fewer than approximately 160 television and broadcasting licences come up for consideration of renewal each year on a yearly basis. So the suggestion of a 3-year licence fee was to distribute this work more evenly and to enable the Board to concentrate on other important matters which it has before it constantly. One may say: That is all right as to the 3 years. What about the 6 months?' Of course there has to be an interregnum. We have to do some work to try to bring the renewal of licences for groups of stations together at the one time. As there are groups which control 6 or 8 broadcasting stations or a number of television stations surely it is desirable that those groups be looked at by the Board at one time instead of having one station in the group considered in March, another in September and this process being followed through the 3-year period. It seems to me that to bring consideration or these groups together and to make tht. work of the Board satisfactoryJ emphasise the word-for the benefit of the community and the Parliament, first of all, it is desirable that there be a spread of work and, secondly, it is necessary to have this 6 months to 3 years provision to enable the groupings to be made and dealt with in the future satisfactorily. The amendment really says that the Bill should go to a select committee. The amendment has nothing to do with the 3-year aspect. It is interesting to note that there is already in existence an appropriate Senate committee. The mover for the establishment of this Committee was the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Murphy). While that committee deals with a number of matters its terms of reference specifically mention that it is to inquire into all aspects of television and broadcasting, including grammes. Is it suggested-apparentl y it is",58,Broadcasting And Televisio N
128,Sir Alan Hulme (Petrie,"PostmasterBroadcasting and -lha t we should have in addition a joint committee of the 2 Houses to make an inquiry? The amendment does not say that it ought to be a select committee of the House of Representatives. Mr StewartA joint select committee. that we have a joint committee representing both Houses to deal with the provisions of the Bill on the terms of renewal or granting of licences. It seems to me to be a strange suggestion which the Opposition has put before us. Why should not this become part of the inquiry of the present Senate committee? In fact, this is in the terms of reference of lhat committee. One would expect us to avoid duplication in the taking of evidence. The present Senate committee has already been to the head offices of the Broadcasting Control Board in Melbourne to investgate the basis on which the Board makes investigations concerning the renewal of licences or the granting of them. Should we have a committee representative of both the Senate and the House of Representatives to do almost the same thing? I do not understand this sort of approach from the Opposition. It seems to me that the Opposition is only trying a delaying tactic. This could be inferred from the remarks of the honourable member for Lang when he first spoke some highfalutin nonsense: Tn a few months we will be the Government and therefore we will take charge of this Bill. We will take charge of this Act and everything in the. garden will be lovely'. I pass on to the second section of this Bill which relates to the situation which has developed concerning those whose interests were frozen by the 1965 legislation in terms of television, and I think the 1969 legislation in terms of broadcasting. When I introduced the 1965 legislation I assured the House then-and I say it again now-that I had endeavoured to make that legislation so tight that those who were benefiting from the freezing provisions could not find an easy way to increase their holdings. This point has been proven. We have often seen legislation brought into this House only to find that it is inadequate to do the things which we had hoped would be done, but that legislation was the exact reverse. It was made so tight in 1965 that in fact hindrance has been created 1 MARCH 1972 Television Bill 449 under certain circumstances. Let me give to the House some examples. One illustration wiil be difficult for honourable members opposite to understand but this is not a reflection on them; it is a circumstance which has flowed out of that particular legislation. Let me give two or three other examples which are fairly easy to understand. One company has control of the maximum number of braodcasting stations. For certain reasons the Broadcasting and Television Act required the company to amend its articles of association. It is a very old established company. It did not want to alter its articles of association and so it went to the Board with a suggestion that, it might form a holding company and that the shares which it held in the broadcasting stations might be transferred to the holding company. There was no addition to the company's shareholding; no reduction in its shareholding and no alteration or variation whatever. For some reason the company did not want to alter its articles of association. It merely wanted to create a holding company to look after these particular interests. The legislation of 1969 was so tight-and it was similar to the 1965 legislation in rela'.ion to television-that it could not be done. member for Capricornia may say that it is a good idea but I notice that his name is not on the list to speak in this debate to justify the stupid remark which he has made by way of interjection. That is one situation which we find. The second one I want to mention may be difficult to understand. Let me put it on this basis: CompanyA has a small shareholding interest in company B. I am speaking about television. CompanyA also has a large shareholding interest in company C. CompanyB purchases some shares also in company C. It so happens that company C holds a large number of shares in company D. CompanyA holds shares in company D, and it did hold them in December 1964, which gave it a protection interest. The purchase by company B of some shares in company C meant the carrying through of that additional interest and this meant that it had lost the right to freezing. Do you know what difference it made in terms of the shareholding? There was no control",60,Broadcasting And Televisio N

130,Dr Everingham,Good idea.,61,Broadcasting And Televisio N
131,Sir Alan Hulme,"The honourablebecause it was only a small interest in the this particular matter, referred to a special company. It meant a difference of .0002 select committee of both Houses to deal per cent. Surely honourable members opposite are not going to suggest to me that the .0002 per cent is going to make a substantial difference in terms of the interest that company holds in company C. It would in fact mean that the company would have to sell one share in company D. But it could not sell one share in company D because it was protected. That was an area of protection in 1965. The Act says that there cannot be any change in circumstances. To sell one share would be a change in circumstances. In this situation to correct the position the company must sell 417,000 shares. Surely honourable members opposite are not going to suggest to me that the 1965 legislation applied to that situation is the experience of a telecast of 5 minutes reasonable. This is what the Bill proposes to correct, at least from the point of view of those companies which had a protected interest. I had no hesitation in bringing this Bill 5-minute telecast as a result of this before the Parliament not to protect people amendment. but to adjust an anomaly. If it is believed by the honourable member for Lang-h e mentioned this-that our only concern through our legislation is protection, let me remind him that 3 of the companies that were protected by the 1965 legislation to the second reading of the Bill. There are have of their own free will lost by selling shares the protection which they had gained.

If a company which is protected in terms of the legislation were to buy How many times has the honourable memshares in a oompany on the stockmarket, not knowing whether in fact that particular to a Board member? How many times has company had interests in television, it could be caught under the legislation, even to the minimum degree to which I have referred in these 2 particular cases. So, I suggest that there is no justification whatever for members of the Opposition telling us that tbey want the whole of this Bill, including the 3-year renewal period and member says quite honestly that he has not with it. The third matter which is dealt with in the Biil relates to election telecasting or broadcasting and there is no objection to that. For the benefit of honourable members who were not present when the second reading speech was made, I remind the House that, in the case of announcements of 100 words or less, it is necessary to identify the author and the speaker at the end of the announcement. If the announcement is in excess of 100 words, it is necessary to have the identification at the beginning as well as at the end and the adjustment in this Bill is merely to require identification at the end in all cases where the announcement exceeds 100 words. I had which, because of the announcement at the beginning and the end, left me with only 4 minutes 20 seconds. So, to all honourable members who will be involved in the next election, I can say that they will be able to have an extra 20 seconds in a Other matters have been referred to in this debate.

I think that those who might be listening or who might read Hansard will tonight. tening over the air, but people are listening nevertheless. I think that they would come to a conclusion. The person who never has sought to make inquiry other than to read the Board's report is hardly in a position to criticise the Board for inadequacy if he believes that there are inadequacies. I will leave other matters to the Committee stage when I hope to have a good deal to say. (9.26)I support the amendment to the second reading of the Broadcasting and Television Bill. The amendment states: 'the Bill be referred to a joint select committee to year there were 45 television stations in inquire into and report upon the conditions under .which television and broadcasting station licences are granted and renewed' I was astonished to hear the Postmaster General( Sir Alan Hulme) asking why the Opposition wanted to set up a committee of this kind when a committee of the Senate is already in existence. My response is that if there is a committee of the Senate in existence, why are we considering legislation before the senators have completed their deliberations? Surely this is the relevance of the matter. The only reasons I suggest that we should have a committee of this House is that it is my belief that there are too many Senate committees and not enough committees of the House of Representatives. Where better to have a committee to inquire into this matter than in the House of which the Minister is a member? However, I shall let that matter pass. The Bill before this House at the looks at the return on television. I repeat moment is in suspense because certain that the Australian Broadcasting Control people are making representations about it. Board's report shows a clear profit by It is a Bill about dividend stripping and commercial television stations of nearly about chains of companies. In his explana$17m on a turnover of $91 m. tions the Minister talked about companies A, B, C and D. I refer to the Ministers second reading speech where he said: . . . it is possible for a person having protected interests to be inadvertently placed in contravention of the Act through no fault of bis own and no action on his part. AllI point out to the Minister is that a person mostly means a company. The shrewdest kind of legal advice in the world is available to television companies and to suggest that the 'person' referred to are not listening is Joe Smith rather than HSV7 or GTV9 is sheer humbug. The Minister's example of a .0002 per cent error in the matter to my mind is sheer nonsense in the circumstances. 1 ask honourable members to look at the position commercial television and broadcasting stations hold in the community and I use figures from the 23rd annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. In 1969-70 there were 114 commercial broadcasting stations of which 101 made a profit and 13 made a loss. Those companies had a total revenue (Melbourne Ports) of $37m, total expenditure of $27m and their net profit before taxation was $9m. To make $9m clear profit on a turnover of $37m is not bad business. In the same operation, of which 41 made a profit and 4 showed a loss. They had a total revenue of $91m and a total expenditure of $74m. The net result before taxation was $16,670,000. Again, that is not a bad return. Surely to goodness this is what we are talking about in this amendment. A television licence or a broadcasting licence is a state monopoly; the state has the determination of the issue of the licence. Surely to goodness the state is entitled to put some limits upon the application of the licence. If the Government believes that there should be automatic renewal of licences, fair enough, but that .it not what we on this side of the House believe. I think it has been said-it was said more about a television licence than about a broadcasting licence-that once you grant a television licence you grant a licence to print money, and that is obvious when one",62,Broadcasting And Televisio N

They make a choice merely of the programmes that are on. Sir Alan Hulme-Labo r hates private enterprise; it hates profit making. making and it hates profit being made behind restrictive conditions.

The Australian Broadcasting Control Board's report to which I have referred shows that the total revenue of commercial broadcasting stations and commercial television stations in 1969-70 was $128m. In my view there is no difference between systematically paying for a broadcasting and television licence, as everybody in Australia does, and paying a fee that is charged for advertising. After all, all the revenue of the commercial television stations and commercial radio stations comes from advertisers, and the cost of advertising is added to the prices of the goods and services which the people in the community pay. On television there are advertisements for tobacco and advertisements for petrol although if you took somebody into a dark corner and asked him: Ts this super grade petrol?' he could not tell you. On television there are advertisements of a rather shyster kind which indicate that one second hand of rape of the community that is going on In my view television is one of the most of a community to use, but we have allowed it to be taken over by these commercial grammes that are shown to the majority of a Bill which will enable those stations which",63,Broadcasting And Televisio N

On most occasions when advertisements appear on television I take the opportunity to do something else, and I am sure that is what a lot of people do today. I hope that some day advertisements for tobacco will go off the television screen, and I hope that an intelligent population will know that there is not much difference between Shell petrol or BP petrol or some other brand of petrol. At a time when the road toll is being emphasised there are on television advertisements showing that one can get better speed on a hill with a certain car. It is hoped that people will be more discriminating when buying a car.

After all, a broadcasting licence or television licence is a state monopoly, and nobody can deny it. Why should not some tests be placed upon its issue and some evaluation made of its uses? That is what our amendment is about. The Postmaster-General said in his reply: 'You have a Senate committee already. Why have a committee of this House?' I would say that if you have a Senate committee, why have this legislation at all? Why should the Bill not be withdrawn? If you have a Senate committee of inquiry why bring in the Bill at all? Surely this House is entitled as much as the other House to make sensible inquiries into this matter. Television is one of the most significant media we have at our disposal.

I have referred before to the quality of the so-called films shown on television. There is a programme called 'Playhouse of the Week'. I saw those shows when I was courting and I have been married for 26 years, but these shows still come forward as the play of the week or the film of the week. There is virtually no criticism whatever of what is shown on television. Another difficulty is that many good shows on television can never be repeated. Why should not the same programme be shown on several nights a week? How many people are there who have to watch television night after night? Nobody can watch 4 programmes at once, anyway. mother-in-law. member, I might have some doubts. But that is beside the point. We of the Opposition have moved our amendment in sincerity.

I hope that some day in Australia we will say that people who own a newspaper will have no entitlement to own a share in a television station. In a community that is supposed to be a democracy an undue influence is being exerted by the media. As long as you can mobilise a few million dollars you can take over these state monopolies and use them for your own advantage. The figures I have cited show how successful is that advantage.

I am quite certain that he spoke with a great deal of sincerity in many of the comments he has made tonight would for one minute question the fact that there will be an attempt, as there have been attempts over the years, to make quite sure that this country has the best form of distribution of television programmes that it is possible to have. I think that probably the main difference between people on this side of the chamber and people on the opposite side is involved in what is considered a reasonable method of doing things. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports tonight has suggested that vast profits are being made, I imagine he means by some television hook-ups. I do not think that is in question. Undoubtedly in some instances this is so, but we on this side of the House, contrary to honourable members opposite, would prefer that a television station such as that on Channel 10 in South Australia, which has marginal operation and has had for some time, would remain operative. We do not think that there should be special conditions for one company and not for another. This thesis cropped up twice this week. We do not believe in discriminating. It has become increasingly obvious that the Labor Party would discriminate between companies in the same field, whether by tariffa suggestion which occurred earlier this week-o r by the method advocated tonight. One cannot go into the market place and say that one grocer should be taxed so much and another grocer should be taxed differently. In the opinion of the Australian people that is not on. If that is the committee of inquiry. That may not be a sort of thing that the Labor Party is trying to propound tonight, it is not on again and it will not be on in the minds of the people of Australia who want to listen to more than one channel and, might I say, preferably more than just a government channel. They want options. This is really the salient point that has developed in this debate tonight. 1 do not think honourable members on a fair description of what the honourable this side would say that a successful commember for Melbourne Ports said. Some pany should be penalised. If it is successof this legislation should not wait until the ful, so much the better. Presumably if it is successful it will have better quality of recording and production. It could be that some honourable members opposite would be shareholders in that sort of company. Let us face it. Whether the Opposition likes it or not Australia is developing that sort of company. We have heard a lot in the last week about Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd. The fact is that the shareholding list of that company Order! I ask the honourable gentleman to return to the Bill. wavering from the subject, Sir, I point out that the list of shareholders in commercial broadcasting companies is very diverse indeed. At one stage I heard someone suggest that a company, whether BHP or a television company, should have roughly one-third wages bill, one-third profit and one-third overhead. That was said by Labor's spokesman on industrial matters. It is arrant nonsense. I can think of one company which has an annual wages bill in the region of $220m, on last year's figures, and a profit of about $60m. It is right out of balance. I regret to say, Sir, that those figures relate to BHP. I cite them only because there is undue suspicion in the minds of the Opposition as soon as someone is successful in the field of commerce. On this side of the House we believe that the nation can profit from successful people. We do not believe that our future is involved entirely with people who should not be successful. We believe that an impetus should be provided for people to get on in life, and I include small companies and television stations. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has tried to justify the Opposition's amendment seeking the formation of a precise description, but I think it is roughly accurate. He has tried to justify it by saying that this is the House of the people whereas the Senate is not, but the Senate has got in first, and that if the Senate is mounting such a committee with reasonable terms of reference the Government should have waited and not produced this legislation now.

I would take up the point of logic of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and say that if I believed, as he does, that the Senate is not the people's House, my attitude would be that the Senate is quite entitled to produce its own committee of inquiry to advise it. This seems to me to be horse sense. The Senate could well look after its own cart. Whether it be a matter of private politics or not, in this House we have to get action on matters we consider important. I will not touch on the very fine matters of fact that were dealt with by the Postmaster General when talking about the Senate Committee, but because I think it is important I will touch on the problems and responsibilities of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. There is no doubt that the Board has the job of dealing with complicated and very far reaching matters and provisions to do with the Act that it supervises. It is very easy to overlook the complexity and sophistication of the matters with which it has to deal. It has to act within a framework laid down by the government of this country. It has extensive records of shareholdings, of loan interests and of directorships, and, as I understand its position, it constantly surveys the ownership and control of commercial broadcasting and television stations. This is its job, which extends far beyond the pure matter of ownership of broadcasting stations. The Board's record in this field of its endeavour is of very great consequence and importance to the nation in terms of the job it does under the legislation which set it up. In the Postmaster-General's second reading speech on the Bill to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act 19421971 he points out that there are 117 broadcasting and 48 television stations now established. It has become clear that the retention of a yearly renewal basis of licensing is becoming increasingly burdensome, as the Minister said, and that it is a matter of some concern to the Board. Integral in these Bills is the fact that we now look for a method similar to that adopted in the United States of America, where, I believe, the licensing authority can renew licences for a period of up to 3 years. Honourable members will realise that this which sets a minimum period of 6 months and a maximum period of 3 years for the renewing of licences. I would remind the House that Canada extends the period to 5 years. Why has this been done? Not only has it been done to reduce the costs integral in the operation of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board but also quite obviously-and the Opposition can poohpooh this if it wishes-to help reduce the costs incurred by the television stations. I thought the Opposition would say that it is to increase their profits but it did not; I am sorry that it did not. The fact is that it will increase profits. It has been amply demonstrated already that the Opposition is highly suspicious of anybody who is making a profit or who is efficient. The point is that if we can lower these everrising costs to organisations, whether they be television stations or manufacturing firms, no matter what they are, the community is surely better off because of it. The one thing that irritates me is the constant harping about the danger of someone making a profit. The whole viability of the community in recent days, so far as I am aware, has been the capacity of the people to do research, to invent new methods and to become efficient, and this is reflected in the benefits to the community. In this debate so far, and I hope I am not being unjust, Opposition speakers have not acknowledged this. 1 return once again because I think it is important to the problems facing the small broadcasting stations and those marginal television stations such as Channel 10 in some States which are not making a profit but which are providing a service to the community, which televise programmes with an Australian content on matters that some of us think are important and that some of us think are worth watching. I would like to move on in the brief time at my disposal to the matter of the Australian component. Section 114 of the Act provides, firsdy, that the Australian stations shall employ, as far as possible, Australian workmen and Australian technicians. All of us will go along with this requirement. I am quite sure that the Opposition is just as keen as we are on this side of the House to make sure that this is so and continues to be so. But I hope that this provision never prohibits commerical television stations in this country from bringing out worthwhile people, whether they be in the field of television or radio or production generally. I hope that we never reach the stage where stations do not feel that they can import top talent where necessary. The second provision of section 114 of the Act deals with production and it attracts the same type of argument I have put forward in relation to Australian content. This second provision sets various stanbeyond the limits of the electorate of, for dards which I will discuss in a minute. The third facet of section 114 affects the presentation of these programmes. Since 1960 increasing demands have been made on commercial television stations in regard to Australian content. Firstly, we looked at the Australian origin of programmes. Secondly, we looked at the Australian content of programmes shown within specified hours, particularly between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. The Australian Brodcasting Control Board, if I might hark back to the great job it does, has been responsible for the supervision of these factors. It was in November 1970, for instance, that the Government introduced new Australian content requirements. These provisions became effective from 20th September last year. IfI may I shall deal with them only briefly as time is short. These new provisions seek to make life, shall we say, much harder for the commercial stations but more pleasant and acceptable and of a better quality for the viewers in Australia. Firstly, 50 per cent of the total programme time must be of Australian content. Secondly, 45 per cent of the televised time between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. must be of Australian content. Thirdly, 6 hours of first run indigenous drama must be televised between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. Fourthly, for 4 hours a month programmes must be provided for school age children. That is in complete distinction from preschool age children. IfI were to criticise the programme, sion that this country has no reason to be frankly I would criticise it in that last ashamed of any facet of its television prorespect. It seems to me that as time goes duction. It is a credit to the Government. by the outback children who are unable to attend school but who will be serviced by television stations at Alice Springs, Darwin, Order! The honourable member's time has Port Augusta and other outlandish expired. places-if I may use that phrase-wil l need much greater provision than the rather paltry 4 hours monthly which is required to be made available for educational purposes. I do not have the time at my disposal to develop tonight the philosophy of what should or should not be viewed or, indeed, what is or is not available. PerhapsI will have the opportunity to do so on another occasion. But in the meantime, I make the small point in passing that I think that this is something the Government should look at in view of the changing circumstances I have tried to describe which may affect the future of children in the outback areas away instance, Angas. I sum up by saying that as from June 1972 the total Australian content of programmes shown on television between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. will be increased, I gather, in allfieldsto at least 50 per cent. Members of the Opposition have described tonightI think with some sincerity-wha t they wish, what they require and what they think should be the provisions that dictate the quality of the programmes that the nation will view in the years to come. I acknowledge their capacity and wish to do so. Perhaps they will acknowledge my sincerity in saying that I do believe, having had the opportunity to travel fairly extensively, that television in Australia is probably vastly better than it is in Thailand and India, although I do not really know whether I have seen it in those 2 countries. It is certainly vastly better than the programmes which are shown in the United States of America today, and in this respect I am serious. Furthermore, colour television in the United States of America has been in years gone by particularly putrid in my judgment. I trust that the wisdom of the Government in putting off the day of decision in term of colour television will be amply repaid by the rewards to the people of Australia of increased quality. The United Kingdom and the European colour television is infinitely better than any I have seen anywhere else in the world. I say in conclu-",66,Broadcasting And Televisio N
148,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Cope),"Many people advocate the banning of the advertising of cigarettes and tobacco on television and radio as well as through the post. I know that lots of people are convinced that smoking causes cancer, but I am not. 1 have seen many articles and many films on this matter. At the present time plenty of films and lectures by experts are available, on this subject. It is interesttobacco industry for their livelihood. There ing to note that, no matter how good these experts are, they cannot reach a common agreement that the statement that smoking causes cancer is correct. 1 do not mind cigarette packages being branded witb the slogan that smoking is injurious to health or that one smokes at one's own risk. In my opinion advertising does not prevent people from smoking. Advertising may cause a person to change from one brand of cigarettes to another, but a person who wants to smoke will do so and there is no way in the world to stop him. If cigarette and tobacco packages are branded with the slogan that smoking Is injurious to health it would be up to the smoker to decide whether he will continue to smoke. But why deprive a smoker of the right to smoke if he wants to do so? Do honourable members think that the banning of the publication of nude photographs in magazines and so forth will stop sexual intercourse? Of course it will not. In the same way the banning of cigarette advertising will not stop people from smoking. It bas not stopped them from smoking in the United States of America or anywhere else in which this form of advertising has been banned. One has to take into consideration the value of the industry to the Government and to the nation. I would prefer to see more Australian tobacco used in the cigarettes sold in this country. Years ago America was in the same position as Australia is now in. Now only about 5 per cent or 6 per cent of the imported product is used in American cigarettes and tobacco. We should do the same thing because we do not have an export market for our tobacco and it is unlikely that we will ever have one. The value of the tobacco industry to Australia should be appreciated by everybody. The value of the. cigarettes and tobacco sold in Australia annually is $560m. The revenue derived by the GovOrder! I ask the honourable member to ernment in the form of excise from the return to the subject matter of the Bill. 10157/72-«-[16 ] sale of cigarettes and tobacco in Australia is S300m. Any reduction in the revenue derived from this quarter would have to be made up by revenue derived from another quarter. In my area alone there are 1,800 tobacco growers and 2,000 share farmers. I admit that that is the reason why I have raised this matter. These people rely on the is always talk about decentralisation but nothing is ever done to achieve it. If this industry is affected in any way as a result of the banning of certain forms of advertising it could force some of the people to whom I have referred to move away from the tobacco growing areas. It must be remembered also that millions of dollars have been spent in storing the water which the tobacco growers require in order to grow their tobacco. This industry is not only of immense value to the Australian Government in monetary terms but it also provides a livelihood for up to 4,000 or 5,000 people in the Mareeba, Dimbulah, Mary Farms and Bilwon areas. What will happen to these areas if the tobacco industry is affected in any way by the banning of tobacco advertising? Mr Clyde Cameron-Does the honourable member himself smoke? I will continue to smoke until I die. I might die from lung cancer; I might die of something else. We all will die some day because of something. It might not be because of smoking. I have never been convinced as to the cause of lung cancer. I will say this: Smoking may aggravate an existing cancer condition. How many people have died of lung cancer who never smoked in their lives? There are many. It might also be said that people who wear white shirts are more susceptible to cancer than those who wear coloured shirts because more people wear white shirts. At least, that was the case. Now, people are wearing coloured shirts. The situation might be reversed. It might be said that those who wear coloured shirts are more susceptible to cancer. Not everybody is convinced.

151,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Cope),"licences and deals with the Broadcasting and Television Bill. able member should deal with licences. bers to realise what is happening. If the advertising of cigarettes on television is banned, it will affect the commercial stations greatly. Where will they obtain their income to show programmes for the people? The advertising of cigarettes provides the greatest contribution for the purchasing of programmes to be screened on the commercial stations. Therefore, I ask the Government to consider all these problems and to find a solution to them. I think the solution could lie in taking steps to encourage manufacturers to reduce the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes rather than in banning all advertising of cigarettes and tobacco. A complete ban would affect commercial stations to a great degree. They depend on advertising to keep their stations going and to screen programmes. If cigarette advertising is curtailed, they will have to increase their advertising of other products or get out of the business altogether. Already, we are talking about the introduction of colour television. It will cost a lot more money. The television stations will have to obtain money from somewhere to screen programmes in colour. Therefore, the matter has to be considered deeply before we ban anything. Is it considered that we should ban the advertising of beer? Beer is injurious to health just as cigarettes Everingham, D.

157,Mr Cope (Sydney) (10.24),"The matter sworn at more Ministers than any otherraise a matter tonight which was raised in some way during question time today. I do not think that the Standing Orders of the House preclude me from raising this matter in the adjournment debate. It deals with a number of dedicated civilians who have been engaged for some considerable time in Vietnam for the Save the Children's Fund. This organisation involves a number of people from South Australia who, over the years, have been collecting a great deal of aid. 1 hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr N. H. Bowen) will pay some attention-if he will get off the air and stop talking to the Minister for Education and Science( Mr Malcolm Fraser)because this matter involves his Department. Since the withdrawal of our forces from Vietnam it has been found that a number of articles that have been collected by organisations for thc purpose of relieving suffering in Vietnam cannot be transported there. Once again I suggest that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should listen and not show his absolute ignorance. These goods can no longer be transported to Vietnam because the Royal Australian Air Force has withdrawn from that area. I understand that representations have been made to the Minister and his Department, yet no assurance has been given that ihese goods that are donated are likely to be transported to Vietnam where these people much conversation on my right. woken up. I would suggest that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should pay ?ome attention to the correspondence he is likely to receive if he has not already received it. lies are toid or to claim some form of much conversation on my right. I have asked for it to cease. Whether the Minister or any other honourable member wishes to listen to the honourable member for Sturt is his prerogative. to get a hit hot under the collar. There sit the people who are responsible for many of the crippled children and the limbless in Vietnam, yet the Minister has not the cation which to anybody on the opposite decency to sit in this chamber and listen side would be a very good book-'The Liars when I stand here tonight and ask with Memory Book'. This is a publication which all due courtesy that he pay some attention to the correspondence he is likely to receive or has already received about assisting with the transport to Vietnam of goods that have been donated by industry-medica l supplies, baby foods and what have you-for the kids who are lying up there as a result of the stinking, lousy conflict the Government has forced on people in this country. SoI say to the Minister in all consciousness that if we have withdrawn our troops, including RAAF personnel, from Vietnam we still have stationed in Malaysia certain Air Force units which I believe would be running some form of transport service between this country and that. These personnel should be made available to transport, as the last leg of their journey, these goods to Vietnam in the interests of humanity in this war torn and forlorn country which has been brought to that state by this Government. In the last few minutes available to me I want to deal with some of the matters that appear in the Parliamentary Handbook. One that has always narked me a bit is the one that deals with our Prime with what ihe Parliamentary Handbook says in regard to his service with the Army. Ft says that he joined up in 1940. He joined up with a New South Wales regiment. 1 am quite sure that members of. the First Brigade, which went overseas, would be interested to know that the unit was originally formed in 1940. and that one William McMahon was an original member of it, when in fact it was serving in the Middle East. 1 want to know why, if it is unparliamentary in this place to say that misrepresentation, how anybody whose par ticulars appear in thc Parliamentary Handbook can mislead the Parliament and the public or anybody else for that matter by presenting details of his service and enlistment which are not true.

The fact is that there are inaccuracies in the Parliamentary Handbook dealing with the Prime Minister, and 1 think they should be corrected. I say to the House that they should be corrected. Why should people be misled? It is one thing to put this sort of material out in a pamphlet at the time of an electioneering campaign because you can hoodwink some of the people all of the time, but to put it into the official handbook of this Parliament is to my way of thinking quite wrong. There ought to be some procedure of the House whereby material appearing in the Parliamentary Handbook should be examined as to its authenticity or otherwise before it is printed and is used in this manner. examined. authority in the House to examine it or whether the word of those who are interviewed in regard to this handbook is accepted.

I think he was perhaps unaware of what he was saying. I do not necessarily carry a torch for the Prime Minister( Mr of the House who are younger than the McMahon) or anybody else in this House, but what the honourable member has read out of his Parliamentary Handbook says nothing dishonourable about the Prime Minister. It seems to be the coming thing of the Australian Labor Party, today to cast scorn on every matter it can. Everybody knows that the Prime Minister before a certain operation suffered from considerable deafness and perhaps there were reasons for serving as he did. I admit that the honourable member for Sturt has a very gallant war record. Fair enough. 1 do not think anybody takes that away from him. We know that he and some hundreds of thousands of others were in the Middle East. But if he wants to play this game as hard as he appears to want to play it, let us have a look at some other records in the Handbook in close detail to find out exactly who was where, at what time, and wby. I think he may find a little less than unanimous support on his side of the House. Perhaps matters listed in the Parliamentary Handbook should be checked. An honourable member is asked what his war service was, and he may say that he was in the Citizen Military Force or the Australian Imperial Force. Many people were in certain fields because of health or for other reasons. Because the honourable member for Sturt was one of those who went overseas and served and rose to the rank of corporal, this does not mean that other people who tried to get away, who did everything possible to get away but were unable to get away because of some disability, are not equally as courageous as he. If there is anything 1 am fed up with it is a braying as that comes into this House and on every possible occasion suggests that he is the only one who made any sacrifice during the war and has the temerity to pour scorn on other people who perhaps tried equally as hard, did not succeed, but still served their country honourably. I think it is despicable for the honourable member to take this point. As I said, if he wants to proceed with it I am quite happy to go through the Parliamentary Handbook and list a few other records of honourable members on his side of the House wbo talk about war and about people on this side honourable member for Sturt and I , and ask them why they did not do certain things.

Last Thursday an article by the Reverend Gricrson, Associate Director of the Methodist Department of Christian Education in Victoria and Tasmania appeared in the 'Age'. That article dealt with alleged shortcomings in the conduct of the 1971 ballot in the Stuart electorate during the Legislative Council elections. I was in that electorate, I was associated with the ballot and 1 would like to give some further points on it. One of the points made by the Reverend Grierson is that Aborigines and others in outlying districts, which are defined as any places more than 5 miles from the nearest polling booth, are automatically supplied with a ballot paper in elections in the Northern Territory. This is different from the position in ordinary electorates as we all know, where a person has to make special application for a ballot paper. The correspondence is, of course, in English and the form is extremely complex. As the Reverend Grierson puts it, it would make the heart of an educated Australian sink; for the uneducated Aborigine it is incomprehensible. Reverend Grierson said: If the Aboriginal voter is on a station the postal votes may not be sent direct to him, but to the station owner, whose task it is to distribute burg we had 152 to 39 in favour of the the ballot paper to any Aborigine on his station registered to vote. Station owners in this case control the distribution of postal votes. I think this is wrong. We have available statutory declarations from a number of Aborigines but an insufficient number to put in a protest on the particular poll in the Stuart electorate showing that thc Aborigines who were registered did not receive ballot papers or that they were held up somewhere on the way. WhilstI am not necessarily saying that a station owner did not distribute ballot papers it certainly makes it possible for station owners to do so, whichever Party they may belong to. It is not compulsory for Aborigines to register and there is no systematic registration campaign carried out by electoral If the practical disenfranchisement of many officers although funds are allocated for Territory Aborigines is a consequence of neglect this express purpose. Last night the and indifference, It is a disgrace. If it stems even Minister for the Interior( Mr Hunt) assured me privately that they would do so. I hope they will do so urgently and will not again give in to the Country Party who hope that people will not register. It is an offence at the present time for anyone else fo canvass Aborigines to enrol as voters. I think this is wrong. WhatI personally object to is that there are alternative procedures. It would not be difficult for the methods successfully employed with indigenous tribes in Papua New Guinea to be adapted to Australian conditions. It is so easy to do this, to arrange for mobile polling booths to go around the stations and collect the votes from the people concerned. I do not know why the present complicated system of postal votes is used in the Stuart electorate, unless it is for the purpose of preventing Aborigines from voting. I think this is completely wrong. Pressure is also exerted on Aborigines on the stations. I have some evidence on this but I have not enough time tonight to disclose it because I want to mention another matter in regard to Alice Springs. But anybody who looks at the figures for places where there were polling booths and where there were official returning officers will see the facts. 1 do not wish to make any reflection on the returning officers. The facts will be clear from what I am saying. Where returning officers were present and the vast majority of people were Aboriginal voters we had the following results: at HermannsLabor Party; at Papunya we had 82 to 22; at Santa Teresa we had 159 to 21. The votes were between 4 to 1 and nearly 8 to 1 in favour of the Labour Party in areas where the votes were collected by official returning officers appointed by this Government. What happened when the postal votes were sent out and given to Country Party station owners to distribute? We got a complete reversal in the votes. We got votes of 221 to 83 in favour of the Country Party representative. This by itself is not proof that the ballot has been tampered with, but I certainly suggest it could be taken to be so. The editorial in the 'Age' of 25th February states: to some degree from deliberate discrimination, it Alice Springs hospital depends on a surgeon is a major pob'tical scandal. Whatever the reason, supplied by the United States Pine Gap it is no longer tolerable. I completely agree with that. Why do into Alice Springs they decided they could Aborigines when they get the chance vote not put up with the sort of medical for the Labor Party candidate? you why they do.

173,As At Dr Forbes,"The Minister for Health hasHerbicides (Question No. 3095) Dr representing the Ministerf o r Health, upon noiice: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the Report on Effects of 2,4,5-T and Related Herbicides on Man and the Environment from the Sub-committee on Energy, Natural resources and the Environment of the Committee on Commerce of the United States Senate, dated 17th and 18th June 1970, which recommends the immediate and publicised removal of this herbicide from the channels of commerce such as its use around the home, on bodies of water and on food. (2) If so, will thc Minister take immediate steps to (a) carry out this recommendation as far as it lies within the competence of the Commonwealth Government and (b) raise the question with the States with a view to parallel action by them. (3) Will the Minister also place similar restricof this statement and I am informed that, arising tions on the milder but closely related substance 2,4-D. (4) Will the Minister seek prompt expert advice, in the light of the report, on what restrictions should be placed on the industrial use of these herbicides. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. In this report there are no recommendations made by the Sub-committee itself, but various suggestions and recommendations were made by the witnesses who appeared before it. In April 1970 the United States authorities suspended registration for liquid formulations of 2,4,5-T for use around the home and all formulations for use in aquatic areas; they also announced the cancellation of registration of all non-liquid formulamends such listing, that recommendation will protions of 2,4,5-T for use around the home and on food crops grown for direct human consumption. Thc United States Environmental Protection Agency, which took over several of the functions of the Department of Agriculture in this connection, in March 1971 announced that it had issued cancellations for thc use of 2,4,5-T. There will be public hearings in this regard and information is that it may take up to a year for a firm decision to be made as to whether any further limitations on ihe use of 2,4,5-T should be introduced. The distinction between cancellation and suspension in the United States is that suspension would involve the cessation of inter-state movements of the pesticide, whereas cancellations are really notice of intention to cancel the registration of a substance. (2) (a) and (b) The National Health and Medical Research Council which is an expert advisory body on health matters to the Commonwealth and Stales, at its 70th Session in April 1970 made the following statement: 'Council considered recent reports of teratogenic abnormalities in mice and rats following administration of large oral doses of Ihe weedicide 2,4,5-T. This substance is included in Secthe organisations and (b) received payments from tion III of the Recommended Tolerances for residues of Pesticides and Agricultural Chemicals in Foods as published at Appendix VI to the Report of the Sixty-eigh.h Session of Council. No residues have been detected and none is permitted in or upon food. Council considered Everingham asked the Minister that the scientific evidence available required verification because the work done did not specifically incriminate 2,4,5-T as a toxicological hazard to humans. Until this information is available Council recommended: (i) the use of 2,4,5-T in areas where water contamination could occur should not be permitted; (ii) all persons exposed to 2,4,5-T in its manufacture and use should use special precautions, such as protective clothing to ensure lhat skin absorption did not occur; (iii) until further evidence is available, special precautions should be taken to avoid exposure of women, particularly those in the child-bearing age group to 2,4,5-T.' The relevant State authorities have been notified out of the application of State legislation to chemicals used for agricultural, pastoral and horticultural purposes, 2,4,5-T on retail sale in Australia is labelled with safely directions. In so far as the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory are concerned, the authorities responsible for control of catchment areas in respect of public water supplies have been informed of thc National Health and Medical Research Council statement, with particular reference to that section ot the statement relating to water contamination. I am informed that, in the near future, the question of listing 2,4,5-T in the Uniform Poisons Schedules will be considered by the Poisons Schedules Sub-Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council. If, arising out of consideration of this question, the Council recomvide a basis for ihe imposition of controls over the sale of 2,4,5-T under State and Territory legislation. (3) No. At present there is insufficient scientific evidence to suggest a need for restrictive recommendations concerning 2,4-D. (4) This has already been done. All pesticides, including herbicides, are kept under continual review by expert committees of the National Health and Medical Research Council. Hospital Benefits Organisations (Question No. 4000) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister representing the Ministerf o r Health, upon notice: (1) What payments of (a) fund and (b) Commonweath benefits were made to or in respect of their members by hospital benefits organisations in 1970-71.

NotesAs Queensland public hospitals provide free public ward accommodation, those members who were insured for a benefit level below intermediate ward have, for the purposes of this table, been included in column (iii). As public hospitals in Western Australia do not have an intermediate ward category, those members who were insured for a benefit level above standard ward have for the purposes of this table, been included in column (iv). Up until 30 June 1971, public hospitals in Tasmania virtually had only public ward accommodation. However, for maternity patients there were a number of beds which were classified as either intermediate or private. Also, members used the higher benefit tables to insure against the costs of private hospital accommodation. In the above table, members who were insured for a benefit level above standard ward have been arbitrarily apportioned between columns (iii) and (iv). were included in this category. Contributors are not entitled to payment of hospital fund benefits unless they have been members of a fund for a period of 2 months before the particular hospital expense is incurred. Exceptions are made in the case of accidents where no waiting period applies and in obstetric cases, where the waiting period is 9 months.

175,Dr Forbes,"The Minister for Health hasDental Health (Question No. 4843) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: Why was the Department of Health authorised to estimate the cost of the dental health proposals made by the Opposition in June 1971 (Senate Hansard, 9th November 1971, page 1731) but not those made by the Australian Dental Association in August 1968 (House of Representatives Hansard, 25th November 1971, page 3768). provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Both the Opposition's proposals and those of the insufficiently precise to enable reliable costings to be made. Therefore, costings have not been made by my Department. In replying to Senator Jessop on 9th November 1971, 1971, I stated that the additional costs to the Commonwealth involved in the Opposition's revised proposals would be between 1239m and $249m for three items-medica l and hospital benefits, school dental health, and the listing of oral contraceptives as a pharmaceutical benefit. Of these items, school dental health was estimated at 145m. This figure for school dental health was an estimate included in Dr Gun's proposal. My proviso that the estimate has every indication of some unreliability stems from Dr Gun's paper itself. In this paper he stated, inter alia. 'Accurate costs of comprehensive school dental services are difficult to forecast. A rough idea can be obtained by extrapolating costs of the present services in South Australia to the costs if the services were expanded to fulfil the estimated needs in that State.' Smoking-Associated Diseases (Question No. 4543) Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Did smoking-associated diseases, other than lung cancer, kill some 33,000 Australians in the 1960's.

Drugs: Advertising (Question No. 4823) Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Has the Minister objected to the advertising of a product as a stimulant or as giving a quick lift that lasts on the grounds of good health practice and avoidance of drug dependence and abuse of drugs when not properly prescribed. (2) Is caffeine a stimulant which gives a quick lift without rebound withdrawal effects.

(2) Yes. (3) Caffeine is the principal pharmacologically active ingredient in tea, coffee and the product in question. Caffeine is a stimulant, but A.P.C. powders contain other pharmacologically active ingredients. (4) My Government has no desire to encourage the excessive use of any harmful product. As the honourable member is aware, steps have been taken regarding the advertising of products containing stimulants, and a voluntary agreement currently governs the advertising of cigarettes on television and radio. The Commonwealth has no legislative powers in tbe matter of advertising of tea and coffee, which are regarded as foods. In any case, I consider that it is reasonable that there should exist, in matters such as these, some personal responsibiUty.

Professional attention is defined in the Act as meaning: (a) medical or surgical treatment by or under the supervision of a medical practitioner, (b) obstetric treatment by or under the supervision of a medical practitioner or registered obstetric nurse; or (c) dental treatment by or under the supervision of a legally qualified dentist or denourable member's question: tal practitioner. A patient who receives physiotherapy in the circumstances set out above may receive Commonwealth hospital benefits. (2) The provision of Commonwealth medical benefits for physiotherapy, services can only be considered in conjunction with the claims for similar benefits for other services such as optometry and home nursing etc. A major consideration in any proposal to expand the present benefits is the additional burden wbich would necessarily be placed on Australian taxpayers who, in 1970-71, provided from the National Welfare Fund $427m for expenditure on National Health alone. The estimate for 1971-72 is $510m, an increase of $88m. However, the question of ths inclusion of benefits for paramedical services is currently being examined by my Department. As the issues involved are of a complex nature and involve policy considerations which will be a matter for determination by the Government, it may be some time before the examination is completed.

(2) What would be the additional cost of allowing these persons to receive prescriptions on the same basis as full rate pensioners. provided the following answer to the hon(1) The estimated additional cost of the proposal to allow persons, qualifying under the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan, to continue to receive National Health Scheme prescription benefits for SO cents for each prescription is $247,000 for a full year. (2) It is estimated lhat the additional cost of allowing these people to receive prescription beneiits without payment of the SO cent patient contribution and on the same basis as persons in receipt of pensioner pharmaceutical benfits would be $2.1m for a full year. This estimate was made on an assumption that the level of utilization would rise above that applicable to the general public other than pensioners, because a wider list of benefits would be available but would not be as high as that applicable to aged and invalid pensioners.

182,Dr Forbes,"The Minister for Health has(2) I understand thai, m ihe field of general advertising, jt is believed that short repeated advertisements may have an impact greater than long films or brochures. However, I am not aware of any evidence relating to the differential effect of such advertisements on cigarette consumption. The factors which influence people to smoke or not to smoke are complex and, in certain overseas countries, cigarette consumption has continued to rise despite complete cessation of radio and television advertising of cigarettes. For this reason, I consider that any opinion given in relation to the matter raised in the honourable member's question would necessarily be subjective. (3) This is one of the objectives of the restricers, respectively, under State and Territory legislations mentioned. (4) The Government considers lhat educational campaigns in schools provide a sound basis for an informed decision by the individual on whether or not to smoke. Third Parly Claims (Question No. 4825) Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that third parly claims must be made and decided before hospital benefits are allowed to those who are injured in traffic accidents and who have insured themselves voluntarily. (2) Can he say whether these claims may involve suing the bereaved relatives of someone killed in the same traflic accident which some claimants are reluctant lo do for good and humane reasons. (3) Will the Government take steps to have hospital fee benefits due from subsidised benefit funds payable (a) under the same conditions as medical fee benefits and (b) wherever third party claims are pending or unpaid whether claimed for or not. (4) Will the Government also take steps to integrate third party, compensation and voluntary health insurance. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) lt is not necessary that such a claim be determined before payment of Commonwealth hospital benefits may be made. Section 59 (3) of the National Health Act enables provisional payments of Commonwealth hospital beneiits to be made in circumstances when it appears that a qualified hospital patient may have an entitlement to compensation or damages but has not established that entitlement. The payment of fund hospital benefits is determined under the rules of each registered benefits organisation. Generally, fund benefits are not payable in respect of any period of hospitalisation which is or may be covered by third party or workers' compensation insurance. (2) Settlements of third party claims are based on State or Territory legislation and do not come within the ambit of the hospital benefits scheme. (3) and (4) The integration of third party, workers' compensation and voluntary health insurance would be very complex and would involve both the Commonwealth and the States. In practice, provisional payments of Commonwealth hospital benefits under Section 59 (3) of the National Health Act are made in the same types of circumstances as provisional payments of Commonwealth medical benefits under Section 21 (3) of the Act. It is not inappropriate for hospital benefits organisations to preclude payment of fund benefits, since th.'rd party and workers' compensation insurance coverage arises out of obligat'ons imposed on motor vehicle owners anil on employtion. Entitlements under third party or workers' compensation insurance are thus more fundnmental than any secondary entitlements which may arise in the voluntary health insurance context. It is also for this reason that the payments of Commonwealth benefits referred to above are 'provisional' they may be repayable lo the Commonwealth after settlement of the compensation or damages claim. Australian Film 'Stockade' the honourable member for Ballaarat ( Mr Erwin) asked me in a question without notice whether the Australian Council for the Arts and the Australian Film Development Corporation had supervised or had any knowledge of the contents of the film 'Stockade' before or during its production. He also asked what steps, if any, could be taken by the Government to remove the film from circulation, because of what he considered to be its immoral content. The Australian Council's interest was to enable the work of an Australian playwright which had previously been produced at the Independent Theatre in Sydney with assistance from the Council to be taken a stage further into film production. The play had been seen by several members of the Council before this decision was taken.
