165,The Nature Of The Inquiry. In South Australia The Speaker,"Order! It being 9 p.m.,The following answers to questions were circulated: Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 1122) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 14 November 2002: Has his attention been drawn to the assertion that claims made during the last election campaign that asylum seekers threw their children overboard were in breach of section 329 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act in that they deceived and misled electors prior to the casting of votes; if so, will the Government urge an investigation into possible breach of the law; if not, why not. The source of the assertion referred to in the Hon Members question is not identified. In any case, the issues were extensively canvassed in the report of the government members of the Senate Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident. Australian Taxation Office: Time Chartering Ships (Question No. 1237) Mr Danby asked the Minister representing the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 11 December 2002: (1) What are the details of the Draft Ruling the Australian Tax Office (ATO) has released dealing with time chartering ships. (2) Has the Government or the ATO costed this measure; if so, what is the cost impact of the ruling. (3) Has the Government or the ATO received legal advice on the draft ruling; if so, what was the legal advice. (4) What consultation did the ATO undertake. (5) Is the Government and the ATO aware of the criticisms of this measure and the affects it will have on the national shipping industry. (6) Will the Draft Ruling severely injure the Australian shipping industry. (7) Will the Government legislate or take any other action, including funding a test case to test the validity of the Ruling, to ensure that this Draft Ruling will not come into force. (1)-(7) Refer to the final ruling TR2003/2 titled the Royalty withholding tax implications of ship chartering arrangements which issued on 14 May 2003. Australian Taxation Office: Garnishee Orders (Question No. 1653) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 March 2003: What has he done to prohibit a taxpayer from depositing income into an account of another person or entity with the intention of frustrating potential garnishee orders obtained by the Australian Taxation Office.

168,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Australian Taxation Office: Legal Professionals (Question No. 1761) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 26 March 2003: What is the Australian Taxation Office doing in relation to the investigation of members of the legal profession in States and Territories outside New South Wales who have: (a) failed to lodge tax returns on time, and (b) abused family law and/or bankruptcy as a tool to avoid paying their creditors, particularly the Taxation Commissioner. (a) The Commissioner of Taxation is pursuing the lodgement of income tax returns of legal professionals in all States and Territories. Those who fail to lodge on time may expose themselves to administrative penalties or prosecution. Also refer to the press release by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer 2 May 2003 ‘Progress of Government action to strengthen laws to prevent tax abuse’. (b) As was the case with barristers in New South Wales, the Commissioner of Taxation will investigate and seek to overturn arrangements designed to disadvantage creditors. Also refer to the press release by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer 2 May 2003 ‘Progress of Government action to strengthen laws to prevent tax abuse’. Military Detention: Australian Citizens (Question No. 1823) (1) Will he provide an update on the current position of Mr David Hicks and Mr Mamdouh Habib and the representations that the Australian Government has made to ensure that they have the opportunity to answer criminal charges brought and prosecuted in accordance with the principles of due process? (2) Is he able to say how long the men will be detained before any such charges are brought? (1) Mr David Hicks is detained by US authorities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The US has alleged that he was involved with Al Qaida, the organisation responsible for the devastating attacks of September 11. United States President George Bush has listed Mr Hicks as a person eligible for trial before US military commissions established pursuant to the President’s Military Order of 13 November 2001. Under the terms of that Order, the President may list as eligible for trial those persons who he has reason to believe are involved with Al Qaida or international terrorism. At this time, no charges have been laid against Mr Hicks. The laying of charges is a matter for the US prosecuting authority and the US Deputy Secretary of Defence who has responsibility for approving charges laid by the prosecutors. According to the US, when deciding whether to approve charges the US Deputy Secretary for Defence will consider all relevant and appropriate information available including the charge sheet and the advice of his legal adviser. Other relevant factors will include the quality of evidence, the completeness of intelligence gathering and the desire to bring closure to individual cases. The rules governing the military commissions provide fundamental protections and legal guarantees for accused persons. These include: the right to representation by defence counsel, a presumption of innocence, a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the right to obtain witnesses and documents to be",171,Questions On Notice

171,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:used in their defence, the right to cross examine prosecution witnesses and the right to remain silent with no adverse inference being drawn from the exercise of that right. In the case of a possible trial, Mr Hicks will be provided with a US military lawyer paid for by the US Government and may choose to engage a civilian US lawyer. Further details about the rules and procedures for the military commissions can be found on the US Department of Defence’s website at: www.defenselink.mil. A high-level Australian delegation visiting Washington held successful talks from 21 to 23 July 2003 concerning the two Australians detained at Guantanamo Bay, Mr David Hicks and Mr Mamdouh Habib. The talks were the latest in a series of detailed discussions with the US concerning the Australian detainees. As a result of discussions, the US made several significant commitments on key issues of concern to the Government regarding the possible military commission trial of Mr Hicks: The US has assured Australia it will not seek the death penalty in Mr Hicks’ case; Australia and the US have agreed to work towards putting arrangements in place to transfer Mr Hicks to Australia, if convicted, to serve any penal sentence in Australia in accordance with Australian and US law; An Australian lawyer with appropriate security clearances may be retained as a consultant to Mr Hicks’ legal team at Mr Hicks’ request, following approval of military commission charges. Mr Hicks’ direct contact with such a lawyer will be further discussed with US authorities; Conversations between Mr Hicks and his lawyers will not be monitored by the US, despite this being allowed in some circumstances by military commission rules; The prosecution in Mr Hicks’ case does not intend to rely on evidence requiring closed proceedings from which the accused could be excluded; Subject to any necessary security restrictions, Mr Hicks’ trial will be open, the media will be present, and Australian officials may observe proceedings; and The US will work on ways to allow Mr Hicks additional contact with his family, including via telephone, following approval of military commission charges. Discussions with the US concerning procedures for Mr Hicks’ possible military trial are ongoing. Australian officials will visit Mr Hicks as soon as practicable to ensure he understands military commission procedures. I can assure you that the Government will remain in close contact with the US to ensure that Mr Hicks is treated fairly and appropriately at all times. Like Mr Hicks, Mr Mamdouh Habib is detained by US authorities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Mr Habib has not yet been listed as a person eligible for trial by US military commission. At this time, there is no indication if, or when, he will be tried. The US has previously stated that detainees will be released when they are no longer of security, intelligence or law enforcement interest. (2) No. However, these matters are the subject of ongoing discussions between the Government and the United States. Economy: Current Account Deficit (Question No. 1837) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 14 May 2003: (1) Can he confirm that Australia’s current account deficit has: (a) tripled over the past two years, (b) now stands at $41 billion, and (c) represents approximately 6 per cent of Australia’s Gross Domestic product? (2) Can he confirm that Australia’s exports are decreasing and Australia’s imports are increasing; if not, why not? (3) What does he propose to do to reverse these disturbing trends? Australia’s balance of payments performance is summarised in the Australian Bureau of Statistics publication Balance of Payments and International Investment Position. (Catalogue Number 5302.0) Further information on the outlook for exports and imports can be found in Budget Paper Number1 Statement 3 of the 2003-04 Budget Papers. Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 1853) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 14 May 2003: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 1413, once his Department becomes aware of an alleged breach of the Sydney Airport curfew, and it writes to the airline operator in question requesting advice on the circumstances relating to the operation of the particular aircraft, what disciplinary or correctional activity normally happens next; if no further action occurs other than this written request for advice, why not. (2) Where can the operational regulations, guidelines, etc for this procedure be found. (3) How can a copy of such be obtained; if no copy can be obtained, why not. (1) Any further action deemed necessary is dependent on the circumstances surrounding the alleged breach, and any legal advice in relation to them. As I have previously advised the Honourable Member, advice on the course of action to be pursued is taken from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) on the basis of their guidelines. (2) and (3) The DPP guidelines are available on their website at www.cdpp.gov.au. Defence Properties: Sale or Disposal (Question No. 1864) Mr Kerr asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 14 May 2003: (1) What was the rateable valuation of the land at the Brighton Army Camp that was recently sold by the Department of Defence. (2) What, if any, other valuations did the Department of Defence or the Department of Finance and Administration obtain before the sale of the land and what were those valuations. (3) Was the land advertised to potential buyers with an indication that the expected price was in the range of $2 million; if not, what were the terms of the advertisements. (4) What was the price obtained for the land and are reports that this large area of land was sold for approximately $150,000 correct. (5) If the land was sold for substantially less than $2 million, why did the responsible Departments proceed with the sale for much less than the land’s valuation. (6) Is the Government aware of complaints from members of the Tasmanian community that the land has been disposed of for a fraction of its real value and in circumstances in which many other offers would have been made had the offer been put in terms that did not suggest that a price under $2 million would not have been acceptable to the vendor.

Australian Securities and Investments Commission: NRMA Ltd (Question No. 1876) Mr Andren asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 14 May 2003: (1) In light of the NRMA’s substantial financial losses, the recently announced increases in membership fees and reduction in member services, will the Treasurer be directing the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to investigate the following representations made in the 2000 Information Memorandum issued to the 2 million members of NRMA Ltd: (a) The NRMA will be in a strong financial position after the Proposal is implemented. (b) Road service membership fees will not increase as a consequence of the Proposal. (c) The Proposal is designed to allow membership fees to be maintained without increasing until 30 June 2001 … Thereafter, it is expected that fees will be increased using the CPI as a guide. (d) Existing road service benefits can be maintained. (e) The proposal is also designed to allow current road and related motoring services and service levels to be maintained, if not improved; if not, why not. (2) Given the substantial increases in insurance premium rates since the demutualisation of NRMA Insurance Limited, now known as IAG Limited, will ASIC investigate the following representations made in the 2002 Information Memorandum issued to the 2 million members of NRMA Limited: (a) Insurance premium rates will not increase as a consequence of the Proposal. (b) Claims management principles will not increase as a consequence of the Proposal; if not, why not. (3) Will ASIC investigate whether the use of the NRMA logo by Mr Ross Turnbull and his team of candidates on a brochure sent to all NRMA members prior to the 2002 AGM was unauthorised, and if it was unauthorised, will ASIC also investigate the position in the light of the general law and the Corporations Act 2001, specifically the matter of directors’ duties, as rule 16 of the constitution of the NRMA prohibits the unauthorised use of the company’s logo without the approval of the board; if not, why not. (4) Will ASIC investigate whether the said use of the NRMA logo by Mr Ross Turnbull and his team of candidates to solicit proxies constituted misleading and deceptive conduct in breach of the General law, the Corporations Act 2001 and/or the Trade Practices Act; if not, why not. (5) Will ASIC investigate whether the financial resources of the NRMA were used lawfully for private advantage by Mr Ross Turnbull and his team of candidates, to gain appointments to the board of NRMA Ltd, by: (a) using the company’s official voting pack mailed to the NRMA’s 2 million members to distribute their unofficial proxy, (b) retaining PR consultants Jackson Wells Morris, to advise and conduct their election campaign, and (c) implementing a media campaign of selfpromotion; if not, why not. (6) Will ASIC investigate whether the decision to continue paying the legal fees of Mr Nicholas Whitlam for the appeal proceedings in the Supreme Court of NSW was unlawful, or inconsistent with prior board resolutions to cease all further such payments.",174,Questions On Notice

(8) Will the Treasurer investigate the refusal of ASIC’s chairman, Mr David Knott, to accept a petition addressed to him as Chairman and signed by nearly 1,000 NRMA members; if not why not. (9) Will the Treasurer accept service of the petition; if not, why not. (10) Can he say whether Mr Ross Turnbull, the current President of the NRMA, is: (a) a current member of the Liberal Party; (b) the same Mr Ross Turnbull who stood for Liberal Party preselection for the federal seat of Wentworth; and (c) the same Mr Ross Turnbull who attended the Liberal Party fund raiser at NSW Parliament House earlier this year; if so, can he say whether the NRMA paid for this attendance by the use of his NRMA corporate credit card or by any other means. (1) No. ASIC actively considered these matters during September 2002. It was concluded that directors would have had a reasonable belief that these statements were correct at the time they were made. ASIC advises that there was insufficient evidence to conclude otherwise at the time. (2) ASIC advises that, following detailed consideration of these matters, ASIC formed the view that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the rise in premiums was as a result of the demutalisation process. (3) and (5) ASIC has advised that it is currently making enquiries in relation to the brochure sent to NRMA members prior to the AGM held on 14 January 2003. These enquiries include consideration of the use of the NRMA logo in the brochure. The enquiries have not yet concluded. As the matter is under consideration, ASIC is unable to provide any further public comments at this stage. (4) Except to the extent that it is relevant to ASIC’s enquiries described in the response to question 3 above, ASIC does not propose to investigate whether the use of the NRMA logo by Mr Ross Turnbull and his team of candidates to solicit proxies constitutes misleading and deceptive conduct, on the basis that these matters fall outside ASIC’s regulatory powers. 6) ASIC advises that it has made enquiries into this issue. It should be noted that, under section 199A(3) of the Corporations Act, an indemnity for legal costs in defending proceedings for a Court order brought by ASIC is allowed unless the grounds for making the order are found by the Court to have been established. Section 199A(4) of the Corporations Act extends the definition of proceedings to any appeal in relation to those proceedings. (7) ASIC has advised that it is making enquiries into complaints about the alleged use by Mr Turnbull of his NRMA corporate credit card. These enquiries have not yet concluded. As the matter is under consideration, ASIC is unable to provide any further public comments at this stage. (8) No. Such an investigation is not a function of the Treasurer. (9) No. The petition is not addressed to the Treasurer. (10) This does not come under the Treasurer’s portfolio responsibilities. World Health Organisation: Membership (Question No. 1879) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 15 May 2003: (1) Can the minister confirm that in letters dated 13 and 21 May 2002 he stated that Australia was favourably disposed to Taiwan being admitted to the World Health Organization (WHO) with observer status, but would only do so when it was clear a consensus supported such a move.",175,Questions On Notice
175,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Would consensus have to include the agreement of the People’s Republic of China; if so, is the Minister able to say whether this is likely to be forthcoming. (3) What other organisations or entities, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, or quasi states, already enjoy observer status and did Australia support their accreditation to the WHO as observers; if so, how did Australia explain its support for these organisations or entities. (4) Have the speedy spread of the SARS epidemic in Taiwan and the possibility of continued crossinfection between China and Taiwan via the busy cross-Strait trade and travel made the admission of Taiwan as an observer to the WHO even more urgent than before. (5) Will the Government, at the commencement of the meeting of the WHO in Geneva on 28 May 2003, move to join the recent statements of the Japanese government, the EU, and the US Congress and bi-partisan private member’s resolution moved by the Member for Fairfax and seconded by the Member for Lilley supporting the admission of Taiwan to the WHO as an observer. (1) In the letters cited I stated that the Government understood and was sympathetic to Taiwan’s desire to be admitted to the WHO. The Government’s position remains unchanged. WHO practice is to decide the admittance of new members or observers through consensus of all members. Australia endorses the consensus approach, as it ensures that decisions represent the views of all members. We support resolution of the issue of Taiwan’s participation by consensus. (2) No. In UN practice, consensus means the absence of an express objection from any member. It does not require agreement; abstention is also possible. To date, there have been objections from some WHO members, including the People’s Republic of China (PRC), to Taiwan’s bid. The issue of the PRC’s policy on Taiwan’s bid is one for the PRC Government. (3) The following entities have observer status at the WHO: the Holy See, the Order of Malta, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and Palestine. The Holy See, the Order of Malta, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies were admitted as observers upon the invitation of the Director-General, with the consensus of the World Health Assembly (WA). Australia supported this consensus, consistent with its objective that the membership of UN bodies should reflect the consensus view of their members. Palestine was admitted as an observer under the name Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974, pursuant to WA resolution 27.37. The resolution was adopted by a show of hands, and received 77 votes in favour, one against, and 16 abstentions. Individual members’ votes are not recorded in votes conducted through a show of hands. (4) Although not a member or observer, Taiwan is able to cooperate with the WHO on measures to combat the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic. On3 May, WHO officials arrived in Taiwan to assist its response to SARS. Disease prevention and control experts from Taiwan attended a WHO conference on SARS in Kuala Lumpur, 17-18 June. Australia has supported Taiwan’s participation in further practical and technical measures to combat SARS. Taiwan has also been assisted by other agencies in its response to the SARS epidemic, such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Temporary quarantine measures designed to contain the movement of SARS across the Taiwan Strait, including mandatory quarantine periods and health inspections, were introduced to control the spread of SARS, similar to quarantine measure introduced in other SARS-affected localities.",176,Questions On Notice
176,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) The World Health Assembly concluded in Geneva on 28 May. At the WA, the matter of Taiwan’s bid for WHO observership attained insufficient support in the General Committee, on which Australia is not represented, to gain a place on this year’s WA agenda. The decision that the issue would not be placed on the agenda narrowed opportunities for the issue to be further discussed by the WA. Instead, the WA allowed two members each to speak for and against Taiwan’s bid in the plenary. Australia was not called on to speak for either side. The issue did not go to a vote. Nuclear Energy: Lucas Heights Reactor (Question No. 1940) 27 May 2003: Since question No. 1355 was placed on the Notice Paper (5 February 2003), has there been an event in the construction of the new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights that has the potential to delay the completion date for the project. Significant rain has led to the loss of a few working days. In addition, and as discussed during Senate Estimates proceedings on 3 and 4 June 2003, there has been an error in cutting penetrations in the reactor pool tank. A proposal for rectifying the error is currently being considered by ARPANSA, which has sought advice from experts in welded structures and the particular stainless steel being used in this project. ANSTO does not expect this issue to lead to an overall delay in construction of the replacement research reactor. construction error in the light of expert advice. Dr Loy will release his decision and the reasons for it on the ARPANSA website. Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 1947) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 28 May 2003: Will he provide a copy of the Memorandum of Understanding that was said to have been signed by himself and a representative of the Iranian government concerning the repatriation of Iranian asylum seekers; if so, when; if not, why not. The document was signed on the understanding that it is a confidential agreement between governments. The Government of Iran has asked that the MOU not be made public at this time. The Australian Government will respect that request. Governor General: Annual Pension (Question No. 1964) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 29 May 2003: Has the rate of the pension to be paid to Dr Peter Hollingworth been calculated; if so, what is the amount of annual pension that will eventually be paid. The pension entitlement for a former Governor General is provided for in the Governor General Act 1974. The Act sets the basic pension at 60 per cent of the salary payable to the Chief Justice of the High Court.

The actual pension amount will depend on a number of factors including the age of the beneficiary and his spouse. The resulting pension is indexed to the Chief Justice’s salary and payable for life. It is fully taxable and treated as income for income tax purposes. Dr Hollingworth is the first former Governor General to be affected by the superannuation surcharge.

Environment: Genetically Modified Organism Record (Question No. 1988) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 3 June 2003: (1) In respect of the Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) record kept by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) and, in particular, “Dealings Not Involving Intentional Release (DNIR)” licence GMAC 5607 entitled “The use of virus vectors for gene silencing in plants (Virus Induced Gene Silencing)”, did the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC), in issuing that licence, require the CSIRO to provide the name of the persons or the organisations that were to be the source or sources of the virus substances named in the dealings; if so, who, and/or which organisation or organisations were named as the source or sources of each of the virus substances named as a ‘parent organism in the GMO Record; if not, why not. (2) Which of the virus substances listed in the licence were imported into Australia and when. (3) Did the ‘monitoring and compliance mechanisms of the OGTR apply to the project; if not, why not. (4) Were the conditions under which the licence was granted adhered to, and could the Minister provide copies of the reporting demonstrating such adherence. the honourable member’s question: (1) The virus source information was not required to be provided at the time of GMAC’s consideration of the GMO dealing application. However, the OGTR has since obtained the following information in relation to DNIR5607. The viruses nominated under GMAC licence 5607 were:",178,Questions On Notice

(2) In respect of the Potato virus X, the plasmid DNA was imported during April 1997; the Barley yellow dwarf virus was imported during July 1999; and the Foxtail mosaic virus was imported during August 2001 and November 2001. (3) Yes. (4) CSIRO facilities have been the subject of a number of inspections. There have been no instances of non-compliance, which compromised the containment of GMOs or posed a risk to human health and safety or the environment. A summary of all monitoring conducted by the OGTR is included in the Quarterly Reports which are available from the OGTR website www.ogtr.gov.au . The Quarterly Reports are tabled in Parliament. Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Question No. 1999) Mr Kerr asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 June 2003: (1) Can he provide a detailed statement of the criteria applied by the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC), to determine which complaints initiated by the public are made the subject of ASIC enforcement action. (2) Is he aware that ASIC has declined to take action in a matter involving allegations that a Tasmanian investor had been misled by his investment adviser due to the adviser’s valuing a potential investment using a methodology other that that allowed under the Australian Accounting Standards and failing to disclose that fact; if so, will he investigate; if not, will he explain how such conduct could be described as not of general significance to the market. (1) For operational reasons the criteria which government agencies such as ASIC use to select the cases that they will investigate are kept confidential. For that reason, it is not possible to provide a detailed public statement outlining those criteria. The criteria that ASIC uses has been supplied on an in-confidence basis to the Office of the Ombudsman. (2) ASIC is aware of a recent complaint made to it that answers this description. In order to ensure that all aspects of this matter were properly taken into account, ASIC reviewed its original decision in this case. Once the review was undertaken, AS (3) IC again concluded that it had no proper role in this case. The circumstances outlined in this case did not identify a matter of critical importance to the financial services market. Having made relevant inquiries and examined the issues thoroughly, ASIC was satisfied that the issues raised in this case did not identify a broad, ongoing market problem. Ultimately the individual concerned retains the option of pursuing private remedies through the court system and can seek appropriate legal advice. In this instance, the Law Society of Tasmania may be able to provide him with assistance in this regard.",179,Questions On Notice
182,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:I also note that, as ASIC is an independent statutory authority, the Treasurer is not permitted to give ASIC a Ministerial Direction regarding a particular case pursuant to subsection 12(3) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989. Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 2013) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 5 June 2003: (1) Further to his reply to question No. 977 (Hansard, 3 June 2003, page 15282), why has the target of 17 per cent of all aircraft movements to the North of Sydney Airport in the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) never once been reached since the LTOP Ministerial Direction was made on 30 July 1997. (2) What are the criteria against which he determines whether implementation of the LTOP has been successful. (3) Which of the two LTOP recommendations are not implemented. (4) Will he table details of how the remaining 29 LTOP recommendations have been implemented. (5) Is it the case that, at page 113, the LTOP for Sydney Airport& Associated Airspace (drafted in 1996) states that “Preliminary planning for Stage2 has been undertaken and a timetable for this stage is currently being finalised”. (6) Has the timetable for Stage2 been finalised; if not, why not; if so, (a) when was it finalised, and (b) will he table a copy; if so, when; if not, why not. (7) What is the timetabled completion date for Stage 2. (8) At the completion of Stage 2, will the LTOP be operating so that all aircraft movement targets, including the 17 per cent of all aircraft movements to the North of Sydney Airport, will be met; if not, why not. (1) (2) and (8) I have already dealt with these matters exhaustively in response to questions previously asked by the Honourable member. (3) The two outstanding LTOP recommendations I referred to in Parliamentary Question 977 were the high and wide and trident arrival concepts. Both of these recommendations have now been addressed to the satisfaction of the industry and community representatives on the LTOP Implementation and Monitoring Committee (IMC). I am awaiting formal advice from Sydney Airport Consultative Forum (SACF) on the completion of the LTOP implementation. (4) A plan that records progress on implementation of the 31 LTOP recommendations has been developed and circulated to members of SACF, of which the Honourable member is a member, on a number of occasions. I understand that an updated version of the plan, incorporating the outcomes of the IMC recommendations on high and wide and trident, has been forwarded by the IMC to the SACF LTOP Review Sub Committee for consideration as part of its investigations into the implementation of LTOP. I await the Sub Committee’s consideration and report on this matter. (5) (6) and (7) This statement is in the Summary Report of the Long Term Operating Plan for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and Associated Airspace prepared by Airservices in 1996. This document was superseded by the Sydney Long Term Operating Plan Proponent’s Statement of June 1997, which was prepared by the Department of Transport and Regional Development. The Airservices document (1996) indicated that the LTOP could be implemented in two phases: Phase1 – mode 5, and mode 14A and a management process for runway selection.",180,Questions On Notice
183,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s questions is as follows:Phase2 – implementation of the rest of the runway modes of operation. All runway modes of operation were implemented in 1996/1997 except for mode 8, which was implemented in December 1999. The high and wide and trident have been addressed as noted above. Health: General Practitioners (Question No. 2016) Ms George asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 16 June 2003: (1) Is the classification of an area as a “district of workforce shortage” determined by the doctor to population ratio; if not, on what basis is it determined. (2) Does the Minister endorse the following assessment of her Parliamentary Secretary in response to my representations of 6 March 2003 on behalf of Dr Natalya Peker: “Port Kembla and Berkeley are located in the Wollongong (C) SLA, which lies within a metropolitan area. Current Medicare billing statistics show that the supply of general practitioners in the Wollongong (C) SLA is better than that currently experienced on average in Australia. Therefore, overseas trained doctors would not generally be granted exemptions that would allow them to provide Medicare eligible services at these locations.”; if so, why. (3) Is the Minister aware that the doctor to population ratio in the electoral division of Throsby is below the national average and is now 1 doctor to every 1,362 people and that Berkeley currently has a doctor to population ratio of 1 doctor to 1,732 people; if so, (a) was this considered when making a determination as to whether or not Dr Peker should be granted an exemption to practice at Berkeley and issued a Medicare Provider Number; if not, why not, and (b) was this considered in regard to Berkeley being granted district of workforce shortage status; if not, why not. (4) Is the Minister aware that in the electoral division of Throsby the number of doctors to population in each postcode district is: (a) 1 to 768 in 2502, (b) 1 to 5,150 in 2505, (c) 1 to 1,732 in 2506, (d) 1 to 1,308 in 2526, (e) 1 to 1,677 in 2527, (f) 1 to 1,219 in 2528, (g) 1 to 2,686 in 2529, and (h) 1 to 1,151 in 2530. (5) Will the Minister declare Throsby a district of workforce shortage and issue Dr Peker a Medicare Provider Number; if not, why not. the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. The Minister’s delegate in the Department of Health and Ageing may take into account some other factors such as whether a community is classified as rural or remote, and local special needs such as the presence of a significant Indigenous population. (2) Yes. Current Medicare statistics indicate that the supply of general practitioners in the Wollongong (C) Statistical Local Area (SLA) is better than that experienced on average in Australia. (3) (a) and (b). No. Doctor to population ratios are calculated at the level of SLAs. SLAs are the basic building blocks used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Australian Standard Geographic Classification (ASGC) system. The use of SLAs to report on doctor to population ratios is considered the most appropriate approach as it is the smallest standard geographic unit defined in the ASGC. (4) Postcode districts are not used to determine districts of medical workforce shortage, which are assessed on the basis of SLAs. (5) No. Electorates are not used as a basis for determining districts of medical workforce shortage.",181,Questions On Notice

(2) In respect of each benefit administered by Centrelink, what are Centrelink’s average processing times by (a) State, (b) region, and (c) post code. (3) In respect of the time taken to process applications for benefits, does Centrelink have any self imposed targets; if so, (a) what are they, and (b) how often does Centrelink fail to meet its targets; if not, why not. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: The detailed information required to answer the honourable member’s question is not readily available in consolidated form. I do not consider it appropriate to expend the resources and effort that would be involved in collecting and assembling information for the sole purpose of answering questions of this nature. However, I can confirm that the Department of Family and Community Services does set timeliness standards for payments and services as part of the Business Partnership Agreement with Centrelink. As of the March 2003 quarter, Centrelink had met these timeliness standards 96.5 per cent of the time for the 2002-03 financial year. Health: Meningococcal Disease (Question No. 2030) Mr Danby asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 17 June 2003: (1) How many children have been immunised under the Government’s Meningococcal C immunisation program. (2) How many children have been immunised outside the Government’s Meningococcal C immunisation program. (3) How long does each immunisation last. (4) Are boosters required; if so, how often. the honourable member’s question: (1) The latest available data from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register indicates that between 1 January and 31 May 2003, 310,636 children up to five years of age had been immunised under the National Meningococcal C Vaccination Program. (2) Data from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register indicates that 33,719 children up to five years of age received Meningococcal C Vaccine prior to commencement of the National Meningococcal C Vaccination Program on 1 January 2003.

Defence: Board of Inquiry (Question No. 2031) Mr Rudd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 17 June 2003: (1) Is the Minister satisfied that the loss of the Mirage A3-40 on 2 May 1986, which resulted in the death of Craig Mackelmann, has been adequately investigated. (2) Is the Minister aware that statements made by the President of the Board of Inquiry (BOI), Air Commodore N Ford, to inquiries by the Ombudsman in 1991 and by Senator Durack in 1998, have been subsequently found to be inaccurate, and that Air Commodore Ford later changed his testimony before the Federal Court. (3) Will the Government review and investigate fully the following matters in respect of which Air Commodore changed his testimony: (a) why the timing of radio transmissions at the time of a range breach by F/Lt Riley differ by seven seconds from the report of the Accident Investigation Team headed by Wing Commander Kindler; (b) was a breach of Range Standing Orders committed by F/Lt Riley; (c) why was there not a Range Safety Officer allocated to the supervision of firing at the time of the loss of A3-40; (d) did F/Lt Riley make an illegal call during a four second lapse in the response time, and if so, why was this not reported in either the reports of the Accident Investigation Team or the BOI; (e) why did the President of the BOI ask questions of the two civil pilots involved in the incident by letter only and not under oath as directed by the Convenor; (f) why did the President of the BOI fail to question the civil pilots about the range breach and their late response to it; (g) why, when evidence in writing was given by F/Lt McCormack that he fired his guns while on the Firing Detail, does the RAAF maintain that no guns were fired; (h) why was no proper accounting of returned ammunition ever produced by the RAAF; and (i) what evidence is there that F/Lt Riley was in the position that he claimed. (4) Was Disciplinary action taken against Air Commodore Ford when he changed his testimony before the Federal Court; if so, what action was taken; if not, why not. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Mirage accident has been the subject of an Accident Investigation; Board of Inquiry; Coronial Inquest; Ombudsman Investigation; Review of Structural Management Practices; Senator the Hon Peter Durack, QC Review; Defence Science and Technology Organisation Aeronautical Maritime Research Laboratory Structural Integrity Review; and Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The matter has also been the subject of a considerable number of Freedom of Information requests. Any further investigation would be nugatory in consideration of time passed and the lack of any additional verifiable evidence. (2) A review of the content of the AAT indicates that former Air Commodore Ford was confused as to his recollections of events following the Mirage accident in 1986 and the existence of the gun camera film exposed on the day of the accident and its numerous inquiries, investigations and reviews. The AAT found this to be understandable in consideration of being asked to provide information in 1998 about events that occurred 12 years earlier. Air Commodore Ford agreed that he had made errors when talking with the Defence Force Ombudsman and the AAT, having considered his evidence, it was found that his evidence should be treated as unreliable and given little weight. It should be noted that Air Commodore Ford was never questioned before a Federal Court, therefore, he could not have changed his testimony before one. (3) No. It is not necessary, as Air Commodore Ford did not change his testimony. He answered all questions with what he felt was the truth at the time, which was later found to be unreliable and not regarded. (a) No. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which sat four times during 1998 and made its final determination in 1999, was conducted to determine if Defence had done all in its power to locate missing audiotapes. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal was satisfied that that it was more than likely than not that the original audio tapes no longer exist and thus any reason for a seven second difference in timing within the tapes could never be established. Plausible reasons for the difference in timing have been considered, including that of playback on different recorders. The assertion that Flight Lieutenant Riley made a range breach is incorrect and inappropriate. (b) No. (c) There was a Range Safety Officer present during this mission. Mass and Sortie briefings for air-to-air Gunnery activities are very specific that the ‘Formation Lead’ is the Range Safety Officer. The aircraft towing the air-to-air banner also has Range Safety Officer responsibilities inherent with its role. (d) No. The timings of calls made by members of the formation was not regarded as pertinent to the accident investigation. (e) It would take an inordinate amount of time and resources to research and respond to this question due to the passage of time. (f) It would take an inordinate amount of time and resources to research and respond to this question due to the passage of time. (g) In the context of an extensive departmental Freedom of Information (FOI) search in 1999 for alleged gun camera cine film, Flight Lieutenant McCormack made comment in an e-mail message from overseas that he recollected having fired his guns. In his report to the Director of FOI at the time, the then Deputy Chief of Air Force made comment that irrespective of whether of not Flight Lieutenant McCormack fired his guns during the 2 May 1986 exercise, ‘on balance, the McCormack statement is not supported by extensive and thorough records searches undertaken by the Air Force’. (h) It would take an inordinate amount of time and resources to research and respond to the question due to the passage of time. (i) Evidence taken by the Accident Investigation Team and the Board of Inquiry would show that Flight Lieutenant Riley was where he claimed. There is no evidence to suggest that Flight Lieutenant Riley was in any other position. (4) As stated in answer to part 2, Air Commodore Ford was never questioned in front of a Federal Court, therefore, it was assumed that this question refers to his appearance before the AAT. No disciplinary action was taken against him. Also, as stated in answer to part 3, he did not intentionally answer any question with other than what he felt was the truth at the time. Air Commodore Ford is no longer a member of the Royal Australian Air Force. Prospect Electorate: Funding (Question No. 2041) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 19 June 2003: (1) How many centres and/or agencies in the electorate of Prospect, which provide services to people with drug and alcohol problems, have received federal funding in 2002/03. (2) Can the Minister name these centres and/or agencies and the nature of the services that they provide. the honourable member’s question: (1) There are no federally funded drug and alcohol centres/agencies in the electorate of Prospect. (2) Not Applicable. Veterans: Entitlements (Question No. 2048) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 19 June 2003: (1) Has he seen a letter from Mr Tim McCombe, President of the Vietnam Veterans’ Federation, dated 19 May 2003. (2) Will he support the benchmarking of the Totally& Permanently Incapacitated (TPI) Pension to average earnings and regularly increase it in line with either (a) the increase in average weekly earnings or (b) the cost of living, whichever is greater; if so, when; if not, why not. (3) Will he support a moderate increase of the TPI Pension before benchmarking it so as to make up for the shortfall caused by the decreasing real value of the TPI pension; if not, why not. (4) Can he confirm that both (a) a moderate increase in the TPI Pension and (b) the benchmarking of the TPI Pension were identified by the Clarke Committee as necessary to give TPI families a decent standard of living; if not, why not. (2) The Government established an independent Committee in February 2002 to conduct a review of veterans’ entitlements. The Clarke Review considered, among other things, proposals to benchmark the TPI pension and index it to either (a) the increase in male total average weekly earnings (MTAWE) or (b) the consumer price index. The Clarke Review has made 109 recommendations. The Government is considering the Review’s recommendations and the views of ex-service organisations and ex-service men and women before determining its response. (3) The Government will consider any proposal to change the TPI pension in the context of its response to the Clarke Review. (4) The Clarke Review is a matter of public record. Defence Properties: Sale or Disposal (Question No. 2049) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 23 June 2003: (1) Was correspondence received by (a) his office or (b) his department, dated 17 November 1999 from the NSW Parks& Wildlife Service (NPWS) expressing an interest in Gan Gan Army Camp should it be disposed of; if so, what action was taken to note that interest in acquiring the Gan Gan Army Camp. (2) Has any correspondence been received by (a) his office, (b) his department, or (c) consultants, in respect of preparing a flora and fauna assessment on Gan Gan Army Camp; if so, (i) what are the details and (ii) did this correspondence signal an intention for the land to be acquired by the NPWS for inclusion as part of the Tommaree National Park; if so, what action was taken.",183,Questions On Notice

189,(1) My Office Received Mr Mccombe’s Letter Dated 19 May 2003 And Responded On 18 June 2003.,"(3) Were any requests received, at any time, for priority sale or acquisition of Gan Gan Army Camp made by any department of the NSW Government prior to the public tender being issued or during the tender process. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (a) No. (b) Yes. The Department received a letter from the NSW Parks& Wildlife Service (NPWS), dated 17 November 1999. The NPWS letter noted a strong interest in the protection of the vegetated lands of Gan Gan Army Camp and urged the Commonwealth to see that the greater portion of the land be set aside for conservation. Acquisition of the site was not mentioned in the NPWS letter. A response was sent to NPWS on 10 December 1999 advising the Commonwealth Government’s policy for the disposal of surplus property was on the open market at full market value. The provision for a priority sale to State or Local government was also identified. Further, NPWS were advised that when an environmental consultant was engaged to undertake an assessment of the property, they would meet with NPWS representatives to discuss the property. (2) (a) No. (b) Yes. In preparing a flora and fauna assessment on the Gan Gan Army Camp Defence engaged the services of consultants GHD Pty Ltd. (c) Yes. (i) In preparing their report GHD corresponded with the Port Stephens Council, Planning NSW, Coastal Council of NSW, Department of Land and Water Conservation, Department of Mineral Resources, National Parks and Wildlife Services, Environment Protection Authority, Roads and Traffic Authority, Hunter Area and Health Service, Environment Australia, Hunter Water Corporation, Energy Australia and Telstra. In their report, GHD advised that no response was received from Planning NSW, Hunter Area Health Service and Environment Australia. (ii) None of the respondents to the GHD correspondence indicated an intention to acquire the Gan Gan Army Camp. The NPWS response dated 7 March 2003 noted a “long standing interest in the Gan Gan Army Camp land...” and that “the inclusion of these areas as part of the reserve system would be a sensible and rational approach for the use of these lands.” Copies of correspondence received were included in the GHD report made available to the public, via CD, during the tendering process. (3) No. Health: Chemicals Evaluation (Question No. 2054) Mr Organ asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 23 June 2003: (1) Can the Minister confirm that the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS) report for 2000-01, when that organisation was within the Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business portfolio, discloses that SHE Pacific Pty Ltd was commissioned to document the range of commercial evaluation practices for new industrial chemicals in Australia at a total cost of $60,754. (2) Is it also the case that SHE Pacific Pty Ltd did not complete this work; if so, why was it paid $60,754 for work which was not completed. the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. This information also appeared in the Annual Report of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC) for 2000-01, as NOHSC commissioned the contract on behalf of National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS). (2) The NICNAS Annual Report for 2000-01 reports the total value of the contract. A payment of $15,188.50 was made under the terms of the contract for initial survey work that was completed and handed over to NICNAS. The contract was subsequently terminated and no further payments were made to SHE Pacific Pty Ltd. Defence: Optometric Services (Question No. 2061) Mr Ripoll asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 24 June 2003: (1) Can the Minister confirm that in 2002-2003 the provision of eye care and optometric services for the RAAF Base Amberley personnel was tendered out. (2) Was the incumbent provider of eye care and optometric services to the RAAF Base Amberley personnel, “Goss Ingram Optometrists’ EYE CAREPLUS” informed that these services were to be tendered out. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. During 2002-2003 Deeds of Standing Offer for the provision of eye care and optometric services to eligible Defence personnel were entered into with service providers in all States and Territories except Victoria. This included provision of these services to RAAF Base Amberley personnel. (2) No. The Request for Tender for the Provision of Optometry and Optical Services was advertised in the national press and Australian Optometry News during January and February 2002. I understand that Goss Ingram Optometrists’ EYECAREPLUS was not otherwise informed of the calling of tenders. Fuel: Petroleum Production (Question No. 2063) Mr Murphy asked the Acting Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 24 June 2003: (1) Can he provide an estimate for when Australian petroleum production will fall short of demand; if so, how confident is he that his estimate is correct; if not, why not. (2) Can he provide an estimate for when world petroleum production will fall short of demand; if so, how confident is he that this estimate is correct; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Australian petroleum production already falls short of demand. In 2002-03, the shortfall of production over demand was 2,367.5 megalitres. It should be noted that because of geography and composition of Australian oil, a large proportion of domestic consumption is met by imported feedstock while, at the same time, a large proportion of Australian production is exported. In general, Australian crudes tend to attract higher prices than the cheaper alternatives. Around sixty per cent of the higher quality Australian crude oil is exported, while cheaper crudes are imported for used in Australian refineries.",186,Questions On Notice

191,Mr Hockey,"The Acting Minister for the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources(2) Current estimates vary from thirty years (International Energy Agency) to more than forty years (World Energy Council). The ability of world petroleum production to continue to be able to satisfy demand will be driven by: The rate at which demand increases The uptake of unconventional production from sources such as shale oil and gas to liquids The development of new and/or more efficient extraction technologies The development of more efficient fuel usage technologies New discoveries The price of oil, which will drive all of the above variables Immigration: Detention Centres (Question No. 2073) Mr Windsor asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 25 June 2003: (1) Can he explain his ministerial duty of care for children held in detention. (2) In fulfilling this obligation, (a) with which State authorities is he or his department working, and (b) how is his responsibility to protect children divided between State agencies and organisations under his direct or indirect control. (3) Can he explain the Government’s policy on dealing with allegations of abuse of children in detention. (4) What is the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs’ definition of child abuse in this policy. (5) For each migration detention centre, how many allegations of abuse of children in detention have been made for each of the past five years. (6) In respect of each allegation, (a) what was the nature of the allegation, (b) was it substantiated, and (c) how did the department respond. (1) The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA), and its officers, have a general duty of care to all persons, adults and children, detained under the Migration Act 1958 (the Migration Act). comprehensive framework consisting of legislative and administrative measures, detailed contractual obligations with a Detention Services Provider (DSP), the Immigration Detention Standards (IDS) and a performance monitoring regime. In general, all children in detention remain in the custody of their accompanying parent or parents. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs also has a specific duty to unaccompanied minors who are his or her wards under the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 (the IGOC Act). Under the IGOC Act, the Minister, as legal guardian of children who enter Australia unaccompanied by a parent or another adult carer, has the rights and powers which a parent may have over his or her own child. The IGOC Act also empowers the Minister to delegate these guardianship powers and functions to any officer or authority of the Commonwealth or any state or territory. The Minister has delegated",188,Questions On Notice
192,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:most of the powers and functions under the IGOC Act to DIMIA Managers and Deputy Managers in each detention facility, and to state or territory agencies responsible for child welfare. (2) In fulfilling this obligation: (a) DIMIA works with a number of agencies in relevant states including those responsible for child welfare, education, health and criminal law. For example, DIMIA liaises with the relevant state education agencies to ensure access to government educational services for detainee children. (b) Various pieces of state legislation have effect in the detention environment, to the extent that this legislation is not inconsistent with Commonwealth legislation. State legislation relevant to children in detention is broadly that relating to welfare, education, health and criminal law. State agencies have access to Immigration Detention Facilities (IDFs), to the extent necessary to fulfil their statutory responsibilities, and DIMIA officers consult as appropriate with those agencies. The involvement of relevant authorities in no way diminishes DIMIA’s duty of care. Rather, these services strengthen the Commonwealth’s ability to meet its responsibilities, particularly in the case of children in detention, by ensuring that decisions take account of all relevant information and advice from experts in that field. Most states have a legislative framework which requires certain people dealing with children to make a notification or report if they suspect that a child is at risk of abuse or neglect. These people are known as ‘mandated notifiers’. In all states, IDF staff are required to act as if they were mandated notifiers, whether or not it is required under the State’s child protection legislation. Residential Housing Project such as that at Woomera. This delegated power ensures that DIMIA officers have appropriate legal authority to make decisions concerning the welfare and care of IGOC Act children while they are in IDFs. These officers draw upon the advice of people with expertise in child welfare such as psychologists and state and territory child welfare authorities. The situation in relation to the Minister’s delegations to state child welfare agencies varies from state to state. The Minister has written to all state child welfare Ministers proposing that their IGOC Act delegations be amended so that their agencies formally take responsibility for such children only once they have been moved out of an IDF. As at August 2003, officers of certain state and territory child welfare agencies have delegated responsibility only once IGOC Act children are moved out of an IDF, while others have delegated responsibility in relation to all IGOC Act children in the state or territory. Certain officers of the child welfare agencies in the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia have delegated responsibility for IGOC Act children when: they are in immigration detention in alternative detention arrangements made between DIMIA and the relevant state or territory governments (such as foster care); or they are not in immigration detention. Delegations of officers of child welfare agencies in New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Victoria include guardianship responsibility for all IGOC Act children, including those in IDFs. In practice, however, officers from these agencies usually exercise the delegated responsibilities for these children only when they are no longer in an IDF. (3) DIMIA and the DSP have in place a comprehensive range of policies and practices which aims to ensure the safety and protection of all children in immigration detention. These policies and practices operate within a legislative framework that includes both the Migration Act and state child welfare legislation. The development of Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with state child welfare authorities in relation to this matter is a priority for DIMIA. Such an MOU with the South Australian Department of Human Services was signed on 6 December 2001. The finalisation of MOUs with state child welfare authorities in New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia is being actively pursued. that all incidents, allegations or reasonable suspicions of abuse or assault of children are reported, both to the local child welfare agencies and, under the detention services contract, to DIMIA. In most states, the child welfare agency will then decide if other parties, such as the police, need to be involved. In cases of alleged abuse, DIMIA also requires the DSP to ensure appropriate professional counselling is given to both the alleged victim and alleged perpetrator. A plan for the ongoing management of the people involved in the alleged incident is required, including consideration of transferring either party to another area within the IDF or to another IDF. The DSP also has procedural guidelines in place for its staff. These guidelines include information on dealing appropriately with assault, sexual assault, serious medical incidents and child protection. The DSP’s policies take account of, and are appropriately tailored to each state’s child welfare arrangements. As part of the contract management arrangements, DIMIA reviews the DSP’s training programs to ensure that these cover the State legislation and DIMIA’s requirements regarding the reporting of allegations or reasonable suspicions of abuse or assault of children. (4) The definition of child abuse is a matter for the relevant State child welfare authorities. In practice, may be concern for the welfare of children, including the appropriateness of care arrangements, instances where parental behaviour requires intervention, and instances where medical conditions require assessment, as well as alleged or actual incidents of sexual or physical assault. (5) Information compiled for the period 1 October 1999 to 30 November 2000 was included in the Report of Inquiry into Immigration Detention Procedures by Philip Flood AO, tabled in parliament on 27 February 2001. Relevant information within that report is: 1.1 Terms of Reference, 1.3 Widest possible meaning of the term ‘abuse’, 6.3 Incidents assessed as meeting the Terms of Reference, 6.6 Table5 – Cases Examined1 December 1999 to 30 November 2000;and AnnexG Summary of Australasian Correctional Management incident reports by centre. Following on from the period covered in this Report, TableA below provides the number of notifications to relevant state government agencies for the period 1 December 2000 to 19 May 2003 for each IDF. (6) To answer this question fully in relation to each individual allegation would involve a manual examination of each detainee’s file. This would be a substantial and unreasonable diversion of the agency’s resources from its normal operations. In general: (a) The broad categories of the nature of the incidents have been provided in Table A. (b) For the period 1 December 2000 to 19 May 2003, DIMIA can advise that relevant state police have issued cautions on six occasions and charges have been laid on one occasion. (c) All incidents of concern involving children are dealt with promptly. Each case concerning the safety of a child is dealt with on an individual basis. DIMIA officers and DSP staff are required to notify the relevant child welfare agencies of any instances involving minors where there is concern for the minor.

Defence Properties: Sale or Disposal (Question No. 2078) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 25 June 2003: (1) In 1955, did the NSW Government transfer the land formerly known as Gan Gan Army Camp in the electoral division of Paterson to the Commonwealth; if so, what price was paid. (2) Has the Commonwealth now sold the land; if so, (a) at what price, (b) to whom, and (c) has the real property title transaction reached settlement. (3) Was there a tender process and what are the details including time-frame of that tender offer. (4) Did Port Stephens Shire Council offer to purchase the land; if so, what was its intended purpose for the land. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Advice from Defence’s legal representative on this matter, Phillips Fox, is that the survey plan for Primary Application 40695 was dated August 1954, but the certificate of title, the Torrens title, was not issued until 14 May 1959. The title is clear that there are no restrictions or qualifications to disposal. Phillips Fox advise that there is no clear audit trail on the documentation surrounding the transfer or sale. Searches to date have not identified a sale price. Phillips Fox advise that further searches would take considerable time, incur considerable expense and that an anticipated completion date could not be provided. (2) Yes. (a) The sale price is Commercial-In-Confidence until the title transfer has been registered. (b) Details of the purchaser are currently Commercial-In-Confidence until the title transfer has been registered. (c) Legal settlement took place on Friday 27 June 2003. The transfer has not yet been registered and this could take more than three months. Until registration occurs the details are not in the public domain. (3) Yes. Advertising commenced on 29 March 2003. Various newspapers were utilised including the Newcastle Herald, The Post, and the Sydney Morning Herald. Tenders were originally scheduled to close on 3.00pm 19 May 2003, but this was subsequently extended until 2.00pm 30 May 2003. (4) Yes. Port Stephens Council made an application for priority sale consideration on 18 January 2002. In the Council submission the reason for acquisition is quoted as “...for the enjoyment of the broader community...”. Council did not identify a proposed future use for the site. The Council submission had significant deficiencies and Council was requested to revise and resubmit their submission on 8 April 2002. Despite a number of requests to do so, Council did not revise or resubmit their priority sale submission and on 4 October 2002 Council were formally advised that their priority sale consideration was withdrawn and that the site would be sold on the open market. Health: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Machines (Question No. 2079) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 25 June 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1503 (Hansard, 14 May 2003, page 14574), which public hospitals in Australian are equipped with an Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) unit but do not provide Medicare eligible MRI services. (2) What was the outcome of the recent negotiations between the Department of Health and Ageing and the Diagnostic Imaging (DI) profession. (3) Will Concord Repatriation General Hospital be granted a licence to operate a Medicare eligible MRI unit; if so, when, if not, why not. the honourable member’s question: (1) The Commonwealth does not have a comprehensive list of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) units that are not eligible for Medicare rebates, nor does it have reliable information on ineligible units in public hospitals. (2) The outcome of the recent negotiations between the Department of Health and Ageing and the Diagnostic Imaging profession was that a new Radiology Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was finalised and took effect on 1 July 2003. Key features of this MoU are that it provides for: Medicare funded MRI to be fully managed under the MoU; and collaborative work with the Radiology profession to improve access to MRI. (3) It is not possible to indicate when, or if, the MRI services provided at Concord Repatriation General Hospital will be eligible for Medicare rebates. The Government will work collaboratively with the Radiology profession under the new Radiology MoU to identify future priorities for MRI.",189,Questions On Notice

Health: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Machines (Question No. 2080) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 25 June 2003: (1) Further to part (7) of the answer to question No. 884 (Hansard, 22 October 2002, page 8402), who are the members of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Monitoring and Evaluation Group (MEG). (2) When did the MEG last meet and when did it last report to the Minister for Health and Ageing. (3) On what dates has the MEG met since March 2000. (4) What advice in relation to MRI services in Sydney has the MEG provided the Minister for Health& Ageing since March 2000. the honourable member’s question: (1) The Chair of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Monitoring and Evaluation Group (MEG) is Professor John Blandford. In the past, the MEG has included the following expertise: a health economist; an official from the Department of Health and Ageing; a radiology expert; a State and Territory health official from the Australian Health Minister’s Advisory Council; an official from the Health Insurance Commission; and a consumer. The MEG is currently being reconstituted in line with relevant provisions of the new Radiology Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and the membership of the Group is still to be finalised. (2) 5 July 2002. (3) The Department has been advising the Minister on an ongoing basis about a range of issues regarding MRI units, including MEG advice and progress with negotiations on the new funding agreement which is now in place. However in light of the need to negotiate with the radiology profession the new funding agreements which were signed in June 2003, the last meeting of the MEG was in July 2002. The MEG has also met on the following dates since March 2000: 11 June 2002; 20 March 2002; 16 November 2001; 17 August 2001; 31 May 2001; 4 April 2001; 15 March 2001; 9 March 2001; 2 March 2001; 12 February 2001; and 12 December 2000.",193,Questions On Notice
194,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to(4) The specific advice of the MEG is strictly confidential. However, broadly speaking, previous advice has indicated that access to Medicare funded MRI in metropolitan Sydney is above the national average and that this area is therefore not the highest relative priority for additional services. Health: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Machines (Question No. 2081) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 25 June 2003: (1) Can the Minister confirm that (a) the Blandford Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Review of March 2000 recommended an increase of seven Medicare eligible units in the year commencing July 2000, and (b) the Government approved six additional Medicare eligible units in September 2001. (2) Will the Minister consider providing an MRI licence for MRI units at all tertiary hospitals, including Concord Repatriation General Hospital; if so, when, if not, why not. the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) The Review of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) recommended an increase of up to seven additional Medicare eligible MRI units in the year following the release of the report of the Review. (b) I can confirm that six additional Medicare eligible units were approved as a result of a tender process completed in 2001. (2) Medicare eligibility is not necessary for MRI units to be established at tertiary hospitals, such as Concord Repatriation General Hospital. State and Territory Governments are responsible for ensuring access to MRI for patients admitted to public hospitals and are able to provide MRI units in these hospitals using their own revenue or using grants provided by the Commonwealth for hospital care. Medicare eligibility would not assist in providing services for such patients, as Medicare rebates are not payable to patients admitted to public hospitals. Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (Question No. 2082) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 25 June 2003: Further to the answer to question No. 1077 (Hansard, 4 February 2003, page 10815), has the Department of Health and Ageing found a basis for providing the diabetic drugs Avandia and Actos on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) while containing the budgetary risk to the Commonwealth; if so, (a) what are the details of this agreement and (b) when will Avandia and Actos be included on the PBS; if not, why not the honourable member’s question: (a) At this stage, a basis for providing the diabetic drugs AVANDIA and ACTOS on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) has not been finalised. Once a drug has been recommended for listing on the PBS by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), other processes need to be completed before the product can be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. These include pricing negotiations with the manufacturer, fi-",194,Questions On Notice

Employment: Intensive Assistance (Question No. 2093) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 25 June 2003: (1) For each year from 1998 to 2003, how many persons in each of the following post codes (a) 3023, (b) 3037, (c) 3337, (d) 3341, (e) 3429, (f) 3432, (g) 3435, (h) 3440, (i) 3444, (j) 3522, (k) 3764, (l) 3024, (m) 3063, (n) 3338, (o) 3427, (p) 3430, (q) 3433, (r) 3437, (s) 3441, (t) 3446, (u) 3756, (v) 3029, (w) 3335, (x) 3340, (y) 3428, (z) 3431, (aa) 3434, (ab) 3438, (ac) 3442, (ad) 3458 and (ae) 3762 have qualified for Intensive Assistance. (2) Of those who have received Intensive Assistance, how many are now (a) in full-time employment and (b) in part-time or casual employment. (1) Table1 details the number of jobseekers residing in each of the specified postcode areas that commenced in Intensive Assistance in each year from 1998 to 2003. The numbers of commencements for 2003 are considerably lower than for other years as all Intensive Assistance commencement activity ceased on 13 June 2003 prior to the introduction of the new Employment Services contracts on 1 July 2003 (i.e. the data for 2003 is for a part-year only). (2) Table2 shows the proportion of job seekers that were in employment three months after exiting Intensive Assistance, based on data from the Department’s Post Programme Monitoring survey. The data are not disaggregated to the individual postcode level as the estimates would be unreliable due to small numbers. Table2 also shows the proportion of outcomes that relate to full time and part time employment as well as showing the proportion of positions that are temporary, casual or seasonal (these jobs can be full-time or part-time).

Health: Therapeutic Goods Administration (Question No. 2102) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 26 June 2003: (1) Is the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) required to cover its operating costs entirely from the licence, inspection and registration fees it charges. (2) Is it the case that the TGA compliance branch employs only 11 auditors nationally; if not, (a) how many does it employ, and (b) does the TGA propose to increase that number. (3) Is the TGA compliance branch well behind in its audit program; if so, (a) how far behind is the TGA in its audit program, and (b) does this leave open the possibility of further manufacturing standard failures as recently experienced with Pan Pharmaceuticals; if not, why not.",196,Questions On Notice
198,Mr Brough,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,198,Questions On Notice
199,Mr Abbott,"The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the hon(4) Has the delay in the audit program been exacerbated by the adoption in August 2002 of a new industry code of practice requiring a longer audit process; if so, has the TGA received additional resources to allow it to administer the new code and, if it has not, why not. (5) How quickly is the TGA responding to manufacturers’ replies to audit reports. the honourable member’s question: (1) Since the 1998-1999 financial year, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has been a full cost recovery agency for all activities that fall within the scope of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. This includes regulation of the therapeutic goods industry, the TGA’s public health responsibilities, the provision of information to consumers and TGA’s support for industry generally (ie. facilitation of exports and international harmonisation of standards). The fees and charges levied by the TGA include those for the listing and registration of therapeutic goods on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG), as well as the audit and licensing of Australian manufacturers and certification of overseas manufacturers wishing to supply therapeutic goods in Australia. (2) (a) and (b) The TGA has an auditor pool of 44 officers, comprising fourteen (14) lead quality systems auditors and thirty (30) technical specialists to carry out audits of manufacturers of therapeutic goods supplied in Australia. Lead auditors are located in the Manufacturer Assessment Section of the Office of Devices, Blood and Tissues of the TGA in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney. The TGA no longer has a Compliance Branch. Technical specialists are utilised where additional expertise is required at a particular audit. This expertise covers areas such as analytical chemistry, microbiology/virology, biotechnology, biomaterials, engineering and computer systems. The TGA, in recognising the need to maintain an effective strategy of scheduling audits according to risk, is in the process of recruiting an additional four (4) lead auditors and training an additional eleven (11) specialist auditors. In addition, non-auditing staff are being recruited to carry out the assessment of evidence for overseas manufacturers wishing to supply therapeutic goods to Australia, thus relieving lead auditors of this task and allowing them to focus on auditing alone. (3) (a) & (b) The TGA audit schedule is drawn up annually based upon manufacturer risk assessment and the available resources. At this stage the TGA has completed 41 per cent of audits of Australian and overseas manufacturers included on the 2003 schedule. It is expected the program will be satisfactorily completed with the engagement of the additional resources envisaged in (2) above. The risk management approach to the scheduling of audits gives high priority to auditing those manufacturers with a high-risk profile. The risk factors taken into account include: type of products manufactured; results of previous Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) audit; significant changes within the company, eg changes to key personnel, building, equipment or products; adverse medicine reaction reports, medicine problem reports and device incident reports; results of TGA Laboratories testing of random or targeted samples of products; recalls of products not meeting safety and /or quality standards; information from other agencies; and post-licensing surveillance investigations.",198,Questions On Notice
200,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer toThe TGA uses the above information when scheduling audits and selects the most appropriate audit strategy, which may include an unscheduled audit. This approach is designed to more readily detect failures in compliance with manufacturing standards. The TGA’s risk management audit strategy has been recognised as world leading by international organisations. (4) The content and principles of the Australian Code of GMP for Medicinal Products (August 2002) are very similar to the previous Australian Code of GMP for Medicinal Products (1990) other than for two additional requirements relating to marketing authorisation. These additional provisions require auditors to check that the product formulation matches that registered/listed with the TGA and that manufacturers validate their manufacturing and analytical processes and procedures. Although these are new requirements, they were always investigated during TGA audits under the old Code of GMP because of their importance in assuring product quality. Consequently, there has been no significant change to the length of the audit process and no adverse impact on audit waiting times or resourcing requirements. (5) The TGA has maintained its usual standard operating procedure approach of responding within a target time frame of one month to manufacturers' replies to audit reports. There has not been an increase in target time in the last ten years. Education: Higher Education Contribution Scheme Contributions (Question No. 2109) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, upon notice, on 26 June 2003: (1) Has he seen an article by Professor Peter Karmel from the Australian National University titled “Student contribution bigger than predicted” published in The Australian on 18 June 2003. (2) Is it the case that the average student share of the cost of HECS-liable courses in 2005 is expected to be almost 40 per cent – a great deal higher than the 26.8 per cent described as the average student contribution towards the cost of their education on page 21 of the ministerial statement Our Universities – Backing Australia’s Future. (3) Is there a higher average student cost burden in any other OECD country in respect of publicly funded higher education institutions; if so, which countries and what are the average student burdens in each country. (1) Yes. (2) No. The 40 per cent figure used by Professor Karmel does not appear to take into account the Commonwealth subsidies involved in HECS. To calculate the average actual student contribution, the following subsidies need to be taken into account: 25% discount for upfront payers; 15% bonus for voluntary repayments; debt write downs due to death of the debtor; remission of HECS debts in special circumstances; and provision for doubtful debt. On this basis, the Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) has estimated the average actual student contribution to be 26.8 per cent in 2005 of total Commonwealth funding to universities.

(2) Which body authorises the trials of vitamin D3/Lipidiol for the treatment of liver cancer in Australian hospitals and which hospitals are currently involved in trials of vitamin D3/Lipidiol for liver cancer treatment. (3) Is there an obligation for such trials to comply with guidelines established by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC); if not, why not; if so, who is responsible for ensuring compliance with these guidelines. (4) Is there a regime of full disclosure of potential side effects and risks involved in patient participation in the trials of vitamin D3/Lipidiol treatment for liver cancer; if so, who is responsible for such disclosure to patients. (5) Is it conceivable that a patient could be part of a trial of vitamin D3/Lipidiol even though they had failed to meet all the specific selection criteria for the trial; if so, who would be held responsible for such a situation. (6) Do protocols exist for the monitoring and evaluation of the trials of vitamin D3/Lipidiol in the treatment of liver cancer; if so, (a) who determines the protocols; (b) where can they be accessed, and (c) are such protocols standard throughout the hospital system. (7) What avenues are open to the families of patients involved in trials should they wish to pursue specific concerns and complaints and which body is responsible for dealing with such concerns and complaints. (8) If the TGA authorised the use of vitamin D3/Lipidiol in trials for the treatment of liver cancer, is it in a position to provide some public assessment of the efficacy of these trials; if so, what is that assessment; if not, why not. the honourable member’s question: (1) Trials for the use of vitamin D3 in the treatment of liver cancer were notified to the TGA via the Clinical Trial Notification (CTN) Scheme in 1998 and 2002. Under the CTN Scheme TGA approval is not required for a trial to commence. (2) There are two systems for clinical trials using unapproved medicines in Australia. The liver trials were notified to the TGA under the CTN Scheme, whereby a trial is reviewed by a Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) and certain undertakings about compliance with international Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) National Statement on Ethical Conduct of Research Involving Humans are obtained from the institution, the investigator, the trial sponsor and the HREC. Under the CTN Scheme the HREC is the authorising body. There is an alternate approval system based on TGA review of summary data, which is rarely used. Only one hospital is currently involved in trials as discussed in (1), but the identity of the hospital would be regarded as commercial-in-confidence. (3) Yes. This is required as a condition of the exemption that allows the trial to use an unregistered good. The HREC is obliged to monitor this and the TGA has the power to seek information and to inspect sites to monitor that this is happening.",200,Questions On Notice
202,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to(4) It is a requirement under both the NHMRC National Statement and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines, that apply to all clinical trials operating under the therapeutic goods legislation, that all clinical trial subjects provide fully informed consent. The process of obtaining this should involve a full discussion of the potential risks and benefits of the treatment. Patient information forms are also usually provided. Consent information and documentation would be reviewed by the HREC as part of its approval and consent is usually obtained from subjects by the investigator. (5) The protocol that is approved by the HREC outlines the inclusion and exclusion criteria that must apply for the trial. Enrolment of patients outside these criteria should not occur. In the unlikely event this occurred, the recruiting investigator would be responsible for notifying the HREC and sponsor. (6) In order to comply with compulsory Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the NHMRC National Statement, any trials for the treatment of liver cancer should have a protocol that would include information on monitoring and evaluation. (a) Protocols are assessed for their adequacy as part of the HREC review. (b) While sometimes they may be provided to the public by the sponsor on request, they are regarded as commercial-in-confidence by many sponsors. (c) There are common features relating to all protocols in terms of the need to define inclusion and exclusion criteria, treatment dosage and duration, monitoring of subjects, etc, but actual protocols differ depending on the particular circumstances of the trial. For example; the nature of the condition and the treatment under investigation. (7) Patients are given contact details of relevant trial personnel, usually the investigator and a local contact officer, when they are recruited into a trial. If they or their families have any concerns, these individuals are usually the first point of contact. The trial’s investigators are required to deal with any concerns or complaints. Other points of contact would be the institution, the sponsor, the HREC, the NHMRC and the TGA. (8) As these trials were conducted via the CTN scheme, no TGA “authorisation” was involved. As explained above, the TGA was only “notified” of the trials. There is no requirement for the TGA to be provided with the trial results, unless they form part of a registration dossier in the future. The HREC, however, should receive information on trial progress and results, as part of its monitoring. Iraq (Question No. 2129) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 26 June 2003: (1) Can he advise precisely which articles Australia is bound by under international law as an Occupying Power in Iraq. (2) Can he explain the system that the Government has put in place to ensure that Australia’s international obligations under the Geneva Convention are being met, including (a) who oversees that system, (b) who is physically making that assessment across Iraq, (c) where is that person or persons located and how often are they reporting, and (d) how many staff are working on that program. (3) What is the Government’s assessment (including that of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) of Australia’s success as an Occupying Power at ensuring the maintenance of law and order, health and medical facilities, and education.

(5) Can he advise what action Australia has undertaken with the other Occupying Powers to ensure that areas of non-performance are addressed. (6) Can he advise what are the international legal sanctions that Australia would face if it does not discharge its duties as an Occupying Power effectively. (7) How many Occupying Powers are there now in Iraq. (8) Will he explain how the relationship between the Occupying Powers and the transitional authority established to discharge the responsibilities of the Occupying Powers works, both procedurally and on what legal basis there is for this relationship. (9) Is Australia an equal power under international law in this transitional authority. (10) How is the transitional authority structured, in particular, (a) where do Australian officials fit within this structure, (b) what is their role within this structure, and (c) what responsibilities are they discharging on behalf of Australia. (11) Can he advise whether a timeline is envisaged, either by the transitional authority or by the Australian Government, for an act of political self-determination to be expressed by the Iraqi people and what Australia is doing to facilitate this. (12) What is the total number estimated by (1) the USA and (2) the UK of (a) Iraqi and (b) Coalition (i) military and (ii) civilian fatalities arising from the Iraq conflict. (13) Are these estimates publicly available; if not, why not. (14) Is he able to say how many seriously injured people are in Iraqi hospitals; if not, why not. (15) Is he or his department aware of concerns expressed by international NGO’s about the health and medical situation in Iraqi hospitals; if so, is he able to say whether assessments made by those international NGOs are reliable. (16) Can he indicate what chemical weapons have been located in Iraq. (17) Can he advise whether weapons inspectors have discovered chemical munitions, anthrax, bacterial growth media or VX nerve agent in Iraq. (18) Can he indicate what biological weapons have been located in Iraq. (19) Does he stand by his statement on 4 November 2002 that “...we know Iraq is still producing chemical and biological weapons, and has endeavoured to produce nuclear weapons”; if not, why not. (20) Can he advise whether there was any doubt expressed by the intelligence community in regards to Iraq’s Weapons’ of Mass Destruction (WMD) capability. (21) Can he advise whether his department expressed any doubts to him or other members of the Government, or had any reservations regarding, allegations of Iraq’s possession of WMD. (22) What is the cost borne by the Government to send Australian weapons inspectors to Iraq to participate in searches for Iraqi WMD. (23) How does this cost compare to the financial cost for Australia of the return of UNMOVIC and IAEA weapons inspectors to Iraq. (24) Has he or his department had discussions with the US Government on the possibility of returning UN weapons inspectors to Iraq; if so, did he argue for the recommitment of UN weapons inspectors to Iraq. (25) Has he had discussions with the Government of the United Kingdom on the possibility of returning UN weapons inspectors to Iraq; if so, did he argue for the recommitment of UN weapons inspectors to Iraq. (1) Australia is one member of a coalition of countries contributing human and other resources to the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) presently in occupation of Iraq. In United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1483 of 22 May 2003, only the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are named as Occupying Powers.",201,Questions On Notice
203,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows :Accordingly, these States have specific and special responsibilities and obligations under UNSCR 1483, the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Regulations. Australia is not named as an Occupying Power and thus does not bear the full burden of meeting these obligations. (2) The Government established a legal watch group comprising the General Counsel (International Law), Office of International Law in the Attorney-General’s Department, the Senior Legal Adviser of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Director-General of the Defence Legal Service, as well as experts in international law drawn from each of those Departments. The legal watch group advises on legal matters of relevance to Australia’s participation in the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). The group consults with its counterparts in the governments of the Occupying Powers in Iraq, namely the United States of America and the United Kingdom, to ensure that Australia’s international legal obligations are taken into account. In addition, Australia has assigned an experienced military lawyer to the Office of General Counsel in the CPA in Baghdad. The Australian Representative Office in Baghdad also conveys Australian views on legal and other matters directly to the CPA, and maintains regular contact with Australia’s representative in the CPA Office of General Counsel. Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel in Iraq are subject to Rules of Engagement which require compliance with applicable domestic and international law regarding their presence in Iraq. ADF members have received training in applicable law and Rules of Engagement as part of their force preparation prior to deployment. The Rules of Engagement are military orders enforced through the military chain of command. Other Australian officials in Iraq in an official capacity are issued with a booklet entitled “Operational Guidelines addressed to Australian Personnel Working in Post-Conflict Iraq”. The guidelines are designed to ensure that Australian personnel do not do anything that would violate Australia’s international obligations, or that might attract criminal responsibility under Australia’s Criminal Code. (3) Australia is not named as an Occupying Power in UN Security Council Resolution 1483 and thus does not bear the full burden of meeting the obligations of the Occupying Powers. Australia is, however, making a significant contribution to the efforts of a broad coalition of countries contributing to Iraq’s rehabilitation, focusing our assistance in the field of agriculture. The assistance that Australia has provided to help meet these needs is summarised in Table A. Table A: Australian humanitarian and reconstruction assistance (detailed breakdown) Recipient Amount (AUD) Initial Commitment UN Central Emergency Revolving Fund 6,000,000 ICRC 2,000,000 Australian NGOs, including CARE Australia and Australian Red Cross 2,000,000 Additional programs, personnel 2,000,000 Sub-Total 17,500,00 0 UN Flash Appeal Commitment 0 ICRC – water, sanitation, health, protection 7,500,000 UN agencies responsible for coordinating humanitarian activities and logistical 5,500,000 arrangements Recipient Amount (AUD) WFP – food distribution 3,000,000 WHO – disease prevention, water treatment 3,000,000 UN Mine Action Service 1,500,000 CARE Australia principally in the areas of water and sanitation and mine awareness 3,000,000 programs World Vision Australia principally in the areas of water and sanitation and 1,200,000 environmental health in primary schools Save the Children Australia support to eight paediatric hospitals across Iraq 800,000 Sub-Total 38,000,00 0 Other Humanitarian and Reconstruction Priorities Revitalise Iraq’s agriculture sector 40,000,00 0 Economic Policy, Water Supply and Sanitation 5,000,000 00 (4) and (5) While emergency and reconstruction needs are progressively being identified and addressed by the Coalition, Iraqi counterparts and international organisations, rehabilitation efforts are being hampered by ongoing security concerns, including targeted sabotage of infrastructure by supporters of the former regime. Significantly degraded infrastructure and chronic problems will also take time to address. Needs assessments are being undertaken by the CPA, United Nations and International Financial Institutions, which will provide a comprehensive picture of requirements for further assistance. These assessments will be finalised for presentation at the donors’ conference to be held in Madrid on 24 October 2003. Australia is maintaining an active dialogue on rehabilitation issues with CPA officials in Baghdad, and with the United States, the United Kingdom, UN agencies, and the International Financial Institutions. (6) As explained in the answer to question one, Australia is not named as an Occupying Power in Iraq in UN Security Council Resolution 1483. (7) See answer to question one. (8) The CPA is the entity established to discharge the obligations of the Occupying Powers in Iraq and to enable the participation of other States in the interim administration and development of Iraq, as well as the provision of humanitarian and technical assistance. The status of the CPA is supported by UN Security Council Resolution 1483 and is consistent with international law relating to the roles and responsibilities of an Occupying Power. (9) No. See also answer to question one. (10) See organisation chart on the following internet site: http://www.cpa-iraq.org/CPAorgchart.pdf. (a) 14 Australian experts are currently seconded to the CPA. They are working in the following fields: Agriculture Economic policy Water and sanitation Trade Oil policy General Counsel Coalition coordination arrangements Baghdad and South Central Regions (b) Australians are involved, inter alia, in: rehabilitating the agriculture sector and development of appropriate agriculture policy the 2003 and 2004 budget processes establishing a new salary structure for civil servants and implementing of salary payments to Iraqi civil servants water and sanitation issues, including the re-establishment of the responsible Ministry assisting the Ministry of Oil in dealing with a range of practical challenges in rehabilitating this sector working with the CPA Office of General Counsel on legal issues establishing the Council for International Coordination, which is the CPA’s main mechanism for coordinating among contributing countries, and with UN and other agencies involved in Iraq’s rehabilitation helping to manage Baghdad and regional areas. The CPA has obligations under the Geneva Convention and Hague Regulations to ensure the security and humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people following the conflict. Australia has made a strong commitment to Iraq’s rehabilitation. See also answers (a) and (b) above. (11) The Iraqi Governing Council was established on 13 July 2003. This is a significant step towards establishing a democratic Iraqi Government. The next stage will entail a process to develop a new constitution. The final stage will be the election of a sovereign Iraqi Government by the Iraqi people. The exact timeline for this process is a matter for the Iraqi Governing Council to determine. Refer also to the answers to questions three and ten. (12) and (13) The Government has not received such estimates of coalition or Iraqi fatalities. (14) The Government does not have such information. (15) See also the answer to question three. There are approximately 100 NGOs currently working in Iraq, a significant number of which are working in the health sector. The Government is not in a position to comment on the reliability of the assessments of all of these NGOs. However, AusAID is working with key UN agencies, including UNICEF and WHO, and the major international NGOs, namely CARE, International Committee of the Red Cross, Save the Children and World Vision which are implementing vital reconstruction activities in the health sector. AusAID has provided assistance to a number of these organisations to respond to health needs, as detailed in Attachment A. (16) (17) and (18) It would be premature to answer these questions prior to Coalition investigators completing their search for WMD in Iraq, but see also answer to question 19. (19) The Government is confident in the judgment that Iraq possessed a WMD capability in the lead-up to the war. Australian intelligence agencies are continuing to assess the scope and nature of that capability in the light of current investigations. (20) and (21) No doubts were expressed by the intelligence agencies or my department about whether Iraq had WMD capability. (22) This question should be directed to the Minister for Defence, whose department is co-ordinating the Australian contribution. (23) It is not possible to compare the cost directly. The cost of UNMOVIC and IAEA weapons inspectors is paid out of the UN and IAEA budgets respectively. Australia pays an annual assessed contribution to both of these organisations. (24) and (25) Australia believes that international organisations such as UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have a role to play in Iraq. Australia has conveyed this view to the US and UK Governments. However, the circumstances under which these organisations operated before the conflict with Iraq commenced have changed. This has been recognised by the UN Security Council in UNSCR 1483 which “underlines the intention of the Council to revisit their mandates”. The Australian Government favoured the early return of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to resume its safeguards responsibilities in Iraq in line with Iraq’s Non-Proliferation Treaty safeguards agreement. Australia made its position known in Washington. An IAEA team was despatched to the Iraqi nuclear research centre al-Tuwaitha and commenced inspections on 7 June. Health: Outer Metropolitan Doctors Scheme (Question No. 2132) Ms Hall asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 26 June 2003. In respect of the 75 doctors who are relocating to outer metropolitan areas under the Government’s program, can the Minister provide a list detailing where each of those doctors is relocating from and where each is relocating to. the honourable member’s question: As at 21 July 2003, 87 doctors had been approved to participate in the More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas Measure. Of this number, 64 had been approved to relocate and 23 were undertaking training placements in an outer metropolitan area. Provision of suburb level information for each relocating doctor could enable identification of individual doctors, and this is considered inappropriate for privacy reasons.

In the case of light industrial employment, this downturn can be attributed to a general decline in the manufacturing sector of the economy, a shift away from labour intensive manufacturing, and the general relocation of industry to greenfield sites in Western Sydney. In the case of commercial and retail employment, there has been a market shift from traditional local shopping centres to larger regional and sub-regional centres located outside the RCC area.

(3) Has the new Act and arrangements achieved the Government’s objectives; if so, what is the evidence to support that conclusion; if not, what are the inadequacies of the Act. (4) Will the Government release the report produced by the Office of Small Business in 2000 on the employment impacts of the move to the Specialist and Enthusiast Vehicle Scheme (SEVS); if not, why not. Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) I understand you have asked a similar question (QON 2173) of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon John Anderson MP. As he has portfolio responsibility for the Act, I refer this question to him. (2) The Motor Vehicles Standards Amendment Act came into effect on 1 April 2002. Transitional arrangements allowed registered vehicle holders to continue modifying and plating permitted vehicles for the market until 7 May 2003. Given the short period of time the Act has been fully effective, there has been no assessment of the employment implications of the new arrangement. (3) It is too early to determine how successful the Act has been in achieving the Government’s objective given the short period of time it has been in effect. (4) The Government will not be releasing the report. The Office of Small Business was requested by Ministers Anderson and Reith, and Senator Minchin to provide advice on the implications on small business of the SEVS. Mr Reith has previously indicated to Parliament that this advice was for the use of the Ministers only. Motor Vehicles: Private Importation (Question No. 2184) Mrs Irwin asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 11 August 2003 and it was transferred to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services: (1) What restrictions apply to the private importation to Australia by Australian citizens of second hand motor vehicles less than 15 years old and when were they introduced. (2) Were the restrictions imposed as a result of any report or recommendation of a parliamentary committee. (3) Were the restrictions imposed as part of the implementation of an announced Government policy. (4) For what reasons was the ban imposed on privately imported second hand motor vehicles less than 15 years old. (5) Will he allow the importation of vehicles purchased privately overseas before the restrictions were imposed. (1) The Motor Vehicle Standards Regulations 1989 permit the private importation to Australia by Australian citizens of used motor vehicles less than 15 years old under the provisions of regulations 12 to 16 inclusive. In general terms, the regulations provide for: personal imports, where the vehicle has been owned and used continuously for a qualifying period overseas; where the vehicle complied with the Australian Design Rules when it was first manufactured and delivered for use in transport; or where the vehicle is eligible under the Specialist and Enthusiast Vehicle Scheme and the vehicle model is included in the schedule of a registered automotive workshop, in which case the import application must be made by, and approval issued to, the registered automotive workshop. (2) No. (3) Yes. Changes to the import provisions of the Motor Vehicle Standards Regulations 1989 were introduced as part of the Government’s response to the Review of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989. These changes were announced by Senator Minchin and me on 8 May 2000 and included: abolition of the former low volume scheme for used vehicles after a two year transition period; creation of the Specialist and Enthusiast Vehicle Scheme; removal of provisions allowing the importation of vehicles for dismantling; and extension of the qualifying period for personal imports from 90 days to 12 months. (4) There is no ban on privately imported second hand vehicles. There are restrictions, as noted in (1) above. (5) Yes, if the vehicle can be imported under one of the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Standards Regulations as outlined in (1) above. National Security: Terrorism (Question No. 2203) Did Australia sponsor with the United States and New Zealand a counter terrorism workshop for Pacific Island countries in March 2003; if so, what was the outcome of that workshop. Australia sponsored with the United States and New Zealand a counter terrorism workshop for Pacific Island countries in March 2002. Australia did not sponsor a workshop of this sort in March 2003. The 2002 workshop helped to raise awareness in Pacific Island countries of the nature of the threat of international terrorism and of the role Pacific Island countries have in combating this threat, including through compliance with mandatory United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and relevant international instruments. Workshop participants agreed that the focus of the regional effort should be on taking practical steps to address the terrorist problem, including the early completion by Pacific Island countries of the reporting requirements of UNSC Resolution 1373.",210,Questions On Notice
