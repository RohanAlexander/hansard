The inquiry was not needed. The duty. First of all, I refer to Mr Black's decision not facts were known. The action should have been to conclude one way or the other as to whether or taken against the Special Minister of State on 5 not the Minister breached the law under section July.

No other conclusion is possible: of the House, if that is what he intends to do, let me take up one point that he raised about five Let us now consider the two pieces of evidence minutes into his argument when he said: 'It was which Mr Black appended to his report. First unnecessary, Mr Black found, for me to fill out there was the statement itself. Secondly, there was the form"". Is he really telling this House that as the valuation. It is crucial to the position of the Special Minister of State the answer is that he did Special Minister of State that the duty valuation not have to fill out the form anyway? He is rather came in under the figure of $500 because section like a man involved in a conveyarlcing transaction 209 of the Customs Act allows for release of goods who is asked to fill out a statutory declaration and on payment of a penalty and without prosecution does so falsely, and knows he does it falsely, and so long as in the opinion of the officers concerned who is charged later and finds out then that it was the value of the duty sought to be evaded did not not necessary to fill out any sworn document; a exceed $500.
