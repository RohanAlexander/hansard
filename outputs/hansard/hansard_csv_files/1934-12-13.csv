11,Mr Ward,"I am protesting againstacceptance of the principle of handing out to persons who are not in necessitous circumstances money raised by means of a tax upon the poor. When the last Government, which was composed entirely of persons holding identical political opinions on all matters, introduced a flour upon such an issue as this, many of them tax, it would not agree to the proposal of the Country party that there should be no discrimination in the distribution of the relief and that the men in good cirpockets at the expense of the poor people cumstances should participate in it equally with those who needed it. An election followed, with the result that this House was so constituted that the members of the United Australia party were unable, to form a government without the assistance of the Country party. £t is because the Government has to rely upon support from that quarter that we find a modification of their views in this particular measure. Many honourable members of the United Australia party who were in the last Ministry have had to swallow the words that tbey uttered when supporting its proposals. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Stewart), the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White), and others, who referred to last year's measure as one to assist the needy and not the greedy, this morning walked across the chamber and voted for the greedy, because they are anxious to preserve their positions. able member may deal only with votes that may or will be recorded. He is not entitled to reflect upon any vote that has already been given. explain the matter to honourable members while they still have an opportunity to preserve the rights of those unfortunate people outside who are not able to speak on their own behalf. Because of the position that a number of men hold in this House, they are able to record a vote upon a matter in which they are directly interested, namely, the distribuquotation from a telegram couched in tion of the money to be raised by means of the flour tax. antagonism, even at this early stage, to the action of the Government. The policy now being followed was not enunciated by it, nor was the matter discussed by any member of the United Australia party or the United Country party, during the last election campaign. true. bers were to face the electors to-morrow would not be returned to this Parliament to support a proposal to take money from the Treasury and place it in their own of this country. I have, as I have already said, received a telegram upon the subject. It readsCongratulations on your exposure hypocritical wheat-farmer politicians. Urge you use all means prevent parliamentarians benefiting as a result imposition of flour tax. That telegram is signed by a man who styles himself "" wheat-farmer."" When one wheat-farmer is sufficiently publicspirited to place the well-being of the nation before his own personal interests, what must be the opinion of the majority of the public outside Parliament? order, I ask, Mr Speaker, if an honourable member is entitled to quote from a telegram imputing hypocrisy to members of this House, without giving the name of the sender of the telegram. verning this matter provides that if a Minister makes a quotation from a public document, he may be required to table the document; but that, in the case of a private member, there is no such obligation. an honourable member is not entitled to quote from a document statements which, if made by a member within the chamber, would not be permitted. The test in this case is whether the statement contained in the telegram-that certain members in this chamber are political hypocrites-is of such a nature as would be permitted in this House. If an honourable member is not entitled to call another, member a political hypocrite, then I submit that a such language cannot be allowed. altogether.

If so, we could all protest on one ground or another. the honourable member for Barker was protesting against something said during this debate by the honourable member for East Sydney.

A number of honourable members were not able even to hear what the right honourable gentleman said. More time should be allowed for the committee stage of the bill, for several pages of amendments have been circulated by the Minister himself, and I suppose he does not wish to exclude other honourable members from moving important amendments if tbey desire to do so.

It is entirely unfair therefore that they should be denied an opportunity to express their views on the motion for the second reading of this bill. I object to the procedure that has been adopted. It appears that a very ill-digested bill was introduced last week, for numerous Government amendments have since been circulated. It is impossible for honourable members, iu the time at their disposal, to consider the real effect of these proposed alterations. I urge that the time for the consideration of the bill in committee should be extended for an with hour. Apparently the Government does not wish the circulated amendments 3.25 to be considered in committee. Honourable members on both sides recognize p.m. that the most effective work can be done during tbe committee stage; but honourable members have no opportunity to read the amendments in conjunction with the provisions of the bill. If proceedings are conducted in this way half of the time of the next session will be occupied in rectifying mistakes and in endeavouring to indemnify the Government against, claims which may be made as the result of passing ill-considered legislation.

Other Ministers have been most courteous to honourable members on this side of the chamber; but the Acting Leader of the House is very off-handed in his disregard of our representations. for the discussion of various stages of the bill were apparently altered by arrangement with the leaders of the different parties. Under the Standing Orders the time allotted for the discussion upon a motion allocating time is half an hour, which time would be trespassed upon by the proposed time-table. If arrangements are made outside the Standing Orders between the Minister in charge of a bill and the leaders of parties, it makes the position of the Chair very difficult. Commerce is prepared to confer for a moment or two in order to see if the time provided for discussion in committee can be increased I shall endeavour to meet him. made is not satisfactory, the Acting Leader of the House had' better revert to the original times. amend the motion to provide that the period allotted for the second reading of the bill shall expire at 2.35 p.m. the time-table so that the time allotted for the second reading should expire at 2.10 p.m., and we discussed the proposal to terminate the second reading debate at 2.10 p.m. I ask now is it permissible for the Minister, willy nilly, to withdraw one motion and substitute another without the leave of the House? member for West Sydney is adopting a somewhat extraordinary attitude. He has already pointed out that the time allotted could not be adhered to because the time allowed had already elapsed, but when I informed the Acting Leader of the House that the arrangement could not stand, the honourable member has again protested. order. We were supplied with a typewritten sheet containing the allotment of times which the Minister originally intended to move, but the times he moved do not agree with those set out on the type-written sheet. If proceedings are to be conducted in this way it can result only in confusion, as honourable members would not know what stage had been reached. ruled that the motion originally moved was not in order. The Acting Leader of the House hasnow moved that the time for the second-reading stage of the bill shall be extended to 2.35 p.m. The question before the Chair is therefore that the times allotted shall be those set out on the paper circulated. protest against the guillotining of this measure. The Minister, in his anxiety the Minister for to evade criticism, brings forward a timetable, and despite some attempt at prearrangement with party leaders, finds himself hoist by his own petard. The members of the Country party, who are supposed to represent country interests, have reduced this discussion to a farce. Honourable members are not given an opportunity to discuss important measures in a proper manner. As I pointed out yesterday, Country party members are monopolizing the whole of the time allowed for discussion, and are voicing opinions which we have heard year after year. That no new light has been shed on the subject has been because lionorable members on this side of the House have not been given an opportunity to express their opinions. The other day tbe Attorney-General invited honourable members to pool the brain resources of this Parliament in an endeavour to find a solution of the pressing problems confronting this country, but immediately the Oppositon seeks to examine its legislation, the Government restricts discussion, and sheaves of amendments, drafted in the seclusion of ministerial party rooms, are introduced. That can only result in confusion. As the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has pointed out, three or four sheets of amendments have already been introduced since the bill was brought down. That the Government has found it necessary to introduce these amendments is surely a sufficient indication",25,Allotment Of Time

We should make it possible for primary producers, whether they raise wheat, fruit, maize, butter, fat lambs, beef, or any other commodity, to organize their industry on the New Zealand system. I made the same request in a motion moved in this House on tbe 29th August, 1929, again on the 27th March, 1930, and on the 15th September, 1932. recently been suplported by the Council of Agriculture of Queensland, representatives of thefat lamb and beef producers of various States, and citrus growers and other producers. It is hopeless, however, to look for any effective measure of co-operation among primary producers so long as the wheat growers are bought off each year by a Commonwealth dole of this kind.' Wheat growers in the southern States are' prepared to allow the other primary producersto starve on their farms so long as they themselves are able to get this easy money year after year. The honourable member may not make a second-reading speech on the short title of the bill. 15th December last I asked the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) whether he would advocate at a Constitution Convention an alteration of the Constitution to give full trade and commerce powers to the Commonwealth. On the 28th MarchI received the following communication from his department:With further reference to your letter of tlie 15th December, 1933, regarding the suggestion that tlie Commonwealth Constitution be amended with a view to vesting in the Commonwealth Parliament full trade and commorce powers, I desire to inform you that the question of the distribution of the powers relating to trade and commerce .was discussed at the Premiers Conference which was held in Melbourne in February last, but that no agreement was reached in regard to the matter. If wheat-growers exerted themselves or organized, they could influence State governments ancl assist other industries which get no federal grants to secure the support of all State governments for such a scheme. I submit that every word of the honourable member's speech is directed to the merits or demerits of the hill itself and not to the suitability, of its title. directed the honourable member to confine his remarks to the clause. I shall not again draw his attention, to the necessity of following that course. the bill is termed a Wheat Growers The policy I advocated has Relief Bill, we have the opportunity to review what it is intended to do. The President of the Senate has sent to honourable members a Christmas card which illustrates the direction in which this relief will be given. It shows a farm with ten teams of four horses each, and 36 furrows being turned over in one operation. This is one of the wheat-farmers who will receive this relief. connection between the card issued by the President of the Senate and the clause. The honourable member must not disregard the direction of the Chair. submit that if the honourable member wishes to alter the title of the bill, it is because he feels that it does not fit the purpose for which the bill is introduced. May he not give reasons for his belief and support it by arguments? member would be in order in doing so, but he has digressed abundantly. claim that the honourable member is in order in referring to the card issued by the President of the Senate, illustrating the type of people to whom the relief is to be given. He was interrupted before he had completed his argument. want is to give wheat-growers the organization benefits enjoyed /by the sugar growers and the dairy-farmers. The bill would not bear this title if the wheat growers and their representatives organized themselves as the dairying and other industries have done. All they do is to come along lazily at ithe end of the year and ask the Government for a dole, thus upsetting the Government's finances and the bread of the poor, and because of their numbers they command an influence.",27,Second Reading

During the last half hour, tbe honourable member has deliberately assisted the Labour party in an attempt to make the wheat bounty a dole to the farmers. The first Wheat Bounty Bill did not discriminate in the slightest between one grower and another. treated all growers throughout tbe Commonwealth in the same way. I ask what is the question before the committee, and what is the relevancy of the debate? I demand that the clause be put. the question before the committee is not to raise a point of order. Clause1 is before the committee. It deals with the title of the bill, and, so far, the right honourable the Minister for Commerce is in order. duced the last bill considered dealt with an equal distribution of the money to every wheat-grower throughout Australia, but an amendment was moved by the Lang Labour party to make It apply only to those who had no income. the lionorable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser). The relief to be given by the bill now before the committee is not to be given without discrimination to every wheat-grower. It takes into account, not only the total production of the industry, but also the number of acres that the grower has sown, whether that sowing resulted in a big or a small crop. It was brought down for the specific purpose of helping farmers who had the bad luck through rust, drought or other causes, to be unable to obtain a decent crop. By it they will get a share of the money which is now being made available. Mr E. J. HARRISON -And it will also help those who have sown on uneconomic land, will it not? degree. For many years I have opposed this principle, but this is a recommendation of the royal commission to meet the special circumstances of the case. The commission says that we ought to give certain money on a production basis, and come the disastrous effects of drought. That is all that this bill does. It gives, so far as acreage is concerned, 3s. an acre. It also gives on a production basis, and affords additional relief to necessitous growers. I regret, as much as the honourable memIt ber does, the necessity for it, but there is no escape from the position. Next year there will be a further sum of £572,000 made available to assist those men who have suffered more calamities than even the men who will be assisted under this bill. move That after the word "" Growers "", the words "" Absentee owners and rural investors"" he inserted. This will make the purpose of the bill clear. The right honourable the Minister says he believes that these rural industries should obtain relief from the Government. provided against in this bill if the honourable member will take tbe trouble to read it. the Minister says that the bill covers That was supported by everybody who has grown wheat.

The amended title which I suggest would be more in harmony with the truth than the title now given to the bill. The Government supports such people. We are opposed to that policy, and. think that the title of the bill should be so amended as to make it free from all ambiguity that this ' Government want3 to relieve absentee owners and rural investors who are buying up farm after farm. Because of the adverse exchange, they are keeping their money in the country, and using it to acquire the farms of those who are unable to meet their interest charges or pay their storekeepers' bills.

67,Mr Garden,"The right honorableshould be amended as proposed by me. The Government is not so much concerned about the farmers who are losing their holdings, and are being pressed to the wall, as it is with rural investors in other countries, whom it proposes to assist by means of revenue raised by a bread tax that falls most heavily on the poorest sections of the community. The Minister in charge of the bill (Dr. Earle Page) and tbe Minister in charge of War Service Homes( Mr Thorby) are both Country party men yet they are prepared to support a bill designed to help those who farm tbe farmers rather than the farmers who are up against it. amendment is not in order. amendment is out of order on the ground that it is inconsistent with the terms of the Governor General's message Since you, sir, have ruled that the amendto be the intention of its framers. Thoument is not in order, I intend to oppose the clause. It must be patent to everyone who takes the slightest interest in the agents of people who have invested money distribution of this bounty that the title of the bill as printed does not properly cover the distribution of the funds provided for under it. As pointed out by the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden) that absentee owners and overseas rural investors are to participate in this form of relief. The clause, therefore, is misleading because it provides that "" This act amendment which you have disallowed, shall be cited as tbe Wheat Growers Relief Act."" The ex-Minister for Commerce( Mr Stewart) when he was dealing with a similar measure last year said that the reason for discrimination was that the Government desired to assist only necessitous farmers. He pointed out-and by reason of his Ministerial office he was in an excellent position to know what he was talking about-that if the restrictions then proposed were not placed on the distribution of the bounty men who did not know how to grow a grain of corn-me n whose only interest in wheat-growing was that they had invested their money by way of mortgage on wheat farms-woul d participate in the bounty. The conditions which obtained last year prevail to-day. It is all very well for the Acting Leader of the House (Dr. Earle Page) to say that only wheat-farmers will receive this relief. Half the farmers in Australia today are mere chattel slaves of the banking and other financial institutions which control them by means of mortgages over their properties. They are the peoplethe people who farm the farmers-and not the farmers who grow the wheat who will benefit by this bill. Since the title of the bill as it stands is "" The Wheat Growers Relief Act"", we should see that the money distributed under it go only to those who grow wheat. Overseas investors who own farms or who have mortgages over farm properties in Australia, and of whom it can never be said that they will be ""driven from their holdings because of the necessitous conditions that prevail to-day, should not be allowed to participate in any distribution of moneys raised by means of a bread tax on the poor of this country. The title of the bill should set out clearly what honourable members know ands of farmers have no material interest in their holdings. They are merely the in them and even if we provide that the bounty shall be payable only to wheat farmers it will go ultimately in all such cases to the financial institutions. I do not wish to dispute your ruling, Mr Chairman, but I contend that the title of the bill as it stands does not adequately describe its intention. The suggested would have shown exactly the interests to be benefited under itThe title of any bill should clearly indicate its object. The clause says, "" This act may be cited as the Wheat Growers Relief Act."" Every piece of legislation designed to afford relief postulates the granting of assistance to persons who are in distress. 1 agree that the distressed farmers should be given proper relief; but this measure should conform to the Government's general policy for the rehabilitation of rural industries. Ministers admit, however, that this legislation is merely a temporary expedient. The farmers, of course, are in need of assistance, largely owing to the exorbitant interest rates that are imposed upon them.

The majority of them were inveigled into the industry by State policy, and I do not know that it can be argued that they should be forced out of it. The percentage of inefficiency among wheat growers, including those who are producing on unsuitable country, is smaller than exists in the majority of understand why the wheat industry should be singled out for the charge that a considerable proportion of the men engaged in it had no right to enter it. Less than 20 years ago the bulk of the land in my electorate was considered absolutely unsuited to wheat production, yet to-day it is regarded as one of the finest wheat districts in New South Wales. Times change, and ideas upon the productive capacity of country change with them. Therefore there is not much force in the argument that the allegedly inefficient farmers constitute a problem. The real problem to-day is the inability of the great majority of wheat-growers, whether they he small or large, to produce at a price that will recoup them the cost of production. The report of the royal commission shows conclusively the immediate necessity for some assistance being given by the National Parliament. All sorts of side issues have been dragged in, including that of the alleged big man. The commission proved that the bigger a man was, the greater were his losses. If we are to base our policy upon the idea that this is a great national issue and not merely one affecting individuals; if we are to consider it as an important piece of national socialism, only one conclusion is possible. We must not give specially favourable treatment to some, and penalize others, but must regard who is now engaged in the industry. The man who continues his wheat operations with capital drawn from other sources is a special type of benefactor. WereI in the wheat industry and had I to call on my capital resources to keep going in the hope that times would improve and I should eventually make good, I should say that I was entitled to relief and should be as readily prepared as any other wheat-grower in this House to hold out my hand for the bounty. for the committee'stage has expired.

Tliere is no point of order. ask whether the honourable member may refer to something that took place in committee. member had not proceeded sufficiently far to enable the Chair to acquaint itself of the nature of his-remarks. Mr E. J. HARRISON I was particularly concerned in clause 4, dealing with the amounts to be paid to the different States. I question the right of certain wheat-growers to take advantage of the provisions of this measure. Some of them have no need of relief, while others are producing uneconomically and should be forced off the land by the withholding of assistance. .' s Earlier in the day the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) drew attention to the statement in the report of the royal commission that 30.9 per cent, of the wheat-growers of^Australia are producing at under Is. l i d . a clusively that a very big percentage are not in need of the proposed relief. He also pointed out that 11.5 per cent, of the producers are producing wheat at from 4s. to over 5s. a bushel. I submit that these people should not be kept on tbe land by palliatives of the kind now being provided by the Government. I direct the attention of honourable members also to the following extract from the report of the South Australian committee which investigated the subject of debt adjustment in respect of the agricultural and pastoral industries:Dr. H . Krause, Phil. D., who is attached to the Melbourne University, and is co-operating at that institution with Professor Copland, has recently examined the actual working figures of many wheat-growers throughout this State, with the exception of Eyre's Peninsula. He estimates approximately the average cost of production of wheat per bushel delivered at nearest siding as follows:No. .1 district, comprising lower north and Yorke Peninsula-2s . I d . No. 2 district, comprising lands between No. 1 district and Goyder's line-2s . 4d. to 2s. Sd. No. 3 district, being lauds outside Goyder's line-2s . fid. to 3s. These estimates exclude all charge for interest. I contend that people who are producing wheat under those conditions have no right to expect relief payments from the Government, for they are engaged in definitely uneconomic production. I have selected these references to South Australia because authoritative figures are available, but similar uneconomic wheat production is going on in all the wheat producing States of the Commonwealth. In South Australia, out of 46 counties producing wheat in the period from 1929-30 to 1932-33, 24 counties averaged only 5.17 bushels to the acre sown, and these particular counties produce^ 30 per cent, of the total wheat production of the State for those years.

Bill brought up and read a first time. Debate resumed from the 11 th December (vide page 988), on motion by Sir Tliat the bill be now read a second time. The Minister directing negotiations for Trade Treaties( Sir Henry Gullett) told us in bis second-reading speech on this bill that its purpose was to remove sales tax from goods imported from F i j i of a kind similar to those free from sales tax in the Commonwealth. He also stated that it was intended to exempt from primage duties "" certain goods the product of F i j i , including bananas "". It can be said, therefore, that this is a move by the Government to encourage the importation into Australia of greater quantities of Fijian bananas. A reduction is also to be made in the quarantine inspection charges on Fijian bananas from 4d. to 2d. a case, and in due course a proclamation to that effect will appear ir. the Commonwealth Gazette. It will be seen, therefore, that honourable members who consider that we should be building up our primary and secondary industries have substantial grounds for complaint at the introduction of the measure. commensurate benefit is being given to any Australian industry through the granting of these concessions to F i j i . In 1921, when the then Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Massy-Greene) introduced the tariff schedule which provided for an increase of the duty on Fijian bananas to 8s. 4d. per central, he saidIt would not make the slightest difference views in regard to the necessity for proto our trade with Fiji if we imported no bananas from the island, because all the sugar tecting the Queensland banana industry grown there comes to Sydney to be refined, and that is the real source of Australia's substantiar trade with Fiji. In other words, the honourable gentleman considered that no serious disadvantage would be imposed upon Australian trading interests 'by granting to the Australian banana-growers the additional protection that was afforded them at that time. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) said in this House"" It is incumbent upon confidence in industry will not be undermined."" Will not the confidence in the banana industry be further undermined as a result of the action proposed to be taken by the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties? Under the Ottawa agreement the duty on black-grown Fijian bananas entering Australia was reduced from'8s. 4d. to 2s. 6d. a central on 40,000 centals. Tariff Item 44A as amended reads ""Bananas, per central: British, 2s. 6d.; general, 8s. 4d."" But it does not actually restrict importations to any given quantity. Unlimited importations could be made except for the specific stipulation contained in the Ottawa agreement. agreement no bananas could be imported from F i j i without paying 8s. 4d. per central duty. How do we know that the Minister is not proposing to give further concessions to Fiji? His decision of to-day might be reversed to-morrow. I well remember the statement of the former Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Francis) that he could definitely assert that Cabinet had decided that no further concessions in respect of bananas would be given to F i j i . In making that statement. I understand he was speaking No with the full approval of the Cabinet. At any rate when he went to Queensland and, speaking as a Queensland member of the Cabinet, assured the banana-growers of that State that no further concessions would be given in respect to Fijian bananas, no other Minister in the Commonwealth Cabinet contradicted him.

Speaking of the Ottawa agreement the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties said "" This agreement bas been drawn up in aid of the man on the land."" His heart was bleeding for the man on the land! Yet he has delivered this crushing blow to a large number of men on the land in Australia to-day. I have received tbe following letter from Mr dustry by the ill-conceived action of the H. W. Gardner, secretary of the Targinnie branch of the Queensland Producers Association, which outlines the views of banana-growers in that districtI have been instructed by the Targinnie Local Producers' Association to request that you endeavour to have ample protection afforded the growers of bananas in Queensland and New South Wales. This Local Producers' Association views with apprehension the lowering of duties on Fijian bananas, parwent to the expense of sending experts ticularly as growers in our own country arc having a hard time to make ends meet and we fear that it may also mean that other proworld to examine methods of ripening ducts of this State will be forced to compote with produce from cheap, coloured-labour countries. This letter is not from a union secretary or from a person interested in the Labour movement, but from the secretary of the Local Producers' Association, which consists chiefly of banana-growers. Confidence in this industry is being rapidly undermined. The Minister's statement that the Ottawa agreement was drawn .up in aid of the man on the land was all moonshine. The Ottawa agreement is a complete washout. Promises were given in respect of butter, wheat, meat, cotton, bananas, and other primary products. It was said that the price of butter was to fly to great heights. But what are the facts? The price of butter and other products fell like a plumb-bob immediately the Ottawa agreement was signed. When a. duty of 8s. 4d. a central was placed ou imported bananas in 1921 local growers naturally thought the protection would.continue for all time. They knew that the increase had been given by a Liberal or Nationalist Government, and that the Labour party stood for adequate and effective protection for primary and secondary industries. But what happened? The growers were asked by the then government to increase their plantings and to put their sons on the land. They took up additional holdings and entered into contractual obligations because they thought that the whole of the Australian market would be preserved for them. The number of growers increased rapidly, until to-day there are 8.000 in Queensland and New South Wales, giving employment to a large number of people in allied industries. The banana industry uses 1,000,000 cases each year.* Any injury done to that inpresent Government must affect not only the banana-growers, but also allied industries. In rail freight alone the banana growers pay annually £134,000 in Queensland, and £70,000 in New South Wales. The industry has so expanded that about 30,000 acres are under banana cultivation in Australia to-day. Seeking to improve their efficiency, the growers to every banana-growing country in the and of combating pests and disease that challenge the existence of the industry. It cannot be claimed that the Australian demand, amounting to 1,000,000 cases per annum, cannot be met by the Australian growers. As a matter of fact the Australian growers produce 1,400,000 cases per annum, leaving a surplus of 400,000 cases above local requirements. If the Australian growers were not in a position to supply local requirements no one would object to the importation of the foreign-grown product, but every thousand cases of bananas from F i j i must depress the price of bananas on an already over-supplied Australian market. When confronted by his irate electors in 1932 the then Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Francis) said: "" Not only have the banana-growers of Australia nothing to fear, but negotiations are in progress between the Commonwealth and the British Government for variation of the Ottawa Agreement in respect of bananas."" He led his constituents to believe that the Government felt regret at the step it had taken, and that it would consider the question of retracing it. But no such consideration has been given. On the contrary a further staggering blow has been dealt to the industry. In an attempt to justify this proposal it has been said that the Fijian banana-growers are as white as the growers in Australia. European owners of Fijian plantations represent only 6.6 per cent, of the growers. The native growers represent 75.9 per cent., Indians 9.8 per cent, and Chinese 7.7 per cent. In other words, in F i j i there are twelve times as many black growers as European growers, and there are more Chinese than whites engaged in the industry there. ° So much for the statement that the industry in F i j i is conducted by white men. Following upon the Ottawa Agreement, which resulted in large importations of black-grown bananas from F i j i , some of the most conservative newspapers in Queensland trenchantly criticized the' treatment meted out to the banana growers of Australia. The Brisbane Courier., in a leading article, which appeared immediately following the speech delivered by the then Minister for Trade and Customs dealing with the Ottawa agreement and the importation of bananas from F i j i saidYesterday it was announced by Mr Gullett, dous hardships because of the over-supply in his speech on the Ottawa agreement, that the Federal Government had decided to reof the market. duce the duty on F i j i bananas from Ss. 4d. per central to 2s. Gd. per central, and to allow the importation of 40,000 centals a year. The attacks on Queensland's agricultural industries have become so frequent that one ia forced to the conclusion that the Federal Government ""IB absolutely ignorant of Queenslaud conditions. It does not realize that Queensland is the only State which is carrying on tropical agriculture to any great extent. That ignorance has led the Federal Government to believe that "" Queensland's industries do no oount,"" and that whether that hurts the State or not does not matter, so long as the south is appeased. I have never attended a more enthusiastic public meeting than that held in Brisbane ToAvn Hall. Train loads of growers came to Brisbane from various parts of Queensland to attend it. Professor Goddard, of the Queensland University, addressing the meeting, saidMany growers have been fearing for some time past that there will be over production, and, if their fears are realized, then the problem will become a most serious one, with the admission of F i j i bananas on terms that will enable that product, grown under native labour conditions, to compete wit h the Australian product in terms disadvantageous to the latter. The Queensland Producer, representative of the farmers' organizations of Queensland, also published a scathing indictAlr. Forde. ment of the action of the Government in depriving the Australian growers of the local market. The banana-growers have gone out into the back country and cut their farms out of the scrub. They have suffered great hardships. They have to put up with the ravages of pests and droughts, and, even with the whole of the Australian market at their disposal, they were gaining small remuneration for their labours. The drastic action following upon the signing of the Ottawa agreement was bad enough, but, notwithstanding the definite promise made that no further action would be taken to the detriment of this industry, the Minister has now the audacity to come forward with this bill to encourage additional imports of Fijian bananas. The unfortunate growers in the northern parts of New South ""Wales and the coastal districts of Queensland in the electorate of the honourable member for Lilley( Sir Donald Cameron), and particularly in that of the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser), are suffering tremenso many in my electorate now as formerly. result of the recent electoral redistribution. At any rate there are a great many in the electorate of the honourable membei for Wide Bay, and I represent manywmyself. This industry is not confined to one State, because New South. Wales, I believe, now produces more bananas than does Queensland. For many year* production in New South Wales declined because of the ravages of the bunchy-top disease, and thousands of acres went out of production. As the result of scientific research, however, most of the pests have now been either controlled or eliminated, and New South Wales has again become a heavy producer. with which the growers have to contend is the Government. that the Government attaches importance to our trade with F i j i , but our exports to those islands have not declined because of our policy of protection.

Our imports from F i j i have increased from £23,000 in 1931-32 to £33,552 in 1933-34. when replying in 1921 to criticism directed against the proposal to give tha whole Australian market to local banana growers, said that the exclusion of Fijian bananas would make not the slightest difference to our trade with F i j i , because the basis of our trade with that colony was the Fijian sugar brought to Sydney to be refined. I ask the Government to reconsider its attitude to this matter. We are at present seeking avenues of employment for our people, and are at our wits' end to find occupations for the 300,000 unemployed in two States alone. Surely it is a mistake to take action that will tend to restrict primary production. The cry we hear on all sides is, "" Get back to the land "", but of what use is it to put people bananas. To-day the Australian growers ou the land if we rob them of their markets? This industry was established under the protection of the tariff. The growers were promised the whole of the Australian market, and no one thought that there was one chance in a million that ing of their bananas, and if prices are any succeeding government would throw the Australian market open to Fijian bananas, the product of .Indian and Chinese labour. The banana industry 1 in Australia provides employment for timber-workers, transport workers, box makers, &c., and we should think seriously before taking any step which would interfere with it. The other day the Minister in charge of this bill appealed to members of all political parties to offer suggestions that would sought to repair their broken fortunes by be helpful in the rehabilitation of Australian industry. I now offer the suggestion that no further action should be takes in connection with this bill for six months, so that the Minister may have an opportunity to visit the banana-growing areas of Queensland and northern New South Wales, and study conditions for himself. If he does so he will learn that many of the growers are living in bag huts or galvanized iron shacks, and are suffering the tortures of hell on their no compensating assistance is granted to small banana plantations. I believe that after such an inspection the Minister will H7 ] bill at all. In order to provide him with an opportunity to make the visit, I moveSenator Sir Massy-Greene, That the word "" now "".be omitted from, and that the words "" this day six months"" be added to, the question. Minister, when introducing this bill, saidThe purpose of this bill is to remove sales tax from goods imported from Fiji of a kind similar to those which are free from sales tax within the Commonwealth or not produced in the Commonwealth at all. It is also proposed to insert a notification in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette exempting from primage certain goods the product of Fiji, including bananas. In addition, a reduction of from 4d. to 2d. a case of the quarantine inspection charges upon imported bananas will be gazetted. I regard this as the most inappropriate time that could have been chosen for the granting of further concessions to Fijian are receiving lower prices for their product than eyer before. Many of them are on the bread line, and this further blow will cause them to lose heart. Some of them are losing heavily on the marketfurther reduced they will find it impossible to carry on. The banana industry is a great factor in promoting closer settlement. There are now 8,000 growers cultivating 80,000 acres and the value of their production is approximately £1,500,000. Most of the holdings are small, of from five to six acres, and are chiefly on mountain slopes in difficult country. Many men who have been out of work for a considerable time have embarking upon the growing of bananas. The chief factor in banana-growing is hard work and plenty of it. Only a small holding is necessary, and no really great amount of capital is required. In one part of my electorate a new settlement has sprung up, consisting of people who have established banana plantations with the assistance of unemployment relief money, but their enterprise will be placed in jeopardy if the present bill is passed and the industry. The settlement is known as Austinville, and its beginning was",38,Henby Gullett

As a result of the arrest of the disease known as bunchy-top, following upon research work by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research experts, and Professor Goddard and his assistant in Queensland, and the consequential expansion of the area under cultivation, there is at present serious over-production of bananas. More bananas are being produced now than ever before, and in the markets of Sydney and Melbourne they may be bought for less than the cost of production, although the fruit is better than ever as the result of improved transport methods and ripening processes. The future of the growers will be black, indeed, if special efforts are treatment to Great Britain for 20 or 25 not made to assist them. The Minister( Sir Henry Gullett) stated that this was a minor measure designed to grant to the Fijian growers concessions which it was intended that they should receive under the Ottawa agreement, but it is more than that. Under the Ottawa agreement, F i j i was entitled to place on the Australian market 40,000 centals of bananas a year after paying a duty of 2s. 6d. per central as against the 1921 duty of 8s. 4d. A promise was given that the quantity would not be increased, and that no further concessions would be granted. For the first year, the duty collected on Fijian bananas was to be devoted to advertising bananas with the idea of popularizing them on the Australian market, and some of the money was to be devoted to enable the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to conduct further investigations into maturation processes, transport problems and the elimination of diseases to which this fruit is subject. The Government honoured its obligation in that regard, and both last year and this year £3,000 was made available for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for the conduct of research' work. The success of the council's work is most gratifying. The suggestion has been made that perhave said that this bill had heen intromission to import 40,000 centals of Fijian duced merely to grant concessions which bananas at a reduced duty was but the he thought had been made at the time of thin end of the wedge, and that further the Ottawa agreement. Primage a»d sales concessions would be granted later. I tax were in existence long before the Mr Francis. took the matter up with the Prime Minister some time ago, and induced him to instruct the then Resident Minister in London, Mr Bruce, to confer with the Secretary of State for the Dominions, for ithe purpose of obtaining an assurance that, in no circumstances, would a greater quantity than 40,000 centals of Fijian bananas be admitted to Australia in any one year. Confirmation of this was readily obtained from the Governor of F i j i , Sir Murchison Fletcher. The banana-growers of Australia were called upon under the Ottawa agreement to make the principal sacrifice on behalf of Australian industries for concessions granted by the United Kingdom and the dominions, although we had already been giving special preferential years. During the first half of the present year, the Governor of F i j i visited Australia to discuss with the Government a number of matters. Among these was the charges which Fijian bananas entering Australia had to meet in common with imports from every other country. I had a discussion with His Excellency, at which the present Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) and the then Minister for Commerce( Mr Stewart) were present, and during the conference asked whether His Excellency contended that we were not fully carrying out the terms of the Ottawa agreement in regard to the uniform collection of these charges on imports from all oountries. He was most definite in his reply that in no instance had he suggested that we had failed to carry out fully the Ottawa agreement. firmation of my statement by the Minister for Trade and Customs, I fail to understand why these concessions should be made. They were not claimed by the Governor of F i j i as part of the Ottawa agreement. The primage and sales tax have nothing to do with the Ottawa agreement, and I cannot understand why the Minister( Sir Henry Gullett) should",39,Henby Gullett

In the Senate on the 25 th July last, the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs was asked the following question:Have any concessions of any kind, other than exactly where they are. Having regard to those provided for under the Ottawa agreement, as agreed to by Parliament, been made, or arc any such contemplated, upon bananas imported ""into Australia from F i j i ? The reply made by Senator McLachlan was as follows:The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:No concessions other than those provided for under the Ottawa agreement as approved by Parliament have been made to F i j i upon bananas imported into Australia, and none is contemplated. Yet the Minister who introduced this bill said that it provided for no concessions other than those already approved under the Ottawa agreement. Customs, in the answer which I have just read, stated clearly that no concession other than those provided for under the Ottawa agreement had been granted, and none was contemplated, The concessions for which this bill provides have not been approved by Parliament, and the fact that the Governor of F i j i admitted that we had honoured the Ottawa agreement in its entirety is evidence that the Minister's contention as to the reason for the introduction of this bill was based on false premises. The honourable gentleman said that these further concessions were proposed because of threats from elected members of the Fijian council. They, however, are in a minority. There is no chance of F i j i repudiating the Ottawa agreement, particularly in view of the Governor's statement. prepared before reports were received from F i j i about opposition in the Fijian Council. speech, the Minister said that these concessions were made because of a threat It from F i j i . If he says now that that is not so I shall of course accept his assurance; but if , because of threats, we are going to pull down the protection granted to an industry there will be no scarcity of threats from all quarters. If the Minister can give me a definite assurance that no further concession is to be made, I shall be materially helped in satisfying the growers that there is some security for them and that they may now know the substantial over-production of bananas in Australia, and the fact that they are being sold at less than the cost of production, I do not think there is any chance of a larger quantity of Fijian bananas coming into Australia^ I wish, however, to be certain that these are the last con cessions that the industry will be asked to make. If we have a definite assurance in that regard the industry will then know the extent to which it can go on producing, and what will be the market available to it. It will be able to organize markets for its products throughout Australia. Buti f after it has been working energetically to find new markets-particularly in country districts-for its product, The Minister for Trade and further concessions are to be granted to F i j i , it will not have the encouragement to which it is entitled at the hands of the Government and much good work will be undone. It should be encouraged to organize a system of distribution that will enable it to supply the whole Australian market-market s in country districts and elsewhere-wit h all that they require. Wis find that there is an ever-increasing consumption of the fruit now produced, but if the banana-growers are to be left in ignorance as to what further imports may be allowed, their position will be a most difficult one. We are unable to export bananas. The banana is a softfruit, and cannot be carried to oversea-"" markets even with the assistance of refrigeration.

102,The Ottawa Agree,"Mr Francis -In his introductoryengaged iu the production of apples and pears have received a grant of £125,000 to help them to market their product overseas. Citrus-growers are guaranteed by the Government against loss on export. The mandarin industry last year received a grant of £10,000. The canning industry, which deals mainly with peaches, pears and apricots, has received, since 1920, government assistance to the extent of £1,000,000 in exporting its surplus. The canned fruit industry last year received from the sugar industry itself help to the extent of £110,000. I urge that the banana industry should be assisted. Imports from F i j i are pushing off the Australian market a quantity of the Australian product. It should be assisted by the Government to develop the secondary side of the industry and helped to make use of its by-products, and to find hew markets for them overseas. There is a surplus of tbe raw fruit, and if, through tbe Council for Scientific and Industrial Research or other agencies, methods were devised of converting the banana into a satisfactory by-product such as banana flour and banana coffee, valuable help would be given to the industry. Surplus production and undersized fruit would be profitably absorbed. I appeal to the Minister for a definite assurance that no further concession is to be granted F i j i and that assistance will be given to develop the secondary side of the industry. With such an assurance the industry will be able to organize the Australian market, it will be encouraged to proceed with the eradication of pests that assail it, and should become one of the most useful of our primary industries. As it is, the industry cannot hope to rehabilitate itself or to solve the problems with which it is faced. I shall be glad to hear what the Minister has to say with regard to the future of this industry. seconded the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr additional to the ordinary customs duties, on Forde) and 1 did so for many reasons. When, a little over two years ago, the Minister in charge of this bill ( Sir Henry Gullett) submitted the Ottawa agreement for the ratification of Parliament, I supported it, but urged that it was quite unnecessary to have in it a clause relating specially to F i j i . I , with many others, opposed, the reduction of the duty on bananas from F i j i believing that the concession should not have been given. It was wholly unnecessary; but followed a continuous agitation on the part of that Crown colony for a share of the Australian market for bananas. More bananas were then being produced in Australia to provide for the whole of our needs. Australia. I admit, in this respect, is in a rather peculiar position, but under the Constitution, in the levying of customs duties we cannot discriminate between the States. The banana-growers are not responsible for the disadvantage under which Western Australia labours in that respect. It is due solely to the geographical position of Western Australia, and the provisions of the Constitution. For many years F i j i has requested the Government to remove the general tariff of 8s. 4d. per central. Under the Ottawa agreement it was allowed to ship to Australia 40,000 centals at the reduced duty of 2s. 6d. per central, or less than one-third of the ordinary rate. Although the Minister stated that F i j i was limited by the Ottawa agreement to 40,000 centals a year, I point out that that quantity was not provided for under the agreement, hut was arranged for later. F i j i has since attempted to obtain even greater concessions than were originally given. Recently a motion hearing on this matter was submitted in its Legislative Council, which is partly a nominated and partly an elected body; but the real power is vested in the Governor. A paragraph published in the newspapers in Australia stated that the following decision had been reached hy the Legislative Council of F i j i : That it ia expedient to levy extra taxation, Australian goods, including a primage tax of 30 per cent., a sales tax of 20 per cent., and an income tax of 10 per cent., on all goods shipped from Australia to Fiji. That proposal could not be accepted by the Governor of F i j i . It would have involved additional tax to the extent of 60 per cent, on all Australian goods exported to F i j i .

The two previous speakers' have reintervals.

Five acres is regarded as the largest area which one banana-grower can attend to, and, therefore, of all the ment the quantity of Fijian fruit imprimary industries in Australia,-bananaported into Australia has not reached growing definitely lends itself to closer the stipulated 40,000 centals. This is settlement. If a man can obtain land not due entirely to the primage and sales suitable for the cultivation of this fruit, tax. When Fijian bananas were first he may make a living on a smaller area brought in, after the Ottawa agreement, than is required by a man engaged in they were a novelty, and the public practically any other form of primary bought them eagerly; but now the production. It may surprise some honorboasted superiority in favour of the Gros able members to know that more bananas Michel banana of F i j i is no longer aro now grown in New South Wales than generally recognized, and the public is in Queensland. Most of the increase in even showing a preference for bananas acreage has occurred on the Tweed grown in Australia. One reason why the River, where a short time ago the local quantity imported has not reached unemployed were totally absorbed, owing 40,000 centals is that the public to the extension of the areas devoted to has discovered that the quality of the banana-growing. It shoidd not be forFijian fruit is not so high as it had gotten that this industry has helped to been led to believe. It is claimed that an extent to solve the great problem of the drop in prices here is due to overprounemployment. Under the present proposal, F i j i is of the smaller sizes.

If that course is inspection charges. It may be argued followed some action will have to be that these concessions do not amount to taken much, and one of the main contentions of the Government is that F i j i supto the Government a method of plies only about 2J per cent, of the total dealing with the matter. An arrangequantity of bananas consumed in Ausment was entered into with the last Gotralia. queried, but even allowing that that customs duty, which would be £5,000 if Does he say that able prices again rule another shipment The trouble is not a year, but to the fall in prices caused by large quantities of Fijian bananas being marketed at I admit that since the Ottawa agreeduction and the marketing of fruit in regard to the fruit so eliminated, and I shall suggest The figures have been vernment that the amount received in P i j i sent over the full 40,000 centals at 2s. 6d. a central, should be made available to the industry for the purpose of improving its marketing arrangements and helping it in other ways. I give that government full credit for agreeing to make that money available; the assistance rendered was in conformity with that given to other primary industries; but the full amount has not been received by the industry. Speaking from memory, I believe that about £1,600 was allocated last year. As the Australian industry is able to supply the whole of the local market with fruit of the first quality-ther e is actual overproduction-somethin g should be done by the Government to compensate the growers for the quantity of Australian bananas which would be eliminated if this further concession be made to F i j i . If , in the interests of better trade relations with F i j i , the Government considers that this concession is necessary, I make the alternative constructive suggestion that the Australian industry be assisted as have been the citrus, apple and other industries, with the object of devising means for the disposal of the quantity of local fruit displaced by imports from F i j i . Further investigation might be made by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research into the handling of by-products on a commercial basis. Flour, coffee and other commodities have been made from bananas, but I do not know whether they can be produced as a commercial proposition, and the matter is well worth consideration. The president of the Banana Growers' Federation of New South Wales has written to me on the subject, and I understand that communication couched in similar terms has also been sent to the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) and the Minister for Commerce. That federation makes two requests, one of which is for the development of by-products to the extent of the displacement of local bananas by imports from F i j i . The letter goes on to sayThe possibilities of such a by-products ineven by Queensland. dustry are largely experimental, and a large sura of money would have to be spent, first of all to discover the attractive by-product, secondly, to process same, and thirdly, to establish them on the markets. I suggest that the Federal Government should make available llr. R. Green. by some method a sufficient sum of money to implement this proposal. I do not know, speaking off-hand, what sum would be required; I Bhould Bay probably £10,000. That would not be a particularly large sum to spend on this important industry. The figures supplied by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) show that 8,000 persons are directly engaged in banana-growing. The advance would not go directly to the grower, but he would be indirectly benefited. The expenditure would amount to about £1 a head, which is not exorbitant. The letter goes on to sayIf this was done I would personally endeavour to get our own growers to acquiesce in the remission of the charges of which Fiji is complaining. I recognize, of course, that the Commonwealth Government has power to do as it thinks fit without any such acquiescence, but should it do so, such action on its part is bound to leave bitter feelings behind. Would it not be much better to retain the goodwill of those who are engaged in the industry in Australia, than unnecessarily to antagonize them? They are being definitely antagonized by this action of the Government. I am advised by the writer of this letter that on the 28th November last he wired the Prime Minister as follows:Connexion proposal l if t primage sales tax F i j i bananas respectfully request you call conference of interests concerned before taking any action. Position banana industry present time owing to glutted markets causing growers grave anxiety. Would appreciate opportunity discussion. The door is still open to the Government to confer with the industry with respect to that portion of its product which is now being forced off the market by the enjoyment of this concession by F i j i . I commend, not only bo the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page), but also to the Government generally, the offer of the Banana Growers Federation, which has in its ranks practically every grower in New South Wales who markets bananas. As the honourable member for Moreton has said, New South Wales produces at the present time a greater quantity of banaua3 than is produced I regret that the Government has seen fit to again antagonize this industry. I fought the concession given to F i j i when the Ottawa agreement was being considered a little over two years ago. This is a further concession, and one that is unnecessary. For that reason, I shall support in every way, and hope that the House will also, the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, which in effect means the withdrawal of the bill. Downs) [4.53] I have considerable sympathy with the banana-growors in the position in which they are placed. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr be an effective quota. The intention was Francis) has put the case for them, considering the circumstances, 'temperately and reasonably. This, I feel, is really part of a greater question. Australia is now contemplating entering into trade treaties. The first thing which Australians have to bear iii mind is that the conof trade, other imposts have to be met. tinent on behalf of which the Government is negotiating has a wide range of climate and of products, and the Government has the responsibility of giving to every part of it a fair chance to develop. The tropical and sub-tropical areas must be developed and effectively occupied if we want to hold Australia, and that involves the establishment of industries as an essential part of our national life. Such a policy has been followed from the inception of federation, and is a vital consideration to-day. Therefore, I suggest that in the making of these trade treaties there is borne in mind, not only the necessities of to-day, but also the development of Australia in the years to come. In dealiug with industries, particularly those that are primary in character and engage people in occupations on the land, Australians ought to be careful to see that there is not given away a part of the real national development which enables us to populate and occupy this country. In that category, I would place particularly the banana, cotton, sugar, and a number of other industries that I could mention. The impression left on my mind by the making of the Ottawa agreement was that 40,000 centals represented the limit of imports from F i j i which the Government was prepared to sanction. I say, emphatically, that I stand very strongly for preferential arrangements within the Empire. I want to see them developed. But at the same time, as Great Britain has said that, so far as its agricultural industries are concerned, it must look first to Great Britain, then to the Empire, and then across the seas, so Australia must be pardoned for saying that in regard to its tropical industries it must look first to its own development. I gathered from the speech of the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett), that when a quota of 40,000 centals was fixed, the spirit of the agreement was that it should to put the growers of F i j i on the same footing as Australian growers, with the exception that they should pay an import duty of 2s. 6d. a central. Apparently, however, the negotiators on both sides' overlooked the fact that, in the course One of those is the sales tax, and another is the primage duty of 10 per cent. duty was not overlooked, but the sales tax was. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -Quaran tine charges were also overlooked. We are now informed that the Government is giving this concession in order to observe the spirit of the agreement. There is, therefore, something to be said in favour of the action the Government is taking. The negotiators of trade agreements naturally desire the spirit of the agreements to be honorably observed. The Minister said, by interjection, a few minutes ago, that primage duty was not overlooked at Ottawa, but while the rate of primage duty at the time the Ottawa agreement was made could not be regarded as normal, it must surely have been realized that a normal rate of primage duty would always be imposed.

I consider that these producers should be given a definite assurance by -Jie Government that no further concessions of any kind will be given to the banana-growers of F i j i . Our banana growers have organized their industry in a remarkably efficient manner, and their methods of cultivation and marketing are most commendable.

Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -It applies to industries generally. A great deal of capital has been invested in the banana industry in Queensland. Further, a great deal of employment has been provided, and an efficient co-operative marketing developed by it. Every endeavour has been made to ensure that only bananas of a high standard will be placed on the market. I am sorry that the marketing arrangements of the New South Wales banana-growers are not as satisfactory as those of Queensland. An industry of this description should be organized on a nation-wide and not a State basis. I hope that the Government will give sympathic consideration to the earnest and eloquent requests made by the honourable member for Moreton, and by the representatives of the banana-growers who waited on him to-day, for an assurance that no further concessions would be given to the banana-growers outside Australia. [5.7] I hope that this bill will be withdrawn. Otherwise serious additional"" disabilities must fall on the banana growers of Queensland, who are already bearing serious privations in consequence of the great development of the industry at a time when the purchasing power of tlie market was not sufficient to absorb the increased production. Those engaged in tliis industry have developed an efficient marketing organization and are offering for sale only high quality bananas, and they should therefore be given every consideration. I do not agree with the statement of the Minister in charge of this bill ( Sir Henry Gullett), that the passage of this bill will not open the way for additional imports of bananas into Australia. 1 consider that the intentions of the Ottawa Agreement have already been fulfilled. It up to 40,000 centals of bananas at a duty of 2s. 6d. per central. Notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary, it must have been realized at that time that the usual imposts on trade of that description were to be met. Ever since the ratification of that agreement, I have endeavoured by interviews and correspondence to get the Government to give an assurance that nothing further would be done to encourage the importation of F i j i bananas, and not long ago I received a definite undertaking on that point. In view of the fact that the representatives of the British Government at Ottawa made concessions to F i j i in regard to the sugar it marketed organization has been in Great Britain greater than those made to Australia, I do not think our representatives at Ottawa need have made any concessions to F i j i in regard to bananas. Greater assistance is rendered to the Fijian sugar producers for the sugar they export to Great Britain, than is received by our sugar producers for-the surplus sugar that they send to that market. For this reason the sugar-growers of Queensland, who are operating on small areas from six to ten acres, are entitled to assume that they were making a sacrifice which rendered unnecessary the granting of further concessions to the Fijian banana industry. I do not criticize the British Government for having made a substantial concession to F i j i in",45,Henby Gullett

110,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"respect of sugar. In this regard the following extract from The Dominion Office and Colonial Office List for 1984 in respect of Fijian trade to Great Britain is interesting:Tlie improvement in trade is due mainly to for organizing themselves as the bananaincreased sugar production. The agreements arrived at at Ottawa have placed the sugar industry in a very sound position. The people of F i j i could surely continue, without complaint, the trade that they aro at present doing with Australia in manufactured goods. Evidently F i j i does not place much importance upon its banana trade with Australia, because in 1928, when the duty of 8s. 4d. per central on bananas totally prohibited the entry of any F i j i bananas to Australia, our trade with that country was valued at £621,396, whereas now, it is valued at a little over £400,000. Tbe Minister referred to certain preferences which F i j i bad granted to Australian products at Ottawa, hut I point out that F i j i merely accorded to Australian products tlie same treatment as it accorded to Canadian products. The statement of the Minister that the passage of this bill would not seriously affect the interests of the Australian banana-growers is not acceptable to me. AsF i j i has sent to Australia in the last year or two only about 30 per cent, of its annual quota of 40,000 centals, it will be seen that the passage of this bill would probably lead to an increase of such imports by 70 per cent. These goods must enter into competition with the Australian product, and so limit the market for our growers to that extent. I am aware that the industry is suffering very mudh at the moment, and I regrei that anything should be done to inflict further pain upon the unfortunate growers. Their plight is due in no small degree to over-production brought about by the lack of co-OTdination in the industry itself, but also to the absence of constitutional power to bring about an Australia-wide organization to control the expansion of the industry, extend it* marketing possibilities, and increase the price of bananas. the banana-growers had a perfect organization. Queensland we have an organization, but, unlike the honourable gentleman, I am not sanguine of influencing the whole of the Commonwealth to adopt a Bimilar scheme. I hope, however, that the wheat-growers will see the necessity growers in Queensland have done. Those in the Wide Bay electorate can send their fruit past Sydney to the Melbourne and Adelaide markets at times, and they can do this successfully. Yet growers at Lismore and Coff's Harbour, in New South Wales, often find difficulty in marketing their product in Sydney. That being the case, the difficulty of the grower on our North Coast, who has to send to Melbourne and Adelaide, can be understood. As to the return the growers receive, I have figures relating to the Murwillumbah growers. Last season they sent 300,000 cases to Sydney, which, at 15s. a case, resulted in a gross return of £225,000. Thij, season they increased the number of cases to 450,000 which, with the Queensland product, created a glut on the Sydney market, causing the price to drop to about 10s. a case. The growers thus received no more for the additional 150,000 cases than they had received for the smaller quantity in the previous season. Banana-growers generally get very little for their product to-day. Frequently they have to forgo a little to help pay for transport. The growers have to pay additional handling costs on the greater bulk of bananas transported, for which they receive less money. The cost of transport to the New South Wales market is 7s. 4d. a case. For 450,000 cases at 10s., the Murwillumbah growers received £56,000 against £112,000 for 350,000 cases at 15s. a case in the previous season. The worse difficulty of the Queensland growers is the great increase of production in New South Wales. In 1928, there were 1,900 acres under banana cultivation in New South Wales; hy 1934 the acreage had grown to 22,000 acres, without provision for an expansion of the market. New plantings in Queensland grew from 7,500 acres in 1928 to 19,000 acres in 1534. After making provision for the cutting out of old plantations, there are 15,000 acres under cultivation in that State to-day. During the last ten months the industry in both States has produced 1,198,976 cases, and for a",46,Henby Gullett

The honourable member's predecessor moved that the duty be increased to 13s. 4d. a central. rate my predecessor was recognized as the arch-protector of the industry. In those days there were a great many banana-growers in the Lilley electorate, but following upon the redistribution of electoral boundaries most of the growers are now in the electorate of Wide Bay. In my attitude towards this measure [ am not greatly concerned as to whether there are in my electorate a g'-eat many growers or a few. With other honourable members, I am concerned about the unhappy future of those engaged in this most important industry. When the Ottawa agreement was given effect to in this HouseI was not here; I was passing through a period of enforced furlough. However, I read with the keenest interest the debates which took place when the various agreements arising out of the Ottawa Conference came before Parliament for ratification. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, pointed out that under the Ottawa agreement Australia undertook to admit 40,000 centals of Eijian bananas each year at a duty of 2s. 6d. a central, which is approximately 2s. a case. In return for this concession the Fijian Government agreed to accord Australia the benefit of the British preferential tariff throughout the entire range of its tariff schedule, and to place Australia on a list of British countries which were receiving special tariff preferences under the Fijian tariff in respect of twenty items of importance to Australia. Prior to that agreement being reached, these special preferences were granted only to the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Hong Kong. In these special items alone there is a trade worth £38,000 to Australia. It has been claimed by F i j i that the concessions granted by AusI t was only after the most strenuous tralia to Fijian bananas were rendered almost nugatory owing to the incidence of taxation other than the import duty. Apparently it is felt by the Fijian people that they have not received from Australia an equitable return for the concessions accorded to Australia by F i j i in the terms of the Ottawa agreement. The Minister has emphasized our favorable trade position with F i j i , and 'has pointed out that, during the last seven years, while we have imported from F i j i goods to the average value of only £42,334 a year we have exported to that colony goods valued at £419,154 a year. This leaves a very substantial annual balance in our favour. Moreover, our annual exports to F i j i include £320,000 worth of goods of purely Australian origin, which disposes of the contention that our trade with that colony is largely a re-export one. I am sure that every honourable membei will admit that the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties must evince a spirit of reciprocity if anything at all is to be achieved. It is hopeless to try to make trade treaties with other countries that will enable us to dispose of our exportable products unless we give something in return, and it is often found that by giving a little one gains a great deal. As for the banana-growers of Queensland and northern parts of New South Wales, I feel for them the very greatest concern. I know many of them personally, and I am aware of the almost hopeless position with which they are faced. When the increased duty was imposed in 1921 on imported bananas the growers were given great hope, and thousands of ex-members of the Australian Imperial Force entered the industry which they thought offered a suitable avenue for establishing themselves in civil life. Banana-growing is strenuous work, and demands almost ceaseless exertion from a man who wishes to cultivate his plantation properly. Most' of the plantations cling to the sides of mountains. A few years after the imposition of the 1921 duty, diseases of various kinds broke out in the plantations resulting in the almost entire failure of the crop in Northern New South Wales. efforts by experts attached to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research",48,Corser Th E Realize That Australia Is A Country Enjoy

The growers started again with renewed hope, and then came the decision to admit a stipulated quantity of Fijian bananas under the terms, of the Ottawa agreement. I do not think that that arrangement ever had any very serious effect upon the market for bananas in Australia, because the Fijian growers never exported to Australia in any one year the full quantity permitted under the agreement. Fijian bananas amounted to less than 30 per cent, of the stipulated quantity. ever, the undoubted object of this hill ia to make it possible for Fijian growers to export to Australia the full, quota of 40,000 central.

I ber for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton treaties: with other countries^ we must be particularly careful to watch the in1 terests of our own tropical industries, because such industries are carried on in other countries under conditions vastly different from those which prevail here.

If we could so increase the purchasing power of the people as to make it possible for every small boy to eat a banana when he wanted to, or when it was good for him, the problem of finding a market for our Australian bananas would be solved at once* I am opposed to lifting the sales tax on Fijian bananas because we would thereby give an unfair advantage to an imported product over the product of one of our own industries.

The proposal to remove sales tax and* primage from! bananas imported from Fiji was h'o't disclosed during the recent federal election. quently discussed during the three years prior to the dissolution, and we were fissured by the honourable member for Moreton( If f . Francis)', who was then an Assistant Minister, and also the present Minister for Trade and Cusiom's ( Mr throw away even that percentage', having White), as, well as the, Mnuster in charge of this bill ( Sir Henry Gullett); that no further concession would be granted .in respect of. imports of bananas from F i j i . The Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties interjected a moment ago that we were, pre 1 pared to sell Australian good? to blacklabour countries. That was the position when a national government imposed a duty of Sis. 4d. per central on bananas. Tbe then Minister for Trade and Customs( Sir Walter Massy-Greene) explained that the duty was designed' to establish the 1 industry and to enable returned soldiers to enter ft. It was felt that such a duty would ensure Australian growers a market for their product. Following the [13 DECEMBER, 1934. ] (Fiji Imports) Bill. 1245 imposition of that duty, the Queensland Government opened up hew country arid settled retarned soldiers upon it to engage ih the production.of bananas. The concession, made under the Ottawa agreement, by which F i j i was permitted to land 40-,000 centals of .bananas in Australia at 2s. 6d„ a central, was a big blow to the local industry. The higher duty had then been in operation for ten years-, and the stage of, over-production had just been reached. The granting of this coiir cession to black-grown bananas rendered it impossible fpr Australian growers to compete profitably with them on the local market. Labour^ and transport costs in Australia are very much higheT than they are in F i j i , and, not only bananas,, but the produce of other Australian primary industries suffer because of high freights. I shall I am afr aid. tliat the banana-growers of Australia will not be able to carry on if Fijian bananas are allowed to come in at 2s. 6d. per central and free 6f primage and sales tax.

Thus a further preference of 16 per cent, is to be given to them. The representatives of the banana-growing districts view this proposal with much alarm. We have been told that this concession is being granted because of the adverse trade balance. Next year the Government may make a further attack on this industry on the same plea. Are the banana growers to be hounded off the land? Many industries have practically been sacrificed as the result of quick changes of government that take place in the Commonwealth. comes in and proceeds to give effect to its protectionist policy under which industries are set up and give promise of expanding. Three years later that government is beaten at the polls and another administration comes in with an entirely different fiscal policy, which gives rise to a lack of confidence on the part of people who would otherwise engage in secondary industries. Prior to the arrangement for the admission of 1 40,000 centals of bananas from F i j i under the lower rate of duty, the Government of Queensland opened up new country and encouraged men to settle on it and cultivate bananas. In 1929, when I first travelled through Kyogle to Sydney, the hills in the neighbourhood of Coif's Harbour were heavily timbered. To-day practically all those hills have been cleared and converted into banana plantations. Are the people who have settled there, and all others who have been induced to enter the industry, to be sacrificed? Surely we are not going to sacrifice our primary as well as our secondary industries? The honourable member for Lilley( Sir Donald Cameron) remarked that the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) holds a difficult portfolio. He certainly has a thankless task to perform, and his actions are open to much criticism; but if production is to be restricted, I suggest .that the banana-growers should not be forced out of production by the granting of concessions to other countries. Instead of giving £6,000 for the elimination of a disease which was imported from Fiji in Ifr. Riordan. the first instance, we should consider thv utilization of the money for the purpose of assisting the banana-growers to take up other industries. Certain honourable members on the Government side, when in Opposition, strongly objected to the admission of 40,000 centals of Fijian bananas per annum. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis), when a Minister of the Lyons Government, almost shed tears in defending the Government's action in agreeing to the importation of that quantity. He said that the Government was doing everything possible to develop the industry. He went to Brisbane, and an inspired resolution was carried there, thanking A new government him for the assistance which he had rendered to the banana-growers; but, when they held a large meeting in the Brisbane Town Hall, the Minister had urgent business to attend to in Canberra. He said that he did not wish to give away Cabinet secrets, but he had opposed the admission of 40,000 centals of bananas a year from F i j i . The only practical way to assist the industry is to vote against the present proposal. Last session the industry had no help from the honourable member for Moreton, but the members of the Country party gave it f u l l support. To-day the position is different, because members of the Country party share ministerial office with members of the TJnited Australia party. Prior to the last election the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) said that he could not work with the Country party, yet he finds himself in harmony with it to-day in the attack on the banana industry. Members of the Country party were returned to this Parliament to protect, not to sacrifice, the primary producers. Ministers stated at the election that, if returned, they would not reduce the protection accorded to Australian industries, and the Country party declared that the protection .now granted was too high. Evidently a compromise has been reached, and the Countn party is prepared further to sacrifice the banana industry for the sake of office. protection and development of the banana industry in Austraha seriously injure Western Australia in two directions.

Bruce was Prime Minister, he admitted the unfairness of this position, and regretted that the Constitution imposed such conditions on Western Australia. ment of Queensland or Eijian bananas to Western Australia is not a commercial proposition. When, in 1921, the duty was increased from 2s. 6d. to 8s. 4d. per central, I opposed the higher impost on the ground of the loss of trade that would be sustained with another portion of tbe British Empire. Australia then enjoyed a favorable trade with F i j i , the balance in its favour being about £750,000 a year. Australia needed that trade. It is surprising to me that the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) and the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) seem to attach tremendous importance to the banana industry. They say nothing about the unfairness of increasing the cost of this fruit to the children of the poor. This industry does not bring any new capital into this country, and in that respect it stands in strong contrast to the wheat industry, which the royal commission stated brought new capital into Australia during the depression to the amount of £23,000,000 a year. I am justified in agreeing to the Government's proposal. It is not an extreme action to allow 40,000 centals of bananas to be imported into Australia from F i j i each year. We cannot afford to lose our trade with that country; to do so would be to injure the best interests of the working man and everybody else in Australia, because we may, eventually, place ouramount collected by way of customs duty selves in such a position that no country upon bananas imported into Western will trade with us.

Thanks to a number of young fruit-growers who transferred their activities from Queensland to Carnarvon, Western Australia is now supplying a large quantity of its own bananas, instead of having to meet all its requirements by importations from the Dutch East Indies. more bananas from the East than Australia obtains from F i j i . ern Australia is not destroying its trade with the Dutch East Indies by growing bananas. The balance of trade with that country is still against Australia. The Hooding of Western Australian markets with bananas from the Dutch East Indies would receive scant support to-day in my electorate, and in the electorate of Perth. Bananas are supplied to the residents of all the capital cities at remarkably low prices. I have seen good fruit displayed for sale at 3d. a dozen, so the Queensland growers must receive a very small reward for their labour. In 1931-32, the duty paid on bananas brought into Western Australia from the Dutch East Indies amounted to £6,000. At that time the people throughout the rest of Australia paid no duty at all on bananas. Since only £3,000 was paid last year in duty on this fruit, the industry in Western Australia considers that £6,000 a year should be allowed by the Commonwealth Government as a specific grant to help it to become established on a firmer basis. There are several problems in the cultivation of bananas in Western Australia. The high winds experienced in the localities where they are grown necessitate the erection of brush fences 20 feet high. Sittinq suspended from 6.16 to 8 p.m. Australia was £6,000.

135,Mr A. Green,"In 1931-32 theThe industry is a difficult and costly one to establish in Western Australia because all the water Used on the plantations is taken from tlie bed of the river; on account of the comparatively low rainfall. Although the initial troubles are Being overcome, the men engaged in it are poor and struggling. I trust the Government Will agree to this suggestion. my intention to support the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde). I believe that bananas of good quality can be grown in Australia to the fullest extent of the requirements of our people, and that consequently there i« no necessity for imports from F i j i . According t'o the Brisbane Courier-Mail, this section of the Ottawa agreement was given effect, not at the request, but ih opposition to the wishes of the people of F i j i . adorable gentleman that that is not 'BO. ports from F i j i have been few, they have been sufficient to create bad feeling. Some members of the Country party are inconsistent in their attitude towards this matter. One whom I could name supported the granting of assistance to wheat-gr6wers, but now seems to have fallen fpul of his friends'; or his friends have fallen foul of the banana-growers. If the people who so desire are, denied the right to make a living in . this industry, they will become competitive with workers in other occupations, or, will have to accept government relief work, or the dole. That would be deplorable. It is suggested that, F i j i is ""a part of 'the British Empire. That is so; but it is not a very free part. The labour employed there is not much better than those who are responsible for it ; it is black labour of the cheapest possible kind. I do not believe that Australia is .justified in supporting 'an industry in which that class of labour is employed. Only those who own plantations in F i j i desire this concession; it gives them *a market for a ! portion of their output. The bananagrowing industry is as much entitled as any other primary industry to 'Government support. It 'supplies a necessary and very valuable -food. Y'et, in common With industries of a lik*, character, it is denied the right td expand. Admittedly; it does not produce the same amount of wealth as other industries, such as the wheat and wool industries; but it provides a living for many people, afad a greater number could be absorbed in it-. I represent a purely rural electorate} in which there is not one secondary industry. It contains a few small butter factories, but the major portion of it is devoted to sugar and bahana-gr'owi&g, and dairying. I h the Tully area there is plenty of scope for the growing of good quality bananas, but competition against F i j i is not possible.

From the point of view oi the Government, ""that redistribution was the finest thing that 'could hate happened, because it. removed from the Lilley electorate all the banana-growerB on the north c'oa'st of Queensland. I believe that the decision of ex-Speaker Mackay to retire from politics was ^dictated hy his unwillingness tq face the hostility of those people. I know something of them, and can say that their temper has heen roused by this action of .the Government. I have no hesitation in asserting that it would take the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties much longer to explain to them the reason for the granting of this concession, and how it is going to assist them, than it took him to explain to this House last night his attitude towards the flour tax. There is no doubt '""-it additional imports of bananas from T-; ''i wiH have a further had effect on the industry in Australia.

143,Sir Henry Gullett,"Every1250 Sales Tax Assessment continues to increase as it has in recent years, it would appear that even if Denmark were totally excluded from the British market, a profitable price level in that market could not be maintained. The granting of this small but cession to F i j i was an endeavour by the Government to expand our overseas markets. In return for this concession F i j i granted substantial concessions to Australian products and, I am glad to gay, to Australian manufactured products in particular. Our trade in this regard with tbe Pacific Islands generally, the Dutch East Indies, Malaya and other countries farther up the Asiatic coast has developed greatly. As the honourable member for Lilley( Sir Donald Cameron) said in the course of his speech this afterresentatives have made during this debate noon, we must be prepared to make some sacrifices in order to develop our overseas trade. Vo sell goods to these other countries. We send special commissioners and commercial agents to other countries with the object of promoting the sale of our goods, but apparently some honourable members are entirely opposed to the purchase of any overseas products. The opposition to this measure has oome principally from the representatives of Queensland constituencies who do not seem to realize that Queensland has benefited probably more than any other State by the Ottawa agreement in the sale of sugar, beef, mutton, lamb, butter and other products. If the maximum quantity of Fijian bananas admissible under this concession actually came upon the Australian market it would represent only 2$ per oent. of the total Australian consumption and, as an out-and-out protectionist, I assert that, as a general principle, a competition of 2^ per cent, or a little more is a very good thing for local industries in that it tends to keep both quality aud prices right. A competition of less than % i per cent, could have hardly any influence. F i j i seut to Australia last year only £4,000 worth of bananas, although its full quota would be valued at about £12,000. I cannot understand why there has been such a set [REPRESE! fTATIVES.] (Fiji Imports) BiU. against F i j i , for laBt year we imported more than £9,000 worth of bananas from Norfolk Island and nearly £11,000 worth from Java, most of which went to Western Australia. I assure honourable members that there is no connection beextraordinarily profitable contween this bill and the so-called threat of the elective members of the Legislative Assembly of F i j i . I mentioned that aspect of the subject in introducing this bill because unless we act reasonably we shall find that sooner oi» later Australian goods will be boycotted. We are proposing in this measure to accord to F i j i only the same treatment that we accord to New Zealand. In reply to the somewhat alarmist statements that certain Queensland repregarding the possible effect of this measure on the banana industry of that State, I propose to read some paragraphs from leading articles that have appeared recently in the principal Brisbane daily newspapers. The Telegraph, like other newspapers, lives upon, its circulation and in order to have a circulation it must enjoy a certain measure of popularity. If this proposal ran counter so seriously to the welfare of a Queensland industry,the daily newspapers of Brisbane could hardly be expected to regard it with any sympathy whatever. YetI direct the attention of honourable members to the following paragraph which appeared in the leading article of the Telegraph on the 26th November:For our part, we cannot help thinking that much more couM be done-preferabl y by the growers themselves-to stimulate this important branch of the fruit industry. It seems odd that the -vhole of the supplies in Western Australia have to be obtained from abroad, and subject to an import duty of 8s. 4d. per central, plus, we assume, sales tax and primage duty, if there is actually a glut of Australian bananas. It will be seen that the Telegraph is somewhat critical of the method of marketing the bananas of Queensland, and considers that practically the whole of the Western Australian banana trade might, under different management, be obtained for Queensland. In its leading article on the 21et November the Telegraph statedAt the present time the Federal Government is engaged in the task of overhauling the tariff. It contemplates the making of trade",55,Corser Th E Realize That Australia Is A Country Enjoy

145,Sir Henry Gullett,"That is so.treaties with other countries with the object of enlarging the Australian export trade. For this purpose it is necessary to gain the goodwill of present and prospective customers abroad. Concessions must be made. Inward trade must be recognized as the natural and inevitable corollary of outward trade, Australia must buy if she is to sell. We thought that Mr Smith had returned from the United Kingdom a few months ago with the knowledge of this fact firmly implanted in his mind; but now he seems to think that Australia may be law unto itself and should take up the truculent attitude of disregarding the wishes or intentions or threats of othei countries. ter stonewalling the bill? doing so. I am replying to argumenth used in the debate this afternoon,-and I hope that after to-night they will be put to bed for evermore. The Telegraph also stated in the leading article from which I have just quotedWith due respect to the Premier's desire to safeguard Queensland interests it may be said that it is unwise to suggest that Australia should disregard the feelings of other countries in matters of trade. The small concessions in regard to F i j i bananas which are contemplated in the remission of sales tax and primage duty, seem to be viewed with exaggerated apprehension, for the importation of this f r u it from F i j i under the Ottawa tions in various diseases and pests of the agreement has been far below the quantity allowable, and it is plain that the effect upon local sales cannot have been serious. Yet the report of these minor concessions has almost raised a panic. It is asserted that growers in Australia now are in a precarious state; that the market is glutted; that producers are unable to make profits. In the first place, this is a grave commentary upon the system of "" organized marketing"" which hoe been a Queensland boast for many long years, bolstered by elaborate legislative and bureaucratic machinery; and if the industry is in such a parlous state as is represented, this suggests the failure of the politicians and bureaucrats to produce the results which their operations were designed and confidently expected to produce. from a newspaper which is largely conthe comments of the Courier-MaiM and I find that the Courier-Mail made the following statements in an editorial on the 22nd November:The new concession is certainly inopportune, but there is a case for regarding it as "" due on demand"". Sales tax and primage are not normal charges. Applied to imports they increase t h t protective effect of tariffs, and under the Ottawa agreement the Commonwealth acknowledged an obligation to the United Kingdom to remove them as soon as practicable, but a stronger argument is that F i j i trade is worth £347,000 a year to Australia, having risen to that figure in 1932-33 from £268,000 in 1931-32; and the imports we took from F i j i in 1932-33 amounted to only £31,600, iucluding bananas. The Federal Government agreed in 1932 to devote the customs revenue collected on F i j i bananas to a fund to assist the Australian banana-growing industry, and there w ill be that compensation for the filling of the Ottawa quota. But the chiei security ol Australian banana-growers remains what it was before-the specific undertaking that no more than 40,000 centals of F i j i bananas shall be admitted to Australia in a single year. The Courier-Mail, which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition invited me to quote, fully supports the action of the Government. In reply to the criticism of the use of the revenue derived from the taxation of F i j i bananas I point out that although £5,000 was expected annually from this source, the amount actually received has been substantially less; but all the money so collected has been made available to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for investigabanana industry. The Government has decided to continue these investigations, and £1,500 has been made available for next year-for this purpose, irrespective of whether any money is obtained from the taxation of imported bananas. supplemented ? cipated that after these trifling concessions have been made the amount of money derived from the duty will be employed for these investigations.

Debate resumed from 12th December (vide page 1087), on motion by Mr by direction finders, sometimes consisting of That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is full of promise and is likely to be the most fruitfu l of those which have been introduced by the present Government. It provides for a scientific examination of a large tract of country north of the 22nd parallel of latitude with the object of making new mineral discoveries in remote areas that present too many difficulties foi the ordinary prospector to overcome. The system to be adopted is entirely new so far as prospecting for gold in Australia is concerned. In the early days in Victoria and Western Australia it was usual to send out a prospector provided with a tin dish, a shovel and what was known as a "" grub stake "" of £1 a week, with which to purchase food. If the prospector made a rich discovery then he participated in it. Recently, however, there has come into use what is known as the geophysical method of prospecting. Although it is as yet far from perfect it gives possibilities of greater gold discoveries than the world has ever known. Dr. A. C. Rivett, one of the chief ""executive officers of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Researeh, recently published a pamphlet on the subject which every honourable member should read, and which cannot be too freely advertised. In this pamphlet Dr. Rivett suggests a way out of our present difficulties. Australia, because it is more highly mineralized than any other country, even allowing for the very rich and wide occurrences of gold in the Transvaal, offers, in the opinion of Dr. Rivett, a greater opportunity for prospecting under this system than any other country. Laymen might well be excused for asking for an explanation of geophysical prospecting. I do not think I could do better than quote for the information of honourable members, a paragraph or two from a book entitled Applied Geophysics, by Eve and Keys, in which in a few plain but graphic words, the authors indicate what this latest scientific method of prospecting for minerals meansDuring the Great War the .position of airships and of airplanes was found a t night sound reflectors, sometimes of wireless detectors. Guns in France were located within a few yards, though miles away, by sound rangers employing fine wires cooled by puffs of air caused by the sound of gun fire, so that the electrical resistance of the wires was slightly but measurably affected. To-day most ocean-going ships are fitted with wireless apparatus by which they can obtain their bearings in cloudy weather or fog. Directional wireless rays of a fairly narrow beam are employed to guide pilots on their path. The detection of submarines during the war afforded a difficult problem, which admitted of several solutions with varying effectiveness . . . If then we can locate the hidden submarine by its noise, its o i l patches, by its electrochemical properties, its magnetic effects, its electro-magnetic effects, or by sound reflected or echoed from it , is there any reason why we should not detect an underground body by some of these methods? Indeed, a mineral vein ha8 one great advantage; it is stationary, and does not move away like a submarine. Once located we can remain above its neighbourhood and study its behaviour under stimulus, with variation of treatment. Geophysics also offers indirect aids to geologist and miner, such as the discovery of faults where one region has moved up or down or sideways with respect to another region Upon this system, in my opinion, depends the making of big discoveries of goldbearing country in Australia. It is often asked why so many discoveries of goldbearing country were made in the first few years of gold-mining in Victoria, Western Australia, and Queensland. The average layman thinks that, because discoveries are not being made to-day as quickly as they were in the early days, the gold-bearing areas in Australia have been exhausted. The plain truth is that a prospector in the years goue by set out to discover an outcrop-place s where rocks had been thrust through the surface of the earth by nature. These, being on the surface, were of course easily discovered. All those in the inhabited parts of Australia have long since been found and tested. In Western Australia new outcrops have been seen, but I believe that big discoveries will be made iri the future by the application of a system such as that for which this bill provides.

Country which could not be explored by the ordinary prospector, because of his inability to find the necessary funds, will be opened up in this way. The proposal is that the Government of Western Australia and Queensland-and this is the only occasion on which two States have combined for such a purpose-shal l each contribute to the fund £37,500, or £75,000 in all, and that a similar amount shall be Gepp-of the Development and Migracontributed by tbe Commonwealth, making a total of £150,000 available for this purpose. Such an amount has often been frittered away on one mine, floated .with the idea of passing something on to credulous investors, the promoters themselves knowing that there was no gold on the property. But by this expenditure of £150,000 it is hoped we shall be able to explore successfully not less than 30,000 square miles of country at the rate, I think, of 3,000 square miles a year. first year; thereafter we shall speed up. will be spread over a period of years, and ultimately an area one-third the size of Victoria will have been fairly well examined. I do not propose to enter into an explanation of the method that is to he adopted. Briefly, as outlined in the book to which I have referred, it may be said that electrodes-that is to say, the terminals or poles of a galvanic battery, usually charged by an engine, so as to give a fairly high current^ are placed in the ground where ore bodies are thought to exist, and a discharge of electricity is of forced into the earth. Where the current is carried with good conduction-as might be expected from copper wire-the presumption is that a mineral body exists there. I think we may reasonably be a little optimistic in regard to this experiment. A great deal of optimism is required by those who go in search of gold. It is about the only commodity in the world the price of which has increased of late years; it is now worth about twice as much as it was a few years ago. wants gold, marketing, transport, or storage difficulties to be encountered in connection with the industry. As Dr. Rivett has pointed out, it opens a possible way by which Australia could relieve itself of its great overseas debt. Some years ago an imperial geophysical experimental survey was carried out in Australia under the joint auspices of the British Empire Marketing Board and the Commonwealth Government, by arrangetion Commission. From the middle of 1929 until February, 1930, under Mr Broughton Edge, the party made a search in about twenty localities. One naturally asks whether any practical results were obtained from their investigations, and it must be admitted that no great discoveries were then made. At Northampton, in Western Australia, localities were pointed out where lead might be found, and bodies of ore were actually discovered. Five or six surveys were made in the vicinity of Canberra, including Captain's Flat. I had expected that the party would visit the Golden Mile, which is the richest known auriferous belt in Australia, in search of new lodes. Although men have been working continuously in the old Boulder mine with the most modern machinery, they have discovered, within a comparatively small area, lodes the existence of which was previously unknown, although mining operations had been carried on there actively for 40 years. Gold-bearing lodes, unless they are highly mineralized, are .not easily discovered by geophysical methods. Germany and Sweden have reaped great benefit from the application this system in their quest for mineral deposits, such as iron. For about eighteen years an intensive search was made in Sweden for the purpose of discovering a rich ore vein which was believed to exist in a certain locality. Prospecting under the old methods over a number of years gave no definite results; but, in 1909, when there was a keen search for iron deposits, geophysical methods were employed, and valuable results were immediately obtained. Although prospecting The whole world had been conducted previously in this and there are no locality, and it was thought that no",60,Cabet

163,Ment With Mr Gepp,"no w Sir Herbertvaluable deposits of iron ore were to be found there, the application of geophysical research revealed the presence of a very large body of iron ore, and to-day this is one of the richest mines in Sweden, which has the most valuable deposits of iron ore in the world. Searching by means of aeroplanes has been fairly successful in revealing anticlines that give indications of the presence of oil. afea oi country has been mapped out by means of thousands of photographs, prospecting is proceeded with by geophysical methods^ and, if the results are promising, pearls. His business depends on pearl-shell: boring is begun in order to locate the bodies of ore. The one fault I find with the bill is that the Government proposes to let contracts for the mapping of mineral areas from the air. Tenders are to he called in January next, but I point out tliat we have the means at hand by which the work could be done immediately. It could be carried out quite satisfactorily by members of the Royal Australian Air Force, and it would incidentally enable the members of that force to become thoroughly acquainted with the northern portion of this continent, which is the least known part of Australia. .1 was Minister for Defence the Sydney City Council employed members of the Air Force to prepare certain maps of Sydney, and the work was carried out at a nominal charge. Instead of adopting the old Tory idea of doing all work by contract, members of the Air Force could b© engaged to prepare the maps required f«r a geophysical survey. In the event of war, the knowledge of North Australia that they would thus gain would be most valuable. I heartily commend the bill, but I suggest that the amount of £403,000 proposed to be expended under the direction of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Employment to supply subsidies and loans to prospectors, for the erection of batteries and treatment works, and to assist companies engaged in legitimate work, should be used under the scheme indicated in this bill, and applied to the rest of Australia as recommended by Dr. Rivett in a pamphlet published in August last, entitled ""Debts, Gold, and the Council for Scientific and Mr A. Green. Industrial Research."" If Ministers would study that pamphlet, they would be able to evolve a much more useful scheme than that which they now appear to have in mind. Dr. Rivett, mindful of the extinction of the external debt of Australia of £554,500,000, in the course of his pamphlet statesWhat exactly ie involved in this huge digging task? Assume, to begin with, that AusAfter an tralia does not possess any great deposits of high grade ore; or, in other words, let us regard nuggets and high grade deposits aa casual (but most welcome) gifts of the gods, just as the pearl-shell fisher regards perfect pearls are just pleasing extras. Our pearlshell is, say, seven pennyweight ore, and, if we want to get 2,830 tons of gold from it , we must discover, dig out, and treat some 264 million tons of such ore. Assume a density of 2.5 (certainly a low figure) for the ore, and the volume we require is about 3,700 million cubic feet, or a cube of edge 512 yards. Puti n another way, this is about onefortieth of a cubic mile, or a heap 1 square mile in area and 44 yards high. Isi t stretching the imagination too much to believe that Buch a pile exists in Australia in reasonably accessible deposits? No one can say: but this is a heavily mineralized country and it does not seem to me outrageous to believe that we possess ail this and a great deal more. Suppose we have dug it out, and in doing so have taken thousands of men from loafing When round city streets and degenerating on the dole, how may we ensure that the gold goes to cancel the external debt? Here1 ask the aid of the economist and in his absence merely suggest that national action would be necessary to ensure the exchange of the gold for Australian paper currency or Government debentures and stock. So we have a possible means of recovering sufficient gold to discharge the external debt. What has been done in the Transvaal could be accomplished in Australia. Dr. Rivett addsThe Transvaal is the great Empire producer and, in the three years 1920-22, prior to the American shipments, it averaged 7,765,000 ounces out of a world production averaging 15,852,000. In 1932 the Transvaal yielded 11,559,000 ounces, an increase of 40 per cent, on the 1920-29 average. Even with the fillip that the mining indevelopmental dustry has received, it is only expected that £8,000,000 worth of gold will be won in Australia this year; but, in the Transvaal, the estimated value of the production is £100,000,000. In the Unemployment, opinion of Dr. Rivett, Australia is a more highly mineralized country than South Africa. I regret that tat this stage of the session I have not sufficient time to deal fully with this matter, but I intend to refer to it at every opportunity. [9.30] I exercise the privilege of speaking so soon after my journey down from the roof of Australia, because I regard this as an excellent opportunity to advocate the' immediate development of not only the old mineral fields of north-west Queensland and Western Australia, but also the known and unexplored regions of the Northern Territory. I confess that yesterday afternoon I felt somewhat alarmed at the prospect of making what might be termed a maiden speech. I shall endeavour, however, to make practical suggestions for the immediate commencement of operations on some of the fields in that vast area of the Northern Territory over which this geological and geophysical survey is to be made. In past years a great deal of money has been spent there upon fantastic schemes launched by fantastic people. it to be inferred that this comes within that category. It is a practioal proposal which has the hallmark and the backing of science for its promotion. But I see pitfalls ahead, because so much preliminary work is proposed before anything practical is to be done. I believe that the fields where gold is known to exist should be operated on immediately, and that scouting should be undertaken later. There are fields on which there are old prospectors who already have information which is invaluable. That knowledge will die with them if the Government does not take steps for employment would be provided to procure it. Aa an honourable member said yesterday, these men are "" burnt out"". I have been close to the extremities of their fields of exploration, but neither the Government nor the survey party knows where they have been, except by hearsay. I , therefore, ask that when these special officers and eminent scientists start out on this aerial survey they first visit and confer with these old prospectors, and, if possible, add them to their parties before going further afield. Unless they do, they will be running from the known to seek the unknown. The scientific side of present-day survey methods has been thoroughly explained by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green). Some may be inclined to look askance at the new methods of conducting surveys. From the superficial knowledge that I have gained from my technical reading I can say that the electrical method of measuring electrical conductivity, which is either higher or lower than normal, according to whether mineralization exists or is absent, has been tested and even accepted in the law courts of other countries. When a reinforced concrete building collapsed, geophysical methods of this nature were employed without actually breaking the concrete, to prove that the requisite thickness had not been provided and that a shoddy contractor had put in smaller reinforcements of steel than had been stipulated. Last year I was sent into Arnheim Land to examine that country for pastoral and agricultural possibilitieb. I traversed a wide area, extending from beyond the King River to the Liverpool I do not want River, and I may say that of all the areas I have inspected in the Northern Territory I was most impressed with the King River district. I recommend the immediate opening up of Arnheim Land west of the Liverpool River, for the purpose of prospecting. I do that confidently, knowing that no one would be injured thereby. I counted the natives and found that they numbered fewer than 50. I even went to the trouble of providing reserves in known feeding grounds, where there is game in abundance. If this area were opened up for prospecting, opportunities for some of those who now waste their time in the cities and towns. There is a well watered area extending right into Pine Creek. I have been reliably informed that there are prospectors on this field who are averse to telling the real story of what they have obtained out of the dolly pot. That shows that there is gold between the South Alligator River and Pine Creek. An aerial survey would fix the extent of that field. Further south, nearer to Tennant's Creek, is an area over which I walked in 1930 making surveys. To-day there is on it a thriving little township of 300 miners. Gold occurs at shallower depths there than it does in",61,Cabet
164,Mr Blain (Northernterritory),"many of tbe northern parts. The aerial survey could use this as a base for its scouting operations further afield. I should like tbe round-table conference that I have suggested to take place at this spot, where tbere are many old prospectors-deser t rats, as they are called; or, a3 I prefer to term them, periscopes of the desert. The names of such men as Barney O'Leary, Ted North, Jack Atherlon and Bill Garnett are a by-word. These men are getting up in years, and are ""burnt out"". I should be sorry if the knowledge which they possess were to die with them. It could be used immediately in the development of tbe Territory. I agree, but for technical reasons, with the remarks of the honourable member f8r Kalgoorlie, witb regard to the tenders for the photographic survey. I do not know what the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Casey) has in mind. Strip flying, producing these photographic surveys, is a trained man's job, and I should like the work to be entrusted to technical officers of the Defence Department. One that I would recommend is Captain McComb, who, I believe, is attached to the Civil Aviation Branch. I know that he has delivered interesting lectures and written technical articles on the subject. In his second-reading speech the Assistant Treasurer saidThe proposals are ih consonance with the announced policy of the Commonwealth Government for the development of the northern part of the continent, and represent an imporother parts of the Commonwealth. A l tant step forward in that regard. I sincerely hope that he realizes what that means. is significant in its relation to the development of the Northern' Territory. All development has been preceded by mining operations. The mining resources of the Northern Territory should be thoroughly investigated; but after a certain amount of work has been done in that, direction the development of the sub-tropical and tropical regions of this great area should also be undertaken on sound, and not fantastic, lines by methods of peaceful penetration from the north and the south. From what I have heard in this chamber during the last three days it appears to me that Northern Australia is looked upon almost as a foreign land. We have heard of nothing Mr Maui. but wheat, wheat, wheat; and the idee seems to be firmly fixed in the minds of honourable members that the southern parts of Australia are really the only parts of it that count. I tru3t that the problems and possibilities of Northern Australia will be considered with sanity and sympathy, and that we shall, by a measure of economic nationalism for our tropical regions develop the pastoral, agricultural and mineral resources ef this huge area, so that, before very long, a new light, another star, will burst in the firmament of Commonwealth activities, the star of the Northern Territory. Mr E. F. HARRISON (Bendigo) [9.50] I congratulate the honourable Blain) upon the practical contribution he has made to this debate, and the useful proposals he has made for the development of the northern part of Australia. I am glad that this geophysical survey is to be undertaken by the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of Queensland and Western Australia, for it should result in the performance of valuable exploratory work. Such early results as some people expect may not be achieved, but work of this description, if properly done in Northern Australia, will have a most beneficial influence subsequently on similar necessary work in though no specific statement has been made on the point, I assume that the geophysical survey will be followed by a To me his statement topographical survey, and that afterwards geologists will be called in to probe the mineral bearing areas delineated by these surveys. These three activities, if properly co-ordinated, should result in the collection of a great deal of valuable information regarding auriferous country generally that could subsequently be used in Southern Australia. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) read extracts from the excellent article published recently by Dr. Rivett regarding the possibilities of further gold discoveries in Australia. Gold is one of the few commodities, if not the only one, for which there is a ready market in any part of the world. It is easy to transport and is not subject to corruption during storage. . If we could discover new goldfields or develop existing fields, it would be immensely advantageous to .the Commonwealth. I hope that the Government will adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for the Northern Territory that air photography should be employed in this survey work. The Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has had some experience of air photography, and in case his memory should be a little at fault, I assure him that a number of pilots associated with the Royal Australian Air Force are fully qualified air photographers. pilot3 should be loaned to assist in this really national undertaking of geophysical survey, for they could do work of inestimable value to the whole of the Commonwealth and obtain aerial photographs that could be used as the foundation for topographical surveys. I trust also that the experimentation in geophysical survey work will be speeded up in order that we may apply the system to the advantage of Southern Australia. [ venture to say that more gold remains in the Golden Mile than has so far been taken out. There is also probably more gold in various parts of the divisions of Bendigo, Ballarat and Corangamite than has yet been obtained from there. At present this gold is beyond the sight of the men of Australia are to be sent into remining prospectors. The adoption of geophysical survey methods may, however, lead to the location of ore bodies, so that positively valuable prospecting work may in the future displace the speculative stabworship. That to me is a heathen superbing of the country that has been done in past years. If this method of locating ore bodies is successful many unemployed people conld be put to work to prove the value of the fields. I heartily commend the measure to the favorable consideration of other honourable members, and trust that the geophysical survey about to be undertaken in Northern Australia will be so successful that similar surveys will be made in suitable areas elsewhere in, the Commonwealth. [ shall offer no opposition to the passage of this bill. I hope that the geophysical survey and the other work about to be undertaken will reveal the existence of new mineral bodies not only in the interior of the Commonwealth, but in other parts of it as well. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) read us some interesting extracts from an article recently published by Dr. Rivett. Perhaps tliat gentleman allowed his imagination to run riot occasionally while he was writing the article, but we all hope that his expectations will be at least partly realized. He said that if large discoveries of gold were made, it would be possible to use the proceeds to pay off our external indebtedness. Nothing in this bill suggests that the Government has that in mind. It seems to me that the GovernI suggest that these ment is prepared to risk the lives of the people who will trayel by aeroplane to make this survey, and also the loss of the money that will be needed to finance the undertaking; but if valuable discoveries are made, it intends to allow big private companies to be formed to exploit the minerals. That will mean that our national indebtedness may be transferred from external to internal capitalists, in which case it will be a case of tweedle-dum tweedle-dee to the great mass of the people. An amount of £50,000 is to be spent by the Commonwealth Government and the governments of Western Australia and Queensland in this work; and apparently if reasonable prospects are revealed, the unemployed mote areas to prove the real value of the ore bodies that are located. A good many people seem to regard gold as a god, before which they must bow down and stition. But I shall not dwell upon that point. I am concerned, however, lest areas of country in which valuable ore bodies are shown to exist, should be handed over to big bushranging companies to develop. In the past, such speculative organizations have frequently done more injury than good to the mining industry. I hope that in the case of these surveys the interests of the general public will be safeguarded. If such great mineral wealth exists in Northern Australia aB the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) has suggested, it should be exploited for the nation's benefit. The deposits should not become the property of a few individuals to give them the opportunity to make fortunes at the expense of the working men who will be",63,Cabet
165,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [9.54],"expected doubtless to bear all the hardships associated with the necessary developmental operations. In the past, rich mineral fields have resulted in the growth of mushroom towns; hut as soon as the eyes have been picked out of the various lodes, the towns have been deserted, or else capital has been withdrawn from thom, and the unfortunate residents who have been unable to get away have been left there to wrest a very meagre living from the abandoned mines. I hope that as the Government will be spending money with the object of discovering new mining fields it will also take care to ensurvivors from another wreck wandered sure that the national exchequer will receive its fair share of the wealth that is discovered. Too often the public purse is dipped into in order to develop pioneer business enterprises, such as paper pulp making and the like; but immediately success is achieved the benefits are diverted from the general public to private individuals. As the nation will take the risk of financial loss in connection with this particular enterprise, it should also be guaranteed a proper percentage of any rewards that are obtained. Mr E. F. HAKRISON I wish to work provided for the people who are unemployed. also wish to see such an improvement in our whole social system as will make unemployment impossible in the future. I hope that the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey) will give us an assurance that the interests of the nation will be safeguarded and that the unemployed people who go into the interior and suffer hardships in order to develop any mining fields that may be discovered will be adequately recompensed as areas are brought into profitable production. agree with the honourable member for Northern Territory ( Mr Blain), that, in the surveys proposed to be carried out, we should make use of the services of the old prospectors-suc h men as those who in the early 'nineties travelled all over Australia searching for precious metals. Having done quite a considerable amount of prospecting, I know the hardships they had to undergo. Aa a boy I worked on the mining fields, with 80-lb. packs on their backs, these men tramped through the bush in search of likely mineral country, gaining a great deal of experience that would be of great value to the younger generation. In the southern portions of Australia there is still a great deal of country to be explored. For instance, in Tasmania, often referred to as the "" speck"", there are thousands of miles of virgin country. Only a few years ago, a vessel hound from Britain to Tasmania was wrecked on the Tasmanian coast, and the sole survivor was not found for over five months. A few through the bush, and the majority of them perished before they reached civilization. That gives some idea of the isolation of portions of the State. The mountainous regions of Tasmania contain mineral wealth awaiting development, if prospectors could only get the necessary finance to prospect at the right depth. A survey of the kind suggested by the bill would demonstrate the practicability of profitable mining in this region. It is wrong for the Government to allow people to float companies that have no possible hope of making a profit. The salting of see mines should be prohibited. As a lad I was sent from one mine to another to get a prospect, which was subsequently exhibited by the mine which employed me, and resulted'in sending up the value of the shares of the company. The southern parts of Tasmania are mountainous and heavily wooded; but there are calm waterways., where aeroplanes could land. Gold, copper, tin, and osmiridium have been found in fairly large quantities. The Commonwealth Government, in addition to interesting itself in the tropical portions of Australia, could also with advantage pay attention to the possibilities of Tasmania. In the Northern Territory there are vast areas of agricultural and mineral lands, and the Government is doing the right thing in proposing to spend this money with a view to examining the possibilities of their development. By mining development a large number of men now on the dole could he employed. ployed. it said in this House on many occasions",65,Cabet

I support the bill. in this vast continent to exploit its possibilities. Large numbers of men could be employed on profitable reproductive works if we only went about it in the right way. For instance, I agree with the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. F. Harrison) that many tons of gold will still be won from Bendigo mines. But men must be properly equipped for work in mines. Men should not he employed who are not experienced. That is why I agree with the remarks of the honourable member for the Northern Territory. Government will go ahead with its policy, and that it will not confine it to the Northern Territory. [Quorum formed.] This bill seems to be one of the few introduced during this session that is receiving the universal support of honourable members. I hope the Government will avail itself of the very special and technical information possessed by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain), who undoubtedly could supplement the very valuable information he has already given to the House. also hope that the Government will accept the suggestion made by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. F. Harrison) that the survey should he carried out by the Royal Australian Air Force. The Department of Defence would, I am sure, be only too glad to make the necessary machines and men available. These men are trained in this particular kind of work, and the technical experience that they would gain would be of great value to the officers themselves. I hope that benefits will accrue from the geophysical survey, and that the Government will see that any that are derived will be passed on quickly, so that other parts of the Oommonwealth may benefit. I agree with tbe honourable members for Bendigo and Franklin( Mr Frost) who have said that in Ballarat, Bendigo, and the northern portion of Corangamite, as much gold as ever came out still remains, and I hope an opportunity will be given to develop The bill is one that no doubt has possibilities of bringing about good results to the whole of the people of Australia. No industry can entice population and establish a township better than can the raining industry. In the early day3 of the Victorian gold discovery, people arrived from overseas at the rate of 40,000 per annum. Gold has done a lot for the initial development of Australia. During the crises through which this However, I trust that the country has passed, gold has many times come to its.aid. Governments have done little for the industry in return. Many companies have operated gold-mines until it has become impossible to produce at a profit because of the great depth of the lodes. In spite of the fact that the price of every other commodity increased, gold was the only commodity that remained at its pre-war price until 1921. ""While the cost of all other commodities increased, the price of gold did not change. The cost of mining operations increased, and as a result many formerly employed in the industry were forced to leave if and seek employment elsewhere The men who were responsible for the disI covery of the gold-fields in this country were not equipped with modern methods of transport, but took their camel3 into the outback or their packhorses into Northern Queensland. Some covered the country on foot. If they located a field, it soon became necessary for them to get capital to develop their shows, and very often they got little return for their labour. The discoverer of the Kidston gold-field did well enough for the first two or three months, and at one time there were between 2,000 and 3,000 men working on the field. Then the discoverer's claim cut out, but, with the well-known optimism of the prospector, he kept on going down in the hope of striking gold again. Eventually he had to leave the field and go prospecting elsewhere. The field is still being worked, and for a long time the miners were using an obsolete battery which recovered only about 80 per cent, of the gold. The stone is yielding between eight and ten",66,Cabet
170,Mr Street (Corangamite) [10.9],,67,Cabet
171,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [10.12],"pennyweights, .but now most of the miners have handed over their claims to the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, which proposes to install up-todate machinery. Before that the miners tried to induce the Government to install proper plant, and offered a royalty on all the gold won until the debt was paid; but no assistance was forthcoming. I have found that miners and prospectors do not look upon the Government as a source from which they can obtain assistance for nothing. When a miner makes a strike he is always ready, after settling with bis storekeeper, to pay back what he owes the Government. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) will bear me out that, at one time, there were over 300 men on the Tennant's Creek field, but no attempt was made by the Government to provide water or communications. These"" desert rats "", as the honourable member for the Northern Territory would describe them, ask not for telephones or mail services, but for a grant to enable them to obtain necessary machinery. When I was a member of the Queensland Parliament, there was always the greatest difficulty in getting a government geologist to go out and look at a field unless it was near a railway, or could be reached by a mail coach. A geophysical survey may result in locating new fields in the Northern Territory, but the recent aerial survey carried out north of the 20th parallel resulted in little more than the rediscovery of such fields as Bavenswood, Charters Towers and Croydon, which had been worked years ago. What is really needed at Croydon is, not an aerial survey, but a diamond drilling plant with which to test the lode in various parts of the field. being worked when gold was worth No assistance is forthcoming from the Government, however, and if a prospector wants capital he must go to the Pittstreet miners in Sydney, or the Queenstreet miners in Brisbane, and place his proposition before them; and by the time they have made their bargain there is likely to be very little left for him. A man who is down on his luck, and who seeks government assistance in order to go prospecting, may receive £1 a week for two months, and that is all he can get. Mr Riordan. As a matter of fact, even if he were given the £8 all at one time, it would probably not be sufficient to provide him with food and fracture for a month. Ne matter what may be disclosed by an aerial survey, eventually the field will have to be developed by the miner. Since 1850, gold to the value of £640,424,230 has been won in Australia, and yet it was not until 1915, and then only after a bitter fight, that legislation was enacted hy the Queensland Parliament providing for the payment of an allowance to men suffering from miners' phthisis. In the other States similar legislation was not passed until some time later. The mining industry has taken great toll of the men engaged in it. Miners' complaint does not leave a man very long to live once he has been touched with the dust. This bill provides for the expenditure of £75,000 of Commonwealth money on the carrying out of a geophysical survey, and the States of Western Australia and Queensland are each to contribute £37,500. I hope that any propositions which are opened up as a result of the survey will not be allowed to get into the hands of the big capitalists, and that the Government will advance money to the miners to enable them to work the shows themselves, provision being made for the payment of a royalty on gold won in order to recoup the Government for 'its outlay. I do not know how this money is to be allocated as between the various States, but there are some well known fields, such as Eidston and Croydon, that would be worth exploiting. Up-to-date plant should be installed and roads built, and if this were done thousands of men could be provided with employment. The old fields were only £4 an ounce, but when working costs rose during the war some of them, such as the Ethridge and Charters Towers fields, had to be abandoned because it was costing more to win the gold than it was worth. The development of the Western Australian fields was first made possible by portable batteries, but later, with the introduction of modern machinery, it was possible to make 5-dwt. shows pay. In South Africa, I believe, they are working 2£-dwt. shows. The old Palmer gold-field is another which might he brought back into production if roads were provided, and proper machinery installed. I ask the Government to provide an up-to-date treatment plant somewhere in Northern Queensland, to provide communication, and then let the miners do tbe rest. surer) [10.29] I think that all honourable members must have been interested to listen to the useful contribution made to this debate by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain). Several honourable members have referred to the fact that the Government proposes to call for tenders for the aerial photographic part of the survey. I was myself at first attracted by the idea of having this part of the work done by the Air Force. The Government, however, has sought advice from all responsible quarters on this subject, and has had a lot of evidence taken from people who sponsored the use of the Air Force and those who sponsored a resort to private enterprise. AlthoughI personally started by thinking we should use the Air Force for this work, when I saw this evidence I rapidly became converted to the idea that it would be cheaper and better generally speaking-and I say that without any desire to reflect on the Air Force-to resort to private enterprise. Let me give the reason for this. If we take the full cost of the use of the Air Force machines and not merely the cost of petrol and oil, as compared with the cost of employing private enterprise in this work, we find that the latter would be considerably cheaper. Then again this has become a very highly specialized job for which the normal Air Force machine is not at all suitable. The most suitable is a two engine machine. It is necessary to fly these machines on a dead even keel over many miles of country and a particular type has been developed for this work which is considerably different from the normal machine. Then there is the technical training of pilots as expert photographers for this sort of work which is different from the ordinary photographic work done by the Air Force. We have also to consider the deflection of the officers, men and machines from their normal training duties. There would be a definite interference with training. The combination of all these factors has led the Government to come down very distinctly on the side of private enterprise. We propose, to invite tenders, but even so, if the tenders received are not at the rate we expect, then I say definitely we have the Air Force in the background, and will be prepared to use it. As to the remarks made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, I think he will find from a measure that I hope to bring down later this evening, that his hopes with regard to encouraging prospecting in the Northern Territory will be fully realized. It might interest him to learn that even during the first twelve months of the air survey quite a lot of time will be spent in the vicinity of Pine Creek. Something like 600 square miles to the north and north-east of that area will first be surveyed. Then again east of the Macdonnell ranges there is an area of 400 square miles which it is hoped will be dealt with in the first twelve months: Geologists have flown over those areas and have selected them among others for an early survey. I shall certainly refer to the Minister for Development (Senator McLachlan), for his serious consideration, the two points raised by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. F. Harrison). The honourable member suggested that the Government should take note of the technical experience gained in respect of geophysical methods in the Northern .Territory with the idea of applying that experience to other areas and to that which is of immediate interest to him. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) has referred to certain areas in Queensland. He will be interested to learn that among the areas in Northern Queensland that will be dealt with in the first year are the Cloncurry, the Palmer River and the Mount Oxide areas. I think the bill has interested the House and I hope that there will not be any major lines of dissent from the Government's proposal. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. [Quorum formed.]",67,Cabet
172,Mr Casey (Corio,"Assistant TreaGeneral) [10.37] I move That the bill be now read a second time. This is a short bill to amend the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act in two respects. The first amendment, which will be found in"" substance in clause 2, deals with a point that has arisen on section 44 of the act. That section enables proceedings in relation to breaches of awards to be brought before courts of petty sessions constituted in a certain way. As the act now stands, the provision is that a penalty may be imposed by the Arbitration Court or by any district, county, or local court, or court of summary jurisdiction which is constituted 1>y a judge or a police, stipendiary or special magistrate, or by any State court specified in that behalf by proclamation. vision, a proclamation was made specifying the chief industrial magistrate of New South ""Wales as a court within the meaning of section 44 for the purpose therein dealt with. But, as the outcome of certain proceedings subsequently before the Industrial Commissioner of New South Wales, very grave doubts have arisen as to whether that proclamation is valid. It is highly desirable, as honoran appointment for a limited period. Of able members will agree, that some uniformity, if possible, should be introduced into proceedings of this kind. more satisfaction is obtained, particularly by organizations, if they have their proceedings dealt with by special industrial magistrates by one of the ordinary industrial courts. Consequently, in order to produce the result which was indirectly aimed at by the original act, the amendment that I am suggesting will insert these words, ""an industrial magistrate appointed under any State act, who is also a police, stipendiary or special magistrate."" The passing of that amendment will mean that cases that are now going into the ordinary police courts will have a tendency to be heard before one magistrate, and there will be a good deal more uniformity and certainty. The second amendment that the bill sets out to make is in clause 3. It deals with section 50A of the principal act, in which power is taken to appoint inspeccourt. Section 50A, sub-section 1, providesInspectors may, subject to this section, be appointed in accordance with the Commonwealth Public Service Act. . . for the purpose of securing the observance of this act and of awards and orders made under this act. The Government recently indicated its intention to appoint an inspector for the first time since this power was taken in 1928. That decision having been made, honourable members on both sides will agree that it is desirable that the widest area of choice should be open to the Government in order that some one of very definite industrial experience and knowledge may be appointed. If that be so, it is undesirable that the appointment should be restricted, as it would be, under the terms of the act as it stands, to those who are already within the Public SerPursuant to that provice. In order to make the necessary provision, clause 3 amends section 50A, sub-section 1, by omitting the words "" in accordance with the Commonwealth Public Service Act"", and inserting later the words ""not to be subject to the Commonwealth Public Service Act, but shall -be appointed upon such terms and conditions as are prescribed "". The intention is in the first instance to make course, it is realized that it will be of an experimental kind. The Government Much definitely believes that it has a responsibility in relation to the enforcement of awards, particularly in the case of some awards in respect to industries that are rather than not in themselves highly organized from an industrial point of view. not become a member of the Public Service? ment will he of a temporary character.

Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution '""adopted. OrderedThat Mr Casey and Mr Lyons do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. a first time. surer) [10.55] I move That the bill be now read a second time. On the 16th November last, a Loan Appropriation Act was passed to provide £5,000,000 for the general purpose of relieving unemployment. This measure seeks the appropriation of a total sum of £1,533,750 to carry out Commonwealth public works, to assist the States to undertake public works, and for the encouragement of the metalliferous mining industry. To recapitulate the amounts allocated by this Parliament for public works and for the relief of unemployment, the budget provided from loan and revenue a total sum of about £4,250,000. Following that there was an additional appropriation from loan of £200,000 for Commonwealth works, and then, again there was an appropriation from revenue of £176,000 for public works. The present bill provides further, in addition to all the foregoing, an amount of over £1,500,000 for public works for the relief of unemployment. It is not possible to give the House complete details of the works for which the bill provides. The Government is now, and has for some time been examining numerous proposals which Commonwealth departments have put forward as suitable for this purpose. These are being carefully scrutinized, but the Government is not yet in a position to give details of them, because, owing to their large number and great variety, careful consideration must be given to them before a decision is reached. As these works are approved by the Government, details of them will be supplied to honthese works be carried out? a few months to a couple of years. In addition to the amounts to be appropriated for works to be undertaken by Commonwealth Government departments, a further sum of £1,000,000 is to be appropriated under this hill by way of tional to those now being carried out within their territories. The Governor General's Speech forecast the intention of the Government to assist the States in this way to relieve unemployment, and, in pursuance of this policy, each State government was asked early in November last to supply a schedule of works appropriate for this purpose. Substantial programmes have been received by the Government from nearly all the States, and these are being made the subject of close examination and discussion with the States. put into employment as the result of these works? say that, but it is hoped that a very substantial number of men-mor e than in the past in proportion to the amounts expended-wil l be employed hy reason of the nature of the proposals put forward. to be lent to the States? way of grant.

The principle whicb has been adopted in negotiating with the States in an endeavour to make the Commonwealth grant go further, has been to encourage the State governments, and through them the local governing authorities, to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government in financing these enterprises by making pound for pound and other pro rata contributions. ""Works such as water supply and sewerage schemes, particularly in country districts, are the kinds of works that the States are recommending, especially in New South Wales. pend on contributions by the States on that the largest possible number of men a pound for pound basis? yet been drawn up? decided upon yet; but the Government has a large number of attractive-looking proposals from the various States, and they require close consideration before decisions regarding thom are reached. The New South Wales grant also includes an amount of £63,000, which has been agreed upon as a contribution by the Commonwealth Government towards the construction of an up-to-date highway between Yass and the Eederal Capital Territory. This is one of the works that are being undertaken by agreement between the Governments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales, each Government meeting a proportion of the cost. is, I think, two-thirds of the total. The Government of New South Wales will meet about one-third of the cost of that portion within its territory, the reason for its not heing prepared to meet a greater proportion being that, for its purposes, the existing road meets the reThe efforts of the States to develop their quirements of a country road. As the Commonwealth Government, for many reasons, wishes a better highway to be provided, it has arranged to defray two-thirds of the cost. Some of the States have put forward many works that are under active consideration, and entail quite large contributions by either the State or local authorities. In Victoria, it is expected that the principal measure of assistance will be devoted to the restoration of public works destroyed in the recent disastrous floods. It is hoped that that arrangement will be made on a pound for.pound basis with the Victorian Government. The Commonwealth is endeavouring to enter into similar arrangements for contributions by States and other authorities in the States; but as the negotiations are not yet finalized, it is not possible to supply details of the works to which the allocation is to be made. In the expenditure of the amounts that Parliament is shall be placed in work with the shortest possible delay. The last portion of the bill deals with the money .that it is proposed to allocate for the encouragement of metalliferous mining. It is considered that the development of metalliferous mining, and in particular gold-mining, in Australia, offers a worth-while field for national activity. With a view to exploring the possibilities, a conference of State Ministers and officials of State Departments of Mines was held lately in Melbourne. It was attended and, I believe, presided over by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Employment ( Mr Stewart). Discussion took place upon every means that would tend towards the more active development of the mining resources of the various States, and every proposal brought forward was actively canvassed and discussed. An arrangement was come to, subject to the approval of the Commonwealth Government-whic h has since been obtained and is now submitted for the consideration of the House-for the allocation of £353,000 to the States and £50,000 to the Northern Territory for the encouragement of the mining industry. mining potentialities have been hampered by a lack of funds, and they generally welcome this proposal for a grant for the",72,Second Reading

Advances will also be made to individuals and small prganizations that are searching for gold and other minerals. Except in one particular, the Cpmmonwealth has accepted the proposals of the conference. It was proposed that an amount of £138,500 should be made available by the Commonwealth for advances through the State governments. now decided to make the advance under this heading on a pound for pound basis, the Commonwealth and the States each providing £69,250.

At present the Government of New South Wales, under the authority of a certain measure that was passed hy the State Parliament, is obliging people to work under so-called relief conditons that are a disgrace to civilization. Will that government be able to U3e this money to continue such degrading practices? Skilled tradesmen are to-day being employed in New South Wales at wages far below those fixed by various industrial tribunals. We have been informed that a trust is to be set up on which the Commonwealth Government will be. adequately represented. of the appropriation for mining purposes. surer did not make that point clear to us. I was under the impression that the trust would exercise a general supervision. We have ground for bitter complaint, because after waiting so long for a detailed schedule of public works, we shall have to leave Canberra tomorrow without specific information. I can see now why the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) and other honourable gentlemen on this side of the chamber were so anxious a week or two ago to question the Parliamentary Under Secretary for Employment ( Mr Stewart) in the House on the details of the works that were under consideration to provide employment. I have no doubt that if such questions had been permitted, the honourable gentlemen would have given us much more information than we have obtained from the Assistant Treasurer, and would have answered our questions sympathetically and as fully as possible. I regret that he is not in charge of this bill. Once again we feel entitled to criticize the Government for not carrying out its promise to place a Minister in full charge of its employment programme, so that the questions of honourable members could have been answered fully and frankly, as I am sure they would be answered by the honourable member for Parramatta if he enjoyed full Cabinet rank. That honourable gentleman has received deputations of the unemployed in Sydney, and has dealt as straightforwardly as possible with the representations that were made to him; but, of course, his invidious position prevented him from making authoritative statements. I trust that other honourable members will do their best to oblige the Government to reveal its true intentions in regard to the allocation of this money. mentary Under-Secretary for Employment) [11.29] -The general principles which the Government will observe in the distribution of this money have been so lucidly explained that there is no reason for me to speak except to explain why fuller information has not been provided for honourable members. The Government had hoped to be in a position by now to make a comprehensive statement on the subject; but, unfortunately, its hopes have not been realized. I understand that I have been criticized during the last week or two for my frequent absences from the sittings of the House, but I assure honourable members that my time has been fully occupied in making a close and analytical examination of the many proposed public works that have been placed before the Government for consideration. It is not yet two months since this Parliament assembled, but as the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has already said, largo sums of money have already been appropriated for the relief of unemployment. By this bill the Government proposes to make another £1,500,000 available, and this within three months of the holding of the election. Projects of this kind generally precede rather than follow an election. While the Government would prefer to be"" able to place on the table a complete schedule of works for which it could ask Parliament to appropriate the money, the responsibility for the non-production of the schedule is entirely mine as I shall explain. .1 was pleased to hear, at second",76,Second Reading

245,Mr Stewart (Parramatta,"Parliahand in most cases, of the very flattering things that were said in this House concerning myself last week, and I hope in the discussion of this measure it will not he said that the opinions expressed last week were not justified on the ground that the idol has feet of clay. I can assure honourable members, however, that every attempt bas been made to secure the information they desire. On the 2nd November a circular was distributed to each of the State Premiers asking him to submit a list of public works which might be considered to bo appropriate for federal assistance within the terms of the Prime Minister's policy speech and the Speech of the Governor General. The State Governments do not keep on their files lists of this kind. As a of sewerage systems and water supplies matter of fact, it is unusual, for them to receive such requests. It was therefore not expected that they would be able to submit conclusive programmes within a week or two; but with a view to preparing a schedule for submission to this House the Commonwealth Government after the lapse of a couple of weeks sent a reminder to the States. It asked them not to delay the preparation of their programmes until they had a complete schedule, but to select two or three outstanding proposals for submission so that they could be submitted in this House 'before it adjourned for tbe Christmas recess. It was desired that an advance programme be prepared which could be acted upon during the parliamentary recess. That reminder elicited a number of proposals. Advantage was taken of the presence in Canberra of a number of State Ministers in connection with the rural rehabilidiscussions with the Government of New tation scheme to discuss various proposals with them. Up to last week, however, only the States of Queensland and. New South Wales had submitted anything like complete proposals. But proposals which from the view-point of the States may be complete, do not necessarily embrace works acceptable to the Commonwealth. For instance, the New South Wales Government submitted a schedule of works aggregating in value something in the vicinity of £10,000,000. It was not suggested that the Federal Government should find that amount of money. Indeed, I ought to say as a tribute to the Mr Stewart. States, that, for the most part, their requests have been very modest. A l though the projects of New South Wales are nearer completion than are those of any other State, obviously it would be impossible for the Commonwealth Government within a day or two, to select from the schedule presented works which would be satisfactory to the Commonwealth and the States, and to place on the table of the House anything that purported to be a complete schedule of works for each State. For the information of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) I may say that among the works submitted by the New South Wales Government were quite a number of proposals for the installation in country towns, works of the type which were a special feature of the policy speech and the Governor General's Speech. Such works have an added attraction at' the present moment, inasmuch as they involve very appreciable contributions by local authorities which will be supplemented by the Commonwealth and State Governments. Indeed, I am hoping as a result of the contributions of local and State authorities that the amount of money provided by the Commonwealth in this schedule of work in New South Wales will be increased fouror fivefold. sible to supply specific and detailed particulars, because up to the moment the Government has not been able to finalize South Wales. The proposals submitted by that Government, however, definitely specify amounts to be expended by local authorities or quasi-government authorities. The submission from New South Wales tells us definitely the amount which those local authorities are capable of carrying without imposing an unconscionable burden on the ratepayers. The overburden of capitalization is proposed to be borne by the State and the Commonwealth. wish to submit schemes to the Commonwealth, what means have they of doing so?",77,Second Reading

I assure honourable members that this programme has been brought forward to ensure that some work will be provided during the parliamentary recess, and that this is not the last word in the matter of co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. Action along the lines suggested by the honourable member for West Sydney will be taken at a later date. conditions and wages? to be decided. I do not think that I ask too much in requesting tbe House to believe that in the short time since Parliament has re-assembled the Government has not had time to finalize a specific programme. The Parliament might have been allowed to go into recess without this bill being brought forward, on the plea that the States had delayed in submitting proposals; and the matter would have remained there until Parliament reassembled. But the Government preferred to bring into immediate effect what it regarded as an incomplete schedule rather than let the whole matter stand over until the Parliament reassembled in the new year. land scheme as complete as that of New South Wales? the works are not of the type which appeals to the Commonwealth Government. One of the principal objectives at which we have aimed is to ensure that the Commonwealth contribution will be devoted to work which might not otherwise be carried out. The proposals of the Queensland Government do not conform .o that. They are principally works f already approved and for which the necessary finance has been made available. However, I am still negotiating with Queensland. AlthoughI have no complete schedules from all the States, I have had personal conferences with the representatives of some of the States. ceived from Tasmania anything that could purport to be a schedule. applied for by that State be brought into the scheme? Tasmanian Government for the southern district water supply was discussed by myself and Mr Cosgrove during his stay iu Canberra a week ago, but it has since been withdrawn at the telegraphed request of the Premier of Tasmania. The Oommonwealth Government has not brought down a proposal of this kind willingly. It had the alternative of asking the House to vote this money pending a settlement of the State programmes, or of doing nothing during the coming recess. In the interests of the unemployed it preferred to ask Parliament to vote this money so that .immediately finality is reached with the States we shall be able to proceed without the necessity of waiting for Parliament to meet. Members of the Opposition are not unmindful of the onerous nature of the duties to be performed by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Employment ( Mr Stewart); we believe that he is conscientiously applying himself to the duties entrusted to him. Of all members on the Government side none could fill this position more satisfactorily than the honourable member' for Parramatta, and I am sure that his efforts are greatly appreciated by all members of this House and the unemployed throughout Australia. Buti f he thinks that we are asking for more information than we are entitled to, let me remind him that we are merely asking for what we have been already promised. When the Loan Bill was before the House more than a month ago we were told that a schedule of works would be submitted before the House went into recess for Christmas.

A definite assurance to that effect so that I am all the more pleased that should be given. Wbile there may be some excuse for not having a programme of State works ready to submit to Parliament, there is no reason why a schedule of Oommonwealth works should not have been prepared. I am most anxious to know whai works are to be undertaken in South Australia, but no indication has heen given as to whetbeT the money is to be spent at Port Augusta, at Mt. Gambier, or in the city of Adelaide. The Government bas exhibited a tendency to take too much upon itself in this matter, thus depriving honourable members of their right to express their opinions regarding the works which wilj he undertaken* congratulate the Government on bringing down this Appropriation Bill before the House rises for Christmas. Members of all parties, and particularly members of the Opposition, have made it abundantly clear that, in their opinion, whatever money the Commonwealth makes available for the relief of unemployment should be expended by the State authorities. With that principle I heartily agree. I realize, however, that this arrangement makes it more difficult for a detailed programme of works to be speedily prepared, so that the Government may be forgiven for not having such a schedule ready for us. I am glad that some of the money is to be devoted to assisting the gold-mining industry. I have already advocated in this House that action should be taken in this direction, and I am pleased that the Government has taken up the proposal so quickly. The Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey) said that the money was to be spent on sustenance grants, on geophysical surveys, on rendering technical assistance, and on the I still feel that we provision of batteries. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) pointed out that loans to prospectors were almost invariably repaid, a fact which should make the Government more disposed to render these men assistance. He also said that' in Queensland and other Statesi t was very difficult to induce governments to make grants to prospectors, the Commonwealth Government is doing the right thing on this occasion. I have read in the Melbourne press considerable criticism on the Government's proposal to aid gold-mining, but I cannot agree with it. There are two types of industry which necessitate assistance from the Government. The first, which embraces the wheat industry, is in such a serious condition that it must have assistance to carry on. The second, mining, is of snch importance and value, that even if it produces at a profit, it should be further encouraged, for it is practically the only industry that is able to bring new wealth into Australia at the present time. Therefore, anything that the Government, does to assist the gold-mining industry deserves the support of all members of this House. For that reason the bill should be given a speedy and sympathetic passage. am disappointed that we have not had placed before"" us more complete information, and that a proper schedule of works has not been prepared. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Employment ( Mr Stewart) adheres to the old method adopted by his predecessors when spending relief money on government' undertakings.

The list of those ""ihoso issue of books at the present time, is.

I submit, with great respect, that a very important change has been made. In the past the Librarian, in his wisdom, and as the result of bis experience, has used his own discretion, and has made proper allowance for tbe particular class of study in which an honourable member may be engaged.

No doubt they have long since forgotten where they have put the books, and who has them. The public is quick to call attention to the privileges of honourable members. One of them is the use of an excellent library, and we should be a little more careful about the expeditious rethem. I support the remarks of the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker). I have four books in Sydney at the present time, and I did not think that the rule would be enforced. I understand that on previous occasions it has not been the practice to enforce it.

Isi t a fact that this would deprive people at Anthony's Lagoon, Creswell Downs, Alexandria and surrounding districts of the regular mail service which they formerly enjoyed? 3. Will he take steps to see that the services provided in the past to pioneerB in these isolated districts are not to be sacrificed for the sake of speed? answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The elimination of Alexandria and Anthony's Lagoon as compulsory stopping places under the contract with QantasI m perial Airways has been found necessary to facilitate adherence to the existing schedule fixed for the Brisbane-Singapore air service. In order, however, that Alexandria and Anthony's Lagoon shall not be entirely deprived ""of the facilities which they possessed under the previous purely local air service, arrangements have been made for air mail matter to be dropped by the Qantas Imperial Airways pilot on each outward trip of the new service. 2. The places mentioned have a regular roadside mail service. This service, together with the arrangements indicated, in 1., above, for a weekly inward air mail from the south, has been written up to shouid meet the reasonable requirements of districts where the small volume of air mail traffic is not sufficient to warrant the delay of the overseas air service schedule which would result from regular landings at Alexandria and Anthony's Lagoon. &' Whilst impressed with the necessity for ensuring the most expeditious schedule possible in present circumstances for the important England-Australia air connection, and for accelerating that schedule at the earliest possible date, the Government in fixing the regular intermediate calling places on the sections within Australia, have had due regard to the desirability of continuing as far as is reasonably practicable the air service facilities which residents of Northern Queensland and North Australia have enjoyed in past years.

In Empire countries where markets are available, there are already Australian representatives, including publicity officers, whose objective is to increase the sale of Australian products. It is the aim of the Commonwealth Government, by means of trade negotiations, to remove the principal factors which are limiting the sale of Australian products in foreign countries. As a further aid to Australian exports, it is proposed to appoint Australians as trade representatives in certain countries. In all the circumstances, it is not considered necessary for the Commonwealth Government to establish an institution on the lines suggested by the honourable member. honourable member for Hume( Mr. Collins) asked me the following question, without notice:Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a report that men are parading outside Australia House, in London, carrying placards advocating the boycott of Australian poods ? If this is being done, will the Government communicate with the High Commissioner in London with the object of having the practice discontinued, in view of the detrimental effect it may have on the interests of Australia.
