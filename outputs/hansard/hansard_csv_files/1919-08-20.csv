1,Mr Speaker (Hon. W. Elliot,"for the election of a member to serve in the House of Representatives for the electoral division of Echuca, in the place of Mr Albert Clayton Palmer, deceased, and that the dates appointed in the writ are as follows:-Dat e of nomination, 5th September; date of polling, SOth September; date for return of writ, on or before 2nd October. I might mention that, having regard to the date fixed for the Royal Agricultural Show, I have fixed the date of nomination a week earlier than would otherwise have been the case. Minister for Trade and Customs tell the House approximately when jthe Navigation Act is likely to be proclaimed? A good deal of preparatory work has to be carried out before it is possible to put the Act into operation. The date will be announced at the earliest possible moment. Acting Leader of the House whether his attention has been drawn to a cablegram published in yesterday's issue of the Melbourne Herald stating that the Government of the TJnited States is "" pursuing the profiteers,"" that large seizures of foodstuffs have been made at St. Louis, Kansas City, Chicago, Toledo, and Detroit, and that the Federal officials estimate that 500 profiteers will be arrested in the next few weeks? sire to ask the honourable gentleman whether there is any obstacle in the way of the Commonwealth Government taking similar action having regard to the fact that our Constitution is practically the samo as that of the United States of America, and will he promise that a proportionate number of profiteers will be arrested in Australia within the next few weeks ? held office as Minister for Trade and Customs at a time' when profiteering, if it exists, was as rampant as it is to-day, and he must therefore know the exact position as to our power to deal with it. I cannot say whether or not the cable message is correct, but I would remind the honourable member that the United States of America, although comprising a very large area of country, consists of a large number of very small States between which trade in all classes of commodities' has taken place. On the other hand, in Australia we have only six States, each covering a very wide area. I should say, speaking offhand, that whatever legislation is in existence in the United States of America to-day in regard to profiteering has reference to Inter-State trade and commerce. I shall have inquiries made to ascertain what power the United States of America Government is exercising. I am not aware of any power enabling the Commonwealth to invade the domain of Intra-State trade and commerce in order to take action of the kind suggested by the honourable member. Minister for Trade and Customs whether a petition signed by agents, traders, and speculators who have their own interests to serve, and have practically no regard for the producers, has been received hy him in opposition to the request of the growers of bananas in Queensland and New South ""Wales for an increased duty on imported fruit? If such a petition has been received, will the Minister lay the paper on the table? abolition of the duty has been received, and will be laid on the table of the Library. Home and Territories yet made up his mind as to whether a system of proportional representation or preferential voting shall apply to elections for the Senate?

Leader of the House aware that the wholesale prices of boots have increased since the end of June to the extent of 7s. a pair, aud that it is intended to make still further increases? If so, will the Government consider what action should be taken to prevent this sort of thing? If the Government cannot regulate the prices of boots and shoes, will they take action with regard to the export of hides im order to do away with one of the reasons given for these increases ? facts mentioned by the honourable member, but will ascertain whether or not they are correct. Leader of the House aware that, despite the great increase in the price of boots, the average price being obtained for hides by the producers, who are now skinning hundreds of thousands of their cattle, is about 30s. each, so that there is a very big leakage somewhere? with the facts to which 'the honourable membei has referred. ister for Home and Territories a question H as the Minister for relating to a statement reported in last night's issue of the Herald to have been made by him in regard to an offer by Messrs. Tymms and Kidman to build the North-South railway? In the course of that statement the honourable gentleman said that a survey through the Macdonnell Ranges to Alice Springs was made in 1889, and that as far (back as 1883 sanction had been given by the South Australian Government for the construction of the Palmerston-Pine Creek railway, a distance of 146 miles, and for the construction of the Port Augusta-Oodnadatta railway, of 178 miles? He stated, further, that in 1895 the proposed railway was the subject of a report by a special Commission, and that the first I shall be glad to have inquiries transcontinental work was the overland telegraph line constructed in 1871 ? If the Government have yet passed beyond the reminiscent stage, will the honourable gentleman state what view they take of the offer of Messrs. Tymms and KidmanI s the Acting to construct the railway ? that I saw the offer. It is a matter for Cabinet consideration. I was asked generally what the railway position was as a matter of policy; and all I could speak of were the indications from the history of the efforts of South Australia to construct tliis line.

The arrears of pay and new rate will be paid in 3rd Military District (Victoria) on 22nd August, 1919. the honourable inember for C a p r i c o r n i a ( MrH i g g s ) asked t h e f o l l o w in g quesadditional duty in question, but were actually tion : I have received letters from a firm in Eockhampton stating that, although they imported certain goods on 5th March, 1918, on w hich they paid duty, and which they sold in accordance with the cost of them, they received a claim on the 10th of July of this year, fifteen months afterwards, for further duty on those particular goods. I would like to know what is the practice of the Customs Department in regard .to this matter? I a m now able to f u r n is h the honourable member w it h the f o l l o w in g in for m a tion :The question was referred to the Collector of Customs, at Brisbane, who was asked whether the case mentioned could be identified by the particulars given. The Collector of Customs reports that the question evidently refers to a transaction with the firm of Messrs. Walter Eeid and Company, of Rockhampton, the facts relating to which being as follows:An instruction was issued from the Central Office that certain adjustments were required in connection with importations from a certain firm. ment was to be made for a period of twelve months prior to the 20th January last. The Sub-Collector at Eockhampton at first reported that the invoices relating to Messrs. The W. Eeid and Company's transactions Hiad been burnt in a fire on the 13th September, 1918, but, on the 18th July, 1919, he stated that the required invoices wore subsequently produced, and the importers (Messrs. W. Reid and Company) had been advised as to the amount of the duty due. The firm then wrote objecting to having to pay further duty after the goods concerned had been sold, on the ground that they would be unable to recover the amount. As the goods in question (one shipment only was involved) were landed and duty paid in March, 1918, and the claim for the additional duty was not made u n t i l more than twelve months afterwards, viz., on the 22nd A p r i l, 1919 (not 10th July, 1919, as stated by the honourable member), the claim could not be enforced. Messrs. Eeid and Company were, therefore, informed on the 23rd July last that, owing to the failure of the Department to make the necessary demand within the prescribed time, no action would be taken to recover the amount, but the officer responsible for the neglect would be called upon to make good the shortage. Subsequently the Sub-Collector reported that the amount outstanding, viz., £4 0s. 4d., was paid by Messrs. Beid and Company on their own initiative on receipt of the Collector's letter of the 23rd July. On the 3 0 t h J u l y last It will be seen that Messrs. Eeid and Company were not only not required to pay the informed by letter from the Collector of Customs at Brisbane that no action would be taken to recover the amount from them. r honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) asked the following question:In view of the almost universal custom in Australia among the legal fraternity to render the moratorium null and void by inserting a clause in a l l mortgages, w ill the Acting Prime Minister bring^ under the notice of Cabinet the seriousness of allowing any section of the community to seek to defeat an Act of Parliament? The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l l o w s : The War Precautions (Moratorium) Eegulations contain a provision to the effect that the regulations shall not apply to mortgages executed after the 20th September, 1916, and containing a condition or covenant expressly excluding the provisions of the regulations.

I understand that the engine fires could be banked just as well during those hours as at night. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:Before the introduction of the present regulations of restriction, the whole matter was considered at a conference of the Tramway and Electric Power managements with the Board, but the effect oE expert opinion was that no economy of fuel could be effected by such a proposition, as it would be necessary to maintain thc pressure of steam to meet recurrent load. It was, therefore, decided that the only effective way of saving fuel was to cut off tram services entirely in the evenings, and let the steam down. The hour of 7 p.m. was fixed, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and was concurred in by the various tramway managements. M in is t e r , u p o n notice1.

"" The r e p o r t of t h e j u d g m e n t goes on to state t h a t Many definitions of domicile have been given, but they all embody the idea which is expressed in English by the word "" home ""that is, permanent home. The H i g h C o u r t , in Robtelmes v .

The r i g h t of a n a t i o n to expel or deport foreigners from t h e c o u n t r y is as u n q u a l i fied and undeniable as is t h e r i g h t to pre vent t h e m from e n t e r in g t h e c o u n t r y , whether they are alien friends or enemies. Chief Justice Griffith said, in the case I have just mentionedI doubt whether the Executive authority of Australia or of any State could deport an alien, except under the conditions authorized by some Statute; but it is not necessary to discuss that question now. It was fully considered by this Court in the case of lirown v. Jjizar.*. That case practically decided that deportations should not take place except under statutory authority. I thought it well that honourable members should know what seems to me to be the law on the subject. It will be seen that even under the existing Immigration Act deportation is expressly provided for, but that it cau take place only where there has been an evasion of the law. That is the principle of this B ill . Section7 of the principal Act provides thatEvery prohibited immigrant entering or found within the Commonwealth in contravention or evasion of tliis Act, shall be guilty of an offence against this Act, and shall be liable, solute separation of somewhat kindred upon summary conviction, to imprisonment for not more than six months, nnd, in addition to or substitution of such imprisonment, shall be liable, pursuant to any order of the Minister, to be deported from the Commonwealth. That, then, is a general power to deport, irrespective of time, a prohibited immigrant who has come in by evasion of the law. under section 5, but subject to a time limitation of two, to be changed' now to three, years. Under that section, where an immigrant is found within the Commonwealth, and where it cannot be absolutely proved whether he has evaded the law or not; then within two years of his entry into the Commonwealth he may be called upon to undergo the dictation test. to deport exist under any previous law, apart from the Immigration Act If There are some cases of international arrangement which are covered by Acts of Parliament, and under which deportation by consent of the nations takes place, but I do not think there has been any specific Commonwealth provision for deportation except under the Immigration Act, the Pacific Islands Labourers Act, and similar measures dealing w i th tliis question. We are now making provision by Statute in accordance with what has already been done. x Apart from the sections I have quoted,, it is also provided by sub-section 5 of section 5 of the principal Act thatIf an immigrant is, within three years of his entering the Commonwealth, found to be suffering from or affected with, any disease or ? disability, either specifically mentioned or of a class mentioned in this Act or the regulations, he shallbe deemed to be a prohibited immigrant, unless it is proved to the satisfaction of the Minister that he was free from the disease or disability at the time he entered the Commonwealth. I want to show that this B ill makes no fundamental alteration of the law as it stands. The question of extent is another matter. As regards that, I may say that justice and, so far as safety permits, liberality should be applied to the administration of laws affecting international relations. Although sovereignty may empower, it does not morally justify, unreasonable exclusion-the abraces whose bloods, in a paraphrase of the poet's words, "" of colour, weight, and heat, that blended all together would quite confound distinction, y e t "" would then "" staud off in differences so m i g h t y . "" Community leads to some understanding and knowledge, which diminish There is another power to deport doubts, anxieties, and fears, such as have had so much to do with international troubles in the past. In a world of isolated groups sequestered from all mutual relations, the spread of Christianity would have had a poor chance. "" Go and teach all nations,"" the august command, obedience to which transformed so much of the world, according to Newman, would not have been effective without some openings for intercourse, and at least temporary migration. In administration, then, there must be vision and tolerance in so f a r as circumstances I do not think so. can safely justify them. That is the significance of the preamble to the covenant of the League of Nations. As a matter of fact, the need for such tolerance is recognised, in accordance with the very best British traditions, by some of the leading newspapers in the Old Country, where extremists, perhaps, have made suggestions which the British community as a whole, whilst taking the",32,Immigration Bill Second Reading
89,Mr Richabd Posteb,Did the power,34,Immigration Bill Second Reading
90,Mr Glynn,"power, should not recognise in administration. I find, for instance, in the last copy of the Athenceum to reach me, reference to an article in the DailyM a i l , by a writer named Boyd Cable, in which he urged the suppression, within the United Kingdom., of German art. wifch the finer, and yet absolutely patriotic, spirit of the British, there is an article by the editor containing these WordsA man who reads history with open eyes may reach disquieting conclusions concerning the elements and impulses of mankind, but we are convinced that he would never discover a belligerent nation, no matter how bloody and brutal in the actual conduct of war, in time of peace, summoned, in the name of patriotism, to deB ill is to protect, so far as for a time prive itself of contact with the consummate intellectual and artistic achievement of its aforecircumstances may require, our individutime enemy. I do not want to tire the House by going further into this article, but it breathes a spirit which, although, perhaps, strangely expressed, must recognised according to the best traditions .of British administration. Doubtless the references in the article are to great Democrats, some of whom may still remain, although, unfortunately, their spirit did not animate our enemy during the last war. My reference is to such historic names as Schiller, Beethoven, and Goethe. Triumphant H y m n to Democracy, or Joy, which Beethoven, whose works the writer of the article in the Daily Mai l would shut out, set to the noblest music that ever lifted man's thoughts to t'he eternal. not refer, because I think really all his dramatic versions were taken from cosmopolitan history. such as Joan of A r c, had absolutely no relation to the Prussian spirit. Civilization in less dangerous days depended upon comparative freedom of relations. Athens, the city of mind, capital of a little State, perfect in secular culture and, as far as the days of serfdom would permit, democratic in organization, was a small corner of the earth to which, as Newman tells us, the pilgrim student came as to a shrine, where he might take his fill of gazing on the emblems and coruscations of invisible, unoriginate perfection. It was the centre in which some of the very best people in the then world congregated. national traditions and emotions were unaffected by the gathering there for education of the world clans of those days. "" Greek patriotism,"" it has been well said, "" fused the emotions' of the school and family, of inheritance and early In keeping training, of ' religion . and politics-al l the best of boyhood with all the best of manhood-int o one passionate whole."" We must remember also that the mixture of the races depends upon the extent to which national individuality can be preserved without impairment. Community of traditions and sentiment must within reason be attained and preserved, and our object in taking power under this ality as a nation against outside deterioration. We are anxious to see that the aftermath of the war has no deleterious effect on our victory, but at the be same time the Act must be administered according to the best and safest traditions of British constitutional government. I may be wrong, but in common justice to one's feelings of temperance, I give utterance to these impressions. Australia seems less affected by foreign and mixed immigration than is any other Dominion. There are many races in Schiller wrote the celebrated Canada. I find, for instance, that immigration into Canada latterly has been largely from the United States. In the Times of l l t h June last reference is made to a pamphlet issued by the Canadian Government, in which it is stated, that To SchillerI need the British immigration to Canadai n 1914 totalled 142,622; those coming from the United States totalled 107,530, His greater subjects, and from other countries 134,726. In these circumstances, Canada naturally has to be careful, apart altogether from the war, in dealing w it h her foreign immigration. I visited on one occasion a big Canadian city, W in nipeg, where I found that no less than fourteen newspapers, orinted in different languages, were published. According to a recent statement in the TimesA feeling was running throughout the length and breadth of Canada to-day that they had been too liberal in the past, and that in the future they must admit only those whom they could readily assimilate"" people who are prepared to become part of us, and not merely live Yet its amongst us."" They could not, of course, close the door altogether to people from foreign lands, but they could, and should, choose whom they should have; and they could do what ought to have been done in the past, but had not-the y could give such people every assistance to become good Canadian citizens. As to restrictions on foreigners, the Times statesCanada has closed down all her immigration offices on the continent of Europe; she proposes to maintain in force, and it is so provided in the Bill, the war measure absolutely excluding Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians, and Turks; she intends to restrict in the future the migration of foreigners to Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, where tlile majority of the foreign-born population is concentrated and the problem of British character is very acute; she is maintaining severe restrictions against Asiatics on the Pacific slope. There is evidence to show that other Dominions are also becoming alive to the necessity for discrimination with a view to preserving their true British stock and character, and that, above all, their desire and aim are to attract the riglilt type of immigrant from the British Isles. lot when we study our breed! less, mixed on this globe, but time brings about associations which give some composite character, even to the most mixed classes. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -What is the attitude of the TJnited States of America? that. I thought the best thing was to state the position in other countries, particularly the Dominions, so that the judgment of the House might be well informed. since the Armistice. As to ourselves, we have to some extent, under the exemption powers of the Act, made an arrangement with India as regards the suspension of what we might call the dictation test. In this there is no derogation at a l l from the dignity of the race affected. civilization as regards race. Our lines of education and our literature may not be the same, but we may take it as correct that, whether Asiatic or not, in civilization, speaking in relation to its conditions, is quite as good as another. provisions are hot based on any assumption that one race has obtained a degree of civilization that renders it impossible to admit another. Indians a vote in their own country first! referring has been in operation since 1904, when an arrangement was entered into with In d i a and Japan to enable 1 merchants, students, or tourist travellers to come in on obtaining passports from their own Governments on the lines prescribed. This dispensed with the dictation test, and permitted these classes to come in for twelve months. A f t e r twelve months, however, an application had to be made for a further extension, which was often given for four or five years, and sometimes a little longer. This arrangement was extended to apply to Burmese, Cingalese, Egyptians, Hong Eong Chinese, and also, under special conditions, to China-born ChineseI n regard to Indians, in A p r i l , 1917, and again in 1918, the ImperialW ar Conference We are a l l , more . or passed resolutions-indeed , the resolutions passed last year confirmed that of 1917-which , in effect, asked that we should modify the arrangement by allowing those classes to come in for a certain time without asking at the end of a year for an exemption.

It will be seen that the B ill before the House is not exceptional, and is, in fact, a little milder than others adopted by some of the Dominions. The United States of America also has gone beyond us, and for war reasons. The United States Immigration Act of 1917 deals with the immigration of certain classes, and the deportation of those classes. Section3 provides for the exclusidn, amongst others, ofanarchists, or persons who believe in or advocate the overthrow, by force or violence, of the Government of the United States, or of all forms of law, or who disbelieve in or are opposed to organized government, or wbo advocate the assassination of public officials, or who advocate or teacli the unlawful destruction of property; Persons who are members of or affiliated with any organization entertaining and teaching disbelief in, or opposition to, organized government, or who advocate or teach the duty, necessity, or propriety of tine unlawful assaultwithout an Act of Parliament, but ing or killing of any officer or officers, cither had of specific individuals or of officers generally, sanction of the Imperial Government of the Government of the United States, or of any otlier organized Government, because of his or their official character, or who advocate or teach the unlawful destruction of property. That is the American section, and if honourable members compare it with the clauses of the B ill before them, they will see that the latter are actually more temperate. [440] organized Government"" mean the government of a State? ized government. Other countries have adopted similar legislation, amongst them, for example, Chili, which, in This December, 1918, passed an Ordinance or, at all events, an effective law, articles 1 and 2 of which deal with this same subject. As a matter of fact, this law arose out of the deportation of Australians. The articles mentioned areArticle1 -Entranc e to the country for strangers who have been condemned or who have actually transgressed the law whicli eomes under the crime of offences in the Penal Code can be forbidden; and for tblose who have no profession or who cannot exercise any office by which they may earn their living, and for those who are included in cases of sickness which are contained in the second paragraph of article 110 of the Sanitary Code. Article2 -The entrance is prohibited to foreigners who try to alter the social or political order by violence. Nor will the rights of a denizen be allowed to those who propagate doctrines inconsistent withl the unity or individuality of the nation; to those who wort up manifestations against the established order, and to those who dedicate themselves to unlawful traffic which is contrary to the good customs or public order. I do not desire to give any more illustrations, but honourable members will see that there are precedents, perhaps more extreme and severe than the main provisions of the B ill . similar steps 1 A f r i ca is in rather a peculiar position, because there many laws have to be amendedto bring them in consonance with British laws. As a matter of fact, however, in South Africa, the Government, some years ago, d i d exercise powers subsequently to obtain the to the deportations they had effected. In regard to America, we have had to impose checks on the exercise of their powers to deport. The American Government claimed the right to deport some persons to Australia, and in one or two cases the men were stopped.

Southland in Australia without a. passport, and those deported fro m America will not be allowed to land here unless their passports are vised by the British authorities, who have been asked to make proper inquiries. The TJnited States law provides for deportationto the country whence they came, or to the country of which such aliens are subjects or citizens, or the country in which they resided prior to entering the country from which they entered the United States. The Imperial Aliens Restriction Act 1914, gives general power to prevent immigration, but does not specify classes. The classes affected are covered by the regulations, which I have not with me, but they are, I think, classes similar to those dealt with an the B ill . There was a telegram in the Age about two days ago to the effect that Mr Short, a Minister in the House of Commons, had stated that German business, men would be aamitted; subject to suitable conditions as to duration of stay, places to be visited, and reporting to the police as to change of residence, but Germans who had been deported would not be allowed to. start business again'. Britain is over-run now with German bag-men ?the reason for thestatement that was made. The amendments made in the existing Act< by the B ill are. really matters for Committee, and there are only a few to which I should make some reference. Clause3 amends section 3 of the principal Act. In the first place, it omits paragraph c "" An y idiot, imbecile, feebleminded person, or epileptic,""-and reenacts it in the following for m : (o).Any idiot, imbecile, feeble-minded perpass current on the platform, but not in son, epileptic, person suffering from dementia, a deliberative assembly. insane person, person who has been insane within five years previously, or person who has had two or more attacks of insanity. 'That is according to existing administration, for which we want statutory sanction. I draw attention to the following addition to the list of persons whose i m migration into the Commonwealth is prohibited :(gd). Any anarchist or person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established Government of the. Commonwealth or of any State or of any other civilized country, or of all forms of law, or who is opposed to organized government, or who advocates the assassination of public officials, or who advocates or teaches the unlawful destruction of property, or who is a member of or affiliated with any organization which entertains and teaches any of the doctrines and practices specified in this paragraph. If honourable members compare that provision with those of the Canadian and American legislation, they w ill see that, by comparison, we have been really rather temperate in our proposal regarding the prohibition of the entry of such men into the Commonwealth. In America, mere belief in any of the opinions enumerated in that paragraph would be sufficient to bar the entry of such a person, but we require something more definite in the way of establishing the fact. There, again, we f o l low the traditional British procedure. tinction between the philosophical anarchist and the other fellow ? adminisltration. ""What that provision really covers is the man who is opposed to organized government, and who wants to substitute force for reason. I am sure T h a t may have been that views of that sort are not consistent with those held by honourable members on either side of the House. have mentioned ""direct action"" there. very broad phrase of which I do not know the exact significance.

Clause5 enables an arrangement to be made with otber nations to dispense w itb passports. ferred to in new paragraph gf of clause 3. The other clauses are somewhat technical. Clause7 gives power to deport, b u t the deportation is to be incidental to immigration. It is not a general power to deport. It applies only to men who ought not to have come in and who, by coming in, have violated the principles of the Immigration Act. It providesWhere the Minister is satisfied that, within .three years after the arrival in Australia of a person who was not born in Australia, that person(a) has been convicted in Australia of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer; (6) is living on the prostitution of others; (c) has become an inmate of an insane asylum or public ch|aritable institution; or (d) is an anarchist or person who . . .

Thus there must be a judicial man on the Board. ber, or an open Court? Star Chamber.

Government should have furnished the House with an estimate of the approximate cost per annum of such an institution ; and should also have made preliminary arrangements with the State Governments to avoid duplicating the existing State bureaux or work at present carried on by them."" I hoped that I would not be called upon to address myself to this question to-day. criticisms from the Ministerial side, that the Ministeri n charge of the B ill , and the Government, would read the signs of the times, and note that there is considerable dissension among their own f o l lowers regarding the introduction of a measure of this character, which may mean, at a time when every penny counts, the expenditure of many thousands of pounds w i th probably very little advantage accruing in return. ever, as the Government have not with drawn the B ill , we have perforce to resume its discussion. Without wishing to be too drastic or harsh, I would much rather be engaged in discussing something else that might be for the real benefit of the people in whose interests we are supposed to legislate. My belief is that the measure w ill result, not only in the duplication, but in the triplication, of activity, and, in fact, in more than its trip l ifar accomplished. cation, because nearly every State, in some sphere or other, has already covered, or is covering, the ground that is proposed to be traversed by the Institute of Science and Industry. If the Commonwealth is to launch out on the lines of this B ill , it is essential to precede it w i th a measure to settle once and for all, not only the Constitution of the Commonwealth, but the Constitution of every Statei n the Commonwealth. Without the adoption by the people of an amendment of the Constitution, giving this Parliament those powers that every National Parliament ought to enjoy, I can see that not only in this measure, but in others, we are going simply to follow slavishly along the track that has already been blazed, and more than blazed, by the State authorities. We ought to know where we are before we incur further expenditure on proposals of this nature. The present M in istry w ill be handed down to history as the Ministry of departmental constructors. They are establishing new Departments here, there, and everywhere, and new Departments under the auspices of government as carried on in Australia cannot be built up without a huge expenditure of money. This new Department, which has not been given statutory I thought, after the adverse authority, has been struggling along now for some time, because it is four years since the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) indicated to the people of the Commonwealth that he, or his Government, intended to establish a FederalI n stitute of Science and Industry. A t the latter part of 1915 a Committee was established by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), and held one meeting under his presidency. On that occasion Howhis promise to his followers was that the Instituteof Science and Industry he sought to establish would not be controlled by faddists, theorists, or university professors, but would be an intensely practical concern, which would be useful to. the people of Australia. Since then we have dragged on for four years, and I would like to hear the Prime Minister indulging this afternoon in a retrospect of what the Institute in its embryo stage has so It would not be a very entertaining narrative. As a matter of fact, it would be a displeasing one, not only to the honourable gentleman himself, but also to the people of the country. However, we should know where we stand before entering upon a departure of this kind, involving a considerable expenditure of money, and bringing about the establishment of new Departments to do",40,Immigration Bill Second Reading

A report of the Executive Committee of the Advisory Council of Science and Industry, dated the 2nd July, 1917, contains the following paragraphs :In the opinion of the Executive Committee, one of the most important functions of the Institute will he to encourage higher scientific training,, and thus increase the output of skilled specialists available for the development of the primary and secondary industries of Australia. It is hoped to achieve this result hy both direct and indirect -means; directly, by the employment; of salaried investigators to assist i i i specific researches, as well as 'by -financial grants to institutions for improved equipment; indirectly, by proving to the public the value of industrial scientific research, thus increasing the demand for trained specialists and improving their status and .the emoluments open to them. . . . Technical Education and the Training of Artisans -In addition to the subject of the supply of scientific investigators, the Executive Committee has given attention to the question of technical education and the training of artisans. mation has been collected from reports issued by the several Departments of Education and by Royal Commissions, and through personal interviews with experts on the subject.

One gentleman's name has been men1 tioned during this debate,, and I desire to mention it also, because some of his work has come under m y personal view, and because I am gratified at the manner in which he applied himself to the task of getting the. producers of Australia out of their difficulties during the war.

From what I have seen of his work, I believe that Mr Wilkinson is one of the best1 qualified men in his profession in Australia. If the honourable member for New England is anxious to learn something about the work he is doing, and about his qualifications, he has only to visit the Here Commonwealth laboratory. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -""The appropriate time for dealing with that matter is in Committee. A t this stage the debate should be confined to general principles. machinery already in existence, and was about to show that the expenditure of a comparatively small sum of money would place the Commonwealth Analysti n the position of being able to do far more for the people of Australia than the proposed Institute could do.

No doubt the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company has the machinery and experts for carrying out that work. But a comparatively poor manufacturer who undertakes a contract, the specifications of which provide for the use of steel of a specified strength, cannot afford to pay experts as the big corporations can do.

A t the outbreak of war the Government were urged, as one of the first actions that should be taken to help the country through the coming struggle, to mobilize chemists and analysts. Australia to-day is particularly lacking in commercial chemists and analysts. Those manufacturing firms that are endeavouring to place upon the market certain goods which were formerly supplied by enemy countries complain, "" Our great disability in the effort to supplant Germans and others in Australia to-day is that we have not the properly equipped and trained commercial chemists."" The present and past Governments would have been wise if they had paid attention to that deficiency. Chemistry has played a marvellous part in the establishment and carrying on of the industries of Germany. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) referred to the aniline dyes, which, he said, had been originally invented in Great Britain, and pilfered by Germany. ment. I know that twenty-six years of chemical investigation preceded the production of synthetic dyes in Germany. Several of the great commercial concerns combined in setting chemists to work upon this problem, and after twenty-six years they discovered the secret of aniline dye manufacture. Since that day Germany has had command of the world's dye markets. In a sense, she deserved that reward, because her manufacturers and financiers were prepared to pay expert chemists to investigate continuously until they discovered the secret which has since paid them so handsomely. Were first discovered by an Englishman. constituent of ordinary commercial dyes was imported from India. Then a synthetic dye was invented in Great Britain, which for some years dominated the trade in that article. Later, German chemists discovered an improved method of manufacturing synthetic dyes, and lef t the British people, as we deserved to be left, in a very bad position. In moving the second reading of the B ill , the Minister( Mr Groom) read a quotation from the report of the Scottish Commission that visited Australia. The members of that Commission were mainly practical fanners. I had the pleasure of meeting some of them, and was struck, not only with thenScotch accent, but also with their practical outlook. One paragraph of their report statedBesearch -In comparison with research work carried out in Scotland, where the subject has not received the attention which it deserves, the extensive arrangements which are made, the encouragements which are given to experiment, and investigation in Australia, are gratifying and surprising. Pleasant also is the universal enthusiasm discovered in the directors of experiment stations, and, indeed, in all connected with the work of development. It appeared to us, however, that a considerable amount of overlapping was going on, that in general there was a want of co-ordination and co-operation, that the policy of allowing each State to attempt to attack the solution of each agricultural problem by itself was not the most economical. I admit that the paragraph goes on to draw attention to an overlapping of State activities and suggests that it would be I question that statebetter if the Commonwealth undertook the whole of the work under one organization and authority. I repeat that if the Commonwealth Parliament were in a position to assume entire control of the application of science to industry I would support such action, but the Commonwealth is not able to do that. B y reason of the constitutional limitations placed upon the Commonwealth authority the proposed Institute w ill become merely the seventh authority to carry on scientific and industrial research in Australia. I see.no chance of avoiding that; therefore, I hope that the Government w ill see fit to withdraw the B ill for the time being.

But, unfortunately, one of the troubles of society in Australia to-day is that we have too many round pegs in square holes. We have many people performing duties for which they are totally unfit, whereas in other walks of life they would prove eminently useful. I do not know that the Institute of Science and Industry, for which this B ill provides, will help us to steer clear of such a system.

According to the report to which I have already referred, the expenditure in connection with the Institute up to 30th June, 1917, was £3,593, and I suppose that it has very much increased in t'he intervening two years. If this expenditure was placed on the Estimates it must have been hidden away in some small corner and l e f t unexplained by the Government; indeed, of recent years we have had no opportunty of looking into the finances, and when we do we shall be appalled. Y e t we have honourable members glibly supporting a B ill of this kind, which must involve a much larger expenditure than we can foresee. The telephone, there is not the slightest doubt, is going to play an important part in the life of Australia, which is a country of great distances. A t the present time we cannot be said to have an up-todate telephone system. I am not now referring to the cities only, but more particularly to the out-back districts of the country, where it is highly necessary that the people should be placed in communication with their markets, with medical men, and so forth . Some time ago I had the temerity to ask the Postmaster-General( Mr Webster) whether his Department were elaborating any extensive scheme of telephone extension in the country districts, and the honourable gentleman expressed surprise that such a question should be asked in these times. We are complaining of the rush of people to the cities, and of the few advantages enjoyed by the country people, and proper telephone extensions would tend to make country life more bearable. I feel so strongly on this matter that I should be prepared to support the expenditure of £500,000 in the direction I have in dicated. During the war work has been done in the Government workshops that was never done there before. personally inspected telephone appliances in steel, copper, and more delicate material still, and I can say that from every point of view they are not only as good, but in many cases superior, to imported articles. I have appealed to the Postmaster-General( Mr Webster) to give a Mr Fenton. chance to our own trained artisans, of whom many have attended technical colleges, and one, at any rate, of whom I know effected a valuable improvement in certain appliances. And yet that man is to-day walking the streets unemployed, although his invention was the means of saving money to the Postal Department. Not .long ago I asked the Postmaster General whether he was prepared to have a number of common battery machines manufactured in Australia. The honourable gentleman's reply was peculiar, but I am satisfied that he will not be able to satisfactorily gainsay what has been asserted in opposition to his attitude. As was proved during war time, this telephonic material can be manufactured in our own workshops; but as soon as-peace is declared we find the Postal Department sending their orders abroad. No one can deny that all work of this kind should be encouraged, but the men who were making the appliances during the war have been put on the streets by the Government, the work now being executed by artisans in other parts of the world. I think a little "" science and industry "" in the Postal Department would not be amiss. Reform, like charity, should begin at home; we should reform ourselves before we t r y to reform the world. ThisB ill is not one that ought to be accepted by the House at such a time as this; and I feel convinced that its supporters will at some time confess that they are wrong. We ought to weigh well every proposition, especially one like this, involving the expenditure of large sums of money. I am certain that the people of the country generally w ill not endorse this legislation. There are great Government workshops at Newport, at Islington, Ipswich, and Clyde, and every appliance we need ought, as f a r as possible, to be manufactured there. We all recognise that the inventor is very much wedded to his ideas, and apt to be I have regarded as a nuisance, but inventors ought to be encouraged. The combined harvester and other agricultural implements had their origin in Australia; but it is not every inventor that can command the capital to carry out his ideas. Many men of brains have had to take their ideas abroad in order to find appreciation. In one case I can remember, in. pre-war days, two young Victorian engineers, who had an invention to dispose of, were given the cold-shoulder, not only by Australian manufacturers, but by British manufacturers. themselves to Germany, and there they found a firm ready and willing to give them every assistance. A special part of a workshop was set aside for them in which to carry on their experiments, and they were giver h is h salaried positions. Their invention turned out a huge success, as I am informed by a man who has personally inspected the results. If I had my way every inventor who could satisfy a committee that his invention was on the right lines, would be given room in the Government workshops, and assisted in every way to perfect his ideas. There are a thousand and one ways in which, without the expenditure of large sums on an Institute of Science and In dustry,assistance could be given to both our primary and secondary industries. I am suprised that the Government are not keeping a tighter hand on the purse strings, for 'they must recognise that the character of the men at the head of this Institute indicates exceptional expenditure. their reports! Dr. Gilruth, I am mistaken if I did not see a similar one in a Victorian publication some years ago. member for New England (Lt -Colonel Abbott) urges us to deal with, this question on general principles, but there is -too much general principle, and too little of solid practical fact brought to bear. The reports of the make very nice reading, but the hard pressed taxpayer w ill say, "" To Hong Kong with your grandiloquent language; who The Institute will move along at a snail's pace, and only long days hence can the primary or secondary industries receive any benefit.

I do not want much better meat to chew at election time than I shall have if we are going on with a measure of this kind. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT (New England) [5.37] -Afte r listening to the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton/ and other members on the Opposition side, one asks oneself whether they are approaching a B ill of these dimensions in a national spirit .or looking at it from a narrow, parochial, party point of view, with an idea of squashing it and refusin"" to see the meat and goodness contained within its four corners.

That is a very correct and right proceeding. The Leader of the Opposition( Mr Tudor) has moved as an amendment on the motion for the second reading, the insertion after the word ""That"" of the following words: before introducing a Bill to establish a Bureau of Science and Industry, the Government should have furnished the House with an estimate of the approximate cost per annum, of such an institution; and should alsohave made preliminary arrangements with the State Governments to avoid duplicatingthe existing State bureaux or work at present carried on by them. This is a Bill which will bring to life an institution that will be very far-reaching and have a considerable influence on the welfare of Australia. I do not want to approach the question from a party point of view. I thought with pleasure when I saw the Bill that it was outside the realm of party politics, and that we could look at it through national eyes, in the light of what has been done in other parts of the Empire and of the world, particularly* during the last four or five years of this gigantic war, and so profit by the experience of other countries.

The Commission consisted of practical, far-seeing men. This is the part of their report which goes on from where the honourable member for Maribyrnong lef t off:Thero are many problems whicb are common to the whole of Australia, or to the greater part of it, and it would appear that time and money would be saved by placing some of the work of research in the hands of a Federal Department. State is afflicted with various stock diseases. In Queensland, there is ""tick fever""; and in another, "" dry bible""; in another, there is ""coast disease""; and so on. A strong and well-equipped Federal Department would seem more likely to cope with such diseases than the weaker and less well-equipped States Departments. The prickly pear, again, is not a State monopoly, but may, through time, spread over most of the country; and here again is an argument for Federal control, which would not absorb or limit the energies of the State Departments, but concern itself with a broader and a wider field. If that were true in 1911, how much more true is it to-day, and how much more has it been rubbed into us that it must be true, after our experience in recent years. It has been alleged by honourable members opposite that the Universities are academic and unpractical institutions, but what we shall see here, when the In stitute is established, is a closer association between it and the Universities.

Her people recognise that to deal w it h the pest is a matter of national importance. . They know that scientists in America have been able to cleanse certain areas in a certain time, and thus to push the tick gradually back. me that when a pest such as the cattle tick is likely to cross the boundaries of one particular State, it is time for the national laboratory and national scientists to step in and cope with it. It is generally recognised that Australia has been absolutely neglectful of the scientific education of her young people. throughout the British Empire. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT On e pick up a publication written by a man of letters of to-day without seeing that the shortcomings of the British Empire from both an industrial and a military point of view have been due to the nation's short sightedness in educational matters. Many young men seeking a profession in life choose law or medicine, but if it were possible to hold out inducements to our youths and girls to continue their studies at the Universities in the science classes, with the possibility of securing preferment afterwards in remunerative occupations, we should find them freely taking up a course of training which would be of the greatest benefit to the whole community. When Professor David, who accompanied Shackleton expedition to the Antarctic regions, and who has done a tremendous amount of geological and metallurgical work in New South Wales, was entertained on his return from the Pront, he said that science had played a far more important part in the war than .any one would imagine from the small hints that had been dropped from time to time. It has; but For obvious reasons, the W ar Office and the Navy had kept to themselves many of the most recent types of scientific discovery; but it was a simple hard fact that science had played an enormous part in the winning of the war. "" It is up to each one of us, as scientific men,"" he proceeded, "" to see that the importance of Queensland was rather afraid science for national existence, whether in peace or i h war, is properly appreciated by the public, and that scientific research finds its proper place in the history of this great Commonwealth."" what one would call obviosities.

Recently, also, in Western Australia experts were required in a particular line, but they could not be obtained. There is such a dearth of trained men in Australia that some of our industries, if they axe not already languishing, soon will be. I believe in the proposal to establish research scholarships, but our experience in Australia of such scholarships is that the men of genius who have won them, and gone further afield, have remained abroad where their scientific attainments have obtained recognition. I hope that such provision will be made that Australia will not lose the services of those who gain travelling research scholarships! The most important work of an In stitute of this kind is the establishment of laboratories in which practical It is suggested that the cost of running the Institute will be about £15,000 or £20,000 per annum.

Page 10 of the report for 1917-18 contains the following: During the year 1916-17 we devoted a larger part of our attention to the difficult questions arising out of the recommendation to your i Lordships foreshadowed in our first report, viz., that the most hopeful line of advance is "" co-operation between the various British firms in each industry and between the industries and the State in the furtherance of research."" We are glad to be able to report that the experience of this past year seems to show that the foundations have been truly laid of a movement which is likely to suit the needs of many types of industry, and may prove capable of extension to many industrial interests besides that of research. Besearch of this class is national in a more direct and obvious sense than that undertaken in the interests of any single industry, however important, and "" for that reason it is simpler and more just that all should contribute to the taxes"" to its cost. We have encouraging evidence on all hands that there is constantly increasing realization of thc need for organized research in connection with industry, but the movement for the formation of research associations will receive a serious set-back if the supply of trained researchers cannot be expanded in proportion to the increasing demands, and there is considertests will be carried out. able danger of this happening. They advocate what we are endeavouring to do here, and yet honourable members quibble at our Government's proposal. They advocate spending more money on laboratories where practical tests can be made. This is what is proposed by our Advisory CouncilMoreover, it is quite essential that any investigator who has worked out a new process or material should be able to apply his work on a semi-manufacturing scale, so that it can be transferred to the factory byskilled men who have already met the general difficulties which would be encountered in factory application. This development on a semimanufacturing'scale is, indeed, one of the most difficult parts of research, resulting in a new product, and the importance of it is shown by the fact that all the large industrial research laboratories, however concerned they may be with the theory of the subject, have, as parts Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice, of the laboratory, and under the direction of the research staff, experimental manufacturing plants which duplicate many of the processes employed in the faotory itself. It is hoped that, as far as Australia is concerned, the Institute will soon be able to supply this defect. Later on, I hope to be able to tell the House what is happening in other parts of the world in regard to science and industry. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Tudor) has objected to the establishment of an Institute without parliamentary sanction. As a general rule, I do not applaud the commencement of Government institutions ""without parliamentary authority, but the step having already been taken, the Institute having been established, and its necessity having been demonstrated, it is now useless to cut its throat simply because some one did something a few years ago that should not have been done. The Leader of the Opposition has also twitted the Government with the expenditure on the journals printed by the Institute Advisory Council, but I recommend those publications to the close perusal of every honourable member. I go further, and recommend the publishers to be prepared to lose a little more money on them, by reducing the price to 6d., so that every person in the community may become .acquainted with the work which is being done by the Advisory Council. The appointment of directors is a matter which does not concern the House. I take it that the Government will see tbey are properly advised in making appointments. ought not to be pernicketty in regard to the salaries or fees to be paid. Let us get the best scientists and the very best brains available, and pay them well. If we can give the University graduates the assurance, that they will have ample opportunity of preferment; if we get the very best apparatus that money can buy; and if we send to the other side of the world and bring back those Australian students who have been doing most excellent work for the Empire during the war, and are now completing their -studies abroad-if we bring them back to help us in developing our secondary and primary industries-any this direction will be money well spent. Honourable members say that in passing this Bill we are entrenching on the rights of the States. I fail to see how some of the complex questions which are common to the whole of Australia can be handled by the States treating separately unless they go over the same ground-work. These aTe problems which should be solved by a central body, as is done in the United States of America, Canada, Great Britain, and elsewhere. Lt -Colonel Abbott. Only by realizing what is done in other countries can one see in proper perspective the need for a physical laboratory, and the part it is playing in the world's work. It was an eye-opener to me to see what was being done in scientific industry in. the Old Country. The lack of a National physical laboratory in Australia to-day is a crime. I am not speaking of a small academic retort in a scientist's room at the University. What we require is a .physical laboratory at which we shall be able to make practical tests in the mass, demonstrate to the manufacturer what can be done, and ask him to apply those demonstrated pro-, cesses to his industry. In order to apply science to industry, -we must have a. staff of trained scientists, .and if we wish to hold our place in the race of nations we must be at least abreast, and, if possible, ahead of, our competitors in scientific investigations and the practical application of its results. We must offer greater rewards to science. The laws of nature must be the same in the works as in the However, we laboratory; principles which apply to the one must apply to the other. There must be no divergence between practice and theory. The tests of alloys,-to be effective, must be made on the same scale as in the works. Small .pieces of metal cool too quickly, and differ in many other respects from larger masses. So, too, in Tegard to mechanical treatment; the forging, rolling, and even casting must be carried on with an experimental plant rather than in the ordinary laboratory. Impurities, and the rate of cooling, also, must be studied. We know that in the past Great expenditure iu Britain has been slow to realize the need for scientific advice. What is required now is scientific control, and the sooner we realize that the better. It is ""necessary that we should create in Australia, amongst those who control our industries, an adequate appreciation of science and them its possibilities. We must make industry attractive. We must set up a National laboratory, with apparatus and experimental plant, involving the permanent employment of skilled labour and scientific supervision. One physical laboratory, for Australia should be able to supply an equipment which cannot be reproduced, in a number of colleges. we ought to be able to set up one National laboratory that w ill investigate and solve all the problems that beset Australia. pliances could be used which it would not be safe to place in the hands of a student; to handle them we-""must have trained men. would work in close touch with theu n i versities and colleges, co-ordinating and supplementing their activities. the war; not on©j but many such laboratories were established by Germany. Two of the most famous were those at Char-lottenburg and Gross Licherfelde. Famous also are the Federal laboratories at Zurich, in Switzerland. States of America there are: Bureaux of Standards, and in. France the National laboratory. I . hope to seethe establishment in Australia of a National physical laboratory.

It would be the greatest delight of my life to see a. National physical laboratory established in AusI n such a laboratory aptralia, let the cost be £10,000, £20,000, or £100,000. One honourable member stated the other day that he would spend £500,000on telephone extensions. No The National laboratory doubt, telephones are necessary; but let us put our money into a National reproductive work, from which we shall get Before real value, and which will determine the place that Australia is to occupy in the race of nations . 1 My hope is that when this Institute is established, it w ill include a properlyequipped laboratory, which will underI n the United take, amongst other things, a study of aeronautics.

Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -Tb e testing of these gauges took place at the National physical laboratory, and without such a laboratory and trained scientists, it would be impossible to make shells to fit the guns with the requisite precision. Australia hopes to engage in shipbuilding on a large scale, and we must have a laboratory at which we can make our own models, which must undergo practical tests. It is a mistake to imagine that without such models and tests we can design, build, and launch ships. This National laboratory will carry on experiments in physical metallurgy and the production of tungsten steel, and will make analyses of iron, steel, and nonferreous alloys, and, chemical glassware and porcelain. The British Government has set apart £1,000,000 for a department of scientific and industrial research. Returning to the Orient, we find that Japan has voted for one year £500,000 for a similar purpose. Prance is allocating many hundreds of thousands of pounds for scientific research, and Canada, with a population of 7,000,000, less than double that of Australia, has promised to make available £1,000,000 for this work. Activities in this connection are world wide. In India, Chili, and other parts of the world, Bureaux of Science and Industry have been set up, and particularly for standardization, because they are regarded as neeessary to insure the industrial survival of nations, and because it is realized that those countries which do not give industry the aid of science straight away, will be late in the hunt. One of the results of the war has been to teach Britain that she can be, to a large extent, self-contained. Before, the war all her supplies of potash came from Germany. Now England gets all the potash she requires from a new electrolytic process. Optical glasses, for which we were formerly dependent upon the factories of Jena, in Germany, are now manufactured in England. English magnetos have supplanted the German product, and. the Mother Country is now independent of foreign countries in regard to tungsten steel, which is used in tbe manufacture of filaments for electric lamps; thorium, which comprises 90 per cent, of the constituents of incandescent gasburners; hard poreclain; thymol, a valuable anti-septic which the Germans produced from oil of an Indian seed; aspirin, and salicylic acid. Germany formerly had the monopoly of the production of aniline dyes, which originally were an English invention. English chemists have now made the Old Country self-contained in that respect. I mention these facts as illustrating what science can do for a country. The production of Australia in 1916 represented a value of £270,427,000, comprising: Agriculture, £60,207,000; pastoral, £89,940,000; dairy, poultry, and bee farming, £26,949,000; forestry and fisheries, £5,505,000; mining, £23,621,000; and manufactures, £64,305,000. The purpose of the creation of an Institute of Science and In dustry is to show how this production can be increased. If that is not to be its duty, its establishment will be a waste of time, money, and energy. But we know from . the history of other nations that production can be increased by the application of science to industry. Honourable meinlbers have asked what has this Institute done to justify its existence during the last three or four years. What has it done, for instance, in regard to the prickly pear? In Queensland there are 20,000,000 acres overrun with this pest, and that area is increased to the extent of 1,000,000 acres every year. Queensland has introduced the cochineal bug to cope with it, and by this means, as well as by gas spraying and other schemes propounded by the Institute, it is hoped to keep the pest in check. Prickly pear is found chiefly in Queensland, but it also occurs in New South Wales. The discovery of a means of eradicating it is a national matter, and the Commonwealth must subsidize this Institute, and arrange for it to work with the State scientists in devising means for",55,Abbott I Have No Of A L L Forms Of Electricity Metersy The
190,Mr Gbegoky,"Tb e results obtainedthe extermination of the pest. We know what the Institute has done also in regard to improvements in the tanning _ of leather, paper pulp, and the treatment of weevil in wheat. What Professor Lefroy has done in regard to the last-named evil speaks for itself, and the same scientific remedies w ill deal with weevil in maize. Much has been done in Australia to promote the cultivation of wheat. The South Wales, by hybridizations, evolved different types of dry-country wheat, as the result of which we have been able to carry on wheat-growing in different parts of Australia where before it was thought to be quite impossible. the same thing at Dookie College. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -Perhaps so; but the foundational work was carried out by Mr Farrar. Professor Lowrie, a Scotch professor, has also, by his scientific research work, put millions of money into the pockets of wheat-growers in South Australia and Western Australia. All these works should not rest where they are to-day. It is for the National Parliament to say that there shall be co-ordination of activities, that the scientists in the different States shall be brought together to carry on the work where Lowrie, and Mr Farrar left off, and that overlapping by scientists shall be prevented ; in this way, Australia as a whole w ill be benefited. member approve of the method by which co-ordination is to be secured under this Bil l 1 Does he approve of the idea of having separate State Committees. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT I do not know that I wholly approve of it , but I cannot suggest a better system. The directors of this Institute, whether they be in Melbourne or Sydney, must be paramount. for the States to appoint their own Committees to work in conjunction with the figures in relation to our flocks. In 1890 Commonwealth Institute 1 Lt -Colonel ABBOTT recommendations made by the different 1916 we had only 76,668,604 sheep and States as to the personnel of the State 10,459,237 cattle. Committees w ill come before the permanent directors unless there is any special reason to the contrary. engineering standardization, The cattle tick, although it has been an almost purely Queensland matter, is one in which New South Wales is now interested. Quite recently, largely on account of the work of this Institute, the life's history of the cattle tick has been worked out. In 1916 a committee of experts estimated that Queensland had lost £7,000,000 as late W ill i a m Parrar, of New the result of the direct ravages of the tick, exclusive of the losses due to loss of condition of other stock and the reduced production of milk as the result of the pest. There is also much room for in vestigation with regard to bitter p it , f r u it fly, and the codlin moth; also lung Mr Pye has been doing worm in sheep, nodules in cattle, and blow-fly in sheep. The ravages of the f r u it f l y have been responsible for a loss of some millions of pounds to our fruit-growers. Professor Lefroy, who recently visited Australia to in vestigate the blow-fly trouble, has told us tnat the parasite controlling blowfly in sheep in England has been discovered, and that the control of the Australian blow-fly can be definitely guaranteed. It is estimated that we suffer a loss of £3,000,000 a year because of this pest. The blow-fly maggot was first discovered in the Riverina district in 1897, and honourable members are familiar Professor Lefroy, Professor with the ravages caused by it . The spread of the pest has been largely brought about by the improvement made in the weight of our sheep, and in the fineness of the yolk. One of the penalties of improving the honourable cur breed of sheep has been the creation of a better harbour for the blow-fly. While dealing with the necessity for scientific research in relation to the sheepgrowing-industry, I would point out that statistics of recent years do not show that we are improving to any extent, except in so f a r as the price and quality of the wool are concerned.

A meeting was held during the month of January, 1916, to which I shall refer later on, and the proposal for the Institute was launched. During the the Advisory Council, which was a body created for the purpose of doing work prior to the establishment of the Institute, expended £ 3 , 5 9 3 ; in 1917-18, it expended £ 7 , 1 7 4 ; and in 1918-19, £8,939.

I have shown that while they were in the Government money was spent. I have shown the sums of money spent in each successive year. Honourable members put to me, later on, the question of what the cost of the Department wa3 going to be. That was a very reasonable question to put. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) during the debate, the detailed expenditure obviously must be shown in the Appropriation Bill; but as a guide to honourable members as to what was in the mind of the Minister in charge of the Department when the last Estimates were passed, I refer honourable members to these two items:' On page 165 of the Estimates, £20,000 was put down for salaries, contingencies, and expenses in connection with investigation; and at page 290 of the Works Estimates, £3,000 was put down for the establishing and equipping of laboratories, experimental stations, &c. Honourable members asked me last year when that item was before the House, "" If we pass it , will it commit us to the Bill that is before Parliament ?"" for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) will remember putting that question. My reply was, "" No; the question of the Institute in its permanent form will have to come before Parliament in a separate Bill."" We are now acting absolutely in accordance with the policy as then declared. It is utterly impossible at this stage to attempt to tell the House what the cost of this Department is going to be. All I can do money the Minister who will administer the Institute thinks he will require during the first year, when he is making his commencement and laying the foundations. much as Parliament permits. than Parliament permits.

This work will really be supplementary to State activities, except so f a r as the States themselves desire to abandon activities. The desire is to cover a field that cannot be effectively covered by the States. Honourable members will see presently from one or two quotations which I shall make that there are some States which cannot possibly cover the ground effectively.

If the Commonwealth, by its appropriations, can establish scientific reand search, increase the productivity of Tasmania, and add to its population, it will be doing a truly national work. The policy of the Government, and of those who have been in charge of this Department all through, has been to act in complete harmony and co-operation with the State authorities. Let us see first how the Advisory Council originated. In January, 1916, an Inter-State Conference was convened in Melbourne by But the duplication the Prime Minister, and the following were presentPresident-The Prinie Minister (Hon. W. M . Hughes). State Ministers of Agriculture-Hon. F. Hagelthorn, Victoria; Hon. C. Goode, South Australia; Hon. W. Lennon, Queensland.

I would emphasize the point that at that Conference, before the A d and I shall presently visory Council was established, the representatives of every State were invited to be present, and take part in the deliberations. In addition, the following representatives came from the several Universities: Sydney, Professor Sir Thomas Anderson Stuart; Adelaide, Professors Sir Douglas Mawson and Kerr Grant; Melbourne, Professors Masson and Baldwin Spencer; Brisbane, Professor Gibson and Dr. Richards; Hobart, Dr. Glasson.

I have given the names of the representative body that was asked to consider the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry. From that body an Advisory Committee was posals to the Government to. establish Science most representative Committee, and presented a series of recommendations, the first of which was that a Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry should be established by Act of Parliament. The functions of the Institute were then set forth, and, generally speaking, the main points were very much the same as those incorporated in. the B ill now before us. The recommendations included the followingThe functions of the Institute should be(i) To consider and initiate scientific researches in connection with, or for the promotion of primary or secondary industries in the Commonwealth. (ii) The collection of industrial scientific inprofessors, and men like Mr Donald formation, and the formation of a Bureau fbr its dissemination amongst those engaged in industry. (iii) The establishment of national laboratories. and so forth . Another function set out was(xiii) To seek from time to time the cooperation of the educational authorities and scientific societies in the States with a view to advancing the teaching of science in schools) technical colleges and universities, where its teaching is determined upon by those authorities. The Committee further recommended(a) The control of the present Commonwealth Laboratories be not disturbed, but that they be co-ordinated, their staff increased, and their equipment improved. (6) Any new national laboratories which may be created for special purposes of research and experimental inquiry, including a physical laboratory for testing and standardizing purposes, should Be controlled by the Institute. The honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) recently brought under Mr Groom. my notice the question of testing referred to there. The"" Committee also recommended certain proposals of organization for the meanwhile, and suggested certain arrangements that should be made im mediately. They proposed for the in terim, pending the establishment of the Institute, the constitution of an Advisory Council. The report went back to the Conference, and I understand the scheme was adopted. It was then approved by the Government in power at the time. constituted to formulate proThe honourable member for Yarra( Mr. Tudor) and the honourable member for a Commonwealth Bureau of Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) were members and Industry.

I have shown that when the scheme for the Institute of Science and Industry was first formulated, the whole of the then State Governments were asked to send their representatives. There were also present the representatives of the Universities and of different -State institutions* They formulated the scheme for this Institute, and the B ill is based on their repoTt. An Advisory Council was also constituted as they proposed, and it has done a good deal of work. It was never anticipated that it would continue in existence for so' long, because it was thought that the Institute would be established much sooner. In pursuance of the scheme certain persons were appointed members of the Advisory Council, a meeting of which was convened in Melbourne in A p r i l , 1916,",61,Abbott I Have No Of A L L Forms Of Electricity Metersy The

A t this Conference the following were present:-The Minister, Senator Pearce, as President; the State Ministers of Agriculture, Hon. F . W . Hagelthorn, Victoria; H o n . C.

As a. result of the first meeting of the Advisory Council, in order that each State should have not less than three representatives on the Council, in addition to Ministers of Agriculture, who are ex officio members, tbe Commonwealth Government asked certain of the State Governments to nominate representatives as follows:-Queensland , two additional members; South Australia, three additional members; Western Australia, two additional members; Tasmania, two additional members. members were duly nominated and appointed by the Commonwealth Government, so that representative State Committees were brought into existence in each State. In May, 1918, a. Premiers' Conference was held in New South Wales, which was attended by the Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) and myself. The New South Wales Premier was critical, and had suggested the following motion for the consideration of the Conference: That the Commonwealth Government be requested to cease the .procedure at present being carried out whereby unnecessary expenditure is being incurred in the assumption of functions 'by the Commonwealth Bureau of Science and Industry, which are at present being efficiently performed by the States. On page 70 of the official report of the proceedings at that Conference, honourable members will see the speech delivered by the Acting Prime Minister, who presented a complete report showing the intentions and the scheme of organization of the proposed Institute of Science and Industrv, and f u l ly explained the position. It then Acting Prime will interest honourable members if I refer them to a few of the opinions expressed by the Premiers of the various States. This was the view taken by Mr Peake, Premier of South Australia, as reported with Mr G. on page 73 of the DebatesIn my view, this is one of tlie big questions which we might very well feel satisfied belong rather to the Commonwealth than to thei States, because no scientific discovery will be purely a State affair. It is simply a question of whetlier the Commonwealth can show us that we are going to have increased efficiency without duplication of the cost of the State Departments. Ifi t can show us, then I for one will heartily support the Commonwealth taking over the whole of the departments of scientific research, because I think they would do the work much better. When introducing the B ill , I divided the work of scientific investigation into three classes-administrative , educational, and research-and pointed out that the Commonwealth Institute was primarily and practically intended for research and in vestigation only. Mr Peake went on to say, page 76I would like to put another view from the stand-point of the States. I do not think any State stands more strongly for State rights These additional than does South Australia; but we regard science as on an entirely different footing from practical administrative work. Science has no boundaries, and the operations of a scientific bureau could very well .be spread .over the whole of Australia, both from the point of view of more effective work and from the stand-point of economy. What is the use of five or six different State Departments pursuing inquiries on different lines when, possibly, one body could much more effectively perform the woTk of investigation and research? Later on he addedI think that there must necessarily be greater strength in the scientific methods of the Commonwealth than in those of the States. The greater scientific knowledge which money will enable' the Commonwealth to obtain will strengthen every department, and I think that in this case the Commonwealth can very well take over all scientific investigation on behalf of the general community. Mr Lee, the Premier of Tasmania, saidI think no very great harm can come of this departure, Bureau exercises a reasonable amount of discretion-tlia t is to say, that any matters which are being investigated by a State Bureau should not be undertaken by the Commonwealth, matters peculiar to the State in which the Bureau exists. If those are left to the States, I can quite imagine there are many questions that can well be investigated by the Comnioiiwealth. In matters that are common to all the States, it appears to me the Commonwealth Bureau can effect very essential service to the whole Commonwealth. Mr Lefroy, the Premier of Western Australia, saidNo doubt the question of scientific research is more important at the present monent than, perhaps, at any previous time in Australia. There are many diseases in stock that are common to the whole of Australia, and I am of opinion that better research work could be done by one central body. There are not many men in the world who are experts in these matters. They are very difficult to obtain. If one State were able to get the services of the most experienced man to go into research work, the other States would be unable to avail themselves of his services. AlthoughI am very jealous of the sovereign rights of the States, at the same time, I think this research work could be better done through one central body. I should be prepared to fall in with any arrangement that might have that object in view, seeing that it js in the interests of my own State that it should be done. problems which we shall have to deal with in Australia in the future, and they could be better dealt with by one central body. As I have already explained, the Premier of New .South Wales was critical. fact, he went so far as to suggest, that the Commonwealth had no interest in science. This is what the Premier of Victoria( Mr Lawson) said:I confess to a large measure of sympathy with the President's views as an expression of nn abstract principle. It is, perhaps, possible that the Commonwealth, in the exercise of this right, might logically take over certain other matters which are specifically State functions, but I do not fear that. I think we might reasonably welcome this institution as capable of doing something which, unfortunately, the States have not succeeded in doing. In the State activities and State inquiries there have been overlapping and duplication, but by. means of centralization more satisburne's memorandum, which the Acting Prime Minister read, states the case fully. In 1907-8, when I was a Bureau of Agriculture Nr. Groom. and there was adverse criticism from various parts of Australia. A carefully provided the Commonwealth prepared memorandum an the matter was submitted to the Ministers for A g r i culture in the various States, and Mr Swinburne, who was then M in ister for Agriculture in Victoria, on seeing this memorandum, made a report favorable to what was proposed to be done by the Commonwealth Government. He pointed out that research work could well be undertaken by the Commonwealth, and it was this report to which low, who was Ministerf o r Landsi n Queensland at the time, took up the same attitude. Mr Lawson went on to sayI do not want him to link up the States uncler the Commonwealth. I want him to link up the States with the Commonwealth. W it h the express object of enabling the States to link up with the Commonwealth, we have inserted a provision in the B ill which provides for the making of an arrangement between the Governor General of the Commonwealth and the Governors of the States. Later on, Mr. Lawson saidIf the Acting Prime Minister can assure us that there will be general co-operation and coordination, and that this will be done, not in any overbearing way by Commonwealth officials, but with the desire to achieve the best There are ' many difficult results, to make the most effective research, and give the community the benefit of it, I think we ought to shake hands and work together for the purpose to be achieved. intention is to focus the work of the various States and complete it in a central Institute? central Institute, to co-operate w i th the States, to work in complete harmony and conjunction with , them, and to confer with them. If there is any particular class of investigation which can be carried out better by the central In s t i tute, it will be undertaken by it ; but if investigation can be better done by the co-operation of some of the State Departments and the Commonwealth, they will work together on it .

I wish to show now that since the Executive Committee were appointed, they have been -working on lines of co-operation with the States. In July and August, 1916, members of the Executive Committee visited New South Wales and Queensland to explain to the State Ministers the policy of the Institute, and to secure their assistance and co-operation. In both States the Ministers who were interviewed expressed their sympathy with the work, and promised their support. At a later date a meeting was held with in the Victorian Minister of Agriculture, with similar results. Honourable members have drawn attention to some reports published by the Advisory Council, which, they allege, contain nothing new and represent merely a compilation of previous information upon certain subjects. The way in which the Executive Committee work is this: Special committees are appointed to deal with particular subjects. Before making further investigations, they compile information of existing knowledge and past achievements. These compilations become the starting point for future investigation. In regard to the general policy of cooperation, I can illustrate to honourable members some of the steps that have been taken. In June, 1918, Dr. Gellatly again visited each of the six States with a view to securing the co-operation of their Governments in the work of the In stitute. He carried letters of introduction from the Acting Prime. Minister( Mr Watt) to the State Premiers, and explained to them the proposed working of the Institute. When he was in Queensland the State Government agreed to co-operate with the Institute on the subject of the eradication of prickly pear. A scheme was devised by. which, for a period of five years, experimentation was to take place. Then he conferred with the State Government of",64,Abbott I Have No Of A L L Forms Of Electricity Metersy The

The clays of that State are being tested at the laboratory of the State Mines Department, and the State Wheat Commissioner is working in conjunction with the Institute. A t the request of the Western Australian Government, an investigator has been sent abroad to inquire into modern methods of running a forest products laboratory, and half the expense of the t r ip is being borne by the State Government, and half by the Institute.

Given capable scientists, we must not stint them in so far as laboratories, apparatus, and materials are concerned. ments made in Tegard to the elimination of weevil from wheat have been worth hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Commonwealth. periments, I think the salaries paid involved an expenditure of only some £3,000 per annum. The important point we have to remember is, as mentioned recently by a State Premier, that highly-trained investigators are difficult to obtain. We hope that in time we shall be able to secure such men from our own Universities. They are the training grounds, and in our laboratories our men will serve their apprenticeship. I hope that in days to come we shall have, perhaps at the Seat of Government, a post-graduate University. are post-graduate classes in the United States of America, to encourage -men to develop the higher branches of science. We, however, have not yet reached that stage. community attempting to people a continent, and are face to face with all the pests and difficulties of first settlement. We are facing these practical problems in a practical way. We are anxious in the fight to apply the highest principles of science to aiding the man engaged in industry. The object of this Institute is entirely practical. It is facing, and will face, practical problems, with a view to applying science to industry. Surely Australia is not to be the only nation that expenditure did has come out of the war without learning the value of the application of science to industry. Every country is realizing the necessity for the extension of these institutions, and their greater utilization in the direction of helping its industries. I hope Australia will not lag behind. As The Institute is not an Australian, I am jealous of the reputation of my country. I want to see Australia taking its part in scientific investigation. A number of young Australians have gone abroad and have secured employment in the highest branches of scientific research. Names of such men who are occupying high positions in the scientific world of the British Empire to-day could, if necessary, be employed in our own laboratories, and making here contributions to the scientific knowledge of the world. The Leader of the Opposition spoke rather hurriedly when he said we had not been co-operating with the States. We have been co-operating with them, and desire to continue that co-operation. Most of the scientists of the States with whom I have come in contact are anxious that this reform should be brought about. I hope that before Parliament is prorogued this Institute will have become established in Australia, and that it will prove one of the most beneficial institutions in the Commonwealth. planation, I desire to inform the House that, in regard to the statement made by There the Minister( Mr Groom) concerning my attitude towards this Bill, I stand where I stood on l l t h July, 1917, when I urged that honourable members should have an opportunity to read and study We are a young the report before being called upon to take definite action.

In these circumstances, £ am not prepared to sign another blank cheque to be handed over to a board of directors, who will certainly be under the guidance of a responsible Minister, but of whose research and investigations a Minister who is a layman can know but little.

If honourable members scan the four issues of Science and Industry, the official journal of the Institute, they will find that practically .every subject under the sun may come within the scope of the Institute and be the subject of its investigations. Of course, we can only hope that sane, practical, common-sense men will not waste the nation's money in fruitless research after illusory and impossible remedies. I ask honourable members to scan the whole of the subjects dealt with in the f o u r issues of Science and Industry. If we are going to submit the whole of the difficulties that face the industries of the country to scientific research, the public purse will be affected to an extent to which I am not prepared to consent without some further safeguard against a body over The honourable gentleman which Parliament has no control.

Its duty was to make independent investigations and present independent reports to the House, which had then to decide whether certain public works shall be carried out. That has not been the result. In order to doubly safeguard the position, the Act provides that it is necessary to bring down a motion, and to submit to the House estimates of the probable cost of the work proposed to be remitted to the Committee, and that after the Committee has presented its report the House shall, by resolution, instruct the Government whether the work should be carried out or not.

From my investigations as a member of the Committee I have come to the conclusion that very few, if any, of the public works carried out for the Defence Department should not be brought strictly under the purview of the Committee. No public works of any importance for the Naval or Military Departments can be carnied out without State secrets connected with them being imparted to responsible members of the Naval and Military Boards, and it is a reflection on Parliament, and on the members of its Committee, to say that the House cannot trust them to investigate important naval or military works. It might not be advisable to publish the f u l l evidence, but Parliament certainly ought to have a knowledge of the details of the policy which ultimately it has to finance. I hope that in futur e the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act will be strictly adhered to, firstly, by obtaining the authority of Parliament to remit to the Committee every work that comes within the purview of the Act, and, secondly, when the report of the Committee is presented, by the authority of Parliament being sought for the carrying out of the work. I trust, also, that the disposition shown in the past by the Government to exempt what they consider to be important naval and military works from the investigation of the Committee, w ill be very sparingly shown, if shown at all. The present practice means that the Cabinet overrules the right and privilege of this Parliament to control the expenditure of public money. It is difiicult enough for the House to check the ordinary expenditure of the public Departments. The tendency is for that expenditure to grow, unless the House has the opportunity of discussing the Estimates before a great part of the money is exThat is, they pended, Parliament, however, can do something towards checking unnecessary expenditure on public works, and the Public Works Committee Act was passed to insure that that expenditure should be brought directly under the purview of Parliament.

One can easily make a mistake in sound reading. simply guessers. brought from GreatB r it a in to Western Australia in the gold boom claimed to be good sound readers, but messages sent at twenty words a minute very soon stuck them up, whereas Australian-trained operators were quite capable of taking messages sent at for t y words, a minute. A poor operator on a quadruplex line is a great nuisance to good operators, because he is constantly breaking in , and asking the man at the other end to repeat something he has already sent over the line. A t sea the lives of people are dependent on the wireless operator; and it is the Government's duty to see that no poorly trained man is appointed on any vessel. The Postmaster-General who introduced this important B ill with half-a-dozen words is a man who usually goes into details, and claims to have a thorough grasp of the work of every section of the Department under his control. not give us a complete statement as to the control the Government w ill exercise under the B ill . I presume that the Postmaster-General( Mr Webster) takes it for granted that honourable members are as conversant w i th this subject as he is. No doubt he is the repository of a considerable amount of information upon this matter, but I would like to have had some more information from him in reference to the position of those persons who were conducting private experimental stations prior to the war. splendid service on transports and other vessels. I have in mind one man who was engaged as a wireless operator on transports during practically the whole of the four and a half years of war. He sailed on all seas, and rendered excellent service, and I am glad that the Government have decided to include these wireless operators amongst those who deserve recognition for having done their little bit in connection with the war. I expected the Postmaster-General to in form the House of the latest developments in wireless telephony, which, I believe, will be of great advantage to Australia. If the equipMany so-called sound readers are ment does not cost more than that Some men who were required in connection with the present system of telephony, the wireless system should mean much to this country of great distances. I should like the Minister to inform the House of what measure of success has attended wireless telephony in other countries, and the possibility of its general adoption throughout Australia.
