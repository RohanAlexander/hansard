THE ROWAN COLLECTION. Minister state whether the Government intend to carry out their promise to purchase, on behalf of the Commonwealth, the valuable and historical Rowan collection? papers at hand, I must speak from memory. The matter was submitted to the art advisers of the Government, and I think their report was to the effect that the paintings of the Rowan collection were of great scientific, educational, and artistic value. Some of them, as the honourable member is, perhaps, aware, are pictures of the flora and fauna of other countries besides Australia, but the great majority of them relate to Australia and New Guinea. It was proposed by the Committee that £2,000 should be given for such of the paintings as applied to the fauna and flora of Australia and New Guinea. As that would amount to something like £2 or £3 per picture, the price seemed to be absurd. In view of the declaration of the Committee that the collection is of great artistic, scientific, and educational value, the Government is of the opinion that such an offer would be .an insult to Mrs. Rowan. Mrs. Rowan is prepared to take payment in Papuan lands for the greater part of her collection, and it will be for the House to express an opinion as to whether we should acquire it on those terms. It has been my good fortune to see the collection, and I think it would be a very great pity if Australia did not acquire it. I , however, am not going to offer Mrs. Rowan £2,000 for her life's work. If the House thinks that we should acquire these paintings, we should offer Mrs. Rowan a fair price for them. She has asked, I believe, £21,000 for the collection. Whether that is fair or not I am unable to say, but an offer of £2,000 would obviously be absurd. WAR SERVICE HMS. Minister for Repatriation seen the statement made by Mr Turnbull, President of the Victorian Branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, with regard to the faulty construction and bad drainage of certain War Service Homes at Northcote? If so, is the honourable gentleman in a position to inform the House what he contemplates doing in the matter? the statement, but have inquired into it. Early this morning I sent for the Deputy Commissioner and the branch architect, and they inform me that there is no War Service Home in Northcote in the condition described by Mr Turnbull. Only two Victorian cases have been brought under the notice of the Department. One is that of a house at Coburg, which was built by the Commonwealth Bank on land bought.by the soldier himself. The Department has carried out the work of drainage, but as to that the person complaining is silent. The second case is that of a house in Herbert-street, Preston. That, I believe, is the house referred to by Mr Turnbull. In that case also the Department is carrying out the necessary drainage work. I regret to say that statements of this kind would make it appear that nothing had been done by the Department, whereas the fact is that the remedy has been applied. great importance of the constitutional issue at stake, will the Prime Minister mention to the House on what day the Government will indicate their attitude regarding the Senate's action in pressing certain requested amendments to the Customs Tariff Bill?

So that the purchase of these vessels may be regarded as a good deal. At a subsequent date it was found that other arrangements should be made because of the very heavy loss in shipping incurred by the Allies. There were no less than 911 ships, with an aggregate tonnage of 3,729,000 tons, destroyed during the year 1917 alone. In consequence of this the Prime Minister entered into negotiations to have more ships constructed. placed orders for ships in Australia and in America. So far as the Australian orders are concerned, the ships built at Cockatoo Island, at Walsh Island, at Williamstown, and in some of the private shipyards, gave every satisfaction. There were some wooden ships that were not satisfactory. It is not necessary for me to dilate upon that point, because we have a report from the Public Works Committee who inquired into the building of those ships, and are awaiting the decision of the Government .in regard to that report. The fact remains that it was found that although shipbuilding was only in the initial stage in Australia, and our workmen had to gain knowledge of the business, we were able to build ships at fair and reasonable prices, and, indeed, at a -cost not greater than ships were being built for in other parts of the world at that time. At Cockatoo Island the cost was £33 10s. 4d. per ton, and at Williamstown £29 17s. l d . That was the cost of building vessels of the D class. The cost of building the E class boats at Williamstown was £30 per ton, and at Cockatoo Island Dock £32 6s. 3d. These prices compared favourably with the cost of ships built elsewhere. it in that way. The Prime Minister has said that so far as the workmanship on to pay for the ships. tliese vessels is concerned it is equal to the workmanship in any other part of into that directly. My point is that so the world. The costs at Walsh Island much more work is provided, so much have not been supplied, but I think I more revenue is raised by having Austraam right in saying that they were somelian ships built locally, that the question thing like £30 per ton. When at the of cheaper rates, ton for ton, is considertime I visited Walsh Island the manager ably more than balanced. What is the of the shipyard there told me that Japanese buyers had just visited the island in search of ships. The Japanese Government were then asking for tenders for the building of vessels, and their buyers were surprised to find that vessels could be built at the time in Australia for . £30 a ton. They said that they could not bo built at the same price in many other parts of the world, and it was a lower price than that which they expected to have to pay for ships. ton under the cost of shipbuilding in any other part of the world. the Minister's statement. It stands to the credit of erery one concerned in shipbuilding in Australia, when we consider that the industry here Avas in its initial stage, that we were able to compete successfully with shipbuilding yards in other parts of the world, which had been established for years. As we have spent so much in establishing shipyards, and have been so successful, are we going now to permit the building of ships in Australia to cease? Are Australian workmen, who have done so magnificently, to remain idle while artisans in other countries do our work for us? Or shall we stand by the policy, so far as may be possible, of having Australia's ships built in Australia? There is no reason at this juncture, when war conditions are past, why Australian workmen should be required either to come down to the level of workmen in countries where bad times are being experienced, or be rendered idle owing to the cessation of shipbuilding activities. There is something more than the actual factor of costs to be considered. We should not lose sight of the fact that, by giving the work of building ships to Australian workmen, we employ not merely those workmen, but almost innumerable hands in other directions. does not reduce the cost to those who have",26,Smith Approxi I Realize That Prospects Of Shipping All Over

I propose to quote specific figures covering the activities of one company alone which is vitally concerned in shipbuilding in Australia for the reason that it produces much of the material essential to the industry. Proprietary Company. is being compelled, at the present time, to dispense with a large number of hands owing to slackness of trade-a state of affairs due largely to various orders having been sent abroad, so that the materials are now being dumped in Australia from overseas. In this latter regard I may cite the case of the Victorian Government, which recently placed "" outside "" orders, having to do with the Morwell scheme, totalling between £400,000 and £500,000. have been that the materials could be purchased more cheaply overseas; but I emphasize that there are many otlier considerations besides the factor of exact cost. sideration of the maintained employment of Australians in the production of materials from Australian raw supplies. I hold that that factor alone more than counterbalances the consideration of a cheaper foreign quotation. the Broken Hill Proprietary Company paid to the Commonwealth Government by way of war profits taxation £70,334; to the Commonwealth Government, for income tax, £77,412; to the .New South Wales Government, £66,784; and to the South Australian Government, £28,054a total of £242,584.

For example, the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company keeps a couple of coal mines going to-day. The firm probably takes between 1,000 and 2,000 tons of coal for every day that its works are kept going. If the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company's works are to be whole allowed to close down, the men employed on those two coal mines must also be thrown into idleness.

I think the Prime Minister said the total loss to the Commonwealth was £2,343,159, and that nine of the boats had been sold for £17,360 each. I suppose the amount for which the nine vessels were sold was credited to the total cost, and that the amount remaining was £2,343,159. In addition, the Prime Minister said there were five boats laid up in Australia, and incurring certain costs which would have to be taken into account.

I now desire to draw attention to the list of enemy 1 vessels. I always had a considerable amount of doubt as to what would become of them.

Has any one valued them? is debited against the Commonwealth Shipping .Line at the amount stated, but what, the value actually is can only be ascertained by the Prize Courts. ther the Commonwealth, now that the war is over, has a right to retain these ships, or whether they have a right to retain the profit of £4,826,338 earned by them* I notice in the newspapers to-day that a judgment has been given which seems to set this point at rest. The Judge has held that the Oommonwealth Government are entitled to hold these ships. I had a doubt on the point, but I may be wrong. I hope that, when the Prime Minister is speaking later, he will make it clear whether the Commonwealth Government have a right to retain these vessels, and will state the amount of their earnings during the time we have been running them. have the right to retain them; but their value has to be determined by the Courts and debited against our share of the reparation payments. This matter has been have stated quite definitely that we regarded these ships as ours, and quite properly so. The question of how much we should be debited with has to be determined outside ourselves-that is to say, by the Court-and it will be debited against our share of the reparation payments. whatever we may get from these boats will be part and parcel of the reparation payments to be received by us from the enemy. The Prime Minister stated that the cost of the vessels of the Commonwealth Line was £9 per ton. I do not want that to be regarded as a fair index of their present value. In arriving at that figure, the Prime Minister made certain deductions. He took the value of the profit made by the ships and deducted that from their capital cost; then, by taking the total tonnage of the vessels into account, he arrived at the figure of £9 per ton. It is not fair, however-, to take that figure into consideration when deciding whether the Government should continue shipbuilding. # sired to make was that, if the Line is -to continue as a business concern, it must earn profits on the £9 per ton basis, and not upon the present prices. ister was making a comparison to show that the deal was a good one for the Commonwealth; but, as far as the future is concerned, the amount of capital that will",29,Smith Approxi I Realize That Prospects Of Shipping All Over

Tn most of these cases, with two exceptions, the orders have either been completed or the ships are in process of construction. The two exceptions are ships which will be built at Cockatoo Island, and in connection with them the Government have already expended £336,000 on machinery. If the Committee decides that no further shipbuilding must be undertaken, it means that £336,000 worth of machinery will have to lie deteriorating at Cockatoo Island, or will have to be sold at a big loss. It is very questionable whether the Government could find a purchaser for the whole of it, although they might for portion of it. Another matter, also, has to be considered. The ships are both of 12,500 tons capacity, with an average speed of 15 knots, and are an improvement on the ordinary class of vessel in the fleet. Most of the existing vessels are tramp steamers-carg o carriers-bu t the new boats are to be built with refrigerating space, and to carry passengers. feet of refrigerating space. ship is very scarce, because, during the war, our late enemies seemed to lay themselves out to sink passenger ships with refrigerating space for perishable produce. Since the armistice every effort has been made by all those countries that suffered losses during the war to replace vessels that have been sunk. The vessels to be constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard and the five that are being built in Great Britain will be faster than our existing ships, and, therefore, will be very no right to do that. suitable for the carriage of our primary products. [Extension of time granted.'] No one should welcome the construction of these vessels more than the primary producers and their representatives in this bers of this House have it in their power Parliament, because the shipping position, as disclosed by the cable which the Prime Minister read to-day from the Manager of the Commonwealth Shipping Line( Mr Larkin) is likely to be serious. Mr Larkin has advised the Prime Minister that Lord Inchcape holds the view that the prospect for shipping is bad all over the world, and that the Conference Line should either buy the Commonwealth ships or else the Commonwealth should 1921-1922. ' 13321 purchase their vessels engaged in the Australian trade. Why do they want to buy our ships? a good wicket if they do. our ships in order that, as a Combine, they may more effectively regulate freights and fares. Make no mistake about that. Only on Friday last a cable, emanating from the Conference Line, appeared in the Melbourne Herald stating that owing to. the unsatisfactory outlook for shipping all over the world it would be necessary either to sink or destroy a large number of the vessels controlled by the Line, in order that by regulating freights and fares a more satisfactory return may be obtained from the vessels that are left. Some honourable members suggest that, in view of the changed shipping position, as a result of which vessels may be purchased for a few pounds per ton less than the cost of construction in Australia, we should not go on with our shipbuilding programme. I say that if we adopt that line of reasoning we shall be playing rigb t into the hands of the great Shipping Combine, because if they succeed in buying our vessels they will be able to control shipping from one end of the world to the other, and make their profits from higher freights and passenger fares. What will be the position of the primary producer then? fore, because the Commonwealth Line practically joined the Combine. of the Commonwealth Line would have same. to determine the policy of the Commonwealth Shipping Line.

I trust the Committee will be prepared to support both these items, because if they are passed, it will indicate that Parliament is in favour of the ship construction policy being continued, and the operations of the Commonwealth Line not being, interfered with. I agree with the statement of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) and that of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr a State award when they do not apply to Charlton) that this is an exceedingly important subject, and should be fully debated. It has to be admitted that there has been considerable muddling in connection with the construction of ships in the past. I was a member of the Royal Commission which inquired into Commonwealth shipbuilding generally, and I should admit at the outset that I . was pleased to learn that the work performed by Australian artisans was of the highest standard. challenged, and it is one which we should freely recognise. procedure in connection with shipbuilding at Cockatoo Island would have been a screaming farce if it unfortunately had not been so costly, because of the fact that at least four Government Departments were interested in Cockatoo Island. officers and regulations, which were very often in conflict, and which invariably resulted in chaos and increased the cost of the work. to me that the Superintending Manager succeeded in carrying out any work, considering the circumstances under which operations were conducted. One of the principal reasons for dissatisfaction was the absurd Shipping Tribunal, the decisions of which overrode Federal and' State awards, and which produced in some instances startling results. In some cases two first-class mechanics with equal capabilities would be receiving different rates of pay. One would be earning 18s. 6d. per day, while the one working under the conditions set up by the tribunal would be earning perhaps £ 3 10s. per day. There was also the absurdity that the unskilled labourer attached to the latter would be receiving 50s. a day, whilst the skilled artisan working beside him would be receiving 18s. a day. ber, ought to be aware that on a ship costing £170,000 the additional cost so involved' would be only a little more than £800. justification for setting up an absurd tribunal, the decisions of which overrode Federal and State awards, and which created dissatisfaction among the workers. Commonwealth activities ? of that tribunal overrode all awards. It was a special tribunal created by the Prime Minister to deal with this particular class of work, and the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) must admit that its decisions were extraordinary in their results. The honourable member and others who were members of that Commission will admit that That fact has never been when witnesses appeared before the Commission and were asked certain questions The whole they frequently replied, "" That is not in my Department. It is a matter for the Public Works Department."" Another witness would say, "" That is a matter for the Department of the Navy."" shows the absurdity of the position. Honourable members can readily understand the difficulties that would arise when It is a wonder operations were being conducted by three or four Departments under different Ministerial heads. The work was carried out in such a way that, approximately, 2,400 men were thrown out of work without any warning, and it was a disgraceful act on the part'of those who were responsible. A sum was voted by Parliament to cover the expenditure on ship construction for twelve months; but the amount was spent in about eight months.",32,Smith Approxi I Realize That Prospects Of Shipping All Over

For instance, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, which bought out the Union Company, has joined the Inchcape Combine. The Union Company is in partnership with Huddafrt, Parker, and Company, and several of the other lines have been bought out, so it is exceedingly difficult now to find lines of steamers which are not in this Combine.

Now, with the war over, the charge has been increased to 8s. for a bushel case. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) has repeatedly brought under notice the freight on meat. The cost of running ships must, of course, bo taken into consideration. I put a question, I think, to the Prime Minister some time ago, and he told the House that the cost of running a boat from Australia to England was now 285 per cent, higher than before the war. This Parliament must make a choice deliberately and quickly, unless the primary products of Australia are to be shut out of the world's markets. We must either reduce the cost of running ships and the cost of building them, or we must make a deliberate vote in order to meet the added .cost. We have already agreed to a. duty of 25 per cent, on vessels, and that increases the capital cost by one-fourth. Running costs having increased 285 per cent, as compared with the figures of seven years ago, we must either deal effectively with this serious situation, or Australia's primary products will not be able to reach, the markets of the world.

MrM c WILLIAMS It is a serious matter. The Prime Minister stated the other day that he would resolutely refuse to allow politics to be brought into the management of the Commonwealth Line. That would be a very good stunt if it were carried out, but it is not carried out. This is one of the recommendations of the Select Committee on the Seacarriage of Goods which investigated shipping matters some three years agoYour Committee has been advised that changes have been made in the agencies of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers dt Australian ports by the establishment of branch offices at various ports. Your Committee recommends that, wherever possible, this policy should be extended and the oversea agency taken out of tlie hands of firms who are also agents for privately-owned steam-ship companies. The management of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers enforces everywhere but in Hobart the very wholesome regulation that no one who is an agent for the steamers of the combined companies shall act as agent for the Commonwealth Line. of the Commonwealth Line at Hobart?

There is a State-owned steam-ship company in Tasmania, and it should be the agent for the Commonwealth Line. If it were the agent, all who approached it would get a fair deal."" I differ from the Prime Minister on the subject of the wooden ships that were built for the Commonwealth. Those vessels failed, not because they were woodien, but because they were badly constructed. The pumps had to be used all the way to Australia on the first of the wooden vessels that* came here from America to keep her afloat. vessel. applies to nearly all the wooden vessels built in America. One of them, when loading at Hobart, had to discontinue taking in cargo which was waiting for it, long before its hold space was fully occupied, because the water was pouring in between the top planks. The Prime Minister quoted me as having favoured the construction of wooden vessels, and it is because of that quotation that I am referring to the matter now. Immediately after the war broke out I advocated the construction locally of two Dieselengined fore and aft schooners of 1,000 tons, or a little more, each. The price was to be £25 per ton, and a builder was willing to bind himself under an enormous penalty to construct the vessels within twelve months. The -Government made a very great mistake in not haying those vessels built. No one complained when steamers were taken away from Australia to assist the Empire elsewhere in the conduct of the war; but the dearth of coastal shipping which resulted caused produce to rot, and timber to warp, everywhere in Tasmania. have got the Diesel engines? the Mersey, offered to supply them. M i . POYNTON -He got a contract, and did no good with it. ment refused to give him a contract for schooners, which he could have built, but gave him a contract for large steel steamships, which he could not build. If the wooden vessels which were . built in America had been honestly constructed Victory is still afloat. wooden vessels are not capable of good service is ridiculous. There are no finer ships anywhere than the six-masted schooners which come to Australia from ; the United States of America and Canada, but they are vessels which have been honestly constructed. I have asked over and over again for the names of those responsible for the specifications of the wooden ships built for us, of those who drew up the contracts and perused them was not the on behalf of the Commonwealth, and of those responsible for the boats being taken over. the names of those who overlooked the work in America? why those vessels are now being employed in the unprofitable business of barnaclefarming is that they were built of green oregon, and will not have a life of more than ten years from the date of launching. The Prime Minister has told us that it was useless to go to law about them, but in Fairplay of the 11th August this statement occursI t is reported in the American papers that an Arbitration Board has awarded the Patterson-MacDonald Shipbuilding Company of Seattle $1,028,458 in shipping claims against the Australian Commonwealth Government. The award has been submitted to the United States Court for approval. The claims grew out of the construction of nine 4,200-ton wooden ships by the company for the Australian Government, the original claim being for $1,114,944. The Commonwealth, in addition to what it has already paid for these rotten sieves, will have to pay £275,000 because of the faulty contract under which the vessels were built. are in the same mess themselves.",35,Foster Wh O Was Re Mr M O Williams T H E Disquieting

151,Mr Richard Foster,"The Americanscorrupt. The vessels which were sent to Australia were fraudulently constructed, and were corruptly accepted on behalf of the Commonwealth. That may seem strong language to use, but the statement is true. The officers who came over on those boats will tell you that they were sieves, and that nothing ""but corruption would have accounted for them, having been passed. The fault was, not in constructing the vessels of wood, but in allowexcess of their actual value when ing badly-constructed vessels to be passed off on us. These vessels have been built of green Douglas pine, known here as oregon, and their life, as I have said, will building our Tariff wall higher and not exceed ten years, and I doubt if it will reach eight years. One of the vessels had to be replanked from the deck-line up. This is not the fault of the Minister who is now in charge of shipping ( Mr capital costs, and an increase of 285 per Poynton), but it is the fault of tliose who drew up the contracts, and of those who supervised the work for the Commonwealth and took over the vessels on completion. responsibility in a matter of this kind? to look for Ministerial responsibility in this House. No one in this Ministry is responsible for anything.

While we have warships, we must make provision for repairing them, and must keep employed the staff needed for that service. If the figures given by the honourable member are correct, there is about £250,000 worth of material at Cockatoo Island. and fifty thousand pounds' worth. hand £350,000 worth of material for the construction of ships, then probably the best course would be to complete those now being built. I hope, however, that there will be a complete cessation of shipvernment have been exceedingly fortubuilding a3 it is now being carried on by the Government, because a vessel is no sooner completed and ready to be put into commission than she has to be tied up for lack of cargo. The Prime Minister has said that there is something like 11,000,000 tons of shipping over ancl above the ordinary requirements of the world to-day, and that statement, according to my reading, is by no means exaggerated. [Extension of time granted.'] It is impossible for the Government to go on building ships at a cost very much in launched unless we are to have a millstone tied for all time round the neck of Australian trade. The one object 'of higher is to put a stop to importations. If our ships have to depend for their revenue on only one-way cargo, and if , in addition, we are to have these increased cent, in running costs, it will be impossible for our primary produots to compete in the open markets.of the world. One of the great difficulties with which one is always confronted in reducing public expenditure is that it means to many loss of employment. Every department introduced creates vested interests. To set out on a policy of retrenchment, a man Should have no heart. No one desires to see men thrown out of employment; and it makes one's heart ache to learn that, because of the retrenchment already decided upon, 400 or 500 returned men have been thrown out of work. If the Government are to discontinue shipbuilding, thousands of men will be thrown out of employment. This Committee, however, must sooner or later face the position, and must cut down expenditure wherever it can reasonably do so. We cannot continue building ships at three times their value solely to create work. If the Commonwealth Line of Steamers is to be run in competition with other lines, the manager must be given a fair run. When giving evidence before the Committee appointed to inquire into the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, the Manager of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers said that he could not compete with the shipping of the world if in the construction of his ships his capital cost were overloaded.

I strongly protested as the time, was done; hut while the war was in progress emergent conditions were constantly arising, and the Government, and particularly the Prime -Minister, had to be left free to a large extent to do what they considered to be best for the proper defence of Australia. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has referred to the establishment oi what was known as the Shipbuilding Tribunal, which managed in a very extraordinary way to settle the disputes which arose from time to time by practically conceding the demands made without any consideration for the Government. Whether the disputes were right or wrong, those who created them -the workmen immediately concernedwere the men in whose favour the decisions of the Tribunal were invariably given. Such a one-sided "" HeadsI win, tails you lose,"" sort of Tribunal was no commendation to the Commonwealth shipbuilding policy. I am glad that the Government have intimated their determination to put an end to Commonwealth shipbuilding. mean that the industry is not to be carried on in Australia. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has indicated very clearly that he wants to offer every facility to the development of the shipbuilding industry by any private individual or firm that chooses to commence operations here. He has said that, as far as possible, the docks and machinery of the Government will be placed at the disposal of such people. have deliberately imposed a duty of 25 per cent, to protect aud encourage the shipbuilding industry in Australia. If the industry is to be a profitable one, then the Government offer every facility for its development. If it is going the war. There is, no doubt, much to be to be an unprofitable industry, that is a special reason why the Government should at once bring it to an end. If we are to continue the ownership^ of the existing Commonwealth Line of Steamers it may be necessary to some extent that we should at least have in the Commonwealth repairing yards, apart from those controlled by private enterprise. Assuming that we are going to continue, thc ownership of the Commonwealth steamers, ship repairing yards must be available to the Government at any time. I applaud the decision of the Government. I am distinctly opposed to thc continuation of the industry by the Government itself. The exigencies of the war have passed. The circumstances which might then have justified the Government in entering upon the industry no longer exist, and the time has arrived for us to survey the whole position, and to say how best we can get out of it. I admit that the sudden discharge of a great number of workmen must give rise to difficulties, and it must be left to some extent to the Government to make the change as gradual as possible, so that there will be no undue hardship. the position. that reason the completion of those ships whose construction has been substantially advanced, may be justified, firstly, because we are committed to their construction, and, secondly, because of the unemployment problem which we cannot alThat decision does not together disregard. But at the earliest possible moment an intimation should be given to the workmen in this industry that their occupation is gradually, but surely, coming to an end, I listened with interest to the speech upon shipping made by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). It was skilfully prepared and delivered, and a goodprima facie case was made out. But I do not take it all at its face value, and cerI n addition, the Government tainly, from an accountancy stand-point, most of it could be readily challenged. The right honourable gentleman contended that we were not justified in debiting the Government enterprise with the loss of over £2,000,000 on the wooden ships, because that was essentially a loss due to said in favour of that contention, but the right honourable gentleman surprised me very much when he sought to take this credit: ""Net earnings of ex-enemy vessels for whole period since they were seized, not counting saving to Commonwealth in carrying large numbers of soldiers, £4,066,266."" On the one hand he claimed that the loss on the wooden ships was a war loss and should not be debited, but on the other hand he claimed a credit of £4,066,266",38,Foster Wh O Was Re Mr M O Williams T H E Disquieting
170,Mr Atkinson,They must ease down,39,Foster Wh O Was Re Mr M O Williams T H E Disquieting
171,Sir Robert Best,"Quite so. Eorin respect of the earnings of the ex-enemy ships, although they were equally incidental to the war. are not to be taken into consideration, neither are the wooden ships, and so we are confined to the "" A u s t r a l "" ships, from which we made a profit of nearly £3,000,000. point I am making. We should not take into consideration either the losses on the wooden ships or the earnings by the exenemy ships, because they are a debit and a credit respectively to the war. Moreover, as the right honourable gentleman mentioned this afternoon, the Peace Treaty provides that all liabilities owing to. the Germans by Australians must be paid to the Australian Government, and, on the other hand, all moneys owing to Australians by Germans must be paid to the German Government. member is in error. There is no liability on the Australian Government to pay anything to Germany. to Australians by Germans must be paid by the Australian Government, and moneys owing by Australians to Germans must be paid by the German Government. our part at all. through the clearing house. said represents the practical operation rf the arrangement made in the Peace Treaty.

But, at the same time, when he claims a. credit of £3,000,000 in regard to that transaction, that claim can be allowed only by taking the remaining ships into credit at cost value, whereas, as a matter of fact, they are practically valueless at the present time. we have paid the book value for them, and after writing ofE the whole capital cost, we have made a net gain of £1,669,387. If they are valueless, we still have the profit of £3,000,000. 1 that is strictly correct; but I turn now to another point. In the Budget speech, the Treasurer stated that the capital cost of ships purchased or constructed out of loan moneys, including ships in course of construction, was £7,137,328. Does that amount represent the actual cost of those ships to the Government or their present day value? have actually paid or contracted to pay. that the amount stated represents the cost, and that it is not to-day's value of the ships of the "" Austral"" Line that is included in that amount. the "" Austral"" ships at their book value. operations of the "" Austral"" ships have been satisfactory, but shipbuilding cannot continue in Australia at the present price. It is perfectly clear that we have to reckon up the position at once, and bring the present operations to a termination as early as possible. A t the same time, I am very anxious that every effort shall be made to continue the shipbuilding industry in Australia by private enterprise; that is the very object of the Tariff, and, I hope, of the Government. The future of the Shipping Line is a more difficult problem., and in regard to it one is hardly justified in coming to a hasty determination at the present moment. Possibly there may be some justification, for continuing to operate this Line for a time, but I am desirous that it should not be continued indefinitely. The Government should take an early opportunity of getting rid of this enterprise, because I am perfectly certain that it cannot be carried on by the Government as advantageously as it could be carried on by private enterprise.

Provision is made on this year's Estimates for an expenditure of £3,000,000 upon ship construction. The bulk of this money will be spent on ships which are being constructed overseas. It is anticipated that the payment to Vickers Limited for the period will be £1,267,000. We hope that the vessels they have under construction will be practically completed during the twelve months. It is also anticipated that £900,000 will be paid this year to Beardmore's. These for the construction of ships in Australia. These payments swell the Estimates for this year, but as a result of the completion of the vessels overseas this item for construction will practically disappear next year. In Australia there are three further vessels of the E type to be launched; two during December, and one in January next, which will leave only two others of that type still to be constructed out of the original contract; one by Poole and Steel, of Adelaide, and one at Williamstown, which is to be put together from material supplied by Walkers Limited, Queensland.

There are in all about 3,000 men engaged in shipbuilding in Australia, including those employed by private firms. A t one period during the war there were as many as 5,000 employed on this class of work. There is no country in the world that has greater need for encouraging shipbuilding than has Australia. As we increase our production so w ill our need for vessels increase, no inatter what Government may be in power. The men we have employed upon this work of shipbuilding have proved themselves capable. vessel launched has shown a marked improvement launched, Lloyds' surveyors and others that the workmanship on the vessels built in Australia is quite equal to that which can be seen in vessels built elsewhere. No industry employs a greater variety of trades. We have distributed £1,337,000 in wages among thirty-three classes of tradesmen. These include ship draughtsmen, engine draughtsmen, accountants, clerks, time-keepers, watchmen, platers, riveters, caulkers, drillers, angle-iron smiths, iron workers' assistants, blacksmiths, shipwrights, joiners, cabinetmakers, painters, polishers, upholsterers, saw-millers, sheet-metal workers, electricians, riggers, general labourers, boilermakers, engine-fitters, machinists, ironfounders, brassfounders, coppersmiths, plumbers, brassfinishers, and fettlers. These are the men directly employed, but a glance at any shipbuilding yard will show at once how many other classes of people find employment as the result of shipbuilding. I have been associated with the Commonwealth Shipbuilding Department since its inception. In m y opinion it would be madness for Australia to close down its yards simply because of a little panic at the present time. I have recently taken over control of Cockatoo Island, where various reforms have been instituted, and I propose to show some of the results. .For one thing overhead charges have decreased from 133 per cent, when the Board took control to 35 per cent., including interest and depreciation. of that huge difference? with the services of twelve foremen, thirty-six draughtsmen, one medical officer, one assistant shipyard manager, and three inspectors.

As soon as the Armistice was signed, I cancelled sixteen out of eighteen wooden ships being built in Australia, and those cancellations represented a total loss of something like £4 per ton per ship. In America at that time on the first 370 ships ordered their cancellations represented a loss of £14 14s. per ton. , W it h in the last nine months I arranged for the cancellation of three steel ships of the E type, and I was able to do that without a loss to the Commonwealth of a solitary penny. I made arrangements with Messrs. Poole and Steel to give up one of the ships ordered fromthem, and with Walkers Limited, of Maryborough, Queensland, to give up two ships. This was the more readily agreed to because of financial stress and the fact that the firms mentioned found it very difficult to finance their big undertakings.

He referred also to the huge profits made by the Line after liquidating the capital account. showed that we have made up to £&,000,000 in profits by the transaction. I should like to say that while it is fortunate we did not make that loss, the profits which have been made indicate that the right honourable gentleman did a considerable amount of profiteering with the Line. The ships of the world were available, so far as they could have been made available in the light of warlike operations by sea. The right honourable gentleman placed the ships fie bought entirely in the hands of the Imperial Government, notwithstanding that he now claims that he bought the Line to shift Australia's produce, and to do so at cheaper rates. ister did. owes the primary producers those ships, because they bought them by their payment of high freights. But the fact is that, so soon as the Government got hold of those vessels, they joined the Combine. which the honourable member is the The Government bought them with a view apostle. to keeping rates down to a reasonable margin in the interests of -Australia's primary producers. That was what was said on the one hand, but the incontrovertible fact, on the other, is that the Government immediately joined the Combine which they had set out to fight.

Much alarm has been raised by honourable members concerning what would happen if Australia were „ He thrown back into the hands of the Combine as an outcome of the disposal of our fleet. I would remind honourable members of the state of affairs existing before the war. When we had no ships of our own in active competition, Australian wheat was conveyed to the Old Country at the rate of about lOd. per bushel. The Commonwealth Line charged freight rates running between 3s. 6d. and 4s. 6d. per bushel. of the wheat sold in the Old Country? has nothing to do with the matter. That the Australian vessels were so soon paid for demonstrates the fact that, not only did other people profiteer, but the Commonwealth Line also; and it is clear that the Australian shipping authorities have not acted differently from other similar concerns.

I repeat that Australia's great handicap is her distance from the world's markets. I can, of course, appreciate the attitude of honourable members who represent shipbuilding localities. They are engaged in special pleading, but I invite them to view the whole case in the broadest light. Australia is 12,000 miles away from the world's markets, and the most important consideration is to have Australian produce conveyed to those markets as cheaply as possible, in order to offset the handicap of distance. What will be the effect upon Australia, however, following upon the imposition of the 25 per cent, duties recently decided upon? The effect must be to increase the handicap of distance; Australia will be virtually 16,000 miles away from the heart of her markets. When the 25 per cent, duty has been levied upon shipping brought here to carry Australian produce, the outcome must inevitably be to add that percentage to the price of freights. In other words, Australia will have been removed another 25 per cent, of her present distance from the world's markets. be added to the price of bread. presentatives of shipbuilding constituenin fact, an imposition of £125,000. cies are specially pleading for the continuance of the industry in Australia.

But, if Australia cannot do so, why should there be complaints if the Combine can transport our produce more cheaply? that the Combine will keep prices down? freights were exceedingly reasonable. did not exist then. have no reason to expect that the Combine will take an undue advantage of or will adopt a different attitude towards Australia compared with our experience of former days. I would like the Prime Minister to explain how the imposition of a 25 per cent, duty will be covered except by way of increased freights. There can be no other way, unless the public is prepared to pay the difference involved, by way of a bonus. And, if that difference is added to the freight rates, the effect will be to remove Australia still further from the world's markets. levied upon any ship unless engaged in Australian waters. If a vessel simply comes here and goes away again, carrying our produce overseas, there will be no question of duty. the overseas trade will be protected by a duty of 25 per cent.

At all events, the amount will be set off against any reparation claims, and probably we can accept the figures as given by the Prime Minister. There is only one other point which I want to raise before I deal with the ships themselves, and that honourable is with regard to the profit which the Prime Minister is claiming for the Austral steamers of £2,993,245. The profit in June, 1920, was £2,201,000, which means that since June of last year the steamers have earned a profit of practically £800,000. It is perfectly clear to anybody with a knowledge of the conditions in the shipping world for that year that this profit was never made. There is also the statement by the ex-Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) that our shipping' activities showed a profit of £500,000, but",49,Prowse

277,Mr Brtjce,"No. With all respectI imagine that the answer which no doubt w ill be given is that the figures mentioned by the Prime Minister jdo not allow for depreciation on capital cost of the ships themselves. The balance-sheet, figures from which I have just placed before honourable members, includes certain amounts written off for depreciation, and the only way in which we can arrive at the figure given by the Prime Minister is by restoring those depreciation charges and adding the profit for the year 1921. at least 10 per cent., whereas general depreciation on shipping is 6 per oent. There was one amount of £180,000 written off on one occasion, but I presume this has been restored to make up the £2,993,000. self by using the Prime Minister's figures. We should endeavour to ascertain the value of the Shipping Line, what the profits are, and at what figure we could sell and get back our capital expenditure"" .without making any loss. Sitting ment I dealt with the position of the Commonwealth wooden steamers, and to a certain extent w i th the figures that have appeared in regard to the Austral Line, and the exenemy ships. I now wish to deal w i th the actual position of the ships we own, and the value at which they stand to the Commonwea'lih. In my figures I ishall quote those used by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), which deal with the cost of the vessels, the profits made, and their present capital cost to the Commonwealth. The actual position as shown by the statement of the Prime Minister is as follows:Original capital on 11 ""Australs"" £1,621,578 pear quite plain in the statement.

The amount I have given as the original capital is that at which these 'ships stand, or which they are estimated to cost when completed. In connection with the Austral LineI have taken into account the ships sold, and in regard to those lost the cost recovered from the underwriters. Against the original capital cost of £10,706,976 there are certain profits made both by the Austral Line and the ex-enemy ships, and the profits given by the Prime Minister the other day are the net profits earned to bhe 30th June, 1921, without making deduction for interest and depreciation. Certain depreciation does ajipear in the balance-sheet, and I am under the impression that that has been restored to the balance of profit and loss, and that is how the total of £2,900,000 is arrived I have safeguarded myat. The figures concerning the profits given by the Prime Minister were:Australs .. .. . . £2,903,245 Sailers .. .. .. 41.3S2 D and E steamers .. .. 84,588 Ex-enemy vessels .. .. 4,066,266 Brokerages and commissions .. 181,995 Net gain on sale of "" bought"" ships suspended from 6.30 to S p.m. after allowing for loss on sale of ""Sailers"" .. .. .. 74,343 £7,441,819 Shipping Line, the If the value of that profit is employed in writing down the present value of the ships held by the Commonwealth, they stand in to the Commonwealth at £3,265,157. But to that amount interest on the money employed-the amount, again taking the Prime Minister's figures, of £382,000has to be added. That means that the fleet stands in the books of the Commonwealth at £3,647,157. The Prime Minister's figures give the amount as £3,527,157, which shows a slight difference, which is accounted for probably in the additions, because the figures aptake the Prime Minister's figures, these .. .. .. 009,315 ships stand in to the Commonwealth Gowhich is, apparently, quite correct.

Some may nage :be worth more, and some less, but the point we have to arrive at is whether £9 5s. por ton is a fair basis on which to value the asset. We have to take the different types of steamers into account, and the obvious place where one has to begin is on Araluen tJie Austral steamers still in commission.

The principal point which we have to consider, and one in which, I think, every one is interested, is the average age, which is shown as thirteen years. ' The actual position is really worse than it might appear, because the average age is not a fair basis on which to work. According to the statement the Australport is only six years old, and the Australmead nine years, and these two have had a considerable effect in reducing the average age, which is shown as thirteen years. treme ? the Australpool are fifteen years old. It is difficult to deal with the question of tonnages. The only tonnages that can be ascertained, so far as I can gather, are the gross tonnages; and I wish to make it perfectly clear that the figures in the statement are gross tonnages, and not dead-weight tonnages.

If we are to consider this enterprise and endeavour to ascertain whether it is on a sound basis or not, we must look at that fact. to do that. give my reasons for doing so. We have to realize what ships of this character are worth.

The -purchase price per gross ton of the above ships was £43.19, and the selling price £7.93. The purchase price per dead-weight ton was £25.75, and the selling price £4.73. Considering that our ships are older, are extremely slow, and that they are of very limited capacity, I think a very outside estimate of their value would be £5 per gross ton.

If the honourable member desires information on that point, he should approach a ship-owner j but I can tell him what the answer would be. The life of a vessel depends absolutely upon when she was built, by whom she was built, and the order in which she had been kept. One ship might have a life of twenty-five years, and still be good, whereas another with a very short life might not be so serviceable. The exenemy ships, while in good condition when taken over, had to be run to death during the war, and it is very doubtful whether they could be held advantageously now. If we could get £5 per ton for them they should be sold. My personal view is that they should have been at probably would be of value; but we are to me that £5 per ton would be the utmost amount ab which we could possibly take the Austral and ex-enemy",52,Assets

If we deduct the gross tonnage of 130,061 at £5 per ton, which amounts to £650,305, we have a balance remaining on the fleet of £2,876,852. Owing to the necessary information not being readily available, I have had to deal with the tonnage of the ships in a most unsatisfactory way. The ex-enemy and Austral vessels have been taken at their gross tonnage, while the "" D "" . a u d "" E "" and "" B a y "" steamers are taken at dead-weight tonnage. deal of difference in the! value at an average price per ton. culation right through on the basis of comparing gross tonnage with gross tonnage, and dead-weight tonnage with deadweight tonnage. the basis I have indicated of all our ships is 292,661, and if we deduct the 130,061 tons of "" Austral"" and ex-enemy ships, we ai-e left with 162,600 tons. The value at which this 162,600 tons stands is £2,876,852, or about £17 15s. per deadweight ton for the "" D "" and "" E "" and tiie tons are made up as follows:-There are six "" D "" class steamers which were commissioned in 1919-20, namely, the Dromana, Behmgra, Dundula, Binoga, Dumo&a, and Dilga. absolutely short-journey steamers, and they are not vessels that could fight the Combine. They are obviously suited for our own coastal trade. The four "" E "" class steamers, which were' commissioned in 1921, are the Erriba, Enoggera, Euehmda, and another vessel the name of which I cannot give. There are seven other ships of the "" E "" class building. The total tonnage of the "" D "" ancl "" E "" class steamers is 100,100. These vessels have cost us approximately £31 per ton, but under present conditions we cannot possibly put them down at more than £15 per ton. Personally, I think that a very generous valuation. well built, and apparently they have given every satisfaction to date. If we take that valuation it means that they stand at £1,501,500 for the 100,100 tons. That reduces the tonnage left from 162,600 The result of these capitalized at £2,876,852 to 62,500 capitalized at £1,375,352, which equals about £22 per ton. This means that the five Bay steamers, which are costing £80 per ton, are held by the Commonwealth at £22 per ton. They are absolutely up-to-date boats, and have a great deal of insulated space, while they have very valuable passenger-carrying accommodation for an immigration traffic. The analysis I have presented, putting a fair value on the different classes of steamers Australia owns, establishes the fact that the Commonwealth Line is today standing in at a price which is probably lower than we could realize for it if we sold it. So it appears to me, so far as that part of my remarks is concerned, that the Commonwealth Line, from every point of view, has justified itself up to date, and that the Commonwealth can either get out of the venture The total tonnage on at this moment, and look back on a record which shows no loss, and probably a slight gain, or hand the vessels over to the Commonwealth Line on a capitalized basis which would give them a chance to compete with any likely competitor. That brings me to the question of "" Bay"" ships. The 162,600 whether we are to go on with the shipping venture or have nothing further to do with it. So far as I have been able to understand, a majority of the members of this Chamber are prepared to go on with the These are Line for one reason, and for one only, and that is that they fear the machinations of the great Shipping Combine, if it is left unfettered in the Australian trade. They are desirous of seeing the Commonwealth Line kept in existence for the sake of maintaining competition with that Combine. Tn order to ascertain whether the Commonwealth Line would be of real value in future for the purpose of restraining that combination, we have to look at the records of the past when we had our vessels in operation under very favorable conditions. The war period was not a very difficult one for the shipping companies. There are only four things that have been claimed on behalf of the Commonwealth Line. The first thing Mr Larkiu has claimed is that our ships prevented the Conference Lines from increasing the general cargo rates last year, as they had",53,Assets

298,Mr Bruce,"They are new, and aredone in other places. This, it is claimed, has saved us an increase of 25 per cent. That is one of the things that can never be ascertained with certainty, but there is, very possibly, some justification for the assertion. The second claim is that the Commonwealth Line has benefited shippers by incorporating the Commonwealth Sea Carriage of Goods Act provisions in bills of lading, and that various make an effective impression. lines have followed with a clause tantamount to this. I think the Commonwealth Line can claim to have had a considerable effect in this direction. In the third place, it is said to have been of advantage to shippers by giving opportunity for shipping from other British ports. Finally, it is claimed that the Line has increased the bill of lading valuation limit. With regard to the last named point there is not a shadow of doubt that the Commonwealth Line had a very considerable influence in that respect. The Conference Lines were refusing to accept liability for anything over £100 per package, but they have had to come into line eventually and increase that amount. It is open to question whether it was the Commonwealth Line which brought that about or whether it was obvious that the Conference Lines would have to increase the amount owing to the general increase in prices. I think, however, that the Commonwealth Line is entitled to claim some credit for what was done. admit; but it is not very great, and I do not think that it is sufficient to justify the continuance of a Government venture for the specific purpose of checking the Conference Lines, if that is all we can do. there is very much that we can accomplish. The first point to remember is that we have only sixteen steamers. Even when all the "" E "" and "" D "" class boats and the Bay steamers are completed, the Commonwealth Line will be in no sense equipped to compete with the Combine. The Australs and ex-enemy ships are finished with. Their rate of speed ia about 7 or 8 knots, and, therefore, they cannot compete with the shipping of the world. The vessels of the "" D "" type built here are too small. Their carrying capacity is not enough to make them serious competitors against privately owned vessels. This leaves only the eleven "" E "" steamers and the five "" Bay"" steamers. These sixteen vessels cannot affect the Combine seriously, because there are not enough of them. We must recognise that the Commonwealth has, not fifty-one, but only sixteen, steamers with which to carry on a freight fight, and we must have many more to have more steamers than to allow the Combine to regulate everything. the number of vessels required to effectively challenge the Combine? would be needed, because at some seasons of the year you would want them coming one way, and at other seasons the reverse way. Competition cannot be worked effectively on a narrow margin. There must be a large number of ships which at a. given moment can be diverted in a specified direction. But the path of the Combinei n the immediate future is not going to be so easy that it will be able to do exactly as it pleases in the Australian trade. I am under no delusion as to what its policy would be if it could do as it wished. It has suffered great losses in the last year or two. It has seen its fleets depreciate, but has had to go on trading although losing money. If it had the opportunity it would no doubt try to get back what it has lost. Whether that would or would Something has been achieved, I not be justifiable business procedure is not for me to say now. The question for us is, What could we do to stop it? I 'am sure that we could not do anything without a very large fleet.

The surplus shipping of the world amounts to about 10,000,000 tons. Ships are very expensive to run now, and for some time to come the rates of the Combine will remain high; but, should it carry them still higher, to a point at which it would get back the profits it has lost, there would be attracted to the Australian trade part of the shipping that is now lying idle.

Indeed, I am not at all sure that we can achieve control by continuing to r u n our ships. Moreover, one has to look at the matter as it affects the Australian taxpayer. W ill it be possible to continue to in n the Commonwealth steamers without losing money on them ? Can they be r u n on a basis on which they w ill pay their way without the taxpayers of this country being called on to find large sums to make good their operations? I see no hope of that for some years to come. The shipping trade is depressed, and things will not right themselves within a year or two years; it will probably be much longer before the The record of the working of our most successful shipping branch, the Austral tion. in 1918, £576,164; in 1919, £1,160,055 ; and in . 1920, £137,959. It reached the maximum of profit, and has since, like every other shipping'concern, been falling back. I think that for some years to come we can look for nothing but loss on our shipping venture, and I do not see what is to be gained by continuing it without compensating advantages. I do not think any one of us wishes to be a party to the running of these ships if they can be run only at a heavy loss, and at the expense of the general taxpayers, without reducing the cost of carrying our primary products below the prevailing rates. If we are going' to r u n our vessels for some years merely to lose money on them, I see no reason for continuing in the business. cheaper to the taxpayer-to abandon the Line, and allow the Combine to increase freights, or to r u n the risk of making a profit? We have made the ships pay so far. by continuing to r u n the Line we could do something to check the Combine, that would have to be seriously considered as a factor in its favour; but my attempt has been to show that with the sixteen vessels to whicli I have referred we cannot do anything to check the Combine.

As to the shipbuilding programme, I have very little to say. I was pleased to hear that the Government has decided that it cannot continue to build ships at prices in excess of their market value. I do not think that any of us would consider that a right thing to do.' We cannot bolster up an industry by losing millions in connection with it year after year. That would be an attempt to remedy an unfortunate economic position by the adoption of unsound methods which in the end would in j u r e us much more than it would benefit us.

These vessels are to have an insulated space of 350,000 cubic feet, which is a considerable factor in their favour, though it must be borne in mind that a number of vessels already in this trade have a bigger insulated space, and a great number have as much. My first thought regarding these vessels was that if they had a very large insulated space we should go on with them, even though they might cost a great deal, because they are of a type that is wanted. Apparently they are to be vessels of a good class, and of a type that has retained much of its value. not know whether we could get back their f u l l value, but we could recover a great part of it. If these steamers are constructed we shall, at least, avoid making a great loss on the material to hand, which is valued at £336,000; but, on the other side, we shall probably make a considerable loss on the vessels themselves in the present condition of affairs. It may be argued that these are vessels of a particular type, which will have their full value; but vessels of a particular type have only a particular market in which they can be sold. They are not as readily and easily sold as tramp steamers. A lot of factors have to be weighed in arriving at a decision regarding the building of these steamers; but it seems that, on the whole, we should be justified in building them, for the reason that, because of their character, the loss on them is not likely to be as great as it would be on other tonnage, and, further, that as we are, to a great extent, limiting our shipbuilding activities, and, as I hope, may decide to withdraw entirely from shipbuilding, it will be as well for the encouragement of private shipbuilding not to disperse the technical staffs that have .been gathered build the together. "" Bay"" steamers be used for carrying the mails ? This would save the subsidy now paid to the Orient Company. service could be conducted with five steamers, although their rate of speed15 knots-ma y be sumcient. The conclusion at which I have arrived is that the running of the Commonwealth Shipping Line should be discontinued; and I am opposed to the continuance of shipbuilding by the Government. I think that if shipbuilding is to become a successful industry in Australia it must be conducted by private enterprise. A t the same time, I shall support the Government in finishing the ships now under construction, and in going on with the two that are to be constructed at Cockatoo Island, for which £366,000 worth of material has been obtained. ister and Attorney-General) [8.45] -It could hardly be expected that I should I do follow in detail the figures of the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) until I had had an opportunity to closely examine them; but I understand that they were those supplied by Mr Larkin. right honourable gentleman gave the other day. myself to an examination of the honourable member's argument as directed t© the Commonwealth Line of Steamers.

I think that, upon careful examination and inspection, of the ships that come into the various ports of this country, he will see that a very large number of those which he has ruled out are quite equal to many of the ships tliat trade regularly to and from Australia. If that be so, it appears to me that it vitiates the honourable member's argument which led him to the conclusion tliat the continuation of the Line served no useful purpose to Australia, and probably would involve us in very heavy loss. If we are to look at the Line from the stand-point of a business proposition, we ought to apply that test by which men judge their own business affairs. It was, indeed, through those glasses that the honourable member declared he looked at it. He says that if he could be persuaded that this Line served a useful purpose-that it stood between Australia and the unrestricted operations of the Combine, as a shield protecting the producer, and assuring him as far as possible that freights should be fair and reasonable, he would, perhaps, be in favour of its continuation. Hut he cannot see what the sixteen vessels, which he says are all that can be .seriously considered, could do. Taking the poiuts of the honourable .member's arguments as he set them out, I say, first of all, that I do not admit thab there are only sixteen ships in tiie Commonwealth Line. There are a good many more. As to the point whether the Commonwealth Line is of such value to Australia as to deserve continuance, let us apply the supreme test by which affairs are judged by men of business. honourable member says he does not think the Line does or can affect the producer. I laid on the table of the House to-day an offer by the greatest shipping master in the world to buy this Line. Are we to believe for one moment that that offer, which is bond fide and direct, is made for any other purpose than that which is suggested by its terms? Supposing that honourable members were engaged in a certain business, and a competitor said to them, "" I will buy your business, or you can buy mine,"" one naturally would ask, "" What is the reason for this offer, other Mr Hugliei. > than a desire to secure a monopoly of the trade ?"" What other reason could there be? What other reason could have induced the head of the Conference Lines to make this offer, except to secure immunity from that competition which he regards as harmful to his business? Does the honourable member suggest that any business man makes such an offer except for such a reason? The motive in this case is obvious. The honourable member says that Ave cannot do the Conference Lines any harm. He asserts that our competition is to be disregarded, because it is insignificant. The answer to that is that it is so significant that our sole competitor-for there is only one competitor-say s to the Commonwealth, ""Your competition is such that either we must buy . you out or you must buy us out."" I ask myself what that means. .Does Lord Inchcape want to buy us out for the good of Australia, or for the good of the Conference Lines? If we buy him out, do we buy him out for the benefit of the Conference Lines or for the benefit of Australia? Let us put it that way. This Avas a double-barrelled offer"" I will buy you out, or you shall buy us out."" Let us put aside the first part of the offer, and consider the reasons that exist as to Avhy we should buy him out. If we are to buy him out, it is because we should extinguish competition and substitute for shipping over which we have no control shipping that we would directly own and control. If this argument applies in the one case it will apply in the other. And so I say that the honourable member's main argument, that he cannot see his way clear to support the Commonwealth Line because it serves no useful purpose, and The that its competition is negligible, fails in the face of this offer of our competitor, who says, in effect, "" Your competition is so material that, having behind you, as you have, the taxpayers of Australia, you may go on and we shall be ruined. Rut if we buy you out we shall not be ruined."" Why not? What is going to save them? The ansAver is obvious: the shippers of this country are going to save them from ruin. That is so obvious that it needs no argument. So tried by the test that all business men apply to business transactions, it is quite clear that, in the opinion of the head of the Confermonwealth Line; it is an experience comence Lines, the Commonwealth steamers, mon not only to the shipping companies so far from being a negligible factor, of the whole world, but to all trading exercise in fact a salutary restraint concerns. And so I say to the Committee upon the Conference Lines. orable gentleman's argument did not conin for a period of lean years must not be vert me, nor; in the face of the facts, overlooked. If honourable members expect will it convert others. While I am perthis Line to make huge profits in the fectly prepared to accept the decision of future, then they will register a decision the Committee, as I said when I was under a misapprehension. speaking on this matter originally, I nothing of the sort.

Buti t can do that only if we write Line. gotiations by the Government, or. their all business men would do, and what I agent, with Lord Inchcape which led to think Lord Inchcape himself has done. this offer being made?

That fact in itself, to my mind, is book value of their tonnage to a level an added argument why we should not that would enable them to make both sell. I said when I was speaking on this subwhich the Commonwealth Line ought ject before that I would not agree to the to follow. But when it has done Commonwealth Line of Steamers being conducted other than on business prinall that, it is not a profitable venture that ciples, and with much that the honourable I invite the Committee to contemplate. member for Flinders has said on this Like every business firm, we shall have aspect of the question I am in entire to trim our sails to the breeze in order accord. I said it was not fair to load that we may make both ends meet, the Commonwealth Line of ships with and the reason why thc Line has coma value of £30 to £32 per ton when their mended itself to the people of the country actual value was only, say, £15 per ton. is that the producer who lives by the sale If the vessels of the "" D "" and "" E "" of his products overseas, and whose prosclass are to be loaded on to the Line, the perity depends upon cheap and effective Line should be charged, not their cost sea transport of produce, thinks it will be price, but their real value, whatever it better for him, and so for Australia, that may be. I think the honourable member he should not be at the mercy of one tollput the value as £15 per ton, and I acgatherer. cept that as being sumcient, at all events, Line there is no way to the markets of for the argument. Having said so much the world save at the price that the great on one side, let me say a word or two on Conference Lines determine.

Lord account the profits earned.that the Orient Company, which has, so far as I know, only eight steamers, and is an admirably-managed Line, continues, in spite of hard times, to run its boats in such a way as to warrant its continuance. The five vessels that we are launching-indeed , one is already in the water and will, I understand, start for Australia on 5 th December, will themselves form a fine fleet. They will have a sea speed of 15 knots. They are scheduled to beat the mail steamers on the run to Australia by three days. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) said that there was no reason why these steamers should not carry the mails. The honourable member for Flinders said that he thought that that was not of itself a sufficient justification, but I remind him that they will also carry a large number of immigrants, and they will make available, at a time when it is very much needed, that added amount of refrigerating space so vital to the interests of this country. Therefore, viewing the question broadly, I am in favour of the continuance of the Line. I cannot accept the somewhat gloomy view taken by the honourable member for Flinders, and I cannot help thinking that the best proof of the value of this Line lies in the eagerness of its competitors to absorb it. I turn now to a brief consideration of shipbuilding. When speaking on. this subject before, I said that the policy of the Government was to discontinue shipbuilding but to complete the vessels which are now in course of construction. The honourable member for Flinders endorsed our policy nearly all the way. He expressed some doubt as to which of the new vessels had been advanced so far in construction as to make it more profitable to build than to discontinue building, but, broadly, he accepted our policy so far as it related to ships on which a considerable initial outlay had been made. In reply to those who say that we should cease shipbuilding altogether and not even complete those ships which are under order or partly built, let me say that this matter must be considered in its national aspect. I do not hesitate to repeat, what I said when addressing the Committee previously, that some encouragement must be given to this great industry. Such encouragement is profitable to the whole comMr Hughes. munity. Britain, one of the greatest manufacturing nations of the world, is so because for a considerable period of her existence she adopted a policy of Protection which was carried to a point far beyond what we in Australia have adopted. Whatever there is of Empire, whatever .there is of control of the sea by the British mercantile marine, and whatever there is of manufacturing greatness, she owes to the fact that for three centuries or so she adopted the most rigid The Deputy navigation laws, and sedulously encouraged shipbuilding. Had Britain not pursued such a policy there would have been no Empire, for there would have been no ships, and so no command of the sea, and, therefore, no opening for seamen. We must remember that Australia is an island continent, and that it possesses almost unlimited quantities of some of the best iron ore in the world. We must, if we wish to develop our resources and become a great nation, encourage the iron and steel industry, and there is no better way than by the making of ships, which an island continent, whose market is 12,000 miles away, must have at all hazards. The subject of unemployment has been mentioned, and it has been said that it is most unprofitable to build ships at £30 per ton to provide employment for people if , when the work is completed, its value is only"" £15 or £16 per ton. I do not deny that for a moment. The shipbuilding industry has been labouring under very great disadvantages, but it is not fair to charge it with all those added costs of material which will not necessarily recur, at any rate, not to the same extent as in the past. But, in any case, this is not the time to throw thousands of men idle. If we do that we haye to consider who is to maintain them. Hearing some people speak of unemployment, any one would imagine that by throwing tens of thousands of men out of work the State had rid itself of all responsibility. But when we have thrown out of work thousands of men, we shall still have to maintain them and their wives and children. In a barbarous state, or even in the condition of society a century or more ago, the unemployed man and his wife and children could have been allowed to starve, but we cannot do that to-day. So there is thrown upon us as a civilized comOf the honourable members who have munity the responsibility of maintaining spoken for and against the proposal to them, either by work or by doles.

323,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [9.13],"And there is no compulsion on Australia to sell its ships'. The wealth of the Commonwealth in 1913-14, before the war, was £1,200,000,000. Knibbs, it had increased by the SOth June, 1915-te n months after the declaration of the war-to £1,600,000,000. Our debts to-day total £860,000,000, upon which we have to pay interest. The value of the German mark to-day is about 1,000 to the British sovereign. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Fleming) -Ho w does the honourable member propose to connect his remarks with shipping! that we shall have ""plenty of money to spend on ships, and that we are not so much in debt as honourable members would have us believe we are. The value of the British sovereign is 1,000 German marks, so that it has now fifty' times the nominal value it had before the war. However, we may estimate that the cost of the production of goods in Germany is now five times what it was before the war. My purpose is to show that we can make enough by the freight we earn on the shipment of goods from Germany to Australia to pay not only our war debt, but also the cost of the finest fleet of vessels that ever sailed the seas. Our war debt is a curse that will lie upon our children and our children's children, even /upon the children of the men who died at the Front; but I am not for repudiation of debts. Even Sir Robert McC. Anderson is talking about the national forgiveness of debts, but he does not realize where such a thing would end. As I have said before, I wish to goodness all debts were debts of honour. It would be very much easier for some people if they were. However, to return to my figures, I have made my calculations on the basis of 710 marks to the sovereign. If , instead of the £50,000,000 worth of gold-ou r share of the indemnity-w e take from Germany goods not capable of being manufactured in Australia to the value of 50,000,000 sovereigns, we would receive goods of an actual value of £1,700,000,000, and thus, not only be able to pay the whole of our war debt, but also able to provide enough freight to* keep our ships employed for the next twenty or thirty years. The first question to be considered in the building of a railway is whether the prospective passenger and goods traffic outward from the city to the interior, and backward from the primary producers to According to the centre of population, will pay not only working expenses, but also interest and sinking fund on the cost of construction. The railway history of Western Australia should be taken to heart by every honourable member. The State has done far more than has any other State in the matter of building developmental railways. I have travelled for 80 miles from Kondinin to Narrogin along one of the narrow-gauge lines of Western Australia, and seen at each station and siding stacks of wheat ranging from 3,000 to 10,000 bags where before that line was built there was not one bag of wheat to be seen. In the same way we ought to estimate the possibility of providing for our primary producers means of carrying their produce from coastline to coastline. I have the interests of the primary producers at heart. I do not want to see them at the mercy of any Combine. They cannot deny that Government railways have been a God-send to them. Why should not Government steamers also be a God-send to them? If honourable members will do me the honour of reading a speech I delivered in 1912,. in which I prophesied the outbreak of war, they will see that I showed how the trade routes should be kept clear for our primary producers. The purchase of the Commonwealth steamers aroused a great deal of criticism, and I admit that my lips were not silent at the time, but today I am proud of the fact that we own these vessels, and I want to see the Line continued. Is there anything .more absurd than is to be seen in Sydney to,-day ?' The whole of the city tramways come to a point at Circular Quay, and private companies are then permitted to take thetraffic across the harbour to link up with the tram lines on the North Shore. But that is just the sort of absurdity the honourable member who represents Flinderslane has enunciated to-night. He advises us to sell these steamers at whatever price we can get, even at £ 5 per ton, althoughthey may have cost £30 or £40 per ton. He, as a keen business man in his own warehouse, would certainly not do that with his own stock. He would hold on. for better times.

The honourable member is not dealing with the question before the Chair. the operations of Flinders-lane at another opportunity. Senator Guthrie has already done it in another place. honourable member for Flinders may have had figures prepared on an actuarial basis by a good accountant, but there was too "" much comparing of tonnage about them, to my way of thinking. Let ns come to bed-rock upon the issue. Many attempts have been made to buy the Governmentowned railways 'of Australia. swer is to be found in our Libraryi n the time-tables of the British and European railway companies. Despite the recent increase in fares in Victoria, one can travel from Melbourne to Brighton-9 i miles-o n a first-class ticket at a cost which is less than the price of a thirdclass ticket for the same distance on an English railway. I am out for Government-owned ships. In London our Line is controlled by Mr Larkin, one of the best Jjudges of! shipping matters Australia has ever produced, and I have ample confidence in his business abilities just as I have in that of Mr Eva, who controls the office in Melbourne. These gentlemen are endeavouring to carry on in a business-like way; but if we choose to sell the ships, the Combine w ill very speedily h it up the primary producers. I have made a close study for the last fifty years of the operations of Combines, and I think I know what I am talking about when I prophesy that this would come about very soon. I hope that honourable members w ill take advantage of the rate of exchange w i th Giermany at the present time so that we may be in a position not only to wipe out our war debt, but also to provide money with which to secure, if we so desired, the finest fleet of vessels that has ever sailed any ocean, because we would have £150,000,000 to spend on then*. It is a little unfortunate that the debate Bhould have ranged over so many different .subjects. have discussed the history and origin of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and. whether we were justified in buying 1 the vessels or not. of the continuance of shipbuilding in the Commonwealth has been debated, and also the question whether we should sell the Commonwealth fleet to the owners of the Conference Lines or to any one else. Whilst a great deal of attention No . I shall expose has been given to each of these matters, the question which is of the greatest i m portance to the people of Australia at the The jiresent moment has hardly been touched upon. That question is whether the Commonwealth Line of Steamers should fix excessive and crushing rates of freight in accordance with those of the Shipping Ring of the world, or should fix its rates of freight to meet the needs of the people of Australia. That is the The anissue to which I propose to confine m y remarks, in the interests of the primary producers of Australia, and of many of our secondary industries as well. I should like, however, to say that I am totally opposed to the present proposal that we should sell the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. I am strongly in favour of the objects for which the steamers were purchased and the Line established. The purpose then was to serve the people of Australia, and I deeply regret that it should now be entirely lost sight of, and that the Commonwealth Line of Steamers should be run, not in the interests of the people of Australia, but*, so far as freights are concerned, in conjunction with the Shipping Ring of the world. I shall be able to give ample proof that this is the case before I sit down. I wish to bring under the notice of the Committee the deplorable plight in which our primary producers find themselves to-day. It is due to many causes, but one of the principal causes is the excessive and crushing overseas freights fixed by the Commonwealth Line of Steamersi n conjunction w i th the Shipping Ring. In A p r i l last, I had occasion to move the adjournment of the House, to consider the excessive and crushing overseas freights that were being charged. There was a consensus of opinion at the time that everything possible should be done to have those freights reduced. But w it h the exception of some very trifling reductions in the freights on Honourable members wool, practically no reduction in freight has been made since A p r i l last.

326,Mr Jowett (Grampians) [9.30],"weeks, in common with the rest of the people of Australia, I have become enlightened as to the obstacle in the way. I am now satisfied that this obstacle is that the iCJonunomwealth Line of Steamers, instead of being run in the interests of the people of Australia, is fixing, freights in conjunction with the Shipping Ring. I wish, first of all, to compare the present position, so far as oversea freights are concerned, with the position before the war. It is necessary to remind the Committee of the crushing nature of present freights, bearing in mind the fact that the values of our primary products are gradually declining to pre-war rates. There are some of our primary products the values of which are higher than they were before the war, but some have already declined to pre-war values. friend reminds me, some are below pre-war values. I have prepared a statement showing how present overseas freights . Beef. . Mutton Lamb Pork Rabbit skins Wool, dumped, greasy Wool, dumped, scoured Frozen rabbits Preserved meat Jam and fruit in cases Tallow Hides Sheepskins Leather in rolls or bales Basils duced, would that not cause the ships to be run at a loss? friend whether they are now being run at a profit, or, rather, whether he thinks they are being laidup at a profit? We have a vast amount of capital sunk in these ships, and as they arrive in Australia one after another is being laid up. compare with pre-war rates. The present freight on beef is three and a quarter times the freight in May, 1914; on mutton, it is three and one-seventh times; on lamb, three times; on pork, three and foneseventh times. The freight on wool is 75 per cent, higher than it was before the war. On rabbits the freight to-day is two and one-third times the freight charged in May, 1914; on preserved meat it is three and a half times; on jam and fruit in cases it is three and a half times. I shall have something to say later, in connection with the fruit industry of Australia; but at the moment I emphasize the fact that to-day the freight on jam and fruit in cases is three and a half times what it was in May, 1914. On tallow the freight to-day is three and a half times the freight in 1914, on hides it is three and one-third times, on sheepskins three times, on leather, the product of a very important secondary industry, it is three times, and on basils-tanne d sheepskins*-the freight to-day is four times what it was before the war.

If trade continues as at present, there is no doubt that more steamers will be laid up. There is only one way in which oversea trade can be revived, and that is by making it profitable for people to ship their goods. seems determined to keep up high rates of freight. The natural result of this is to prevent people shipping their goods. member contends that high freights do not mean excessive profits. What would be the effect, on the profits of shipping, of a reduction of freights ? be that the ships would make some losses, but every onei n business must take that risk at times to attract custom. If all the ship-owners of the world are determined that they will not run their vessels except at a present profit, and if the rates which they are at present charging are so high that the public will not, because they cannot, pay them, the result must be an end to trade. been periodical slumps in which only a very few of the shipping companies have continued to pay ^dividends. way out of such a difficulty is for the shipping interests to reduce freights and so encourage trade once more. There 'is not less material in the world to be transported overseas than there was at the height of the boom period; but the decisive fact is that it does not pay to ship many goods owing to excessive freight rates. The short-sighted and superficial view may be taken that it pays the shipping interests to insist upon high freight charges, even though the effect be to reduce the volume of business. sound view is that one of the most effective means by which the trade of the world can recover is by ship-owners deciding to charge such freights as will encourage business; that is to say, to charge such prices as will make it worthwhile for producers to consign their goods. the ship-owners to run their vessels. to continue to run under present conditions, in which, owing to. the rates existI ing, the public are discouraged from consigning their produce.

Alive to the significance of the change in public opinion, it is natural that the Ring should be anxious to purchase the Commonwealth vessels, so taking care that their management shall not break away and endeavour to reduce freights. The question has been raised to what extent, if any, excessive rates have discouraged or destroyed trade. I have received a statement fro m a responsible representative of the fruit-growers of Tasmania. My correspondent is one of the highest authorities upon the subject matter generally. He saysThrough high freights and shortage of shipping last season (1921), Tasmanian apple growers had to leave in their orchards tens of thousands of bushels of fruit to rot on the trees and in the orchards. on the very best and reliable authority that over 1,000,000 bushels could have 'been shipped to overseas markets last year, whereas only about 580,000 cases were consigned. This is practically a loss of, approximately, £500,000 to Tasmanian growers alone. Think of this great loss .to that State and the Commonwealth in the way of revenue from income tax. I desire to give further facts concerning the extent to which excessive freights have discouraged the shipment of goods and produce and so tended' to destroy trade. The following was issued to its clients by a firm of stock and station agents in Melbourne:With the big supplies of lamb indicated ahead for the next month, which is being offered to the public at reduced prices, the prospects are not likely to improve. Therefore, in view of the abundance of feed, an owner cannot lose anything iby holding back cattle.

I want to get a promise from the Government that if they carry on these commercial concerns in the future they will give the fullest information to Parliament as speedily as possible after the end of the financial year. honourable members who favour Government trading should support such a proposal. Surelyi f a concern is not being worked properly the sooner the facts are disclosed the better, so that criticism may be directed at the fault with a view to remedying it. I have in my hand a report of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. This Board supplies the people of Victoria with a f u ll account of its operations. I do not ask the Government to furnish a report as f u l l as this one, but Parliament ought to have a fair and square balance-sheet, with f u l l details of the year's operations, as soon as possible after the end of each financial year. Por years past I have been asking for a balance-sheet of the Small Arms Pactory, at Lithgow, I offered to bet £50, and to give the money to charities, if my statement was not correct that rifles made at Lithgow cost over £11 each, after it had been guaranteed that they were being made for £3 19s. Statement after statement was made, in this House that the Pactory was a paying concern, but the Government declined to state what the rifles were costing, because, they said, it would be giving undesirable information to outside persons. Now we find that the rifles are costing over £16 each. Surelyi t would have been a good thing to have had that information much earlier. If the Government are going to continue conducting commercial undertakings, Parliament is justified in demanding that f u l l and complete balance sheets should be presented at the earliest possible moment. I move That a reduction of £1 be made in the first item-genera l Manager, £3,000-as an intimation to the Government that the continuation of the Commonwealth shipping service is not advisable.

Even those favour of discontinuing the Commonwealth Line. favour of discontinuing the Commonwealth Line, I feel justified in making a few remarks. Amendment negatived. Some members of the Committee are evidently not anxious to hear further argument on this question; but representing, as I do, a constituency of primary producers, I feel it my duty to put the case for them against the Shipping Ring of the world. I must, as they say in the marriage service, speak now or for ever hold my peace. When this item has been passed there will be no other opportunity, short of moving a vote of want of confidence in the Government, of discussing the question. Therefore, I consider that at this juncture the question should be fully debated by every member of the Committee who has any views on the subject at all. I intend to put the case for the primary producers, not only against the Shipping Ring, but, incidentally, against the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. I have no desire to see the Commonwealth Line discontinued or sold. The question has been raised as to what extent the present excessive rates have discouraged the trade of Australia, and to what extent a reduction of freights would encourage it. I have a statement from one of the best authorities in the meat trade of Australia with regard to the position in Queensland. He saysOne of the results of the excessive rates of freight is that during the season now closingone of the best ever known-ver y large numbers of fat cattle, instead of being killed in 1921, have been left on their pastures. It is estimated that in Queensland alone from 100.000 to 200,000 more cattle would have been killed had prices been reasonable and ocean' freights lower.

If the present excessive freights on leather were reduced, the tanners in Australia would be better able to find a market for their leather abroad. I do not desire to labour this question. I shall conclude by stating that the primary producers are in favour of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers reducing freights and thus being run in the interests of the whole of the people of Australia. Proposed vote agreed to. Postponed division 26 (Port Pirie Wharf), £1,291 ; postponed division 27 (Cockatoo Island Dockyard), £30,000; and postponed division 27A (Naval Dockyard) agreed to. Proposed vote (postponed), £1,207,280. moved as an amendmentThat the proposed vote be reduced by £100,000, such total reduction to be made by the Treasurer upon sueh items and sub-items and in such manner as he shall deem con. sistent with economical and efficient administration. Amendment negatived. notice that gold to the amount of £750,000 has been exported to America, and I should like some explanation, in view of the fact that private individuals or companies are not allowed to export, or passengers to take gold out of Australia. This exportation appears strange, when we remember that the trade balance is in favour of Australia. If it were the other way, we could understand it. Government have allowed the export of the current production of gold, to enable the minerB to get the advantage of the increased price. Proposed vote agreed to. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.30 p.m.",69,Rates Of Fkeich T Pbom Austbalta To United Kingdom
