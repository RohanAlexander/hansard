Adermann) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. Minister give the House a statement now, and later a more complete statement, regarding the effect on the Australian continent of the nuclear experiment that was carried out yesterday in the area of the Monte Bello Islands? The right honourable gentleman knows, of course, of the general concern about the matter of uuclear experiments, which has heen increased by dogmatic statements and assurances given over and over again by che Minister for Supply, which assurances appear not to have been justified in the light of subsequent events. give the Leader of the Opposition the information that, I received in the early hours of this morning. Ironically enough, I was awakened at twenty minutes past three by some one who said he was associated with ' intelligence"". f The Government's actions in relation to this week's atomic explosion in the Monte Bello area were precisely the same as they were in relation to all other atomic tests that have taken place in Australian territory; in other words, they were based on the most rigid safety precautions. These precautions include a very extensive advance weather reporting service. No explosion is allowed to occur until a clearance is received from an Australian safety committee composed of distinguished scientists. However, in view of the reports about the existence of cloud over the mainland, the Government sought further information from the safety committee. Early this morningand I stress that pointa message was received from the conimittee. The committee has stated that it cannot overemphasize the fact that the whole operation was carried out without risk to life or property on the mainland or elsewhere, and that there is absolutely no danger to. persons on the mainland. OLYMPIC GAMES. for Customs and Excise had an opporOlympic Games Civic Committee, that he should relax the present customs regulations that require all cine-camera film exposed by visitors while in Australia to be submitted for censorship to the Australian Film Censorship Board before being taken out of the country? has been considered quite recently, and ] am pleased to be able to tell the honourable member that the practice that has been followed for many years, by which all movie films taken by tourists in Australia are required to be submitted for censorship before being taken out of the country, will not be followed in the case of visitors to the Olympic Games. I do not think that the Olympic Games Civic Committee has yet been informed of this decision, but it will be informed very shortly. As some honourable members are aware, the Department of Customs and Excise is at present conducting investigations designed to relieve the public of the necessity to comply with any customs regulations that are found to be unnecessary. I think that the requirement thai all films taken in Australia by visitors must be censored comes within that category. I hope that it will not be necessary to do that in relation to the Olym picGames visitors or, indeed, any future tourists. mentary question, I desire to ask thi Acting Prime Minister whether he proposes to make only the bald statement he has just made on the Monte Bello experiment, and not to give honourable members the benefit of further particulars. I assure him that it is certainly not an answer trail the information on the subject thai has been supplied. by broadcasting stations and other sources. It is merely an assertion by the people who should have been responsible, and whose own actions may come under criticism. Therefore, I ask the Acting Prime Minister to treat this matter as one for which hfmust be personally responsible.",6,Setup

They are a kind of propaganda which most nations of the world use from time to time. They are of thiwindow-dressing variety and are designed to convince the rest of the world of the excellence of the country from which they they represent. As I have said, they arcundoubtedly propaganda, but they are not direct propaganda. Successive Australian governments have taken a broad view of publications of this sort, and, in general, have not prohibited them. Indeed, it is doubtful wliether we haveauthority to do so under the existing law. The Customs (Prohibited Iniports) Regulations provide for the prohibition of documents advocating the overthrow of the Government by force, and activities such as the assassination of public officials, and disseminating direct subversive propaganda of that sort. But this description does not apply to the direct to the Miniswindow-dressing kind of publication.

There is no direct -and continuing liaison between the two departments of which I am aware, but I should not hesitate at any time to seek the advice of my right honourable colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, fair, they should be in a position to do so if it was considered necessary. like to take this opportunity to reply to the question asked by the honourable member for East Sydney on the 12th .rune concerning the Australian World Trade Fair which is due to commence in Sydney towards the end of July. I must apologize for the delay that has occurred in supplying the honourable member with an answer. However, I am sure he will uot mind my dealing with the matter as t propose to do, because there has been a good deal of misunderstanding and inquiry about the subject-matter that he rightly raised. In the first place, it dhould be made clear that the fair is entirely a private venture, from which the organizers, presumably, hope to derive financial gain. However, I should add that they undertook, at the outset, to make part of the proceeds available to the United Nations Children's Fund. The organizers have sought government sponsorship of the fair on a number of occasions, but my colleague the Minister for Trade did not consider that the benefits to Australian export trade would justify such sponsorship being extended. Instead, as the honourable member is aware^ all reasonable facilities were profering with, or taking part in, political vided, through the Australian Trade Commissioner Service, to make the fair known overseas. Department of Trade furnished details regarding organizations and firms which might be interested in exhibiting. From time to time, the organizers have been advised that any further reasonable assistance would be given, particularly in relation to overseas visitors who may wish to visit Australia to see the fair. In January last, the organizers sought special import licensing facilities for overseas exhibitors. They were informed, in the same month, that Australia's balance of payments position did not warrant the expenditure of overseas exchange in this way. It was also pointed out to them that a wide range of goods could still be imported within the existing import licensing structure; so that if overseas producers, or their Australian representatives, wished to exhibit at the without having to obtain special import licensing facilities. The organizers were informed, also, that, when an exhibitor was confronted with a problem which he was unable to resolve because of import licensing difficulties, the possibilities of granting special licences would be examined. It will thus be seen that the organizers were informed in writing on this matter five months ago, and. further, that the Government's decision not to grant special import licences to the value of, possibly, £400,000 is consistent with the view held for many months that the fair would not benefit Australia's export interests to a substantial degree. It is the responsibility of the organizers to convince Australian exporters otherwise. The Governmenl bas taken no action to influence firms one way or the other. The fair has received wide publicity overseas, and the organizers have put a great deal of effort into it. I hope, therefore, that it will be successful. Mr R. W. HOLT -I s the Minister for External Affairs aware that some Asian students at the University of Melbourne have received letters from a government agency, warning them against, first, interparty discussions, and secondly, making party political utterances?

45,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [11.6],"this country has never been determined on the basis of what it costs a person to live. If it had been based on that principle, it would have been much higher. One would have expected this Government to honour its election promise, given solemnly by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in 1949 and repeated later, that it would at least maintain the existing level of purchasing power of the pension; but it has not done so. Since the rate was fixed at £4 a week, the hasic wage has again risen, wages generally in this country bave risen, and the cost of living has risen, but the Government has taken no steps to adjust the pension rate. As an illustration of the callous attitude of the Government towards these unfortunate people, 1 remind the House that, when a question was asked yesterday about whether the Government intended to take any action before the end of this sessional period to deal with the plight of these people, tlie Acting Prime Minister( Sir Arthur Fadden) said that it was a matter that would he considered in due course when the next budget was i»nng prepared. That will be months ah >t '. Everybody knows that to-day will be the last sitting day of the Parliament for some months and that it will not be meeting again until probably the first week in 'September or late in August. What is to happen to these unfortunate people -during the forthcoming severe winter months ? Let us consider what the pension rate -ought to be. As I have stated, in October .last the honourable member for Eden Monaro calculated that the pension should then have been £4 l is . a week to restore It did not! It kept the tax but abolished it to the value which it represented in 1948. That being so, and having regard to the increased cost of living since the pension was last increased, it ought now to he at least £5 a week. Yet supporters -of the Government, knowing the desperate plight of these people, make statements that are not in accordance with facts and which no reasonable member of the -community will accept. When we were last discussing pensions legislation, the honourable member for Indi( Mr Bostock) said that we had reached the end of the road in relation to financial provision for social services. That meant, in effect, that from his point of view there could be no further increase. As a solution to the problem of these people, he said, "" A law ought to be introduced to compel children to support their parents "". Whai a humiliating position in which to put an old couple! There are not many children who would not aid their aged parents, but many of them are unable to help, because of the increased cost of living. But here is the strange part about it. From the parsimonious attitude of the Government, one would imagine that these people were living on charity. What thipensioners receive to-day is not charity at all. They have contributed to the revenues of this country out of which people have obtained these benefits in thrpast, and, when their turn arrives, they are being paid only their own money. Everybody knows that the present Government pilfered the National Welfare Fund. It abolished the National Welfare Fund, which was established by a farseeing Labour government so that thestpayments could be guaranteed against any interruption or diminution in the futuribecause governments might argue that no money was available or that there wafinancial stringency. Although the preseni Government abolished the National Wel fare Fund, it did not abolish the social services contribution that was imposed and paid into the fund during the period of office of the Labour government. Ti is quite true that it does not appeai separately on income tax assessments, bui I challenge any member of the Government to show that when the National Welfare Fund was abolished this Government took any action to reduce taxation. the fund. The Minister for Primary Industrj tried to Rupport the Government's casrby saying, "" Yes, but to-day in addition to the pension rate we provide medica 1 services and pharmaceutical benefits to pensioners and we also provide finance to establish a scheme to subsidize the construction of homes for aged people "". 1 shall deal with those matters in a moment, but at this point I want to refer to a statement made by Dr. Selwyn Nelson. He is not a member of the Labour party; he is secretary of the Post Graduate Committee in Medicine at the Sydney University. Speaking at a Rotary club luncheon on the 5th June last, he said that there were 20,000 old people in New South Wales who could not afford to buy enough food; that there were 12,000 pensioners who would be unable to buy enough fuel to keep warm; and that there were 20,000 of them who would be unable to get all the clothes they need. Yet the Minister for Primary Industry, who is reputed to be almost a millionaire, said, -'But they have free medicine and they have free pharmaceutical benefits "". Let us examine the situation for a moment. A pensioner to-day receives t'4 a week. If his wife is ineligible for a pension because she has not reached the required age, she gets £1 15s. That is a total of £5 15s. a week to keep an old --ouple. The widows of this country are HISO in a desperate position. AnA class .vidow with at least one child under the ige of sixteen years is expected to exist on £4 5s. a week. Other classes of widows receive £3 7s. 6d. a week. The Government provides only £4 10s. a week for war widows-the widows of men who have made the supreme sacrifice in the defence of this country. How can anybody live on such a sum ? It is almost -mpossible to exist on it, and if the pensioners were unable to get some assistance from other quarters, they would probably not be able to exist. The right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), in his capacity vf Miuister for Health, had a peculiar line of argument in trying to establish that this Government had dealt generously with this deserving section of the community. He dealt with the free medical scheme and said that approximately S per cent, of the community benefited under this scheme and that there were 1,500,000 prescriptions, doctors' visits and ->o on in the year 1954-55. He went on co point out that that cost approximately £3,000,000. Then he calculated that only 10 per cent, of these people would be sick at any one time, and he said that because of this the pensioners would receive a benefit equivalent to the addition of £1 a week to the pension rate. Have we ever heard such stupid reasoning by a Minister of this Government? No doubt the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr McMahon) will tell us that the Government has provided a great benefit for pensioners because it contributes £10 towards the cost of their burial when they die! Let us look at the Government's record in regard to social services. It agreed to abolish the means test as it applied to pensions. It promised to do that within a definite period of time. The Government promised to have a report prepared, which would be presented to this Parliament, and to abolish the means test within a certain period of time. Instead of abolishing it, the Government has extended it by providing that a means test should be applied in regard to the pensioner medical service. It has provided that a single pensioner who has an income of £2 a week or more in addition to the pension, shall not receive the benefit of the free medical serviceAn old couple, each of whom receiveu the pension of £4 a week, and who have a separate income of £4 a week, making a total income of £12 a week between them, cannot get the benefit of the pensioner medical service. These provisions were based on a decision of the Government that any pensioner who had a permissible income which, in December, 1.953, would have prevented him from receiving the full rate of pension, would no longer be eligible for benefits under the pensioner medical service. Why did the Government make this change in the arrangements that existed previously? I l did so because the British Medical Association demtui'!ed that the Government should do so. It demanded that the Government should accept the principle that, ihat association had laid down, and the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), when he was Minister for Health, said that it was not right that a married couple who had a combined income of £15 a week, including their pensions, should also receive free medical treatment. I remind honourable member? that in order to receive a combined income of £15 a week, that couple would need to have a separate income of £7 a week in addition to their pensions, and not many pensioners in this country are in that position. Since 1953, however, the basic wage has increased, until it is now £12 13s. a week in New South Wales, and married couple pensioners are being denied the benefit of the free medical service when their combined income is actually 13s. less than the basic wage. It is obvious that the Government is determined to cut down its expenditure, irrespective of the means it must adopt in order to do so. ClassA widow pensioners, who receive an income of £6 5s. a week, including pension, are denied the free medical service. The other classes of widows who receive £5 7s. 6d. a week, including the pension, are also denied free medical treatment. I shall read to the House the words of the right honourable member for Cowper in order to prove that the change in pension arrangements was introduced at the request or direction of the British Medical Association. On the 7th October, 1955, the right honourable gentleman, who was then Minister for Health, saidConsequently the British Medical Associathe honourable member for East Sydney tion informed the Government that it would continue tlie pensioner medical service after the 31st October, 1055, only if the service was restricted to pensioners able to satisfy the means test in force at the 31st December, 1953. In the short period of time left at my disposal, let me turn to the subject of rents. Every one knows that the unfortunate pensioner is exploited in many cases by unscrupulous landlords, who increase rents every time the pension rate is increased. Many of these unfortunate pensioners to-day are obliged to pay from 30s. to £2 a week in room rent. If one subtracts the amount paid in rent from the total amount of the pension, and considers that the whole of the remainder is spent on food, a pensioner would be able to spend about 2s. 5d. on each meal. It must be obvious, therefore, to any reasoning member of this Parliament that many of these unfortunate people are unable to have three meals a day, and are merely eking out an existence. In making that calculation I have made no allowance for the provision of fuel for heating purposes, for lighting, clothing, smokes, fares, newspapers or a wireless set. Does the Government believe that the unfortunate pensioners in this country are not entitled to such things as smokes or newspapers, or to have a wireless set in their rooms? I have heard Government supporters talking about what they have done by way of subsidizing the building of homes for the aged. The Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton), who now sits at the table, said in reply to a question in this House on the 14th March last, that there had been 116 approved applications for assistance in the building of homes for the aged, and that the Government had spent £1,392,000 in this direction. ( Mr Bowden) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. for Social Services) [11.21] -Among the members of Her Majesty's Opposition in this House, and elsewhere, there are some fine, warm-hearted characters who, largely by accident, find themselves caught up in the Australian Labour party, but no one would ever dream of including ( Mr Ward) in that category. Among Her Majesty's Opposition in both Houses of this Parliament, there are men of broad sympathies, wide experiences and deep understanding, but no one would ever dream of describing the honourable member for East Sydney in these terms -no r would he want to be described in these generous terms. He is a militantsocialist, a vicious socialist who, day in and day out in this place, demonstrates his most urgent intention to destroy democratic society as we know it, in the most cruel and callous way. He is a militant without mercy, a combatant without compassion, who has always taken the greatest pride in his utter ruthlessness, of which we have had a demonstration this morning. Yet he is the one, of all the members of the Opposition, who has been selected to launch this attack upon a government fchat has devoted more time, more energy and more imagination to the provision of social services than has any other government since federation. No other group of Labour party members has ever been reduced to such desperate circumstances as this one has, when it selects a militant without mercy to stand here and mock at mercy, a combatant without compassion to conscript compassion.

R -£134 ] Let me deal categorically with what the In addition, the Government has It is my proud privilege to say that this Government's record in regard to pension increases and the relaxation of the means test has been unequalled in the 47 years that have elapsed since Commonwealth pensions were introduced. I must emphasize that a pensioner may now own a home, furniture, personal effects and a motor car-regardles s of their value without prejudice to his pension. Ho may also have other assets up to £200 in value, or £400 for a married couple, and earnings or superannuation up to £3 10s. a week, or £7 a week for a married couple, and still receive the full pension. of the socialist Government. That was Nor does income from property affect his pension. A qualified person may now receive a part pension, provided his addiwas able to exercise an influence in this tional assets do not exceed £1,750, or £3,500 in the case of a married couple. A pensioner may have, by way of income plus pension, a total of £7 10s. a week, or £15 a week for a married couple. But that is not the total benefit. It must never be forgotten that free medical and pharmaceutical benefits have been provided for qualified pensioners and their dependants, thus adding to the real value of the pension and eliminating the social insecurity that was, until this Goby a man who has neither compassion nor vernment took office, inseparable from sickness in all its forms. The one increasing purpose of the Government has been to give maximum assistance to the needy, without prejudice to those who have made some provision for their old age and their infirmities, but it is not .m easy task. If we were to attempt to concentrate all our available resourcesand I have said they exceed £400,000,000 -upo n providing social services for those who are without means and/or earning capacity-and the proposition is not without merit-it woidd destroy incenbomb had sent a cloud over Austive and deny to us an industrious, provitralia and, naturally the people were dent and self-reliant people. That is the grave danger that confronts us in the general expansion of social services, and it is one which, in the changing circumstances of modern society, must be met. Yet, here Ave have this militant and comsidered for one moment that thousands of batant socialist, a man completely devoid of mercy and compassion, standing in his place as the representative of the Australian socialist party, and launching an attack against a government that has devoted more time, more energy, more resources and more imagination to this problem than has any government of this or any other free country. Sums in excess of £400,000,000 have been expended in order to give a measure of social security and domestic happiness to those in our community who stand in such need. The proud record of the Government is to be found in the comparative figure? that I shall now give. They relate to mv own department and to the Department of Health only. A total of £80,777,356 was spent on social service and health benefits in the last full yearthe best that the socialists could do when the honourable member for East Sydney matter. His Government could not increasethat sum by a single fragment. In contrast, this Government is spending, in the current financial year, upon social service and health benefits alone, the sum of £218,404,000. The difference is £137,626,644, and that prompts me to say that there are 137 reasons why this matter of urgency should, be rejected. It was raised by a man who has no understanding of the position. It was moved mercy, and it is designed to defeat the very purpose of the social services obligations of this or any other government. I am pleased to have the opportunity of supporting my colleague, the honorabh member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), speaking for all States in general and the State of New South Wales in particular, because I think that in New South Wales the suffering is the greatest.

He got a pension all right but, because he went down to the city markets and minded cars and possibly got ls. or 6d. or 2s. from those who liked to give money to him, he was told by the Department of Social Services, "" You must get a book and write down every penny that you get. You must tell us how much you get before we can issue that medical card "". The Government sends inspectors into the homes of these people. The State Government of New South Wales has beengood enough, through its welfare organization, to supply its people with spectacles. An inspector examines the applicant's home before spectacles are provided.

Only eleven members of the Opposition are prepared to support his statements relating to pensioners and his accusations against the Government regarding social services.

57,Mr Mcmahon,"The feigned irriuot be prepared to make claims that might be extravagant in that sense. In which way do we look at the problem? We look at it with these principles in mind: First, we try to achieve justice for pensioners and to give them a basic rate of pension that will meet their needs. The honourable member for West Sydney in his typical fashion agreed that married pensioners were not badly treated, and so he devoted his case, not to the married pensioner, but to the single pensioner, and impliedly asked that special consideration should be given to the needs of single pensioners. The Government always keeps in mind the matter of justice to the pensioner in determining what contribution it can make to his welfare. The second important principle which the Government considers is to make certain that in this community we do not break down the sturdy self-reliance of the average Australian. The saving classes are important. They are composed of those persons who in the past have done a good day's work, received good remuneration, and been able to save. Therefore, it is fundamental to the policy of the Government that, irrespective of what else it may do, it should not break down incentives to work and save. Thirdly, surely we all know that the pensioner can benefit only if the standard of living rises and the wealth of the community grows. After all, the pension that is paid by the Government is but a deduction from current production, and therefore the Government must keep constantly in its mind how it can increase production and give the pensioner, particularly the pensioner of the future, reason to believe that he will be better off than he has been in the past. Keeping those three principles in mind, the Government, during the preparation of the budget, examines the problems of the pensioners and decides upon the maximum contribution which it can make at that time. That has been my approach to the matter of pensions. I can vouch for the fact that my distinguished successor and colleague is administering the department with the same keenness and sympathy that I tried to bring to bear in my administration, when I had the great honour to be Minister for Social Services in the Menzies Government. I put the position to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the principles which I have stated are the only realistic and decent principles that can be applied in an attempt to solve this problem. the problem? member asks: What is to be done? He knows very well that the time for considering these principles is during the preparation of the budget, because we have to consider the various conflicting requests, demands, and needs. I am sure that you, sir, will agree that it would be improper and wrong to consider the needs of one section without considering the requirements of others. This Government, like the Chifley and Curtin governments, has always looked at this problem at budget time. No government departs from that policy. The honourable member for East Sydney made the astonishing statement that he has never regarded the purchasing power of the pension as adequate. He did not think it was sufficient when he was a member of the Chifley' Government. If I may put it to you, sir, this shows the standards of decency and the finance standards of the honourable member for East Sydney. Despite the fact that his own principles-if he ever had a sense of decency-were being infringed, he did not have the common guts to rise and say anything along those lines in this House. He had not the common guts to resign from the government of which he was a member tc show that he stood for the rights of the pensioner and that he had sonw principles that were worth sustaining. This is the kind of man who comes into this chamber and tries to create a furore and a false impression about pensions and the Government's attitude to them. The second part of his question related to the purchasing power of the pension. This is also a hardy perennial. My colleague, the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton) has handed me a document which shows the purchasing power of the",24,Pensions

We do not claim that complete justice has been done. We do claim, in terms of realistic debate, that this Government looks at the matter from the most sympathetic angle. I have referred to my own attitude and the attitude of my distinguished successor in the administration of the department. We will continue to give to the pensioners in accordance with what we believe to be their real needs. This problem cannot be met in isolation. The Aged Persons Home Act is another monument to the administration of the Menzies Government. I venture to say that over a number of years that single progressive enactment will bring more happiness and contentment to persons in the final years of their lives than any other reform in recent years. Therefore, I say to honourable members, in terms of simple justice, that the problems of pensioners will be considered when the budget is being prepared. We shall give it the same sympathetic consideration that the Government has always given to these matters in the past.

I refer to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill 1956, the Stevedoring Industry Bill 1956, the shipping bills and The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bowden) -Order! member must discuss the Housing Agreement Bil l 1956. we have the Housing Agreement Bill 1956. Each of these measures which have been pushed through by steamroller methods, has given a blood transfusion to the Government's big business supporters. In every case, the worse features of private enterprise have been entrenched and the position of the basic wage earner has been worsened. This agreement, which is intended to replace Labour's agreement of 1945, provides for the distribution of loan money to the States on a new basis. A portion of the money will be used by State governments to finance their own housing programmes, and another portion-2 0 per cent, in the first two years and 30 per cent, in the next three years-wil l be paid into a home-builders' account, from which advances will be made to approved building societies. The Government claims that that will enable more people to own their homes, implying that that privilege is not extended already by most of the State governments that are operating their own housing programmes. I have several general comments to make on the bill. I think that honourable members on both sides of the Parliament agree that housing should be given first priority. I do not suggest that Government members are not concerned about the housing of the people. We on this side are concerned about it, too-desper ately so. We differ from Government members only in relation to the manner in which houses should be provided. The provision of housing in this country is far too big a programme to be left to the States. That is why the Commonwealth has had to come in. There has been a terrific increase in the demand for houses since the immigration programme was speeded up. In the last eleven years, 1,000,000 immigrants have come to Australia. During that period, there has been, naturally, a great increase of the number of marriages. In our opinion, the demand for homes is growing faster than is the rate at which they are being provided. The honourable More homes would mean more families and happier family life. Homes can bring happiness, but, depending on who I shall do so. Lastly, lives in them, they can bring the opposite of happiness also. Home-life is vital to any nation. The real strength of a nation lies, not in military armaments, but in the home-life and the character of its people. The first lessons in good character and good citizenship are given in the home. I think we all agree on that. All honourable members appreciate the guidance and help that they received from their parents in the early days of their lives. Discord in the home spells disaster for the nation. If some families have to live like animals in substandard, unhealthy homes, the real strength of the nation is menaced. If our home-life were to fall to pieces, we could be defeated from within before we were defeated from without. A study of history shows that all past civilizations received their death warrants through the destruction of their home-life. From homelessness or sub-standard homes stem the shocking evils of divorce, crime, larrikinism, child delinquency, hodgieism and widgie-ism-the latest manifestations of the effect of bad homesand social disaster. The home-building industry employs a larger work force than does any other industry in Australia. If the prosperity of that industry were impaired in any way-for instance, by a smaller demand for houses caused by high interest rates-the economy of the nation would be thrown into a tailspin. It is the greatest industry in this country. It supports a vast timber industry, a vast transport industry and a vast furniture manfacturing industry. The manufacturers of electrical appliances, floor coverings, curtains and kitchen utensils are dependent on it. A vast concourse of people depends for employment on a «> healthy home-building industry.",26,Pairs

78,Mr Chaney,"The honourable memWestern Australia. He was asked whatas honourable members opposite are doing, as a vehicle for attacking the Commonwealth and belittling it in the eyes of the people. However, I think that the people are fully aware of the Commonwealth's splendid record of effort to overcome the housmg shortage, which is a more than usually severe shortage. I wish to comment on only one other aspect of the agreement. It is provided that the States can sell houses and themselves determine the amount of deposit and the terms of repayment. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth can have no control over the sale by the States of the houses that they build, and therefore the States are able to put into operation a method of selling which might be directly opposed to the interests of the community. houses that were built at a cost of some £1,500 before the increase of £1 a week in the basic wage are now valued at something like £4,000. Many people were allotted these homes, and amongst them were ex-servicemen eligible for war service homes. They were supposed to be temporarily housed in such rental homes built under the Commonwealth and States Housing Agreement until they could get a war service home, but many of them found that their housing needs were well satisfied by the rental homes and relinquished their ideas of building for themselves under the provisions .of the War Service Homes Act, especially as costs for the type of home they had originally intended to invest in had risen to about £3,000 or £4,000. They were given the opportunity to purchase the homes they were residing in. A condition laid down by the State was that they could puri-hase within six months of occupying the home, at the cost of construction, or have the opportunity to purchase at a later date, at current values. Every one of those houses had to be occupied, however, before the eost of construction could be drawn up, because the State had to find the over-all cost of a contract. If , for instance, the cost of the house was £2,000 and the war service homes loan availably at that, stage was £1,750. or if the cost of construction was £2,500 and the war ev> iee homes loan was £2,000, the tenant had to find, if he was eligible for a war service to himself to-day for having said, "" Now loan, £250 or £500 as the case might be, in order to purchase the home. In many cases, when the value of the house was about £2,500-o n the present market it. would probably be worth £4,000-the tenant found he did not have the £500 in cash to enable him to meet the conditions laid down in respect of war service homes and had to forgo his right to purchase at cost price. Later, when the war servic loan maximum was increased to £2,750he would have been in a position to pur chase that home. able member account for the fact that 13,000 out of the 30,000 applicants for houses in New South Wales are ex-servicemen?

The honourable member has no In Western Australia time to answer interjections. stood the interjection correctlv, I point out that it is provided that 50 per cent, of homes built under this agreement are to be made available to ex-servicemen. In this country it would be impossible to allocate homes to citizens without 50 per cent, of them being ex-servicemen, because the rate of enlistment in the forces was so high. distressed by the mealy-mouthed attitude of the Government in regard to this measure. It is very obvious that the Government is getting out of housing as fast as it can. If , instead of bombarding the chamber with heroics about the building of homes for people who have the money to buy them, the Government looked at the problem, the social problem, it would see that all its plans are completely out of kilter, and of no use whatever for the future of this country. The Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer), who is the key man in this debate, said last night, with a great flourish of trumpets, ""Under this legislation, we will be able to assist people to get homes "". But has it not been this Government which, since 1949, has prevented 40,000 people from getting homes because insufficient money has been released from the credit sources of the banks? How can the Minister have it both ways? He cannot direct any praise we are looking at the home-ownership",29,Pairs

81,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [12.24],"I amside "". The Minister grows lyrical about this matter, but the real cause of the stulSlums are a horrible inheritance. The tification of home-ownership since 1949, when this Government assumed omce, has been the cramp on credit. Those people, including returned soldiers, who the Minister says will in due course get money through the co-operative housing societies, will buy houses at between £1,000 and £2,000 more than they would have had to pay if the money had been available in the normal way. The available figures cannot be controverted by any general statement to the effect that the Australian Labour party does not want the people to have homes. As far as it is possible to get figures, at the present time 20,000 returned soldiers want homes, 40,000 persons want to buy homes, and 60,000 persons want to rent homes. The Government must remember that it cannot walk out of everything in this country, as it has tried to do in the past, f t has walked out of the Commonwealth shipping line, out of the whaling industry, out of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, out of Trans-Australia Airlines-and now, finally, it wants to sabotage the housaround the country? Are they to be ing scheme. It is essential that a government should build houses for persons who have not the money to buy them. If this Government does not do that, it will wreck its immigration programme. Nothing else will do it. Is it possible to conceive of 150,000 or 125,000 immigrants coming to these shores every year and for the Government to have a restricted plan for the building of homes for rental? It is all very noble to talk about encouraging the man who has a few pounds and who is prepared to build his own house. He is very lucky to bf in that position, and it is good that it can be done; but the essential thing for any government to do is to look lower down the wage-scale in order to see what it can do for those persons who, because of the war, have been dispossessed of the houses in which they lived. The Minister for the Army, who is a very honourable and high-souled man, I understand, has been in the real estate business. He knows that the backlog of houses before World War II . was as great as 100.000 houses, and that people, because of financial circumstances rather than any real desire to do so, lived with their in-laws or in sub-standard houses. Government talks about its housing scheme, but there is no provision for the reclamation of slums. People are just hanging on by their eyebrows. When there is a storm, they are in distress. Honourable members, particularly Labour members, know how grievous and destructive is the housing situation. The Government talks about a new plan, but it simply represents a walk-out on tha responsibilities that any federal government has towards the people of Australia. To say that the emphasis is now on homeownership and that the Labour party does not believe in a man owning his own home is all so much low-grade chatter; it does not mean a thing. The problem is right at the door of the Government. As has been explained by so many Opposition members, the emphasis must always be on the provision of homes for rental. What does the Government intend to do with these people? Where are they to go? Are they to tumble the new dispossessed? Already there are thousands of people who are not in possession of adequate housing accommodation. This scheme is obviously geared to tackle a problem that has been seen in its wrong perspective. Consequently, the problem will be worse confounded. The simple fact is that this legislation will not lead to the provision of more homes for rental. The appalling conclusion is that the Government does not seem to care. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Fairhall) talks about housing settlements being blots on the landscape. He does not know anything about the matter. see through his own prejudices. I can take him to many housing settlements in New South Wales where he will see beautiful gardens, made as a result of the self-help of individuals who, for the first time, have a house which they hope to purchase, and whose desire to own their homes is as keen as that of the Minister.

The aggregation of houses may be unpleasant to the artistic eye of the Minister for the Interior, but, generally speaking, they are good houses and are well built. To the dispossessed person who wants a home and to others who are experiencing housing difficulties and who, if they are not in the magistrate's court every week, are under the threat of a notice to quit, a rented house is paradise. Flying over these areas in a Convair on the way back to Sydney, the Minister may look at them with some repugnance, but"" they are better than what this legislation will give to such people. The simple facts can be restated very briefly: The Government does not think of housing as a social service problem, but as something that it should never have bought into. Last night, the Minister for the Army wailed about the loss by property-owners of £500,000,000 in rent. He almost had a stroke over it. How many millions of pounds in the form of wages were lost by men who served overseas during the war and who have been unable to secure homes of their own 3ince their return? Does the Minister for the Army want to deny them homes for ever and force them to live in "" Cramer's comfy caravans "" for the rest of their lives, or does he intend to do something about the rental position? He is completely isolated by his training and experience. He cannot see any good in a house for rental, because there is no "" cop "" in it. I do not mean that in a perhas expired. sonal sense. Neither the Minister for the Army nor the Minister for the Interior, who says that these houses are a scar on the landscape, see the social service side of housing.

In his responsible position as a Minister, he ought to know better than to talk like that. In his attitude to the expenditure of the millions of pounds that have been spent in the past and which I hope will be spent in the future on houses of one kind or another, he ought to display some responsibility and not just adopt a low-grade snob approach to the problem. If the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has smiled on him and has destroyed his morale forever, we should not have to suffer the effects of it in this House. sense. The Minister's reference to blots on the landscape will, in due course, not be overlooked by his electors. No matter how it is coloured by the heroics and the rhetoric of honourable members opposite, the point at issue is simple. With malice aforethought, the Government is bailing out of housing, because it proposes to subedit what is the most essential part of any housing project;-the provision of houses for rental. In reply to that criticism, Government supporters say that the scheme will be very good for the cooperative societies and that more houses will be built for private ownership, but do they not realize that their sin from. 194'9 onwards will remain on their own consciences ?

If that attitude is adopted, it simply means that we are intent upon this country becoming completely socialized, because that is the nltimate of that type of policy. The minutes are flying by but I want to make clearer certain tbings I said in my speech last night in the hope that I may be able to get into the minds of Labour men in Australia and in this Parliament the real truth about housing. Every one talks about the shortage of houses. We know the terrible disappointments that are suffered when people try to find homes. This is a subject. I have known intimately all my life, as the honourable member for Parkes is aware. Politicians and members of the public are running around with the idea that there is a great physical shortage of houses. A man cannot be blamed for believing that there is a great shortage of houses if he looks for a house and cannot get one. To him that is the test and, therefore, he thinks that there is a great shortage o i houses. The truth is that if the existing houses were properly allocated for the needs of the people to-day, there are -ample houses for every family in Australia to be adequately accommodated. The figures on this matter are indisputable. No country has a better supply of houses commensurate with its population. .yield them. The Minister knows damn well they will not.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN . ^ Order! The honourable member for Werriwa must refrain from interjecting. I have called for silence. the war controls of rents and tenancies were necessary. In 1947, wage pegging was lifted and the cost of everything rose. The only things that were effectively pegged by Labour governmeuts were rents and tenancy controls. They had a certain effect. They meant that the use of a house was frozen, as it were, to the people in it. Take the case of mum and dad and four kiddies living in a threebedroom house. When the children grew up, as they ultimately did in that time, and went away, mum and dad still stayed in the bigger house. These instances were multiplied enormously as time passed until to-day tens of thousands less people are living in the same houses as t'hey occupied when controls were imposed. That is shown conclusively in the statistics that are available. As I said last night, the only State in Australia to remove the rental control with the growth of the economy was Western Australia. It has fewer houses per capita than any other State, but there is no housing shortage. New South Wales, which has the most rigid controls, has more houses per capita than any other State but apparently has the greatest shortage of homes. The anomaly is quite clear and quite conclusive ; there can be no shadow of doubt about it. The honourable member for Parkes has said that a great number of people desire to rent houses. Of course t'hey dot It does not mater how much money is available; the physical capacity of the eountry to construct houses is limited by the availability of labour and materials. How can the housing .shortage be relieved when the figures .show that, as fast as houses are built by commissions, the number of rented houses occupied by tenants becomes less? Whilst the housing commissions are not the built 90,000 houses in the period that I mentioned, the people who owned rented homes disposed of 150,000 houses. The facts are that, notwithstanding all the building done by housing commissions, the number of rented houses is getting less and less. It does not matter what",32,Pairs

97,Mr Cramer,"1 admit that duringevil tliere is in the community, it brings some good; and, as a result of this evil, more than anything else perhaps, the growth of home-ownership is developing not because the people in the first instance desire to buy a house-thoug h it is a good thing if they do-bu t because they are forced to do so when all rental homes are occupied. I agree that from the social stand-point governments should provide homes for indigent people and others who are unable to provide their own homes. But beyond that there should be a sense of responsibility in regard to renting a home, brought into a state of equality with the economy of the country. In that way the desire and the need for people to invest their savings in rented property are reintroduced. As I pointed out last night, 80 per cent, of the people now protected by rent controls are well able to pay the economic rent. Eent control is said to be in the interest of the worker, but it is not in the interest of the worker at all. Ft leaves the worker walking the streets trying to find a home. If the housing commissions build homes, they have to charge an economic rent. If they do not, the deficiency must be made up by the taxpayers. It amounts to the same thing. If there were a free economy in housing, with the number of houses that are available to-day, competition would bring the economic rent to the position where every worker capable of paying it would have a home. The sheer nonsense of Labour governments in perpetuating the system of rent control has brought this terrible burden down on the heads of the workers themselves. ""WhilstI agree that the control system cannot simply he cut with a knife, because that would do a lot of damage, Labour governments are responsible for the fact that thousands of people have been unable to get homes. Labour Governments are responsible for more dreadful things than that. They should face the fact that they are responsible for tens of thousands of children not having been born because of the legislation that they have imposed i upon us. about it. I do not want to become dramatic, but that is the fact. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN Order! The Minister's time has expired. Sitting suspended from 12.^5 to 2.15 p.m. Progress reported. and subscribed the oath of allegiance as member for the Division of Grayndler, New South Wales. Consideration resumed. The combined wisdom of honourable members of this chamber could not contrive to produce a statement sufficiently strong to emphasize the need for an adequate home-building programme in this country, and the influence of such a programme upon the life and character of the people. Honourable members on this side of the committee regard the provisions of the proposed agreement as totally inadequate to solve our housing problem. Furthermore, I suggest to the Minister for the Interior( Mr Fairhall) that any agreement of this nature is of no value unless it has the complete concurrence of the State authorities that are, in the main, responsible for home-building. Honourable gentlemen opposite are, no doubt, aware of the serious concern that is felt by State governments, both Labour and Liberal, regarding the inadequacy of the provisions of this measure. I feel that I must say something about the queer reasoning of Government supporters in regard to this measure. The Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer), for instance, said that we could solve the housing problem merely by removing all controls and allowing private enterprise full reign. That is very strange reasoning on his part, because the public interest has been greatly protected by the housing policies of various State authorities, and by the actions of State governments in ensuring that rents shall be calculated on a fair and reasonable basis. The Minister's argument in that regard is quite untenable.",33,Pairs

101,Mr Makin (Bonython) [2.17],"The assertions that have been made, to the effect that homes built by State authorities are a blot on the landscape, are too foolish for words. Some of the best working-class homes in Australia have been built by the various State housing commissions or trusts. This Government would have something to boast about if its record in regard to construcincreased the interest rate and thus depretion of war service homes were as good as the home-building record of the State -housing authorities. In South Australia tfhere is no comparison between the work -done by the State housing trust in the provision of homes and the inadequate performance of the Commonwealth in its war service homes building programme. People who seek assistance under the provisions of the War Service Homes Act are faced with complete frustration. They have no guarantee of being able to secure -the kind of home that they want in the locality where they want it. Some o' -the war service homes that I have seen .are a disgrace to the Commonwealth. In some instances it was found, after the homes were completed, that some rebuilding was necessary before the homes -could be made fit for occupation. There -have been such instances in the electorate -of Sturt, which I formerly represented.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order!

Surely this agreement attempts tc meet such a situation. A person with £2,000 will be able to borrow another £2,000 from a co-operative building society, which will be financed under this agreement.

If I interpret aright the views expressed by him and by the honourable member for Bonython( Mr Makin), they would have denied to the Federal Government, when it began to draw up a new agreement to replace the purely socialistic agreement of 1945, the possibility of having any influence at all on the terms and conditions of the agreement. The honourable member for Melbourne says that there is no agreement, in effect, because in fact the States are being dragooned into it, and that they have had no say in the contents of this agreement. Those of us who know the prothe introduction of this bill to the Parliament, know very well that the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) spent many months of pat ent negotiation and discussion with all the States, during the course of which very great concessions were made to the States so that we would he able to bring this bill before the Parliament at this time. has agreed to it. not true, as I shall illustrate in a few moments.

130,Mr Fairhall,"That, of course, ishave to accept and administer a socialist bill because we inherited it, and when our own time comes to produce a bill, be denied the opportunity to write into it some of the conditions which are near and dear to the Liberal heart. One would be led to believe that there is no room left for the States in the administration of this agreement. Honourable members opposite have had something to say about the rebate system. In respect of houses built under the 1945 agreement the Commonwealth will continue to meet three-fifths of the losses on over 31 years, as against the 53 years' contracts. There is an aspect of this matter which has not been referred to heretofore, and it ought to be brought to public attention. Honourable gentlemen will know that not all the States have used the rental rebate procedure. Eor instance, South Australia has not used it. There is still provision in the new agreement for the States to make rental rebates, and a fund is already in being from which those rental rebates may be made. Honourable members will know that in the fixing of economic rents under the 1945 agreement an allowance of 5 per cent, was made for a bad debts reserve, which was to provide for rentals not paid and houses vacant during the course of a change in tenancy. This5 per cent, figure applied to all the 95,000 homes built under the 1945 agreement? Not at all. The fact is that of the £12,000,000 of rents received in respect of homes built under the 1945 agreement, 5 per cent., or £600,000 remains in a fund to meet bad debts, &c. Although the amount set aside was 5 per cent., because of the conditions which applied for the duration of the 1945 agreement, it is very doubtful whether, in fact, that fund has been drawn upon to the extent of more than, perhaps, .2 per cent, or .3 per cent. In the last three years rental rebates have amounted to only £300,000, thus absorbing only half of the reserve fund which has been set aside. So if the States want to continue to make rental rebates, there is a fund from which those amounts may be provided. I shall refer now to the entitlement of one of the respects in which the Comthe Commonwealth to write into the monwealth has made very great concesagreement some of the conditions and sions to the States. The interest rate will terms which suit its policy. Of these, the he three-quarters of 1 per cent, below the basic principle is that we should encourage home-ownership. We have had evidence of some very remarkable arithmetic in the chamber in the last couple of days. Last night the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) tried to suggest, in fact, that we would build fewer homes under this agreement than were built under the 1945 agreement. But when 20 per cent, in the first two years, and 30 per cent, in the succeeding three years, of funds allocated to the States are to be put aside for home-building for ownership, on terms extending term of the main agreement,. actuarial computation will show that under this agreement the housing funds available will build twice as many homes as would be built if the same amount were available through the housing commissions for the construction of homes for rents. So, in actual fact, if the nature of the exercise is to make an attack on the housing shortage in this country, it is proved on the figures, which cannot be disputed, that under this agreement we shall build more homes for a certain amount of money than could have been built under the terms and conditions which characterized the 1945 agreement. But I am digressing. The matter of rents is bound up with the matter of interest and so on. Much criticism has been voiced in this chamber because this agreement is tied to the long-term bond rate, but that does not in any way differ from the conditions of the 1945 agreement, whereunder the interest rate was also tied to the long-term bond rate. As I have said before, it is one of the facts of life that the interest rate has risen, but as wages have risen in a comparable fashion, no greater degree of hardship will be created under this bill. But in recognition of the fact that the interest rate has risena fact of life which we cannot ignore-and in view of the known effect of the rise in interest rates on the rents to be paid, the Government has agreed to make this money available at a concessional rate of interest. Here is lomgiterja bond rate where that interest rente is 4-J per cent, or less, and 1 per cent, tered by socialist Labour governments, bellow the long-term bond rate -where that rate is in excess of 4£ per cent. Here is a fund from which the State governments can contribute by giving rebates of rentals, if they so desire. If they want another source of help for the people who seek homes from housing commissions at reasonable rents, they -can draw on this pool of 95,000 homes which were built under the low-interest provisions of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement of 1945. By -careful administration and proper allocation of those homes, the States can still preserve all the benents of the 1945 agreement for the people on lower incomes. The money to be made available under the new agreement is ostensibly to come from loan funds. But we all know the hard facts of the loan market situation to-day. A very large proportion of the moneys which are to be made available to the State governments under the new agreement will, in fact, be provided out of Commonwealth revenue. Surely, the -Commonwealth should be entitled, as it has done, to write its own policy above -all others into this agreement. I remind the committee that low interest rates and subsidized rents amount to subsidizing the rents of a vast mass of the Australian people at the expense of the other taxpayers who are obliged to meet their -own housing requirements without the benefit of government assistance. One has only to look at the facts and the ""figures to see how the matter stands. If an amount of, say, £30,000,000 a year -were made available to the States under the new agreement at an interest concession of 1 per cent., the taxpayers would have to bear a total cost of £66,000,000 -for this concession over the terms of the -agreement. Surely these are factors that not only entitle, but also oblige, the Commonwealth to enforce its policy and to -exercise the greatest care to ensure that the people in the lower income groups -are not treated unjustly in the provision of homes under the agreement. It is quite true that the States say the housing problem, like many others, they are not thoroughly happy about must be analysed. The problem of pen4he terms of the new agreement. I can sions, which we discussed this morning, is well understand that the States adminiswhich believe in rented housing, do not agree with its terms. But it is a perfectly fair and reasonable agreement, and I have not the slightest doubt that, within the next few days, all the States will sign it. When it comes into operation, -vve shall be able to build with the money that will be available during the next five years more houses than we could possibly have built under the terms of the 1945 agreement. [2.57] -The Minister for the Army( Mr CrameT) has described the housing problem as a Labour-created problem. I suggest that the desperate situation in which we find ourselves to-day has been deliberately caused by Liberal policy, first, on prices, and, secondly, on interestrates, both of which have been allowed to increase. The problems of inflation and higher interest rates have been aggravated by the policy deliberately followed by this Government. The housing problem is only one example of the way in which this devastating policy is affecting the people of Australia. There seems to be a Gertain measure of disagreement between the Government and the Opposition on this matter. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Fairhall), in his second-reading speech, statedThis Government believes in encouraging home-ownership . . . It has been suggested on behalf of the Government that the Australian Labour party does not believe in encouraging home-ownership. That is a deliberate misstatement. The Australian Labour party believes just as strongly as does the Liberal party in encouraging homeownership, but, unlike the Liberal party, it recognizes that home-ownership has become increasingly difficult to attain, and that it is almost impossible nowadays for large sections of the community to own their own homes. It is all very well for Government supporters to accept as a brilliant theory the statement, ""We believe in homeownership "", and not do anything to make home-ownership a reality. I suggest that",39,Housing Ageeement Bill 1956
131,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports),"an illustration of the need to analyse a problem. For a person who is wholly dependent on the pension, the problem is very much different from that which confronts a person who has other means. Similarly, home-ownership is not a problem to the person who already owns a home. It is a problem only to the person who is endeavouring to obtain a home. I do not distinguish between the virtuous and the vicious sections of the community according to those who own their own homes and those who do not, because [ recognize that economic circumstances largely determine whether people own their own homes. I happen to represent an electorate in which two-thirds or threecome to his assistance and provide him quarters of the electors clo not own their own homes, but are tenants. The last census revealed that, at the 30th June, 1954, there were more than 800,000 dwellings occupied by tenants. In other words, 800,000 families did not own their own homes at that date. Those are the people whom the bill should be designed to benefit, because, as I have said, housing sections of the community? Why should is not a problem to those who own their own homes. It is a problem only to those who are endeavouring to obtain homes. T say categorically that present building prices and interest rates make it impossible for family men with an income of £16 a week or less to own their own homes. But those are the very people for whose benefit the housing commissions were established. More, not less, money should be made available to meet tha needs of those people. All members of the community, and especially families, irrespective of their circumstances, are entitled to live in decent homes in a decent are streets 220 yards long in which the environment. I propose to refer now to certain arguments that have been advanced on this matter. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney) mentioned building costs in ""Western Australia. I suggest that he was talking merely about the cost of constructing a house, without allowing for the purchase price of the land on whicn it was built, the construction of streets, or the connection of sewerage and other services. In Victoria, it is impossible to buy a decent house for less than £3,500 in cash, or to obtain a mortgage at less than 5 per cent, interest. In most instances, much more than 5 per cent, must be paid. Even at 5 per cent., the interest charges on a mortgage of £3,500, without any allowance for amortization, would b» £175 per annum, or more than £3 a week. In addition, rates and taxes on the property would average between 15s. and £1 a week. The total payments with amortization would amount to approximately £5 a week. How can a family man with a wife and, say, two children, who earns the basic wage plus, perhaps a slight margin for skill, giving him a total income of, say, £16 a week, possibly pay £5 a week to meet his housing needs ? How can he live in a decent, modern home unless bodies such as housing commissions with a home ? It has been suggested that, through the housing commission, he would be subsidized by the rest of the community. But housing is not the only field in which one section of the community subsidizes another. Are not primary producers, particularly wheat-growers, and secondary industries, subsidized by other we not subsidize from taxation the community's greatest asset-ou r Australian families ? But apparently, in the view of this Government, that would be a crime against the sacred thing called private enterprise, the name of which is bandied about this Parliament so often. Yesterday, the Minister for the Interior referred to housing commission estates as monotonous. I invite him to go to Soutb Melbourne, Montague, and Port Melbourne. There he will see examples of monotonous housing, erected in the 1890's in the name of private enterprise. There houses have common' walls. They have frontages of 11 feet, 15 feet and never more than 33 feet. The houses were built over 60 years ago, and tenants have paid for them over and over again. Hardly any repairs have been done to them. Nevertheless, the Liberal Government of Victoria recently increased the rents by 25 per cent. We are asked to say that that has improved the housing position in that State! As my friend, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), has said, it is an act of imbecility for the Minister to say that, because housing commissions rationalize construction methods in order to keep costs down, their estates are monotonous. Under private enterprise we have had monotony, with misery alongside it , for over 60 years. One of the greatest things that ever happened in this country was that the States, one by one-in most instances very belatedly-recognize d the need to provide for the average family a modern, decent house-subsidized , if necessary, by the taxpayers. It was recognized that the fortunate should help to give the unfortunate a better deal. But that kind of activity w ill be restricted by this bill. We have listened to a lot of clap-trap about houses The TEMPORARY ( Mr Lawrence) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. listened to the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), one might imagine that there has been no change in the conception of housing since the time to which he referred. I am astounded that he tried to persuade the committee to accept that idea. Sixty years ago, houses were built in accordance with designs which were then quite acceptable. But we all know that, since then, there has been a transin Western Australia-4,00 0 by the State formation of our ideas about the design Housing Commission and the balance by of dwelling-houses for the people of this private contractors.

It appears to me that the State Labour governments have tried strenuously to avoid building homes for individuals. They prefer a nationalized system of housing. They prefer government control of the types of houses built and the places in which thej are built. BeforeI finish, I want tn refer to the practice of housing people m flats, rather than in the individual homey for which this Government stands so firmly. there being more This Government stands for homeownership. I have listened carefully to both the second-reading debate and the Opposition speakers have implied that, during recent years, this country has been entirely dependent upon building by State housing commissions. That is a suggestion to which I cannot agree. What about the great number of homes that have been built by private enterprise? The Ministerf o r Housingi n the State Labour Government of Western Australia is reported by the Hansard of the Western Australian Parliament to have said, ou the 25th November last yearIn the 12 months ended on the 30th June last, more than 9,000 homes were completed homes erected in South Australia and, speakhouses built in Western Australia in the last than the number built under the State housing scheme. Many people prefer to had to purchase a block of land, by",41,Housing Ageeement Bill 1956
132,Mr Cleaver (Swan) [3.7],"HavingEventually it was my privilege to build on that block a home of my own design. This Government wishes to encourage young people to buy their own blocks of land. We trust that it will always be prepared to assist them by providing finance, so that they will not be compelled by State authorities to occupy homes, not of their own design and not in the areas of their choice. The provision that finance shall be made available to building societies is fully justified. We admit that rental homes built by housing commissions do provide accommodation for the people, and that in a time of desperate need we must turn to schemes of that kind. But we say that we should not be bound to them. We believe in encouraging private enterprise to build, and it has responded magnificently in recent years. Eental homes invariably deprive young married couples of an incentive to enter into comthat we have no real control over the munity life and take an interest in their homes. In a large number of cases, the maintenance of rental homes presents a problem. In many housing commission areas, we find that no gardens have been made by the tenants. These homes are often surrounded by black sand. This particularly applies in Western Australia where there is much black sand land in the metropolitan area of Perth. True community spirit is affected by undue emphasis being placed upon the provision of homes for the people through agencies such as housing commissions. I want to refer now to the magnificent record of this Government in making money available to the States under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. The previous Labour Government provided approximately £62,000,000, but this Liberal Government has provided approximately £176,000,000. The figures quoted by my colleagues during this debate show the magnificent degree of assistance that the Commonwealth has extended to the State governments, in the way of co-operation, and the corresponding results in the large number of housing units built. These figures should give us a great deal of encouragement, particularly as the purpose of this biU is to renew an agreement which is decidedly in favour of the States. I conclude by saying that, in my opinion, the State Labour governmentshave again and again used this housing agreement for ulterior purposes. We have seen groups of housing commission homes so located that even anybody whoknows little about politics would realize that political motives lie behind their location, because they are strategically placed in accordance with electoral boundaries. I believe that the new agreement' still gives far too great a freedom to the States. I consider that the Commonwealth would be justified in imposing on the States some measure of control, under this agreement, in respect of wherethese large housing commission areas arelocated, in order to ensure that no ulterior electoral purpose is served by the choiceof location. The houses built under thisagreement should be located in carefullychosen and suitable areas. It is obvious; location of houses built under the agreement, because I have seen housing commission areas located in places wherethere is no provision for adequatedrainage. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) referred to> slums, as I did at the beginning of my remarks. I believe that many housing commission areas are so located that they will eventually become slums because,, being under government control, a seriouslack of maintenance could well eventuate.. I submit my views believing that the States will, of course, accept the agreement, because it represents a positiveapproach to the housing problem. I am prompted to join in the debatebecause of what I believe to be the misleading and grossly inaccurate statementsmade by the Minister for the Interior and Minister for Works( Mr Fairhall)> and the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer), both of whom are now at the table, as well as similar remarks made by other honourable memhers opposite. Thisbill, designed as it is to providefinanceforhome building, will not, and cannot, touch approximately 2,000,000 of the working: people of this Commonwealth. Last night, the Minister for the Interiorclaimed that the average wage of the Australian workers was more than £17 a week..",43,Chairman Conimittee Debate I N Many Instances
133,Mr Griffiths (Shortland) [3.17].,"-or, approximately, £900 a year. Last year's budget-papers, however, give a -different picture. They show that there were 884,836 taxpayers earning less than .£500 a year; that there were 1,237,517 wage-earners earning between £600 and £800 a year, or about £14 a week. These -figures, taken together, show that more than 2,000,000 wage-earners in Australia are earning less than £14 a week on average. taxable income. budget-papers show that they refer to the actual incomes of taxpayers. So, there are more than 2,000,000 taxpayers who earn less than the £17 a week average mentioned by the Minister for the Interior. They are the people who, m the main, are unable to provide themselves with homes. It is interesting to note that the Minister for the Army stated that we had approximately one home for every 3.5 persons in the Commonwealth. But what are homes? The Commonwealth Year-Book shows that the Commonwealth statistician's definition of a home 13 much broader than the definition usually applied by the layman. It saysFor the purpose of a Census a "" dwelling"" is defined as a room or a collection of rooms -occupied by a household group living together -as a '' family unit"" whether comprising the whole or only part of a house or other -building (including temporary structures). Included in this dehnition are private houses, flats, tenements, hotels, boarding houses, hospitals, institutions, and any other structure -used for the purpose of human habitation. It also gives the definitions of a fiat and a tenement as follows:For Census purposes a "" flat"" is defined as part of a house or other building ordinarily intended for occupation by a separate family .group, and is a self-contained dwelling unit . with both cooking and bathing facilities. A "" tenement"" is part of a house or otlier buildand that one receives £13 a week. The ing ordinarily intended for occupation by a separate family group but is not a self-contained unit, and consists in the main of a -room or rooms with cooking facilities. There are literally many thousands of .people in Australia who to-day are living in groups of three or four families to a house. The Minister for the Interior himself knows that in Newcastle people are living in gun-pits. gun-pits ? knows that there are a dozen families living at Stockton in such conditions. They are living in caves and sheds. Over the last six years the Minister has travelled to and from Newcastle by train, and he knows quite well that along the railway lines there are many people living in tents. choice. there by choice! there by choice! because there are no houses for them. They are working on the railway system and there are no houses for them, so they are forced to live in tents. as the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Dean) knows. They live there because they are unable to find homes. If the Minister for the Interior doubts that, we shall send a group of them every week to see him and explain to him that they are looking for homes, but are unable to find homes. It is interesting to relate the statements of both of the Ministers at the table to the statement made by the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) when this bill was before another place. For the purposes of comparison he gave figures that had been obtained from building societies in respect of applicants for loans. Of the 50 cases he cited, we find that 46 concern people who receive between £16 and £20 a week, that three receive £15 a week, man who receives £13 a week is an engine-turner, and is probably a young man who has applied for a loan knowing that sooneT or later he will be on a higher wage level and will be able to meet the expense associated with building a home. There is not one labourer among the group of people mentioned by the Minister for National Development.",44,Chairman Conimittee Debate I N Many Instances

143,Mr Griffiths,"That is not true,We welcome the bill in that it is intended to provide finance for homebuilding, but, as I said before, let us not be blind to the fact that there are approximately 2,000,000 workers in Australia whom the bill cannot, and will not, touch. These workers are people who, because they are labourers earning the basic wage, are unable to take advantage of the measure. The Minister for the Interior said that there is nobody now on the basic wage. I shall disillusion him on that point, and very i|'iiickly. I invite him to investigate the position in any railway depot. There is trouble in the railway service because wage levels are very low when compared with those of people in other industries. Boilermakers' labourers, yardmen and fitters' assistants receive a flat rate of between £13 and £14 a week. It is physically impossible for such workers to obtain finance to build a house for themselves. I believe that, if this Government wants to do the right thing for people who wish to acquire their own liomes, it should make it possible for a. public servant, a railway employee or an employee of any semi-governmental undertaking who is contributing to a -upcrannuation fund, to an insurance -cheme, or to a provident fund, to acquire .t house by paying the lowest deposit possible or even without having to pay a -ieposit at all. As soon as a man obtains » stake in the country, he is part of it. In Newcastle recently, I sent to the .'ommonwealth Bank a young man who had £1.300 worth of assets, and who was huilding his own home. He had the weatherboards, the window sills, the -vindow frames, and the remainder of the framework of the house erected. He went to the bank and tried to obtain £230 for the purpose of obtaining the roof and putting in the windows and a stove. He works at the State dockyard, and being a plasterer by trade he is able to do his own plastering. He wanted to reduce his expenditure, so he asked the bank for £230 to enable him to do the work himself. The bank manager said, "" No, that is not our policy. We are not allowed to lend on that basis. If you say it will cost £900 to complete the building and if you nre prepared to employ a builder, we are willing to consider providing you with finance so that you may have your house completed."" This young man was willing to hand over the deeds of the land and the asset that had been erected, and to commence repayments as soon as the money was made available to him. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN . Order! The honourable member's time has expired. was interested when I heard the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Griffiths) refer to some of the housing problems that existed in his electorate. He and other Opposition members seem to think that the electorates that they represent have a monopoly of bad housing, but 1 sliould say that in the electorate >>f Eawkner housing is as bad as anywhere else in Australia. I know of a condemned house consisting of five rooms in which 29 persons are living, and of another in which thirteen people are living in two rooms. Opposition memhers have failecf to emphasize the great progress that has been made during the term of office of this Government towards alleviating overcrowding. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) tried to discredit the present building rate, but he knows that during the last year more than 80,000 houses were completed in Australia 80,000 houses completed? houses were completed. In the current financial year, almost 80,000 houses wilt have been completed. Fifty-seven thousand houses a year are needed to cope with the marriage rate and the intake of immigrants, so the backlog is being reduced by more than 20,000 houses h year. At present, the backlog is 100,000 houses, so at the present rate of building the shortage will almost have been overcome in four years. If that building rate is maintained, it will soon be possible to start clearing sub-standard dwellings and"" slums in parts of the capital cities. Within the last year, a start has been made with the demolition of condemned housesin the electorate of Fawkner.

But what will the buildbuilding societies. From what has been ing societies, ask for that money when they stated by members of the Opposition, one lend it to the rank and file of people who would think that the number of people desiring to own their homes was being reduced. In fact, it has been increased. In 1947, only 53 per cent, of the people of Australia owned their own homes. The revolving scheme that has been subfor rental. More than anything elsehome-ownership means that the owner? I say yet again that the majority of tinthe Interior( Mr Fairhall) has said. One of the worse features of the bill is",46,Chairman Conimittee Debate I N Many Instances
147,Mr Duthie (Wilmot) [3.37],"Thiwant homes? That is the great question in this; bill, and it has not been answered. Will they charge a further ^ per cent, to home-seekers, thus bringing the total interest rate up to more than 5 per cent. ? This high interest rate will shackle the wage-earners, who will still have to rely on the State housing commissions if they want homes. It will drive the wage earners farther and farther towards State assistance.. Therefore, the agreement will not achieve what the Government said it would. The wealthier people will get priorities from the building societies because they will have the ability to pay. Tlie agi'eement will create a new middleman between the people and the government-the building society. Before this bill was introduced, we had direct contact between the State and the people. There was no middleman at all, but now the building societies are injected between the State and the people. The high rate of interest, which is Liberal policy, is the red light of danger to our economy. It pushes the chance of a home further away from the wage earner, who is already staggering under the burden of inflation, and throws him on the mercy of the State. The building societies are in that way isolated from the wage-earner. As the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Kearney) said last night, 53 per cent, of home applicants in New South Wales receive less than £14 a week.. This bill will not help those people. It will have exactly the opposite effect, because only 80 per cent, of the money will go to the State for housing purposes and the other 20 per cent, will go to the co-operative building societies. Therefore, the poorer people in the community-5 3 per cent, in New South Wales-canno t expect one scrap of help from the co-operative building societies when this bill becomes law. They will definitely be made to suffer as a result of this legislation. The Statei, can use only 80 per cent, of the money in the first and second years, and only 70 per cent, in the third, fourth and fifth years. for servicemen's dwellings. member for Werriwa says, less 5 per cent, for servicemen's dwellings. The wage-earner will be pushed further and further away from the chance to get a home. Low interest is the answer to this problem and would transfuse new blood into home-building. In every State fewer houses are being built to-day. Figures have been cited here for each State. In Tasmania, 2,364 new houses were under construction at the 31st March of thi9 year. At the same time last year, 2,507 new houses were under construction. During the March quarter of this year, the number of new homes commenced was 592, a decrease of 56 compared with the December quarter of 1955. It is the same story throughout the Commonwealth. There should be a special low rate of interest2 per cent, or 3 per cent -for all housing loans. That is Labour's policy, and it would give' the vast bulk of home applicants a reasonable chance to get a house. Labour's policy is to have low interest rates and low deposits, and that policy should be implemented as a matter of urgency. In Tasmania, the Agricultural Bank1 builds the government homes. No deposit is required, and there is a re-purchase system if the occupant wants to buy the home. We have listened to a lot of clap-trap from Government supporters who say that we do not believe in private ownership of homes. That is the great lie that has been forced out through propaganda from the Government benches. But what sort of a deposit will be asked for by the building societies? It will be £700 to £900 deposit, plus a block of land owned by the applicant, on a house valued at about £3,500. This bill will increase rents by about 10s. a week to all who come under its operations. That is a tragedy and it will slow down the homebuilding rate for those really in. need of homes. I want to conclude with the Canberra story. The Government has failed to provide houses for its employees in Canberra, as the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) has often said. More than 3,250people are on the housing waiting list and are entitled to houses. The waitingtime now is more than two> and a half years.

149,Mr Dtjthie,"As the honorablenow must wait three years to secure a house from this Government. The rate of housing construction, compared with population increase, is the worse in the Commonwealth; yet in the Australian Capital Territory housing is completely under the control of this Government. It has complete power and complete responsibility, but it has failed to house its own people adequately in Canberra. How can it be given the responsibility of housing the people of Australia? We need 3,000 houses in Canberra to meet the present demand, and the problem will become more acute. As the Minister knows, omcers are being transferred from Melbourne to Canberra and 1,000 additional houses a year for the next five years will be needed to cope with the great influx of people from the capital cities. The number of housing units completed in 1952 was 635, but in 1956 it is 398. In 1951,1,044 housing units were under construction, but last year the figure had dropped to 657. In 1950, the number of people on the departmental waiting list was 2,902, and this year it is 3,250. The number of people directly employed in the housing industry has decreased from 951 in 1950 to 693 last year. That is the record of the Government in the housing field in a territory in which it has complete control. The Opposition will not vote against this bill; we merely point out its worse features. It was wrong for the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) to say that we will vote against this bill. We shall not do so. We believe in private ownership, but we do not believe in the methods used by this Government in its purported endeavour to improve the housing position. This agreement will make it more difficult for a wage-earner to obtain a home. Over 50 per cent, of the people in Australia to-day are earning about £14 a week, from which they must pay income tax. They will receive negligible assistance only from this bill. Although the Opposition will not vote against the bill, it definitely disapproves of the methods by which this Government has attempted to depart from the principles laid down by a Labour government in the agreegave the show away in the concluding ment that it negotiated in earlier years. portion of his speech. We have heard, Australian Government has no power to deal with housing, except in its own territories. It has power under the Constitution, however, to provide money to the States for the purposes of housing, and it has power to lay down terms and conditions upon which it shall make that money available. Under that power the Commonwealth has been providing money to the States for housing for some years past. The bill that we are now debating provides for a new agreement under which the States will be given money for housing purposes. The Commonwealth is acting perfectly correctly, under its constitutional powers, in saying on what terms and conditions it will provide this money. We heard an amazing speech this afternoon from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), in which he suggested that the Commonwealth was exercising duress when it laid down terms and conditions. He implied that the Commonwealth had no right to do this. Of course the position is that the States cannot get money from the Commonwealth as of right for purposes of housing. They may ask the Commonwealth for the money, and it is for the Commonwealth to say in what circumstances they shall have it. The Commonwealth has, in fact, laid down fair terms and conditions. I direct the attention of the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie), who comes from Tasmania, to the fact that when the Labour Government introduced its 1945 legislation the Labour Premier of Tasmania would not become a party to the agreement. It is expected however, that the same Labour Premier of Tasmania will be very glad indeed to accept the agreement proposed in this bill. It will be obvious that when the matter is examined by a responsible Premier, who knows whether or not hp. wants money for housing, he will prefer the present bill to the earlier bill that has received praise from the honourable member for Wilmot and other Opposition members.

I rise to order. I regard They fear that the Commonwealth will first subtract from that amount one-fifth for the building societies, and then onetwentieth for its own responsibility in regard to service dwellings. They fear that the Commonwealth w ill do this because it flouted its obligation to find all the funds required under the 1945 agreement.

The court said that that was true, but that the Commonwealth could give money on any terms that it thought fit and that, if the State accepted the terms, they were binding. This bill is another illustration of the same principle and the illustration that E have given is always an answer to Commonwealth governments which claim that the thing asked of them is not directly within their legislative jurisdiction. Home-building is one such matter. Education is another. This bill is an instance of assistance to education. The housing legislation was the last illustration before the House. I mentioned it because of its supreme importance in the development of this country and to try to end the shibboleth that because the Commonwealth cannot control education directly, it should not go to the assistance of education. Of course, this was not the first step.

I think that without this assistance that university would have found it almost impossible to carry on and I have no doubt that that is true of the universities of Melbourne, Queensland, Adelaide, 'Western Australia and Tasmania. The University of New England, in New South Wales, can, and probably will, receive assistance to the maximum figure under the provisions of this bill. These are vital matters. Another matter that I want to mention is the kind of special assistance that might be given by the Commonwealth in the field of education. In this particular instance, the Commonwealth requires the State to provide a portion of the money voted for the teaching and administrative costs of the residential colleges of the universities. They are not the university itself. They are colleges representing and started, I think, in most cases, by church institutions or churches, and continued on a non-ecclesiastical basis as But the topic which is of supreme imceded by those who have thought most deeply on this subject that the area of the grants are devoted to scientific think will be even more productive than mere grants to the great institutions which will benefit from this bill. I appreciate the importance of the legislation and we all agree with it. Having reached this stage in assisting education, we cannotmark time. The nation must go forward. In this respect we have no constitutional limitations which are a barrier to action of the kind I have described. The Commonwealth can select this field and can also select housing, in respect of which it has specific powers. financial assistance for any purpose that the Commonwealth thinks fit, so long as fche assistance is made available through the State parliaments, which are only too glad to receive assistance. The Oommonwealth may stipulate conditions. This provision is in a sense what might be called one of the flexible provisions of the constitutional system. ""We have a binding and rigid constitution which limits the Commonwealth in many respects, but section 96 is not a provision some suitable means of arranging for of this type. It provides a way out of most of these problems. ""We welcome this legislation, and I make no further analysis of it. Many of my colleagues are interested in special phases.

As the right that the success of the Commonwealth honourable gentleman from Barton (Dr. Reconstruction Training Scheme did Evatt) has indicated, the Opposition suphave, by its very nature, cevtain very ports the bill, and we assume therefore marked effects on universities and the that no controversy will arise regarding way in which universities themselves came the central purposes for which the bill is to regard their own functions.

Nevertheless, I feel sure that immediate effect of that very admirable there are many remarks which members scheme was that it introduced more on both sides of the House may wish to people to the idea that a. university edumake concerning the general subject of cation was obtainable by all and was university education. I think it is proper available to all. It caused more people that they should make them, partly fr in Australia to regard attendance at a demonstrate the fact that this Parliament, university as being a normal part of in a broad national way, does take an education rather than an exceptional interest in and does recognize the imporpart, and that, of course, is demonstrated tance of universities as being among the by the permanent increase in university great institutions of the Commonwealth enrolments which has taken place in this of Australia. Furthermore, the fact that country. In 1939, the enrolments in all the Commonwealth, by providing finanuniversities in Australia totalled, in round cial assistance, has entered into this field, makes it the duty of this Parliament, and of every member of this Parliament, to take an interest in what is going on in the institutions which this Parliament is now supporting. As the right honourable gentleman indicated, the scheme which is now operating had its origin in the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme, which was brought into existence shortly after the recent war. Provision for reconstruction training was clearly a function of There is power to grant the Oommonwealth and, again as the right honourable gentleman indicated, it would have been possible for the Commonwealth, at the termination of the reconstruction traming scheme, to take the line that its obligations had ceased and that its responsibility no longer existed, and leave the universities to their own devices. But, as is well known, as the reconstruction retaining scheme began to expire, the present Government took upon itself the responsibility of finding financial assistance to the universities in a. way which would replace the reconstruction training scheme, and thc present Prime Miuister( Mr Menzies). as all honourable members know, took a very large personal part as an architect of the present scheme of financial assistThe remarks that I wish to make about",52,Arthur Eaddeut

With the tapering off of that scheme, the enrolments tended to fall, but to-day, in 1956, the enrolments are again at almost the same level as they were at during the peak period of the reconstruction training scheme; and, of course, to-day, there would be fewer than 100, or a few score, reconstruction training students still on the university rolls. One natural effect-and I think this effect may have beeu less desirableof the reconstruction training scheme was to increase the trend in Australian universities to provide training for an occupation. A great deal of the work done in Australian universities to-day is students for occupations. If we look at the statistics of university subjects and the figures relating to degrees conferred, we find in Australian universities a very great trend towards what might be termed the utilitarian side, the vocational training side, of university activities. Nowadays, first degrees, or bachelor degrees, in medicine, engineering, law, science, dentistry, agriculture, architecbe easier for the universities to obtain the ture, and so on, form perhaps two-thirds of the total number of degrees conferred in Australian universities, a proportion much greater than was found in the pre-war pattern. A further influence which the reconstruction training scheme had, was to set up in the universities and, I think, in cations of the Commonwealth Statistician the student bodies of universities, a tendency to look for greater public finangeneral university activities. In 1933, cial aid. The habit in universities used to be towards independence. The habit to-day is certainly one of seeking assistmade by both the Commonwealth and ance, and that applies to the students just States made up less than one-third of that as much as it applies to the university governing bodies. In my own student days, the general habit of mind of the student was that he worked his way through university; it never occurred to him that any one had to assist him to complete his course. The habit of mind to-day in tbe student-and I make no criticism of it-is that some one should provide him with money to cover his university course. The habit of mind in the governing bodies of universities in pre-war days used to be, ""We should be very careful about accepting any money for fear that the grant of the money should have strings attached to it "" . Nowadays, the habit of mind of every governing body of every Australian university is, "" Let us see if we can find any excuse for getting more money from somebody "". big benefactors in this country. In Australia, the State has customarily been regarded as the major benefactor. One element of the scheme to be put into operation by means of this bill is that it is hoped to encourage public benefactions, particularly from industry, in addition vocational training preparing to the provision of money from governmental sources. tions will not attract Oommonwealth grants. so hitherto. full measure of Commonwealth financialassistance if they obtain additional revenue from other sources. The figures relative to university finances show that the universities to-day are dependent on governmental finance to a far greater degree than they used to be. I propose to refer to the figures given in the publishowing the total income available for when the total receipts of all Australian universities were only £6S2,000, grants total. In 1954, the latest year for which I have the figures, when the total receipts of Australian universities amounted to £9,160.000, as contrasted with £682,000 in 1933, government grants totalled £7,490,000, or 81 per cent, of the total receipts of the universities. The contrast between the position in 1933"" and that in 1954 is shown by the difference between 31 per cent., which was the exact proportion that government grants bore to the total receipts of the universities in 1933, and 81 per cent, in 1954.",54,Arthur Eaddeut

I think honourable members will agree that 81 per cent, is a very substantial proportion of the total revenue of anybody. To what extent are parliaments and the taxpayers, who provide the money which the parliaments disburse, entitled to ask whether they are getting value for their money? To what extent are they entitled to say that this or that purpose should be served by the universities in the expenditure of the money? Conversely, to what extent are the universities entitled to claim, as, traditionally they have claimed, that they can do what they like within the university sphere, and to suggest that this or that attempt to supervise their activity is an interference with academic freedom? Is it their function simply to spend and to be admired, or are they to be made subject to some sort of public, scrutiny now that so large a proportion of their funds is provided from public sources? All honourable members who are concerned with matters such as academic freedom must realize that this is a vary difficult, and in some ways, a very delicate, earlier: Seeing that additional public matter. As I have already said, one consequence of the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme was to maKe the universities dependent to a greater degree on governmental financial assistance. We must recognize that fact, and We must recognize, also, that certain other changes in the nature of university activities have taken place. Por example, universities, like all other bodies in ne country, have been affected by rising costs. I need not enlarge upon that problem. Universities, their staffs, and the students, sense from nonsense and distinguishing like all other groups of people in Australia, have been affected by the changing ideas about what is an appropriate standard of living. At one time, in my own student days, students and staffs were quite accustomed to the idea that a bicycle, or their own legs, provided an appropriate means of travel. But people who would once have ridden bicycles now think it is proper to drive motor cars. People who would once have thought one drink at dinner time on Sundays was an appropriate indulgence, now think they ought to have a drink at dinner time on every day of the week. I do not think the universities should not share in the general rise of the standards of the community. But that sort of thing has had its effect upon the expectations of comfort and of monetary reward. Perhaps the greatest change has been the trend towards more specialist training and specialist research, which requires costly buildings and equipment. We an go back in history to the ancient philosopher who, when he "" considered the heavens "", needed no more than quietness and a clear night for his study. Nowadays, an astronomer needs an observatory, costly equipment, and a highly paid technical staff. Newton was able to think in an orchard. The modern Newton needs a whole factory and a battery of electronic brains in order to think at all. For better or for worse, the specialized demands of specialist institutions necessitate the expenditure of much more money than was required in the past. This has helped to create the very great demand for financial aid which the universities now make. In approaching the conclusion of ny remarks, I should like to address myself to a question at which I hinted a litth* nnanciai assistance is being given, to what extent are we, as members of the Parliament, entitled to look searchingly into what the universities are doing? The sort of inquiry that I personally should like to make does not relate so much to the activities of this or that lecturer, or to the question whether this or that set of views is being promulgated. On such matters, my mind is confident as well as calm, because I have a firm belief that the human mind is capable of sorting out between truth and error, and that the Parliament need not concern itself very greatly whether one man's course of lectures is directed towards a right end, or whether this or that lecturer holds correct views. There are no correct views in the broader fields of learning. But one thing about which I personally feel very much concerned is the general purposes which the universities consider themselves to be serving. That question can be looked at best, I think, from the stand-point of the individual student. What do people go to the university to do ? versity from a vocational training instituI fear that a great many students at the universities attend simply to be trained for a job. Any one who has taught in a university knows the terrific pressure that is imposed on lecturers by the demands of a body of students interested only in passing an examination in order to qualify for a profession or for some position which may be advertised at the end of the course. That is one of the more discouraging and dispiriting things about modern Australian university life. I shall go the whole distance with any honourable member who argues that there is a natioial need for technical and professional competence. There is no doubt that we need engineers, doctors, lawyers, and scientists the human mind to distinguish between of various kinds. We must train them in order to meet the national need. But I am rather dismayed when I look at official university publications, particularly those else. I feel that that is the sort of thing which support the search for more money. I find that the university governing bodies and vice-chancellors base the whole of their case for more money on the function of the universities in training specialists. I am also rather dismayed when I find that young students embarking upon university careers are again just thinking of the occupational purposes that universities serve. I do not conceive that to be the whole function of a university. even worse. familiar with the field of teaching as is the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), but I can readily believe that that is so. What do we expect a university to give over and above training for an occupation? What do we expect a university to do in addition to producing for the nation the whole army of technicians which, undoubtedly, the nation needs? Some people may go to a university for its snob value-jus t because they like to have some letters after their names. Some people may go to a university just because of the opportuniserved for ten years in a university, I ties for sport which it provides, over and regard it as an honour and a privilege above those provided by a technical college. But there is something far beyond that. I believe that what distinguishes a unition and brings honour to it is that it adds something more to technical competence. Trying to think what that something more is, it seems to me that it is a search for truth, in the larger meaning of that term, and a belief that there is something that can be designated as the truth. In this world of ours to-day, we are accustomed to drift into the assumption that we cannot distinguish the true from the false. We need the universities to remind usand to remind us constantly-that there is something that is true and something that is false. We need the universities to remind us, too, that it is possible for them, to devote itself constantly and without deviation to the search for the truth, and to value the truth above everything which universities, perhaps more than any other institutions, can add to the function of merely training for an occupation. I hope the fact that the universities are receiving public assistance will not mean that, in future years, they will direct their attention simply to their vocational training job. I hope they will not desert that ancient principle of learning which expresses itself, not in the mere accumulation of knowledge, but in a constant, exacting, painful and undeviating search for the truth and a willingness to make sacrifices to obtain the truth and to regard it as the most precious thing that the human mind can encompass. Having said those few words, I express the hope that, in the criticisms offered in this Parliament and in the arguments that may be produced by the universities on the question of financial assistance from taxpayers' money, neither we nor the universities will ever forget that higher function of a universitya function not merely of scholarship, but of intellectual integrity which has been honoured in universities in the past.",55,Arthur Eaddeut

170,Mr Cairns (Yarra) [4.38],"Havingto participate in the determination of the policy for providing, through Commonwealth agencies, for the development of universities. I should like to refer to the changes that the Ministerf o r Territories ( Mr Hasluck) has noticed in recent years in relation to the development of universities and the provision, through the Commonwealth, of funds for them. The Minister gave the impression that, in his student days-the y were not so long ago-ever y university student was a poor lad who rode to the university on a bicycle, but that now students are well provided for. He implied that they expected to use motor cars rather than bicycles. I do not think that that is an accurate picture. Years ago, just as to-day, the sons of very well-to-do people attended universities. I believe that in the days when the Minister was a university student, the proportion of students with well-to-do parents was rather higher than it is now. If some of the poorer students did use bicycles in those days, they had a more comfortable and, perhaps, a more effective means of transport than the over-crowded trains and trams on which the students ride now. I do not think that the Minister painted a completely accurate picture of the changes that have occurred. students to-day are working their way through a university and are paying the high fees that must be charged because insufficient funds have been made available to universities from Commonwealth and State sources. In these days it is not so easy for students to pay the fees charged for university courses, especially if they are working students, as it was in the 1930's. I hope that I shall not be accused of speaking with only a political objective in view if I remind the House that the foundations of the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme and of this kind of legislative provision for Australian universities were laid by the Australian Labour party-ver y iargely by Mr Dedman. He was attacked-rathe r gratnituously, I thought-in an earlier debate to-day. In the rough and tumble of politics, one would have expected such an attack to come from the rough and tumble members of the Parliament, rather than from those who have had the benefit of a university education. I give f u l l credit to Mr Dedmanf o r the part he played in the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme and in the establishment of the Australian National University. I want to refer to the very obvious fact that all is not well w i th the universities. Let me refer the House to an article entitled "" The Responsibility of Science and the University in the ModernW o r l d "" , published recently by SirI a n Clunies Ross. On page 12 of the article, SirI a n statedWhat can or should be done in Australia? Here we encounter all the normal resistances on the part of students, parents, and possibly staff, which have already been mentioned. In addition, there are difiiculties which, if not peculiar to Australia, occur in exaggerated form: The continual struggle for the majority of the universities to carry on even as they are; the day-to-day uncertainty whether they will be solvent to-morrow; the battle to maintain and develop post-graduate research schools; the lower staff-student ratio as compared with the universities of the TJnited ICingdom. All these, in a period of vicious inflation, preoccupy staff, administrators and' governing bodies, and there is little time or energy left for thought ahout the vital purpose of university education or the broader questions of educational reform. Many Having worked for ten years in a u n i versity, I can say that every one of those statements by SirI a n Clunies Ross is strikingly true. He goes onIndeed, a pardonable analogy may be drawn between the universities and Toynbee's arrested civilizations of tbe esquimaux and the nomads who were so overborne hy the sheer business of living that opportunity to develop the arts and practices of civilization were denied them. While their present plight does not excuse complete inaction, it is obvious that the changes necessary to provide some semblance of general edncation for all students cannot be made except at considerable cost and hy the appointment of additional staff. This emphasizes afresh that the time is long overdue for a comprehensive examination, at the highest level, of the whole problem of university education in Australia. Things are not all well in our universities. It is so obvious that more funds are required. It is so obvious, also, that more funds are needed for housing, railroads, road-building and for many other things. But the funds which sbould be provided for universities differ in this way from the funds necessary for other activities: The resources are available i u this field, whereas in so many other fields the problem, as has so rightly been recognized, is the shortage of resources. So ihe resources are available to meet the in creased funds that should be provided to improve conditions in universities and to raise the standard of university education and research. ° In 1947-48, the Commonwealth provided 85 per cent, of the total university revenue. The last figures that I have available show that, to-day, the percentage is smaller. In 1953-54, it had fallen to .56 per cent. University staffs are themselves most concerned about this decrease. Prior to the determination of the level of the present grant of £2,000,000 the federal council of the University Staff Associations of Australia was active in an endeavour to have the grant increased. I have here a letter from the federal council of the associations to the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) which readsThe Federal Council of University Staff Associations of Australia and the National Union of Australian University Students are deeply concerned at the inadequacy of the financial resources available to Australian universities. University expansion, essential to the future well-being of Australia, is being severely restricted by financial considerations. We recognize that university finance is considered to be primarily a State, not Commonwealth, responsibility. Nevertheless, in recent years the Commonwealth Government has seen the necessity of making substantial university grants. We feel that many of the present difficulties of the universities can be resolved only by greater Commonwealth participation in university finance. There is no doubt whatever about that. The Commonwealth must come more and more into this picture. The letter continuesWe would like an opportunity to express in some detail our views on this subject. Accordingly, we request that you, sir, receive a joint deputation from our organizations at a date convenient to yourself, which we would suggest might be early in June, 1956. The date of that letter was the 30th A p r i l . Of course, it was too late for a deputation to see the Prime Minister, who answered as follows:I received the letter . . . in which you ask if it will he possible for me to receive a joint deputation from the Federal Council of the University Staff Associations of Australia aud the National Union of Australian University Students to discuss university finances. Unfortunately I shall he leaving Australia at the end of this month to attend the Prime Ministers' Conference in London, and I cannot see anj' opportunity of arranging to meet this deputation before 1 leave. So nothing came of that proposal. I d i not think that the representations of the universities as a whole, in relation to these annual grants, have been brought f u l l y to the notice of the Government. The needs of the universities are widely recognized and I should like to spend a moment or two indicating what some of them are. It is generally recognized that there is overcrowding in universities, and that they have inadequate facilities and equipment and inadequate funds for research. Perhaps some figures carefully prepared recently w ill give an. enlightening comparison of the amount of money expended for every student in several British universities which are similar to our institutions, with the amount spent for every student in our universities. Expenditure for each student in various British universities was-Birmingham , £452; Bristol, £480; Leeds, £438; Manchester, £402; Nottingham, £325; Sheffield, £ 4 5 1; and Edinburgh, £343; or an average ef £A.422. The comparable figures for the Australian universities are-Sydney, £257; Melbourne, £259; Adelaide, £264 ; Queensland, £274; Western Australia, £355; and Tasmania, £456-the only one which compares favourably with the British figures. The average expenditure for each student in Australian universities was £284, compared with £422 in the United Kingdom. Professor S. H . Roberts, the vicechancellor of the University of Sydney, in a letter to graduates in A p r i l , 1955, referring to statements made by the president of the University of Toronto, saidThe President complained that "" Canadian Universities spent in 1952 $953 per student. Yet we in Canada spent in 1951 $1,077 for each individual in our penitentiaries "". I do not think that the amount spent in Australian penitentiaries for every prisoner is quite as high as the amount spent on prisoners in Canada, but it is considerably higher a prisoner than the a-mount spent on each student in our universities. Professor Roberts commented as follows:* By Australian standards, the existing state of affairs in Canadian universities seems a vcTy happy, indeed almost an Elysian, eondition.

Perhaps those things are not as popular or as fashionable to-day as they were in the past. I shall now deal with the question of academic freedom. The Minister for Territories has rightly stressed the fact that, when increased funds are made available to universities, the question of the control of those funds arises. Let me refer to the position in Great Britain, where university education is far more developed, and where there is a far greater experience upon which to draw. For very many years, Great Britain has had a university grants committee. I propose to quote an article by Mr BT. V. Wiseman, entitled ""Parliament and the University Grants Committee"", published in tbe 1956 spring edition of Public Administration. We must avail ourselves of experience gained in Great Britain when approaching the question of the development of relations between the Parliament and the university. Mr into that field. Wiseman saidThe success of thc university grants committee rests fundamentally upon unwritten conventions and personal and social relations of a homogeneous community of university men in and out of the government, who share common tastes and a common outlook unmatched by any similar relationship in the United States And in Australia, too. Incidentally, this article was written by an American. It continuesAttempts to formalise these relationships by development of Australian universities. I administrative regulations would destroy them and lenve a vacuum which bureaucracy would soon fill. I do not wish to see such formalized relationships develop in Australia, nor do I want to see any vacuum created that bureaucracy would soon fill. There are two aspects of the problem of the influencing of university men by those outside who control the funds. The remedy is relatively simple. Recently, a member of the Australian National University staff associated himself with a conference in Indonesia, and he was criticized in this House by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and other honourable members. It seems that the circumstances required the vice-chancellor of the university to remind the staff that they had a duty to the university which they ought to consider when associating themselves with certain kinds of political activity. If we wish to do the right thing in relation to academic freedom, it is not necessary for us to think in terms of new committees or old committees. Persons who are rather heavyhanded in politics should not become heavy-handed in relation to academic freedom. It is not necessary to form new committees in order to rectify the situation. It is worth noting that, when certain other members of the staff of the Australian National University have supported the foreign policy of the Australian Government they have not been criticized by members of the Cabinet. That is the first point that I should like to make-that the question of academic freedom is a comparatively simple matter with which to deal. Men who work in universities have a rightful field in which to work, and I do not think it is desirable that senior Ministers or other members of the Parliament should intrude too far be only from one side ? should be any intrusion at all, and I suggest^ that the Minister for Territories, with his background, should agree with me. I think that some action must be taken in the field of university finance and development. I suggest that there is a kind of hiatus or malaise in the know from my own experience that there is_ an awareness of the problems that might he involved in asking for more money. University people are aware that, if they go too far in this respect, they -might become involved in certain governmental controls and restrictions that might be damaging to their scope of operations. I feel that there is a great danger that the recognition of that possibility will prevent the breaking of that malaise or hiatus in university development. The pressures are not intentional ; in many ways they are hardly recognizable. But there is need for a greater freedom and scope for development in this direction than we possess at the present time. It seems to me that the suggestion",57,Arthur Eaddeut

172,Mr Cairns,"I do not think theremade by Sir Ian Clunies-Ross, in tbe article to wbicb I bave referred, may very well be one that could be considered seriously as being another step in tbe development of this relationship. What Sir Ian Clunies-Ross suggested was that a Commonwealth commission of the highest prestige and authority ought to be set ftp to examine and define the functions, responsibilities and needs of universities, as well as to examine the financial requireStaff Associations of Australia write to ments to meet those functions, responsibilities and needs. If that were done, the emphasis given by the appointment of a commission or committee of such high prestige and authority as that suggested, would, in itself, be sufficient to break down the kind of hiatus in development that I suggest exists. It is worthwhile to notice that Sir lau Clunies-Ross was concerned not only with finance but also with the function that the university should fulfil. That function concerns a much, more rapid technicological development, a much more rapid provision of scientists and engineers and people who are needed for utilitarian purposes of that sort. It concerns also the broader concept of education and the laying down of some kind of a plan so that the universities can get away from the condition which Sir Ian Clunies-Ross has described-and which I know from my own experience to be true. He referred to the continual struggle by the majority of universities to carry on, even as they are, with the day-to-day uncertainty about whether they will be solvent tomorrow, the battle to maintain and develop post-graduate and research schools, must have the vote of the majority of the and so on. This means that planning and financing has to be from day to day or month to month. The development of a university requires that a plan must be much more long-term than that. These are the conditions that have been forced upon so many people working inside the universities. It has been said that the new universities developed in G-reat Britain are redfine teaching is provided and from which brick universities. In that sense, our universities are fibro-plaster. The comparison emphasizes the extent to which we have had imposed upon us by circumstances a kind of development that is essentially short term. Much has been done and the universities appreciate what has been done by goverments of all kinds to foster their development in recent years. They appreciate what has been done and draw no political line or division in that appreciation. But all is not well with the Australian universities and we must see the importance of tackling thia problem. It should not be put off with the kind of relationship that exists when the representatives of the the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) at a time, unfortunately, close to his departure, and are unable to pnt their case to him in relation to this measure. We need some more formalized relations. I am well aware of the difficulties and the problems that arise in these formalized relations, but we must see to it that better is done in the future. House is indebted to the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) for the fine speech that he made on this matter and, in particular, for pointing out to us that it is so important for universities to seek the truth and to teach the truth. That is the sort of thing that one is apt to forget, and, because of that, it is very important that from time to time we should be reminded of it. It may very well be asked whether there should be a constitutional change to give this Parliament f u l l power to make laws in regard to education. There are, of course, people who favour that view, but I doubt whether it would find acceptance in the States. It must not be forgotten that any constitutional change States before it can be adopted. The States are very proud of their educational systems and I believe that, in particular, they are very proud of tbeir universities. We have heard much to-day which proves to us that the universities of Australia are great institutions with fine traditions. They are institutions in which much research is carried out, in which students graduate with honours and with knowledge of the subjects that they have been studying, which is of value to them for the rest of their lives. It may very well be that the position under the Constitution could remain as it is now-that the Commonwealth should not have full",61,Arthur Eaddeut
173,Mr Joske (Balaclava) [5.9],"Th epower to deal with education hut might make grants in the way proposed under this bill. That is to say, the Gommonwealth should use its power to make grants to the States and to set out the terms and conditions of those grants. It will be noted in this bill that the financial assistance to the States is granted on certain conditions. One of those conditions is that the States are to pay an amount equivalent to that paid by the Commonwealth to the university. The other condition is in two parts; firstly, that a certain part of the sum is to be applied by the university towards the teaching and administration costs of the residential colleges; and, secondly, that the remaining portion is applied by the university for expenditure, not being capital expenditure^ on universilty purposes. When one considers whether this I'arliament should give more money to the university than has been given in the past-and that was very strongly canvassed by the honourable member for it from two points of view. There is the point of view of the university, and there is the point of view of the taxpayer. Many university pontiffs have said to me. "" We need more money"". I have met those same gentlemen on the morning after they have received their income tax assessments and they have been very down in the mouth about the amount of their tax. As this money comes out of the pockets of the taxpayers, it is the duty of this Parliament to watch very carefully how much is spent on universities. It is not a direct obligation of this Parliament; it is an obligation that we are entitled to take upon ourselves, but not an obligation that we are bound to accept. In other words, we must exercise due and proper judgment in this matter. Tn exercising that due and proper judgment, we mu3t remember the worthy purposes of a university. We must remember that the needs of a university are very great indeed and that we should do our utmost to see that those needs are fulfilled so that a university may accomplish what it desires to accomplish. That, of course, will become more and more important as the years pass. It is quite likely that the grant now being made to the universities will increase in the future. It is appropriate that I mention the point of view of the student. One of the great periods of his life is spent at a university. It is a period when he begins to realize that he has ceased to be a mere boy, that he has become a man, that he is spreading forth his wings, as it were, and that he is beginning to appreciate to the full the life that is unfolding before him. Any one who undertakes a university course, either here or in England, must appreciate the wonderful life that students lead. Not only are they beginning to live a full life, but they are also acquiring a great deal of knowledge which they will never forget. They are acquiring an educational background, than which nothing is more valuable in this life. We must also consider the matter of scientific knowledge. The question often arises whether our universities should concentrate on research or teaching. Professors in a teaching university are sometimes inclined to resent the fact that they have to spend so much time in teaching when they would prefer to spend a large part of their time in research. That is one of the problems that will have to be considered in the future, and we may have to decide to what extent a teaching professor should spend his time in research, or whether, if he prefers research, he should go to a purely research university. Another question that arises is whether our universities are making sufficient provision for the requirements of the community, particularly with regard to what may be called the professional' courses. It is quite evident that, in the future, there will be a shortage of professional men in Australia. That, shortage will occur in most, if not all, of the professions. Some universities have introduced what they call a quota system, under which the numbers of students in certain faculties have been reduced. That is an extremely controversial practice. The universities that have adopted that system contend that they are unable to teach any more than the number provided in the quota. It may he that if they were a little more painstaking, or exerted a little greater effort, they could take more students. On the other hand, it has been",62,Arthur Eaddeut

175,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [5.22],"universities are places for the cultivation of intellectual excellence. The universities of the TJnited States of America have rather a different function in the community. Certainly, there are some universities in America of the kind that are found in Britain, hut Americans have unconsciously arrived at the point of view that there should be a special kind of university education, leading to the acquiuniversity education is worthwhile. sition of a degree that is not really the reflection of a high level of academic excellence. Many of the colleges of the United States of America might be said to have a first-year study standard equivalent to that of our last year of high school. I do not say, of course, that such universities at Princeton and Harvard are in that category, hut it is a fact that America has many of what might be called middle-level universities. That has led to a vast section of the American community appreciating university education, and appreciating research. It has resulted in the formation of a business community that is prepared, year after year, to pour millions and millions of dollars in endowments into all sorts of universities, research projects and other studies in ail parts of the TJnited States of America. I do not think that we will see again private fortunes leading to such endowments as were made by the late Sir Winthrop Hackett, Sir Lavington Bonython and T. E. Barr-Smith. Therefore, the Commonwealth Parliaments of the future are likely to have to repeat this kind of legislation. I would say that education is that development of personality which goes on as a result of an individual's which might be said to be primarily conlearning. Personality is the sum-total of an individual's aptitudes and attitudts. Technical education may be said to be the training of aptitudes. The development of attitudes is always a more difficult matter. Technical education is instantly appreciated because the products of the aptitudes that have been developed are there before us, physically. The question of attitudes is much more subtle and, basiliament which makes the listener to broadcally, universities will be judged on the type of attitudes that they produce iu their students. I have been in this Parliament for moie Parliament have attempted to deal with than ten years now, and can think of a lot the issues before them without resort to of members of Parliament wbo have a personal abuse. To that extent they have university education, and a lot who haye contributed to clarity of thinking on the not. If a university education of a cultural type, which involves dealing with attitudes, is effective, it ought to have been apparent to me during those ten years that the men who had a university education brought to bear on the problems before this Parliament qualities wnic'i were available; qualities which should give some indication as to whether a There is far too great a tendency on the part of those who' bombard this Parliament with requests for more finance for universities to assume that it is axiomatic that those institutions should get a higher proportion of the nation's resources. That is very much open to question. Por instance, the technical faculties of the Australian National University are magnificently efficient, but it is extremely doubtful whether the Australian community has yet received from the non-technical faculties, ih research or in publications, anything which shows a quality of thinking that contributes something new to the national life, or to the clarification of the thinking of this Parliament or the Government. If the universities are doing that they are contributing something that is extremely valuable. If they are not, they do not deserve to be appreciated by the community. I am not saying that a new institution like the Australian National University can be judged offhand immediately. I am merely making that point in order to argue that it is up to the universities, especially in those faculties tributing a quality of thinking to the community, to show that they can product) results. I may be making a very rash statement when I say that, over the last ten years, the members of Parliament on both sides who have had a university education, by and large, have been freer than are most members from that feature of this Parcasts so sick-the practice of not dealing with a man's arguments but, instead, defaming him. Generally speaking, I would say that the university men in this issues before this House. I would say that that is one up for the universities. If they can, in the civil service, in the Parliament and everywhere where decisions are made, produce an attitude of mind that tries to arrive at the facts, and that is suspicious of its own self-interest and will try to brush it aside to give a decision warranted by the facts, the universities will have been worthwhile. The humanities are, of course, the faculties at the universities which are trying to produce these attitudes. Basically, I should say that the test of culture is how you treat people. I understand that the late Hermann Goering appreciated art to an advanced extent, and even went to some pains to collect the art treasures of Europe. I understand also that, with Heinrich Himmler, he appreciated Beethoven's sonatas. I do not know that the culture of these gentlement was ""much good to the world. The thing that the world will remember about them is the way in which they treated people. Ultimately, if the universities are to produce cultured people they must' produce people who, by honesty of mind and other qualities, will solve the problems of mankind and not use their qualifications to ensure their own personal victories at the expense of the community. I would say that this last was the leading characteristic of the two late gentlemen whom I have just mentioned. The universities are facing the problem of rising costs. I have been for ten and a half years on the interim council, and the council, of the Australian National University. I remember that in 1946 we had before us the question of approving certain plans for buildings which it was estimated would cost £340,000. Eventually, they cost more than £900,000. The plans had not been altered, but building costs had risen in the interim. Of course, universities are hit very heavily indeed by such rises. The Commonwealth has been drawn more and more into the field of university education because of the effect on the universities of inflation, and because the technical faculties are becoming so important. I do not know whether the information that I received was accurate, but when I asked an honourable member who knew a great deal about the Woomera rocket range, whether there were many air force, army and naval personnel there, he said, "" Certainly not. Most of tbem are scientists"". I said, "" I mean the men firing the weapons and so"" on ''. He said, "" Yes, they ,are scientists"". In the modern world defence has become an absolutely scientific matter. The handling of even the initial stages of weapon operation requires scientific assistance. There is no doubt that our present great concern about the lack of engineers and scientists is comparative with what we have been told about the enormous numbers of engineers and scientists who are being turned out by the Soviet Union, which we envisage as a possible enemy. Education, like many other fields of our social life, is now being discussed competitively with Eussia, and I take it that that was what the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) meant when he said that concern about technical education was one of the characteristics of the cold war. There is no doubt that, for that reason, technical studies will be assisted more and more. I do not think that they need fear for their future. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Joske) spoke about the size of classes and the teaching load. Every university in Australia, except the Australian National University, has that problem, but I feel that one answer to the increasing size of student bodies is to build more universities rather than to extend existing universities. About 1946, the late Professor Cotton took me through the medical school at Sydney University in order to show me the overcrowding of classrooms and laboratories. It was a very big building, but very old. The universities of Australia, except the Australian National University, the University of Western Australia and the New South Wales University of Technology, are large buildings that were constructed 100 or 80 years ago. We never sufficiently appreciate how those small communities put up magnificent public buildings which, in relation to their resources in those days, must have required immense contributions. Those same university buildings are now housing student bodies three or four times larger than those originally housed. I remember that before the war, when the University of Western Australia had a studeni body of about 1,000I tbink it has more than 3,500 students at the present tm:>' --it was an extremely pleasant place to be. I rather wonder whether a university with 15,000 students or, like the University of Southern California, with 100,000 students is, in fact, a true university at all and whether it would not be better to have a number of them. The University of Technology in Sydney, which seems to me to be quite wrongly named, is at least a university that has been established separately from the Sydney University. It should, in my opinion, be called an institute of technology. After all, the term "" university "" implies that people are studying in all disciplines-that it is a place where all work of a near-political character in disciplines are available. How it is possible to have a university of technology when technology is not a universal set of disciplines I do not know. The name is a contradiction in terms ancl, in the United States of America, such an organization is called an institute. But the principle that underlies the University of Technology, insofar as more students were not just slapped into the engineering faculty of Sydney University or more buildings built there, but that a separate institution was established, seems to be a sound one. The honorahle member for New England( Mr Drummond) in laying the foundations of the University of New England some years ago, appeared to me to adopt the right approach to this problem of the overcrowding of universities. It would be a good thing if, instead of continuing to crowd more and more students into universities such as the universities of Sydney and Melbourne the accommodation of which is already overtaxed, we gave some consideration to establishing new ones in centres away from the capital cities where they could perform a useful function. I have mentioned the ending of private endowment as one of the factors making difficult the problem of university finance. I wonder whether it would be possible for the Commonwealth or the States to enter the field of university endowment. Each year we make a grant. It is a grant of income. It is not a grant which enables the university t ustees to n=e v their wisdom as to where they would invest money to get the best return for their university. I know that the Australian community has enormous problems before it in the rehabilitation of the railways and roads and I know also that it has tremendous developmental problems; but it would not be a bad thing if, from time to time, we could find £1,000,000 or so for the universities, divide it among them according to some formula, and leave them the discretion of investing that money and earning an income from it and, over a period of time, building up their endowment. I think that it would give them a great deal more independence than they have. I think it would stop this perpetual which vice-chancellors are forced to engage at' the present time. In Western Australia, for instance, they are arguing whether the State government is being sufficiently generous in the matter of the salaries whicli it allows in its grant for professors and lecturers at the University of Western Australia. week. got a rise. It is rather a pity that great Australian enterprises such as the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited which do make handsome contributions to technical education have always kept those contributions under their own control, setting up their own technical schools, because technical advances will, to a very large extent, be based upon the general research which is carried out in the universities, not with an immediate bearing on some technical problem of manufacture, but with a bearing on establishing a general truth. I think that the Australian universities, by and large, have established for themselves quite a good reputation in the world. When one goes as a member of Parliament to have discussions with leading civil servants, in Canbena for instance, many of whom are the products of universities, one finds in them a genuine concern about the welfare of the nation and a quality of mind being brought to bear on the problems of the",64,Arthur Eaddeut

[5.42] -It is welcome, although I think in this case it is not surprising, that we find unanimity on all sides regarding tliis bill and a uniform desire to support it. Because that is so, we are not so much debating the bill itself as followr ing down the side issues which have been suggested by its introduction. I myself am happy and proud to join with honourable members on both sides of the House in stressing the importance of university education, and the valuable and essential nature of the work that universities do, and in commending the intellectual freedom which we believe is, and should remain, a characteristic feature of university education and life. Our universities are, generally speaking and with one notable exception, State institutions. Here, we find the Commonwealth making a grant-rin-aid for their maintenance. I believe that it a right and a proper thing to do. I support it. I think the Government is to be commended. But I do feel that there are some different considerations in regard to this matter from those which obtain in regard to other matters in connection with which the Commonwealth uses its appropriation power to invade a field which properly and primarily belongs to the States. I think, in general, that process, although it is to be commended in this case, is to be deprecated. I believe that, in general, it is better that the responsibility of finding funds should be borne by the same authority that has the power of allocating and spending them. But in this case, I , think that a different principle can be invoked.. It is basic to the universities, that, they should be as free as possible and beholden to as few as possible,, They should. no_t. come directly under the qontrol of any goyernnien.t, whether it be State or federal, and I £h.ink jtha.t it is a good thing, .and it increases their independence, if we can separate the sources from which they get their financial support It has been a characteristic, of course, of i British freedom that it has depended upon this division of functions' and powers. If we have universities which are dependent mainly on a single body, thp State, for thpir needs in excess of what they receive from their student fees and from bequests, those universities are likely to come more under the control of one particular government or one particular parliament than if the university drew part of its sustenance from two separate parliaments. SoI feel that the very condition which makes it generally undesirable that the Oommon,weal th's appropriation powers should be used to invade new fields, works in reverse in this instance. In order to assure the universities of the greatest degree of independence, there is something to be said fpr the division of the source of their revenue between the two governments. I mention merely in passing that we do not want this position in regard to the universities to derive from the situation where the States have insufficientresources to maintain their proper services. That is an entirely separate question, and I think that many honourable members agree with me that, in that regard, some adjustment should be made, and made before very long. The universities in Australia are meeting a crisis in numbers. As honourable members will recall, they met a crisis in numbers immediately after the war, when the bank-up of persons of normal university age coming out of the services swelled their numbers for a few years after peace was declared. They are now about tp meet another swelling of numbers, by reason of the. increase in the age groups which are now qualifying for the university. This increase haa come upon our primary schools. It iscoming up through our secondary schools^ and if we look from a demographer's point of view at the various-, age groups we see that this is quite a steep increase,, and it is. now coming into-, the university range. The universities,.",67,Arthur Eaddeut
178,Mr Wentworth (Ma.ckell.ar),"therefore, will have to expand the number of their students in the near future, and that will require quite considerable increases in real revenue beyond what may be occasioned by any increase in the general level of. costs. In addition-and I think this has been mentioned by honourable members on both sides in the earlier part of this debatethe universities are meeting a new responsibility with new technology. With the coming of automation and new techniques, the maintenance and improvement of living standards must require that a greater number, and a greater proportion, of the people have technical ability, and although some of that technical ability will lie below the level of normal university education, much of it will lie above that level. We shall need more technical graduates if we are to improve our living standard; but I think that honourable members on both sides have rightly stressed the view that the university is not merely a technical college, and that the mechanical side must not be given a position of sxiperiority over done on the physical side. It is particuthe humanities. I believe that the House is recognizing the lack of students may be expected to that universities can perform in the comimpair the efficiency of the teachers. munity a function which is essential, and which no other institution can duplicate. I agree with the contention of the honorside, it is frequently found that the most able member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) that it is much better for us to increase the number of our universities than to increase over-much the size of with that. I think that this tendency existing universities. There comes a time operates both in the sciences and in the when the institution is too big to be perhumanities. I think that it operates personal, when the mere weight of numbers haps more in the humanities than in the crushes individuality, at least to a very sciences, but I am not trying to say for large extent, and when a big institution one moment that it does not operate also cannot give the same opportunities to its in the sciences. students that a smaller institution can give.

It is very difficult to decide of our universities, which, I suppose, must what is the best size.

A university education requires a should be looking to the foundations of tutorial system, and this brings me back new universities, and I hope that many to my earlier contention that there is of them will be, at least to large extent, a great deal to be said in favour of residential universities. A residential residential universities. I suppose it is university can give something that cannot, I believe, be given by a university where a majority of students come in by the day. I should have liked to see in the schedule to this bill a greater recognition of that basic fact. Honourable members on both sides have, I think rightly, pointed out that a research university cannot be altogether healthy if divorced from the teaching function. One does not want the really top-flight researchers to be impeded by routine duties, but nevertheless, even the top-flight researcher is likely to become sterile if not brought into constant contact with new and developing minds by exercising the teaching function. This, I think, is particularly true of the humanities. This association of research on teaching could be. I believe, one of the best ways of promoting both research and scholarship. This has a bearing on the point made by the honourable member for Fremantle, namely, that the work done on the humanities in the Australian National University has lagged behind the work larly in the realm of the humanities that valuable research is done by teams of twenty or more undergraduates.

It may be that, because we are a new country in which because taxation is high, fortunes cannot now be made, our universities will continue to be meagrely endowed. If that is so, it would be a. good thing for governments .to look on their grants for university purposes not as year-to-year appropriations, but as special appropriations to stand for a number of years, and perhaps to be adjusted in accordance with changes in the cost of living and the requirements of special expansions of activity.

[ submit that that is the procedure that should be followed for so long as we operate under a federal system. We on this side of the House believe that, for the better government of Australia, ultimately there will have to be a considerable shift of constitutional powers, possibly from the States to the Commonwealth. But the powers should pass consistently. They should pass by means of agreement with the States, or by alterations of the Constitution. We should not have to use this hole-in-the-corner method of grants-in-aid. Section 96 of the Constitution, which was referred to earlier by the Leader of the Opposition (""Dr. Evatt), does give the Commonwealth Parliament broad power to make grants to the States for specific purposes. The grants that we are considering now are made under the terms of that section of the Constitution, as are the grants made to what are called the claimant States by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The present position highlights the very real difficulties that face the States to-day. One of those difficulties is a form of financial starvation on the margin of their activities. Universities are a case in point. Surely the financial system of this country ought not to be so delicately poised, as it were, that the State universities are forced to come to the Commonwealth and say, "" We cannot carry on our essential activities without a grant of £2,000,000 "". This is only one example of the many marginal difficulties that beset the States. As has been stated from time to time in the debates on the annual reports of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, Commonwealth bodies of that kind, in effect, can control the policy of various State instrumentalities, because tbey hold the purse-strings. So far, the Commonwealth has not used its power to make grants-in-aid to universities as a means of dictating the kind of activities in which State universities should engage. The honourable member for Mackellar appears to believe that the fact that both the Commonwealth and the States are responsible, to some degree, for university trol of universities less possible. I do not know whether he intends to imply that the Australian National University-wit h which I think he is very familiar-because it is beholden only to one government, is experiencing that kind of difficulty. I hope that this Government, controlling the national purse, does not say to the Australian National University, "" We shall not give you financial assistance unless you engage in certain activities, curtail certain activities, or curb the conduct of certain people on the staff"". I do not think that that kind of thing has occurred openly as yet, although there are vague rumours circulating in Canberra to the effect that from time to time there are attempts to curb the freedom of expression of members of the staff of the Australian National University. If that were so, it would be a sad thing for academic freedom throughout Australia. If the first blow were struck, even if it were limited to the national capital, academic freedom throughout the Commonwealth would be in jeopardy. gentleman give a specific instance ? all that we have sometimes is an atmosphere of rumour. I am not making specific charges, but the fact that these things are spoken of quite freely among the citizens of Canberra, who mix one with the other, indicates that all is not well as far as academic fredom is concerned. I have not had any connection with the administration of universities. My association with universities has been as a student-no t as a residential student, which some people appear to regard as the ideal pattern. It may be the ideal pattern for some stage in the future, but certainly it will not be the fairest pattern until considerable adjustments of the economic stratification of the community have been made. My experience is that from time to time the suggestion is made that the appointment of certain people to academic positions in the Australian",70,Arthur Eaddeut
182,Mr Killen,Can the honourable,71,Arthur Eaddeut
183,Mr Ceean,"In matters of this kind,National University is prejudiced because some people believe that they hold certain political views. I suggest that when that kind of thing is occurring it is serious indeed. but, as you say, sometimes rumour has been persistent, persistent enough, I suggest, to lead to the suspicion-wher e there is even a little smoke there is some fire-that there is some justification for the rumours. ""We on this side of the House are sometimes grouped with certain academic people to whom the term "" l e f t is t "" has been applied because they the Australian National University, was have acted or spoken in some direction contrary to the views of the government of the day. But the term "" l e f t is t "" is often applied to a member of the Labour party. In some of our universities, not only the Australian National University but also some of the State universities, people are being prejudiced to-day because of the political views they hold. I submit that, if any academic appointee attempts to indoctrinate his students, then perhaps the university authorities ought to act; but they ought not to act, in advance, on the kind of information that is sometimes surreptitiously given to them that such and such a person may be a dangerous man, or may corrupt the youth of the community should he be appointed to a university post. This afternoon there was considerable discussion on academic freedom and the role that universities should play in the future, as well as the role that they have played in the past. I submit that anybody who has studied closely the role of the university in the community in the past knows that people in academic circles, who have been outspoken, and often unpopular, in their day have sometimes been the bearers of culture, as it were, for the future, and have often been the ones who have been responsible for change, and beneficial change, in the future. Once the power of the purse, or power of appointment, is used in any way to threaten the academic freedom of any individual t'*en, as I said earlier, it is a dangerous thing. Recently, I noticed in the stop press column of a Melbourne newspaper a report that Professor Sir Howard Florey, who has played such an important part in the preservation of life in this community, had resigned as a member of the staff of the Australian National University. If I recollect aright, it was stated at the time that he had resigned because he was carrying on work at Oxford and wanted to devote himself to studies there. But again, ugly rumour in Canberra suggested that he had resigned for entirely different reasonsin fact, because he felt that the academic freedom both of himself and others in Australia, and particularly of people in being threatened. I have no definite proof of the truth of these rumours, but I say that they are more than persistent, and I suggest that some close examination ought to be given to this situation. Recently a royal commission inquired into the administration of the University of Tasmania. The commission was the result of discontent, some of it economic because of the inadequacy of salaries and some of it academic on the question of freedom. But at least in Tasmania a judicial inquiry was held, and an opportunity was given to the aggrieved parties to state their cases. As I said earlier, in this Commonwealth of ours, university education is basically and primarily a State matter. By and large we have something like 100 years of academic integrity behind us in this community and we may very well be proud of the record of our various State universities. The University of Melbourne is celebrating its centenary this year. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) at the close of his remarks this afternoon, agreed that academic freedom needed to be protected but he said, rather veiledly, that sometimes we have to exert ourselves in the name of freedom against people who challenge the very name of freedom itself. But, again, he was not very specific. I suggest that there we have at any rate the kind of atmosphere that surrounds statements made by academic people in our community. Sometimes opinions are uttered, and have to be uttered, by",71,Arthur Eaddeut

But -when a goverument attempts in any way to infringe on, or to abridge, that freedom of expression, something has to be done to halt it. Recently, we had certain economists, who are academic people, issuing an economic statement in which ithey suggested certain remedies that -ought to be taken for the welfare of the community. We should not resent the fact that this kind of opinion was given, and that this kind of criticism was made. -On the economic plane, of course, at least the opinions expressed are often subject to challenge and to a certain amount of debate as to the fundamentals of the opinions. Nevertheless, we should welcome the fact that academic people in our midst, whether they be economists or people concerned with international affairs, or people in schools or political philosophy or of philosophy generally, utter opinions. Although these opinions may at the time appear contrary to what is currently accepted, we should at least welcome frank expression of opinion, and make no attempt to hinder it. In conclusion, I come back to the point at which I started, which is that, in this financial measure, is again highstaffs of universities, who are students, lighted a marginal difficulty that besets or who are doing research. Perhaps it the whole of our federal system to-day. We have a system under which this Government has been chided by a committee of its own creation in regard to expendithose of the present-to express their ture on defence, the committee having Stated that £9,000,000 was expended which need not have been expended. That raises the thought that if that sum of £9,000,000 had been made available to tbe States it could have been spent on sueh things as education generally, or adult education, library development, better health facilities or in such other ways as the States decided to expend it. Adermann) -That is not in issue under this bill. to the bill. I submit merely that the fact that an additional £2,000,000 has been sought by the universities is indicative that the States as a whole are not getting sufficient revenue, because it is well known that essential services, universities in particular, are languishing ir. the States because of the inadequacy of the revenue available to them. Minister for Health) [8.19] -It is nice to know that all parties in the House, and all members of the House, support this bill. BeforeI continue in rather more general terms about some of the matters covered by the bill I should like to refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) and the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns), as well as those of some other honourable members, on the subject of academic freedom. I think that we are all sometimes inclined to talk about academic freedom without pausing to t think quite what we mean by the term. WhilstI do not apply the description I am about to use to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, I think that we are sometimes prone to talk about academic freedom with some degree of priggishness. After all, what do we mean by academic freedom? I would say that academic freedom is only a part of the freedom in which we all believe and which we all enjoy. Perhapsi t means a little more than that to persons who are on the means that they are free to investigate the thoughts, the history, the views, and the ideas of people of the past as well as views about them, to discuss them, and, as it were, to make an investigation of the minds of people of all age3. Let me refer to the specific incident that was mentioned by the honourable member for Yarra, namely, that a member of the staff of the Australian National University attended a conference outside this country and later expressed certain views about it. PerhapsI have a little more knowledge of this matter than has the honourable member. My understanding of the situation is that exception was taken was there or that he expressed certain views, but that he conveyed the impression that they were the views of the Australian National University.",72,Arthur Eaddeut

188,Dr. Donald Cameron (Oxley,"suggested that. He expressed his own view. Dr. right honourable gentleman interjects, but I happen to know something about the matter. that that was the only matter to which exception was taken. Not only is it a question of academic freedom; members of university staffs also have certain responsibilities. I suggest to the House that we should consider that aspect of the matter too. I am sorry that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has given to the House the impression that positions at the Australian National University are prejudiced because of views that are held by persons who either occupy those positions or seek them. Again, I say that I have some knowledge, and, with respect, perhaps, even more than has the honourable gentleman, about this matter, and I deny that suggestion. I think it would be a great pity if the House were to gain the impression that that is the manner in which the council of the National University manages its affairs. If I may use a stronger word, I say that I think it is deplorable that the name of a very great Australian scientist should have been introduced into this debate in such a way as to suggest that it was for that reason that he severed his long connection with the Australian National University. I should like to assure the honourable gentleUniversity or similar institutions, and man and the House that that was not so. seriously ?

Minister's assertions. now say something about the provisions made under this bill. The bill covers provisions only for the universities of the States; but we should not forget that the Government, in addition to providing, in the terms of this bill, £2,000,000 for the State universities, also provided in the last financial year, under other legislation, £812,000 for the running expenses of the Australian National University and £874,000 for capital expenditure. Therefore, Commonwealth expenditure in a financial year for university education in Australia is very considerable. Although the Australian National University is purely a research institution, we must not get the idea that we can divorce research entirely from the other universities, that we can concentrate it either in the Australian National that it is not necessary to conduct research in the teaching universities By way of illustration, let me refer to the medical schools of tbe teaching universities.

I have no douht, as I have indicated, that it is necessary in relation to the other scientific faculties, and certainly in relation to the humanities as well. Although it has been stated on several occasions during this debate that in this age we can no longer look for benefactions or endowments to the universities from private sources, I should like to support honourable members who have expressed the hope that perhaps we might be able to look to such industries as the pastoral industry or to such organizations as Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited for such benefactions. ""Why should we not be able to attract suitable endowments from such industries? Of course, in a sense, private endowments are still received. That is to be seen in the money that is provided by the various churches for the building of university colleges. Although, perhaps, they are endowments only in the sense that they make a great contribution to university life, the colleges enjoyment of living, and for a fuller, that have been erected are not merely halls of residence. I am sure that any honourable member who has been fortunate enough to pass all or part of his undergraduate life in a. well run university college will agree that, not only were the years he spent there some of the most pleasant and important years of his life, but also that the colleges separately and as a whole have a great impact and make a great contribution towards the corporate life of universities. In the changing society in which we live to-day, there is need for the encouragement of university education. It is hardly necessary to refer to what, has been stated already during this debate about the need for technical education, but I should like to make some reference to what was said by my colleague, the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck), about the mistake of looking at university education as being merely vocational training. It would be a great pity if we were to regard universities in that light. There is, of course, ample scope in them for technical training and for vocational training in the professions. *It is essential that they should provide the best facilities and training, that they should attract the best teachers, that they should attract not only our own graduates but also graduates and teachers from abroad, and that they should be able to maintain a standard of technical training and of general scholarship that not only will attract teachers and lecturers from abroad but will also ensure that we are able to produce graduates of such a calibre that they would be welcome and easily able to obtain positions in universities in other parts of the world. I hope that we shall also keep in mind the fact that universities do not cater only for the scientific professions. . I hope that we shall be ready to provide funds for them as homes of learning and of scholarship for ics own sake, and that we will not adopt the attitude of some persons who ask, ""What is the use of snch and such a faculty? What does it fit one for? What sort of living can one earn after he has taken a degree in it?"" Non-scientific faculties will fit us for a better understanding of life, for a better better and more satisfying life. Even if we are to pursue in our universities some disciplines merely for the sake of the knowledge they contain, for the learning they give us and for the. understanding of the past, and through that of the present, then it will be well worth spending the money which the Commonwealth and the States are providing. There was a time when governments had very little to do with the provision of learning or of scholarship, except perhaps through the patronage of princes. Tliose days have, gone altogether. I like to think that we are carrying on the tradition of that patronage by extending freely-no t in the financial sense as freely as we sbould like, but in other senses quite freely-the funds made available to universities. That is what this bill does. It provides money only for their current expenses, but if. provides quite a large sum. Taken in conjunction with the money provided under another act for the Australian National University, it adds up to quite a great deal for the provision of higher education. I am glad that all of us in this is that this grant is conditional. I am House are able to support the bill. The Opposition applauds this bill insofar the interjections, which he deflected duras it increases the amount payable by ing his speech, concerning grants to the Commonwealth to the State governuniversities being made conditional on the ments for the purposes of their univergood behaviour of the staff of those unisities from a maximum of £1,7,00,000 to versities, and in particular, on condition, a maximum of £2,000,000.

204,"Subject. There Will, Undoubtedly, Be Try ( Mr Mcmahon), As He Now Is, I N","When I criticize the attitude of the Government towards assistance to State universities on the ground that it is too conditional, I refer rather to the fact that ties, is that we should establish a all the grants under this bill are made conditional on the State universities receiving specified sums from State grants and Irom fees. A disturbing feature is that there have been manv cases in the last few years when the universities have not qualified for the maximum grants specified in the act. In other words, they have not been able to consume the carrot -dangled before them. Let me cite some cases. In .1954, the University of Sydney, which was entitled to a maximum grant of £472,000 under the 1953 act, qualified for only £391,000. The University of Melbourne, which could have obtained a maximum grant of £385,000, was able to qualify for a grant of only £360,000. Last year the University of Sydney, which under the 1955 act was eligible for a maximum grant of £493,000, was able to qualify for a grant of only £440,000. The short-fall of the University of Sydney last year of £53,000 could have been made up only if the university had received three times that amount, or £159,000, from State grants and from students' fees. In that regard, it is not inappropriate to point out that the biggest and most populous universities in Australia the Universities of Sydney and Melbournealready receive in students' fees more than the maximum amount they are eligible to receive under this bill, and still more than they were eligible to receive under the acts of 1951, 1953 and 1955. The difficulty of these conditional grants is that the State governments can increase their grants to universities only by decreasing their grants for other purposes. In order to pay Paul they have to rob Peter. In the case of the University of Sydney, with which I am mo3t familiar, and to which I have already made reference, one has only to point out that the Government of New South Wales already spends more a head of population on universities than is spent by any other State except Tasmania, in which State the university, being a small one, costs somewhat more a disadvantage of the Australian unihead of population. The suggestion I make, to remove the spasmodic and conditional character of the Commonwealth's grants to universiuniversities grants committee, such as has operated for many years in the United Kingdom. We already have in Australia a Commonwealth Grants Commission for the purpose of considering the amount of money which the Commonwealth should pay to the three less populous States in our federation, to enable them to provide public services of standards similar to those provided in the three more populous States. The Commonwealth Grants Commission makes an exhaustive inquiry every year and presents a very full report to the Parliament. As far as I know, the Parliament has always adopted its report, and the amount of money involved each year is very many times the £2,000,000 which is the maximum commitment of the Commonwealth under the legislation we are now considering. This measure will become obsolete if the population of the universities increases, and as the salaries and other costs that universities have to meet also increase, as we must expect they will increase within the next year or two. Already one can see that Australian universities receive very much less money a head of population, and are more poorly staffed, than their counterparts in the United Kingdom. I refer to the red-brick or non-residential universities. I said that our universities are comparatively under-staffed. In 1954 and 1955 the University of Sydney had one full-time member of the teaching staff for every 15 full-time students. In the non-residential universities in the United Kingdom, such as Birmingham, Leeds, Bristol, Sheffield, Edinburgh and Glasgow, the population of each of which is less than that of the universities of Sydney or Melbourne, there was an average of one full-time member of the teaching staff to every eight or nine full-time students. The proportion of teachers to students in the United Kingdom was almost twice as great as the proportion in our two largest universities. I am not reflecting in any way to the versities when I make that comparison. It is only just that I should point out that income tax under the present system. They among the ranks of the Government parties the graduates of the universities of Sydney and Melbourne are in the Ministry, and the graduates of Oxford and Cambridge are on the back benches. I do not suggest that every honourable member on the Government back benches is a graduate of Oxford or Cambridge. I do not know from what university the honourable member for Moore( Mr fees in order that we may drink or Leslie), who has been seeking to interject, graduated. From the diversity of his talents and his contributions to the proceedings of this House, I should have thought that he would have been through many campuses in his time. I have said that our universities are comparatively poorly staffed. That is because, as is the case with so much of our capital equipment, we are doing things on the cheap. Seventy-one per cent, of the income of the University of Sydney is spent on the salaries of the staff. To take the same year as that for which I gave the House the proportion of lecturers to students, 1953-54, the average expenditure for each full-time student in the non-residential universities in the United Kingdom was £375 sterling, which is equivalent, I believe, to about £A.469. I have obtained those figures from the returns of the Universities Grants Committee in the United Kingdom for that financial year. In 1954, the average expenditure for each full-time student in the University of Sydney Was £274, which is less than 60 per cent, of the amount spent in the United Kingdom. We are cutting down on the most essential expenditure in a university, which is on the teaching staff, by having too few members of the teaching staff and paying them too little. I have said that the only way in which the States can qualify for the full amount of the grant is by increasing their grants to the universities at the expense of other public services. It is not inap""f actions in the past many of our propriate to point out here, as did the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), that the uniform income tax system and the Australian Loan Council system provide a very real brake or restriction on the expenditure of all the States. The States cannot impose cannot raise loans, except with the consent and through the agency of the Commonwealth. They cannot, under the Constitution, impose excise or customs duties. The easiest way in which Stategovernments, Liberal and Labour alike,, can increase their income is by charging licence-fees if we wish to indulge in our various foibles and by imposing higher gamble without breaking the law. Another shortcoming, as I see it, of our method of helping universities is that our contrbution is being made only for the running expenses. There is nocontribution whatever towards theircapital expenses. We know that in universities to-day, particularly in those faculties which more and more students are seeking to enter, and into which it is in the national interest that more andi more students should go, there should be more elaborate laboratories and better stocked libraries, which can be provider! only with a higher capital expenditure. We are not giving the States sufficient loan funds to provide those services in the universities, and this measure makes, no provision for grants for such purposes. Another shortcoming of this legislation, as I see it, is that it provides no incentive for private benefactors to make grants to universities. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) stated earlier in the debate that it was possible, under this measure, for contributions by benefactors to universities to attract these Commonwealth grants. With great respect to the lionorable gentleman, that is not so. It has never been the case undev the 1951, 1953 and 1955 acts, and it will still not be the case under this measure. If the Minister will look at the definition of "" State grants "" in the bill, he will see that private benefactions do not come within the category. I may point out that but for some of these beneuniversities could not have carried on. I believe that the University of Sydney has an income of about £115,000 from the investment of private gifts. Much of that money, of course, is tied up in the endowment of particular chairs and prizes, and cannot be used for general university purposes. The University of Melbourne no longer go to universities merely for nas an income of £70,000 a year from their own benefit. It is now in the "" similar sources. If it is desirable for us to encourage in the world-bigges t according to benefactions, we should provide that such normal standards-suc h as the United amounts of money as are bestowed Slates, Bussia and now the United Kingprivately on a university should attract dom, are realizing more and more that grants under this bill. It is true, as the the community gains something from Minister for Health (Dr. Donald people going to the universities, because it Cameron) and the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) have said-the is there that tliey obtain the higher techformer having represented us on the nical skills which enable them to develop, Council of the Australian National and conduct the affairs of their country.

People are proceeding through the universities national interest that they should go to the universities, and the biggest countries Government supporters who have most faculties, but they are not in themselves sufficient. With this objective the and, in so doing, are acting in the national interest. The proper way to look after these matters is to appoint some continuing, non-partisan, expert body, such as the Universities Grants Committee of the United Kingdom to make periodic investigations and report to the Parliament. That would provide continuous and consistent grants in place of the present couditional and spasmodic grants to universities. We support this bill because it is an improvement. It is good as far as it goes, but let us hope that in the bill which will be brought down next year, or, if preceding practice is adopted, in the following year at the latest, we will do better. not my intention to cover much of the ground that has been covered by speakers on both sides of the House. It is perhaps unique, especially at this particular time, that there should be such unanimity among honourable members. Of course, a degree of criticism has come from both sides and I think that many of the suggestions put forward warrant serious consideration. When further grants are made to the universities, some of them could well be kept in mind. We have among us my colleague, the honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond), who has made a valuable contribution to education in New South Wales, having been for many years Minister for Education in that State. Another of my colleagues, the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) is the Chancellor of the new University of New England. I am sure that the Government is gratified at the support that this bill has received from both sides of the House. The Acting Prime Minister( Sir Arthur Fadden) concluded his second-reading speech with thes? wordsI commend the bill to honourable members, t am sure that they will wish the Commonwealth to continue its assistance to university of them. In the field of agriculture, education, which is so important for Australia's future. It has been proved conclusively that all members wish the Commonwealth to continue its assistance to university education. vernment upon this bill and upon farms. When we talk of the need for the increased grants being made to the universities. It may be that, some consideration could be given to increasing the amount still further because, to me, £2,000,000 in a budget of approximately £1,000,000,000 seems insufficient to spend upon something that is of such vital importance. Certainly, in the future, the Government might well consider increasing the grants to a very much greater degree. I congratulate the Government upon bringing down the bill because it is apparent that universities are to play an increasingly important role in Australian development. Therefore, the future of Australian universities is the concern of all Australians. The degree of apathy and indifference which so many people display to the need for universities in the community is quite remarkable. That, of course, may be attributable to many factors, to some of which a few people in the universities contribute. This debate should bring home to the people the fact that universities need finance and should not be allowed simply to "" grow u p "" as did Topsy. Universities offer valuable opportunities for research, for the advancement of knowledge, and for the provision of trained and skilled technicians in this modern mechanical age. Comments have been made in this House about the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, and the sums that this Government has made available to it for research purposes. That money cannot be spent unless we provide trained men to carry on the research. We speak today about the atomic age and about nuclear research. Even in the field of defence and in our Air Force; Navy and Army, greater stress is being laid on the technical side and the technical weapons in those individual services. Therr fore, it would be of no value if we had the weapons without the technicians to use them, and to train other men in the use veterinary seience, and farm machinery we have gone beyond the horse-and-buggy days.

205,Mr Lucock (Lyne) [8.55],"It isincreased production, we should remember that we need scientific development in order to achieve increased production. So we find that there ds in our community a growing need for universities. Unfortunately, in so many cases, there is not parallel with that need a full appreciation by the public of that growing need. One thing I would say is that when grants such as this are made they give a degree of certainty to the university. As I said in the opening remarks of my speech, perhaps the amount given could be increased but while there are these grants, there is a degree of certainty and so a degree of continuity within the university itself. I think that the suggestion made by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr individual to make a contribution here. Beazley) with regard to money being given as an endowment to universities should be given serious consideration. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Joske) touched on the matter of teaching and research. I think that he went on to say that we must strike a balance between the teaching side of the university and the research side of the university. That is something well worth considering because if we concentrate on one, we do so to the detriment of the other. The honourable member proceeded to talk about the life of the university and the benefit gained by those who attend universities. We have seen that development in tlie University of New England. That university is outside the metropolitan areas. It has been established in the country and gives greater opportunities to young men and women to attend the university who, in the normal course of events of their lives, might not be able to attend a university and gain the higher educational standards. The effect of correspondence courses is that now men and women in Australia are able to study for certain degrees by correspondence. development will make its contribution to our academic life. I think it should be appreciated that the value of a university is not to be measured merely in academic qualifications. I should like to read the report of the Australian University ViceChancellors Committee on the function of universities. One of the functions of universities was stated in section 4 of that report as follows,:The preservation of our cultural heritage and of our democratic traditions of freedom of thought and speech and the development and exchange of new ideas. Indeed the contribution of the Universities to society should not be reckoned only in terms of the professional proficiency of the graduates tbey produce or of the value of their contributions to research but rather in terms of tlieir part in determining and moulding our way of life. I think that that should be stressed because many people think of university graduates and the value of having university graduates in terms of academic qualifications. We have seen in this House proof of the fact that academic qualifications do not necessarily fit an A man may have a brilliant academic record and yet fail to make a vital contribution because he tries to be clever, tries to score a point, is sarcastic or stresses his intellectual qualities compared with those of some one.else who may not have had the same educational opportunities. I think we should realize that the words that I have quoted are quite true. The contribution of the universities to the life of the nation is not merely in academic achievement but in the training of men and women to play their part in the community life of the Commonwealth in which they live. I should like to make one comment on the remarks made by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) and the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) in regard to freedom of expression. I think that every honourable member will agree that there should be no interference in the expression of thought by the leaders of our universities. But while we say that, we should also say that the leaders of our universities should be most careful when they make a statement on a particular subject, par. I believe that that ticularly if that subject has a political flavour. Whether the view is justified or not, a university professor or iecturer, is looked upon by the rest of the community as a person of some learning and knowledge and of some standing; therefore, the average person, if I may use that hackneyed phrase, will take morenotice of the statements made by such a person than he would if they had been made by some one with not quite the same qualifications. Therefore, I believe that while we sbould stress continually the freedom of thought in universities which bas been part of our Australian way of life and of tbe British way of life, we should agree that with freedom must go the realization of a greater degree of responsibility by the leaders in our university life. I congratulate the Grovernment on the presentation of this bill and hope that, in future future. It is of especial importance thai years, further consideration will be given to the suggestions made by honorabkmembers on both sides of the House in this debate. gather from the comments of the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock) that apparently he has not come to the same conclusion as the many speakers on this subject of university education, university training .and the philosophy that comes from liigher education. The question of the final responsibility <«!' the academic mind to the community is aot measured by Avhether you like it or not; and it was rather astonishing to hear the honourable member for Lyne refer to the fact that university leaders should be careful of their statements. I think that any man of authority and knowledge should be not careful of his statements, but should be courageous in his statements, and the people should be careful as to the conclusions that they draw from those statements. In the circumstances, the freedom -of the informed mind to inform in turn the community is largely challenged by statements such as that made by the honourable member for Lyne. That permeates so much of the thinking on the -Government's side which has been made evident during the past year when men of letters, professors and others, time after time, have been challenged simply because they have not got what is regarded as the right political line. That has nothing to do with the matter at all. If there is any merit in their training and .study and in the university system at all and in the democratic acceptance by the community of men who group together to think-and that was the original concept of a university-the n the Government and members such as the honourable member for Lyne must be crassly wrong in their whole attitude. But at this late hour and at this time of the session I do not intend to develop that theory, or my attitude towards it. 1 have something to discuss which is a-lot more important and down to earth. L is the subject on which the lionorable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) touched in regard to the studies in universities and what will be taken up in we at this stage should give some support to Australian literature and to a Chair for Australian literature in our Australian universities. The Leader of the Opposition, referring to our responsibili[9.8]I ties and our rights under section 96, which have been now established by contested cases in the courts, indicated how much and how usefully we can assist, either by means of payment for services by establisliment, or otherwise, in regard to this fund. In New South ""Wales, without waiting for a government to do anything, and without waiting for the university to initiate anything, a body of men has clubbed together, held meetings, and begun a university fund, which now stands at about £12,000. The Leader of the Opposition was one of the speakers at the inaugural meeting at which the scheme was launched to raise, by self-help, the sum of £80,000 for the establishment of a chair for the study of Australian literature and letters in the University of Sydney. It is hoped that then, first the Federal Government, and later the State government, will come to the assistance of all the universities in establishing a chair for Australian literature. We have heard much to-day about what studies should be pursued and how far technological study should be taken at the university, how far the university should be a plush-lined avenue through which a man may get a job on the strength of the letters he may add to his name, as a dentist, a lawyer, a doctor, or in some other profession, and how far the university provides a philosophical course of study, so that a man may think and know and remain democratic and informed.",80,Donald Cameron Th E Tion Dr Evatt To Interrupt Like That
206,Mr Haylen (Parkes),"But there is a wiaer and laiger call which must be answered now or forgotten altogether, and that is for the establishment of a chair of our own basic literature, which during the last century has been developed and written and is now deserving of wider exploration and explanation. Nobody suggests that a chair of Australian literature will at once produce geniuses, as £100,000 or £200,000 expended on a legal medical school will produce geniuses immediately in the courts and the operating theatres. After the cold, hard, and long study of literature is over, it still remains for the man who completes that study to make his own mark and his own contribution to Australian literature, which is the greatest and hardest taskmaster of all. But surely at this stage, when we are celebrating tlie centenary of the establishment of responsible government in New South Wales, and when we have had various celebrations to mark the centenary of tbe establishment of our universities, there is a vacuum in the whole of the Australian approach to our own culture and 'the tmiversal culture that we seek, in that we have not any truly representative chair to further the study of our own literature. It is not a matter of some quick and easy way of providing degree courses in literation for young people. It will be in many ways a research chair. Great difficulties will be faced in obtaining a suitable professor to occupy it, but surely now is the time to do something about its establishment. Section 96 of the Constitution is the medium whereby this Parliament can be of assistance, but we can go further: we can broaden the scope of the literary f nnd. The Commonwealth Literary Fund to-day is a. poor thing. Awards from thc fund depend upon whether the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) likes a writer or not. It has been a tragedy. I belonged to the advisory board, but I was not a member of the administrative committee, and I fled from my post in despair. The conclusions that the committee has reached and the bureaucracy by which it has surrounded itself are not only astonishing but frightening, and if the same sort of thing takes place in relation to the Council of the Australian National University as has taken place in regard to the Commonwealth Literary Fund all I can say is, "" God help the Australian National University"". As an ordinary member of the advisory board of the Commonwealth Literary Fund, I experienced many frustrations. Honourable members would rise in this House and say that such and such a writer who was receiving a grant was a Communist, a leftist, or something or other, or that he wore the wrong sort of hat or came from the wrong country. Such considerations are all completely absurd in the realm of literature, and everybody who knows anything about literature would be shocked at the conclusions arrived at by the committee. The worse offenders in this regard, of course, were the members of the splinter group which belonged to this side of the House but which is now happily absent from our midst. In making a special grant for Australian literature and in establishing a chair of Australian literature, we ought to be proud. We ought not to be so precious in our discussion of university education as somehonorable members have demonstrated themselves to be in the speeches we have heard. If we can produce something which is unique in our own right, a chair for the study of our own literature, after an existence of less than 200 years in this country, we shall have done very well for ourselves. Let us study the works of the writers Henry Lawson, Christopher Brennan-tha i neglected, corii ; ;i ting genius of Australian letters, who in any other country would be amongst the immortals-C . J. Dennis. Kendall, and Henry Handel Richardson, aud our poets Banjo Paterson and Ogilvie, and let consider the spirit that prompted them to become the literary giants of our time. There is a tendency to debunk Paterson and Ogilvie, because theirs was. of the rural and primitive type of poetry in their age, but they belonged essentially to their century, and we should be careful that we, too, belong to our century. We have to make an analysis and a study, through the universities and the scholarships available to us, of these sources of national, and indeed international, aspiration. We should know what makes the Hungerfords, tl-e Darcy Nila.nds, and a hundred and one other successful writers of this country to-day, and we should -observe how there has been a change from the frontier writer, of whom the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) spoke, to the more sophisticated writer -of to-day. We talk of development of the universities and money for study, accombenefit, but his children, too. We need modation, and research, but I submit to the House that the real, crying need at this moment is for money for the establishment of a chair of Australian literadestiny. There is a fine backlog of Austure, and the Federal Government, with its limited powers, which are gathered together under section 96, could be of assistance in the struggle that is taking country what really makes the country place outside to this end. The right honourable member for Barton, the leader of our party, Dr. Eris O'Brien, and many distinguished men of letters, were proud to be in Sydney a few weeks ago to inaugurate this drive amongst the people to create the desire to study at the university our Australian literature and to create a chair in the mother university of Australia, the Sydney University. We should go further and not depend entirely on our powers under section 96 and on allocation of some of the taxpayers' money. Many people made a lot of money prior to and during the war, and I believe that they should be told that, as their wealth is immense, they should emulate the example of other wealthy persons and give of their wealth for this splendid purpose. I am sure that many of them have not even dreamed of such a noble act. We remember that in the past universities have been endowed by this famous individual, that scholar, or this lover of the arts. To-day, the situation is entirely different. This is not only a matter for individuals. Great corporations in this country have the requisite finance to enable thein to help. farious literature of the world, except They have millions of pounds at their disposal. Such corporations have endowed many universities and faculties in the United States of America. The thinking of our great industrialists should be directed to the fact that the joh that they can do to help .Australian universities and Australian education is only just beginning. I sit down on this note a sharp note. and placid note. The establishment of a chair of Australian literature in all our universities would benefit not only the honourable member who interjected, who I am sure would be susceptible of not be so Fecksniffian about this subject. We shall feel proud in the long run if we can force ourselves to accept our tralian literature that requires investigation. One may learn from what has been written over the years about this tick. An investigation of French literature gives the key to the French way of life and French thought. Everybody today faces the fact that it was the slow and steady stream of Russian literature that eventually brought about the Russian revolution, because it was writing on a national theme. We must investigate our own literature to ascertain the central theme and the pulse of our country's thought. It is not to be found in the daily newspapers, or even in Hansard. It is found in the slow writing out qf the thoughts of men in the literature of our country. For that reason, it is imperative that we should establish chairs of Australian literature in our universities. We should be business like in this matter. We should take advantage of the provisions of section 96 of the Australian Constitution to broaden our fund of literature, as I have mentioned before, by providing scholarships to encourage the writer who is held back by nothing so much as the peculiar circumstance of being Australian. Because he lives in a community of fewer than 30,000,000 people, the vast and multifor the classics, comes to him almost in syndicated form. He needs a unique kind of protection for that very reason. We must assist our own publishers. If we are genuine in our love of Australian literature and of the Australian way of life, many magnificent books about our aborigines, our customs, and our early days of exploration, which are not in themselves best sellers, must eventually find places on our bookshelves. Our literature must be encouraged through that initial development by literary",82,Donald Cameron Th E Tion Dr Evatt To Interrupt Like That

209,Mr James (Hunter) [9.25],"Ihe admired the schools here. He compared them with the schools generally found in the States, which he said seemed like military barracks by comparison with the Canberra schools, and were hardly an encouragement to children to go to school longer than they were compelled to do. The same remarks could be applied to the universities. The State universities seem almost like military barracks in comparison with the Australian National University in Canberra. If 'the whole nation benefits from the education of our citizens, why should not the National Government give more money to the States for education? At the present time owing to the lack of funds the States find it very difficult to discharge their responsibilties in the field of education. The States cannot afford to replace the old military barrack-style of buildings and build something more congenial and comfortable. They have to appeal to the Commonwealth from time to time for assistance, because the Commonwealth has the money and all the other resources that are necessary to provide the opportunities for a higher standard of education. I have no definite support for my opinion, but I think the States would willingly hand over the field of education to the Commonwealth if it were willing to accept responsibilty for it. Why should not the Commonwealth take over responsibility for all education in this counlished university hostels, at which try? After-all, education is fundamental to the development of a nation in this atomic age. people engaged in developing and exploding atomic weapons. Press reports have put the wind up some of us because, apparently, a radio-active cloud, caused by the recent explosion of an atomic bomb at the Monte Bello Islands, is drifting over the mainland of Australia. If we had people well versed in weather forecasting, in all probability they would have foreseen, before the bomb was exploded, the change of the weather that occurred immediately afterwards. The Acting Prime Minister( Sir Arthur Padden) has said that we have nothing to fear from this radio-active cloud, but I know that I should be fearful if I were living at Wyndham or any of the places nearby. However, I am not at Wyndham; I am here. I plead with the Government to take action to enable the children of coalminers to receive higher education. There is a great deal of talent in the coal-mining community, including a male voice choir of miners which won for three years in succession the Australian singing championships, if I may so call them, held at Ballarat. When the coal-miners strike, either to obtain improvements of their working conditions or to resist attempts to take something from them, they are condemned; but when a war occurs and, in order to maintain coal production, miners have to be prevented from enlisting in the forces, we find that, after all, they are not bad fellows. Why not give to the sons and daughters of miners an opportunity for a higher standard of education? If I had continued to work in the coal-mines, instead of breaking into Parliament, so to speak, I could not have afforded to give my sons who won scholarships, the education that they have received. I ask the Government to negotiate with the States with a view to taking over, lock, stock and barrel, the responsibility for education in this country. Biit for my eldest sister, I shoidd not have been able to afford to keep my sons at a university I pay tribute to her now. She is still alive, at the age of 89 years. I suggest that at each university there be estabstudents could board much more cheaply than elsewhere. My sons were lucky At Woomera, there are enough to win scholarships which entitled them to free university education, but, if my sister had not given them free board and lodging, I should have been unable to keep them at the university. I appeal to the Government to do something to assist the poorer people in relation to education. Honourable members opposite say that they are Liberals. If they are liberal minded, let them act liberally to the poorer people. Let them give to those people an opportunity to educate their sons and daughters to a high standard. There are many talented young people in coal-mining districts who would benefit from university courses, but whose parents cannot afford to pay for a university education. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. Debate resumed from the Sth June (vide page 3001), on motion by Mr ing capacity to manufacture at least Thnt the bill be now read a second time. a bill to amend the Tractor Bounty Act 1939-1953. It is of profound interest to Australia, because tractors are of prime importance to our primary industries. T have always had considerable personal interest in tractors. I operated one of the first dozen internal combustion engine tractors to be brought to Australia. It was a huge, single-cylinder machine. It was used for threshing and for driving straw presses, contract presses and chaffcutters. I remember that on one occasion I used that great monster of a tractor to pull an eight-furrow plough on the plains of Werribee. That was away back in 1913, or thereabouts. I am still personally interested in tractors, and I still operate them. I have watched their evolution from 1913 onwards. With that background, and as one who is very interested in the development of Australia's secondary industries, naturally I am deeply concerned because, in this measure, the Government has not done the right thing. Por many years, the Australian tractor manufacturing industry has been assisted by bounty and by other means. At the present time, it is being assisted by bounty under the terms of legislation enacted in, I think, 1952. The Tariff BoardI admit frankly that this Parliament is not bound to accept the recommendations of that body, but almost invariably it does accept them-mad e a thorough investigation to determine the degree of assistance necessary to stimulate the production of tractors by Australian manufacturers. On the conclusion of the investigation, the board submitted a report to the Parliament. By no stretch of the imagination could it be alleged that the, investigation by the board was not extremely thorough. The investigation was made as the result of a submission by manufacturers that the bounty was quite inadequate to stimulate the production of tractors in Australia. After all, how important it all is! Our tractor requirements are in the vicinity of 20,000 a year. Of that number, approximately 3,500 are now manufactured in Australia, and the balance is imported. We have an exist6,000 tractors a year, and, without a doubt, if the essential measure of protection were given to the industry, we could very easily increase our manufacturing capacity to 12,000 or 15,000 tractors. I am staggered to realize that there are some influences at work on this Government; that in this case, a most exceptional instance, the Government has seen fit, despite the very thorough investigation by the Tariff Board, to turn down the board's most emphatic recommendation. The Government brings this bill into the Parliament with the intention of re-enacting, practically in their entirety, the provisions for the existing measure of assistance, or alleged assistance, to the industry by way of bounty. I have said that our capacity to manufacture tractors is about 6,000 compared with our annual requirements of about 20,000 annually. I should say that one of the reasons that prompted the Tariff Board to recommend the imposition of a tariff on tractors, in addition to the bounty paid on tractors manufactured in Australia, was the fact that unless something definite is done in the way of assistance to the tractor industry there is no possibility of that industry being able, in any appreciable time, to increase its output to any great degree. If the industry is unable to develop itself in that way within a reasonable time, then it has no decent prospect-and this is pointed out in the Tariff Board's report -of being able to reduce its cost of production and, unaided, to turn out tractors in competition with imported tractors. By"" unaided "" I mean free of bounty and possibly free of tariff protection. That is the irony of it. I want to emphasize to this Parliament the fact that in recent days we have had before us bounty proposals to assist the acetate flake industry conducted by Colonial Sugar Refinering Company Limited, and to assist the cellulose rayon",85,Donald Cameron Th E Tion Dr Evatt To Interrupt Like That
210,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [9.36],"This isindustry conducted by a very large firm with an ample supply of capital at its disposal. In both instances the GovernmentI do not know why-despit e the fact that the manufacturers of both these products are concerns with huge aggregations of capital behind them, has seen fit to do two things. Pirst, it saw fit to give those concerns bounty assistance and, secondly, it saw fit to bring down a proposal, which will be debated at some time in the future, to give them tariff protection in addition to bounty assistance. The third factor is that the Government has provided in its bounty proposals to allow the firms -to draw bounty, as well as to have the advantage of tariff protection, so long as the profits on their capital do not exceed 10 per cent. If they exceed 10 per cent, the bounty assistance is withdrawn. But in the case of the tractor industry, what do we find? The Government gives the industry the benefit of bounty assistance, but refuses it the advantage of tariff protection. It is a small and struggling Australian industry which very greatly needs assistance; but all that the Government can do for it is to give it bounty assistance and no tariff protection. In addition-and mark this!-it has provided that the bounty shall cease if the profit on capital exceeds 5 per cent. ""Why does the Government on the one hand give, without hesitation, to two very wealthy concerns with immense aggregations of capital at their dispos.il both bounty assistance and tariff protection, with a provision that the bounty assistance will not cease until profits on capital exceed 10 per cent, and on the other hand adopt a very different attitude to a small struggling industry which needs protection? in my second-reading speech. that the answer was given in his second reading speech! I sliall deal later with the answer given. In the case of the Australian tractor industry-and the best sector of it at that-the Government not only refuses tariff protection, despite the recommendation of the Tariff Board, excuse given by the Government in conbut also provides that bounty assistance nexion with this matter. shall not be given when profit on capital used by firms in the industry exceeds It is a reason. 5 per cent. Did anybody ever hear of such discriminatory action? The Australian tractor industry is not only a worthy industry, but is also an essential industry. It would appear to me that the influence of the people in the corner, the members of the Australian Country party, was imposed on the Government. It does not necessarily follow that tariff protection for the tractor industry would lead to an increase of the price of tractors which are bought by primary producers. ber for Moore( Mr Leslie), the apologist for the Australian Country party, says that it would. If tariff protection for the tractor industry would lead to an increase in the price of tractors, then surely tariff protection in respect of acetate flake and cellulose yarn would mean that higher prices would have to be paid by the users of those commodities. I suggest to the honourable member for Moore that, nothwithstanding the fact that it may be true that, owing to the negligence of this Government, primary producers are finding great difficulty in competing with other exporting countries because of keen prices on the world's markets, it is also true that they are in a reasonably sound position and could possibly afford to carry whatever slight increase of the price of tractors might result from additional tariff protection. The honourable member for Moore shakes his head, but the fact is that experience, has shown that when tariff protection has been granted to enable the Australian industry to compete with the imported product, there has never been any necessity to increase prices to the Australian users, for the very simple reason that almost immediately the tariff protection has been granted the importers have reduced their prices. That is ancient history, and it is a common occurrence when tariff protection is given. Now let us examine the plausible",87,Osborne

The Minister for Customs and Excise said in his speechFurthermore, the Government cannot conaider raising the profit limitation from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent, at this juncture. The Government agrees that 10 per cent, is not, nnder normal circumstances, an unreasonable level stances. tell me what abnormal circumstances are ? I suppose the Minister would regard as "" abnormal circumstances "" the fact that in Western Australia there is a very efficient tractor-manufacturing concern turning out what, in my opinion, is, in its class, probably the best and sturdiest tractor produced anywhere in the world. I saw this firm's tractors under test f o ur or five years ago. with the honourable member about that firm's product. The honourable member for Moore is in entire agreement w i th me, yet he is supporting the Government's refusal to give tariff protection to the Australian tractor industry. The company in Western Australia to which I have referred is hamstrung and embarrassed by the fact that, because Western Australia is a small demand State, 60 per cent, of its tractors have to be exported to the eastern States. Some are, perhaps, exported to the islands. Surely a firm of that kind which, if given tariff protection, could double its output and even then meet the disability of freight on its exports to the eastern States, is entitled to some consideration. In addition, behind the protection of a tariff barrier, it would be able to overcome the disability under which it now labours of not being able to afford the advertising on by firms that have American capital. Because of an imaginary temporary disadvantage to a few primary producers, [137] the honourable member for Moore( Mr. Leslie) is not prepared to agree that, in the interests of Australia and particularly of Western Australia, the report of the Tariff Board should be accepted. the bounty? second-reading stated by the T a r if l Board to be ineffective as a means of assisting the tractor manufacturing industry, and that is the very reason why there was an additional inquiry by the Tariff Board. TheT a r i ff Board laid particular stress on this fact. Let me quote its conclusions. It statedIf means are found to increase the volume W ill the Minister of output of some sizes of locally produced diesel-powered tractors And Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited make such tractorsfor which engines are now imported That is another factorthis may lead ultimately to one of the overseas manufacturers of diesel engines establishing a plant in Australia.

In other words, a bounty does not solve the problem. As everybody knows, the T a r i ff Board is not eager to increase duties if increased duties can be avoided. The Tariff Board said furtherContinuation of the present method of assistance-wholl y by bounty-wil l leave the industry very much where it is at present. The weaker unit will continue to struggle on a hand to mouth basis, and there will be no encouragement for new capital investment in the enterprise. Much weaker cases presented by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, the acetate flake manufacturing company and Courtauld's, the manufacturers of rayon filament, have the scale that is indulged in resulted in those organizations obtaining not only a bounty but also protection in the form of the right to earn 10 per cent, on their capital before the",88,Osborne

If the Minister knows anything about mechanics or engineering, I invite him to inspect one of these tractors. This small but admittedly efficient concern is to be denied the tariff protection that was recommended by the Tariff Board. The sinister influences behind the scenes are, or could be, the great importing tractor concerns and some of the great American tractor concerns already manufacturing here. They are the sinister influences and they probably influenced the Ministry against adopting the recommendations of the Tariff Board. The Tariff Board recommended(1 ) That the existing scale of bounty under the Tractor Bounty Act 1939-1953 for tractors over 10 but not exceeding 55 m.b.p.h.p. he conin accordance wit h Australia's international tinued for a further period of three years from the 24th October, 1955. (2) Tbat the Tractor Bounty Act 1939-1953 be amended to provide for payment of bounty on tractors exceeding 55 m.b.p.h.p., when fitted Bounty Act. with an imported engine, of £200 per tractor. That bas been rubbed right out. Here is a recommendation based on the responsible opinion of the Tariff Board that the Western Australian industry, desirous of fitting tractors of 55 horse-power, which is the limit for which bounty is paid or protection given, with engines of 75 or 80 horse-power, should be given assistance to the extent of £200 for each tractor. The Government has refused tariff protection and, in addition has refused to concede the bounty of £200 for each tractor to the Western Australian firm if it produces a tractor incorporating a 75 or 80 horse-power engine. further(3) That, subject to proper safeguards, hounty payment be made on tractors exported for use in Australian-controlled territories. The Government point(4) Tbat section 9 of thc Tractor Bounty Act 1939-1953 be amended by substituting a rate of not less than 10 per cent, in lieu of the 5 per cent., therein. That is the profit limit. The board recommended an allowance of 10 per cent, profit, but that is refused. The Colonial Sugar Eefining Company Limited, Courtaulds (Australia) Limited and all the rest of them are allowed to make a profit of 10 per cent, before the bounty is eliminated or even partially reduced. What is the reason for this discrimination against the State of Western Australia and a firm turning out a first-class product? There has been no criticism by the Tariff Board of the efficiency of the industry. The only suggestion is that the volume of production of the company is too small and that other disadvantages under which it is labouring are hindering it. Those disadvantages can be overcome if the company is given the opportunity to produce in volume and is protected from imports. The Tariff Board also recommended(5) That a duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem under the British Preferential Tariff be imposed on all imported tractors exceeding 30 m.b.p.h.p. and that rates other than those under the British Preferential Tariff be fixed commitments. (G) Tbat the matter of assistance to the production of tractors in Australia be reviewed before the expiration of the amended Tractor The board then made certain recommendations about crawler type tractors. I do not think that anybody is particularly concerned about those recommendations at this juncture. Will the Minister explain this discrimination? explain why a 10 per cent, profit should be allowed to the fattest concerns in Australia. He did not explain why the little concerns-particularl y Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited-shoul d be tied down to a profit of 5 per cent., in spite of the recommendations of the Tariff The board recommended Board. What is the reason for this wicked discrimination? It is not mandatory for a government to accept the recommendations of tariff boards, but this is the only instance of which I know in the last six has conceded that or seven years where discrimination has been shown against a small firm and the Government has refused to accept the recommendation of the Tariff Board. I suppose the Minister will tell us that the adoption of the recommendations might have had an adverse effect on primary producers and on primary production. If every industry in Australia had been",90,Osborne
231,Mr Osbokne,I did.,91,Osborne
232,Mr Pollaed,"The Minister did noidependent upon that excuse, it would not have been able to continue. That excuse has been made by members of the Australian Country party who are the direct representatives of primary producers in regard to every industry that was ever granted tariff protection. Traditionally the Australian Country party is a free-trade party. Representatives of their organizations or of industrial organizations such as farmers' unions, wheat growers' unions and so on, attend all tariff a disgrace. It is a penalization of a board inquiries that involve any article that may increase the cost of primary production. They express their opposition to the raising of a protective barrier to enable secondary industry, so necessary to the protection and development of this great country, to be established firmly on a sound basis. That is the innuence that in this case-and for the first time since this Government came to office-ha s been responsible for the refusal to accept the recommendation of a very efficient tariff board. I could understand the attitude of the Government if the report had said that the tractor industry in Western Australia was a struggling, hopeless industry; that its product was not a good product; that it had no possible chance of surviving; and that it would be a waste of time to encourage it and to inflict upon the primary producers some additional cost for tractors. But this report does not reflect in any way on Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited or any of the people who are now manufacturing tractors or propose to manufacture them in the future. This is a matter that, in reality, ought to be referred back to the Tariff Board immediately for further investigation and consideration so that the Government can see whether it will stick to its present recommendation or whether it will withdraw it, eat humble pie and advance some reason why the industry should not be protected. I know that it will not do that. I suggest to the Minister that if he is not prepared to reconsider his attitude, withdraw the bill and promise some tariff protection, say, during the next session of Parliament, then he should at least give a promise that he will ensure that within at least six months this matter shall again te be referred to the Tariff Board. The board has suggested that the matter be reviewed before the expiration of the present period of three years' protection or three years' bounty recommended in the report. I am sure that, in regard to tariff protection, bounties and any other activities of this Government since it came to office, this is the most flagrant and most wicked discrimination, and it reeks of corruption or, at best, of favouritism. It is segment of Australian industry simply because it may have some unfortunate repercussion on the cost of primary pro duction. However, the Government does not say, when it introduces tariff protection for any other industry, ""We will not impose tariff protection on this industry or that industry because it may have some serious repercussion on the pockets of industrial workers by virtue of the fact that it increases the cost of materials for their homes, their small factories and their industries "". There is not a word about that. Is there any reason why a manufacturer, who is admittedly efficient, should be deprived of that which is given to other segments of industry simply because his product goes directly to the farmers 1 The farming community in this country has been treated reasonably generously by most administrations. For this Government to yield on this issue to that section of its Ministry that consists of representatives of the Australian Country party is the most cowardly and unjust thing I have seen since this Government came to office. I shall say no more on this matter. I hope that what I have said will receive consideration hy the Minister, and that it will be endorsed and supported by honourable members from Western Australia, although they represent another party. I hope that even at this late stage some wise counsel will prevail, and that the Government will do the right and decent thing to the tractor industry that is now struggling to establish itself in Australia on a basis that will enable it eventually to stand unaided.",91,Osborne
233,Mr Tubnbtjll,That is a big thing.,92,Osborne
234,Mr Pollard,"It is a big thing.am eager to speak in support of this bill, because it concerns a Western Australian industry that is making a valuable contribution to industrial development throughout our nation. Also, it is an industry that provides employment for quite a large number of individuals. The enterprise that benefits from the proterritories. The next point that is visions of this legislation is located in my own electorate, and I can, therefore, claim to know personally of its value. I propose to deal with the purpose of the bill, then with the firm of Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited, which will benefit from the provisions of the bill, and then to point out in conclusion that while the assistance that is to be granted is logical and fully warranted, there are several anomalies in this legispower rating above 35 horse-power. The lation that I feel should be corrected. At this stage, however, I feel that I should say a word or two about the contribution made to this debate by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Australia by the International Harvester Pollard). It is good to be in agreement with the honourable member, at least on some aspects of the matter, on this occasion. In other debates I have appeared always to be diametrically opposed to him. I thank him for emphasizing that this bounty bill is of pro1949, at which time the only tractor being found importance. He linked this bill with primary production. He also referred to the very thorough investigation made by the Tariff Board. AgainI entirely agree with him, and later I wish to deal in some detail with the report of the Tariff Board. Of course, I cannot agree with the honourable member for Lalor when he refers inaccurately to Western Australia as the little State. My colleague, the honourable memher for Moore( Mr Leslie) and I would remind the House with some enthusiasm that Western Australia is a vast territory with an immense potential, the development of which is now being vigorously undertaken. It will be difficult indeed for the nation to measure the contribution, and ti»e layout of the factory, and the that Western Australia will make in the future to our national development. I turn now to the purpose of the bill. I remind the House that it provides for an extension of the Tractor Bounty Aet 1939-1953. The Minister said, in his second reading speech, that the bounty payment on tractor production by Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited will be renewed, that that bounty will be subjected to a profit limitation of 5 per cent., and that, for the first time, the bounty will be payable on sales of tractors by this company to Australian revealed in the Minister's speech is that the bounty is restricted to tractors rated at not more than 55 horse-power. Finally, as the honourable member for Lalor has mentioned, no protective duty in the interests of Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited is to be applied to tractors imported by other companies. Only two manufacturers in Australia produce tractors, including engines, of a smaller company is Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited, to which I have referred, while the larger, which seeks and receives no bounty assistance, is a world-wide organization, represented in Company of Australia Proprietary Limited. Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited was first established in 1947, and it went into production effectively in manufactured was a kerosene model. It made only kerosene tractors until 1955, when it produced its first diesel tractor, the Chamberlain 55DA. This was the first all-Australian diesel tractor. In 1952, when tractor sales suffered a recession, the company commenced to manufacture implements. The main implements made were the 14 and 18 disc ploughs, and the 20 and 24 type scarifiers. In 1952, the Tariff Board visited the plant at Welshpool in Western Australia, and it was quite evident from its report that the board did not consider that the industry at that time was efficiently organized and controlled. However, since then many alterations have been made, both in the management industry is far better equipped in 1956 than it was in 1952. It is interesting to note that the same members of the Tariff Board revisited the plant at Welshpool in February of this vear, at which time, of course, the Tariff Board report that we",92,Osborne
235,Mr Cleaver (Swan) [10.10],"I have been considering bad been compiled and submitted. I am quite satisfied that tbe members of the Tariff Board were far more impressed in February of this year than they were when they first reported cn the industry in 1952. At the present time Chamberlain present, namely 1,500 tractors per annum, Industries Proprietary Limited has about should be achieved with little difficulty. £8,000,000 worth of plant in the field, spread throughout Australia, and I think it can be claimed that all of this plant is being efficiently serviced by the organizaAt page 9 the report statestion.

W it h great difficulty it survived, and it has now of import restrictions, but it is a reasonable conclusion that it has emerged from If this company were the only manufacturer ance under this bill is both logical and f u l l y warranted. I am personally i m pressed with the consideration given by the T a r i ff Board to efficiency in production and general organization. On page 8 of the board's report there is a summary of the action taken by the Chamberlain company to achieve production efficiency. It readsI t was stated on .behalf of Chamberlain Induscries Pty. Ltd. that the company has taken 4teps to reduce its coBts of production and to overcome the disability of location through being so far away from the main market for its products. As the honourable member for Lalor mentioned, more than 60 per cent, of the company's sales are made in the eastern States. The company's plans for its new medium-type tractor provide for assembly operations to be performed in the eastern States and for the utilization, to a greater extent than in the past, of the facilities provided by outside manufacturers specializing in the production of components. These components would be shipped direct to assembly points, wherever located, instead of, as at present, being shipped to Western Australia, with attendant transport costs, assembled in the Welshpool plant, and then transported back to the east where 60 per cent, of the sales take place. The advantage of this method lies in the saving made in high interstate transport charges on both the components and the finished product. The report states furtherTlie company has taken steps to obtain modern precision machinery for use in the production of tlie new model medium tractor. It has also installed centrifugal casting machines to enable castings to be used in place of some costly forgings. It was claimed that the introduction of this improved equipment could ultimately result in a production output of 5,000 tractors per annum of the medium type within three years. The increased production if achieved in conjunction with the anticipated output of heavy type tractors -houki result in lower production costs. The board was, therefore, faced with a problem. Its policy is not to recommend assistance to an industry that is not reasonably efiicient. All members of this Parliament should support the Tariff Boardi n that attitude. On the one hand, tliere is a large manufacturer supplying the bulk of Australian production, and apparently making satisfactory tion would result in increased costs to profits without any assistance. The fact that it is able to do this is worthy of commendation. I suggest that it is a tribute to its efiiciency. On the other hand, there is a small manufacturing concern which is just emerging from a period of great difficulty. It is definitely in need of assistance, and apparently not as efficient-to be quite fair-as its larger competitor. Nor would we expect it to be as efiicient as a world-wide organization. Chamberlain Industrie? Proprietary Limited is a new and struggling concern, but one which is growing more efficient day by day. Because one manufacturer with a large share of the market can continue without assistance, should the other manufacturer be deprived of assistance on the ground that his undertaking is inefficient? 1 should like to quote again from the Tariff Boardreport on the subject. It readsThe Board does not interpret its requirement of efficiency in the sense that every industry seeking protection should have the high standard set by a large world-wide organizationThere are few industries in Australia that would qualify for protection or assistance under such an interpretation. And while it is comforting to know that there is in Australia an engineering industry capable of producing an intricate piece of machinery without, protection or assistance-a n industry setting a standard for otlier industries-the Board takes the sensible view that an industry or a unit of an industry is not necessarily inefficient because it fails to reach that high standard. Hence without departing from itideclared policy the Board is not prepared to refuse to recommend assistance to the tractor industry on the ground that the small section requiring assistance is inefficient. Having quoted that, I come now to a consideration of the fact that many people find bounty payments objectionable. However, not withstanding one's attitude to bounty payments, I submit that it would be illogical, and a bad economy, to cut off assistance by way of bounty to an enterprise which has overcome very great initia l difficulties, is now producing a tractor that is very acceptable to the farming community, and appears to have at last reached the stage of profitable production. Some take the view that duty protecthe primary producer. This was certainly not in the mind of the Tariff Board, which recommended a protective duty in addition to the payment of the bounty. The board expressed its conviction in these wordsThat the form of assistance in the future the company for which this bill is should be one of bounty-cum-duty, with the bounty element decreasing and the duty element increasing as circumstances from time to time necessitate. It seems to me that the Government, in deciding to avoid any risk of increasing costs in key export industries by rejecting the recommendation of the Tariff Board, should have been consistent and realistic and amended the approved bounty by adding an appropriate amount to offset the duty protection. The second point that I want to emphasize is that covered by the honourable member for Lalor. The exclusion of bounty payments of £200 a tractor on tractors between 55 and 80 horse-power is difficult to follow. The Tariff Board recommendation was quite clear that the bounty should be payable on tractors within this category. The report emphasizes that the multi-cylinder diesel engines which are imported for these larger tractors are subject to a 10 per cent, ad valorem duty, whereas a competitive tractor of United Kingdom origin is free from duty. My thought is that bounty to offset this duty would represent a sound and sensible incentive to the manufacturer. producers are eagerly seeking larger horsepower tractors in the interest of cost reduction and economy. With my little understanding of farming operations, I think I may say that the larger implement or several implements can often be used with the extra-powered tractor. I believe that in Queensland and Western Australia the general trend is towards the larger-sized tractor. I have obtained from the company concerned some helpful observations in this connection. They feel that their 70DA tractor was produced to fulfil an insistent demand by the largest farmers for a highpowered tractor capable of doing maximum work with minimum of labour, thereby reducing their production costs. regard this bill as another example of the This tractor, which is normally equipped inability of the Government, on essential with twin rear wheels, has proved to be much cheaper in heavy operation than many crawler type tractors. It has a gross weight of 10,000 lb. and will. pull approximately 8,000 lb at the draw bar. It is extremely important, not only to designed but, I think, to the Australian farmer, that assistance be given by way of bounty or protection with regard to those tractors which exceed 55 horsepower. It is quite apparent from a reading of the Tariff Board report at page 11 that the "" mark u p "" on the landed costs of imported tractors for which there is no competition from Australian-made machines is higher than the ""mark u p "" on landed costs for tractors where equivalent models, by way of horse-power, are made in Australia. Therefore, if this company is not protected in some way in the manufacture of tractors of over 55 horse-power it is perfectly clear that it must cease to manufacture such tractors even though Australian manufacturing efficiency is constantly improving. I want to make this point: I have estimated that the additional cost by way of bounty, if this larger tractor were given bounty assistance, based on 50 per cent, of the Australian demand which would represent 250 tractors per annum, would be only an additional £50,000. I strongly urge the Government to reconsider the restrictions to which I have Furthermore, primary referred and to provide for the payment of the bounty on this larger tractor, that is, on tractors exceeding 55 horse-power but not in excess of 80 horse-power. 1 remind the Government that this is in line with the recommendation of the Tariff Board. If this be not possible, I recommend that at least the Tariff Board be requested to review in the light of the most recent statistics and information, this section of its report and its relationship to the present bill. At the same time, I strongly recommend to the Government that it should suitably increase the amount of the bounty payment on tractors due to the non-application of any protective tariff.",93,Osborne
236,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [10.35],"1matters, to take a really progressive step. I tliink that in a matter of this description previous speakers, that two companies in which the Government should have been generous, this bill unfortunately shows that it has been niggardly. I agree with the remarks that have been made by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr not only tractors but also agricultural imPollard) and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Cleaver). The recommendations which were made by the Tariff Board were five in number. The first was the continuation of the bounty which was fixed in 1952. Secondly, it recommended that a bounty of £200 should be provided on tractors of 55 belt pulley horse-power, manufactured in Australia. The board recommended a bounty to operate on tractors exported to Commonwealth territories. It recommended permission for the profit rate to be increased from 5 per cent, to not more than 10 per cent. Finally, it recommended a duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem under British preferential tariff on imported tractors exceeding 30 maximum belt pulley horsepower. Those five recommendations were made after a very extensive and a very careful inquiry. In the report that has been issued by the Tariff Board in respect of this matter, one finds a wealth of detail. A lot of information is given with respect to the submissions' which were made by a large number of persons interested in tractor manufacture-by those who were opposed to it and by those who made submissions from the general community stand-point. In its report, the Tariff Board has analysed these submissions very carefully and, after due consideration, it has made a recommendation on the five points that I have mentioned. One really has to read the Tariff Board report in order to appreciate how all these recommendations are bound together. I think it can be said that, after having made this very ful l inquiry and having made these recommendations, the Tariff Board believed that it had done something that ""would place the tractor industry on a firm foundation and enable it gradually to develop and be in a position to meet the great bulk of Australian productive requirements in respect of tractors of over 30 horse-power. The position is, as has been stated by are vitally concerned in this matter. One is the International Harvester Company Proprietary Limited, a great international company which manufactures plements. It is a world-wide organization which is backed by heavy capital, great assets and great resources. When that company established itself in Australia, it established itself as a manufacturing unit after it had built up and obtained a market in respect of both tractors and agricultural machinery by importations into this country. So it can be said that before the Internationa] Harvester Company Proprietary Limited actually came into Australia, it was already upon a firm foundation in the international sphere and that it simply brought into this country the necessary manufactures to meet a market which it had already, over the years, developed iu this country. The second company is Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited, which, as previous speakers have pointed out, is an Australian company of fairly recent origin. Whereas International Harvester Company Proprietary Limited was, and is still, primarily a manufacturer of agricultural implements, Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited is primarily a manufacturer of tractors, although it does manufacture some agricultural implements. A bounty is now payable on terms similar to those proposed in the bill, but it is not payable on tractors in respect of which a profit in excess of 5 per cent, is earned. That probably is the reason why International Harvester Company Proprietary Limited has never sought the aid of the bounty. That company is an extremely profitable concern, and had it sought a bounty it probably would have been refused because of the size of the profits the company makes. I have no objection whatever to the proposal which is made by the Tariff Board for an increase in profit limitation from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent., but Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited is not concerned with such an alteration. This -company is now breaking even, and possibly making a slight profit, but its profit is not as much as 5 per cent. It has no desire for a limitation to 10 per cent., but it does desire to have conditions in respect of this industry placed upon such a firm and strong foundation that it can, from now onwards, progress in the manufacture of tractors to the stage where, as a result of increased production, the industry may be put on » firm and permanent basis. I believe that that was the desire of the Tariff Board, and that the board's recommendations interlocked with one another so as to produce proper conditions for this industry. As pointed out by the honourable member for Lalor, of the five recommendations the two basic recommendations were the bountycum-tariff proposals, and retention of the 1952. The appendices to the report disclose the bounties fixed in 1952. From that time onwards the costs of labour and material have increased greatly. Those bounties varied from £80 to £240. This legislation provides that only those tractors with a horse-power in excess of 30 are covered, whereas under the current legislation tractors with a horsepower in excess of 10 and up to 55 were covered. -teemed to be the foundation upon which the Tariff Board recommendations were made was for a continuance of the bounty fixed on prices in 1952, plus the imposition of the 5 per cent. British preferential tariff duty. It is interesting to examine the reasons given by the Minister for not adopting the recommendation in respect of tariff. Honorjiblf members will recollect that the Miiiister made a very brief speech on >bc matter and that he dismissed the very important question of the 5 per cent, tariff in a few words. His actual words were-The Government cannot agree to grant HHsistance by means of the Customs Tariff, particularly at the present time, mainly because increased costs in key export industries that the Government was to follow tht would follow. Those are the words with which the proposals made by the T a r if f Board, after a very lengthy hearing, were dismissed. The Minister was of the opinion that implementation of the board's proposal? might lead to increased costs in key industries. It is very interesting to refer ti> what the T a r i ff Board had to say in respect of this matter. A t page 11 of it report, the board saidAt present the industry needs further assistance than that provided by the present bounty scale and the Board considers that such assistance should be provided by a duty of 5 pei cent, in the British Preferential Tariff on imported tractors exceeding 30 m.b.p.h.p. with increases in rates other than the British Pre ferential Tariff in accordance with international commitments. In arriving at thiiconclusion the Board examined closely thi possible effect of a duty on the costs to users, and believes that there is sufficient competitioi between different makes and sizes of tractor^ to prevent a general increase in costs. In tin 30 to 40 m.b.p.h.p. range for example the competition between the 37 m.b.p.h.p. tractoi made in Australia and those between say 3ft and 40 m.b.p.h.p. imported would prevent an; rate of bounty provided in general increase in the prices of the imported machines; there would also he a restraining influence on the prices of the 30 to 35 m.b.p.h.p tractors because those prices cannot drap nearer to those in the higher horse-power rangf without loss of sales to the higher horse powev group. Although individual tractors may no' be competitive there must be a relative stability in the differentials between the different groups; consequently the Board feels that thiimposition of a duty of 5 per cent, will hav little effect on prices. For the time being the Board sees no necessity for a duty on im ported tractors over 10 but not exceeding The proposal which to me 30 m.b.p.h.p.; the provision for bounty on tractors of this classification should remain, however, and the question of assistance to thi* section of the industry examined again in the light of developments between now and thf next occasion on which tractors are before th>Board. In the next paragraph we find the reason behind the recommendationsThe Board believes that the imposition of the small duty recommended will provide a greater stimulus to the industry than the provision of equivalent or even higher assistance in th, form of increased bounty. Its greatest vainwould he in its being an indication that future policy of assistance will favour tariff protection rather than the relatively insecure and restri>tive method of bounty. I believe that had the T a r if l Board known very unusual practice, as pointed out by my friend the honourable member for Lalor, of not accepting the board's recommendations the board would have pro posed a higher bounty, because we musi bear in mind that the bounty proposed in this measure is exactly the same as the bounty fixed in 1952, since when costs of both labour and material have substantially increased. Obviously, that bounty does not give the same protection to-day, when costs are so much higher, as it did in 1952. I suggest to the Minister that the board, in making its recommendations, had in mind the two factors which it believed were necessary in order to put this industry on a proper basis. I think that the Minister is just as eager to see this industry placed on a proper basis as I am, or as are the honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Lalor. The question is: How can we do it? We want to place this industry, efficient as it isI think it is admitted by all that the industry is extremely efficient-o n a basis where it gradually can free itself from all assistance. If a duty of 5 per cent, would stimulate production, and, perhaps, increase capital investment in the industry, it would be a sound long-range policy to impose a duty at that rate to enable the industry to become independent. Like the honourable inember for Lalor and the honourable member for Swan, I very strongly urge the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr the past. Osborne) to give further consideration to this tariff in conjunction with the recommendations which were made by the Tariff Board, if he cannot at this stage take the action I have suggested. I believe the board, in making its recommendations, followed a plan which it believed would give the best results. If some of the features of the plan are eliminated, it will fail to give the results that were expected. In order to demonstate that the imposition of a tariff does not necessarily increase costs, I refer to page eleven of the Tariff Board's report, which statesThe Board believes, however, that the existemphasize that, if we want to do the ence of a local industry has had the effect of keeping prices to users at lower levels than they would otherwise have been. The board then made this signincant statementDistributors' margins on types not made in Australia are noticeably higher than on those that are and the Board believes that an extension of the range of local production would cause further reduction in margins. Tractors that come into Australia under by-law without the payment of duty are sold in South Africa and in New Zealand at prices lower than the price in Australia. Tractors are an essential item of capital equipment for primary producers, and importers who have no competition in the local market are able to charge any price they like. Although the primary producer may think he is getting his tractor at the lowest possible price, if there is no competition from local production, he will pay more than the producers in South Africa and New Zealand pay. I know my friends in the Australian Country party will say that the primary producer is up against a lot of difficulties and that the Government wants to keep the costs of primary production down. One can understand that, but I point out that primary producers are not the only people who have to make sacrifices. I speak now from the stand-point of trade unionists, who also are making sacrifices to-day, because they are unable to keep pace with the rising cost of living. The freezing of wages, and other restrictions, prevent them from getting as mucb benefit from their wages as they received in I should like to point out that 7,000 Chamberlain tractors are in use in Australia, and they are believed to give efficient service. If 7,000 primary producers find these tractors satisfactory is it not possible that many others also will find them satisfactory? I am reliably informed that the life of a tractor is approximately fifteen years. An increase of the price by 5 per cent, would add very little to the costs of primary production if the increased price were written off over fifteen years. I mention that point so that honourable members may appreciate exactly what the position is. I again right thing by this industry, we must bear in mind that the Tariff Board has recommended the payment to the local tractor industry of a hounty based upon 1952 prices, plus a British preferential tariff at 5 per cent, based upon present prices. If one of these concessions is not given, the other must receive further consideration. If the preferential tariff is not imposed, it will be necessary substantially higher-powered machines. I suggest that to increase the bounty based on 1952 costs, the Minister give further consideration because the industrj is now producing at to the Tariff Board's second recommenda1956 costs. If this were not done the intion. I believe that, if he does so, he dustry could not contribute to Australia's will realize that the recommendations condevelopment. I wish to mention also the Tariff Board's second recommendation, which readsThat the Tractor Bounty Act 1939-1953 be amended to provide for payment of bounty on will be imported duty-free tractors exceeding 55 m.b.p.h., when fitted with an imported engine, of £200 per tractor. I think the Minister is aware, though he is a busy man and he may have forgotten, that Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited manufactures tractors of approximately 75 to 80 maximum belt pulley horse-power. engines produced in the United States of America. The competitors of this company are able to import machines of a similar type duty free under by-law, but the company pays a 10 per cent, duty on the engines. This undoubtedly places the Australian manufacturer in a very difficult position. I am sure the Minister will find, if he makes inquiries, that what I have said is correct. I do not desire to go over the ground traversed by the honourable member for Swan, who pointed out that there is a tendency to-day for primary producers to favour tractors of greater horse-power. That is a good thing. Farmers producing on a large scale find it essential to have high-powered machines. A t very little additional cost, Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited could increase the power of their 55 horse-power tractor to 60 horse-power, which would admirably meet the needs of many farmers and would enable the Chamberlain tractor to compete with the imported machine of CO horse-power. But, because the company desires to qualify for the bounty, it is unable to increase the horse-power of the tractor. That is undesirable. According to the figures I have been given, the demand for tractors of higher horse-power is not very great at the present time, and the company could easily supply half Australia's annual requirements of tractors in the 40 horse-power, 55 horse-power. 60 horse-power, and 70 to 80 horse-power classes if the bounty were given for the stitute a composite plan designed to achieve worth-while results. Industries Proprietary Limited is changing to a United Kingdom motor which so, but that motor has only recently come on the market. But the question then arises whether there should be a refund of duty on the engines they have imported. If the Minister will agree to give consideration to that matter, that will be They are powered by something to be thankful for. I conclude my remarks by stressing once again that the two key recommendations are those in relation to the bounty and the tariff. I believe it would be in the interests of the Government, the primary producers and the community generally to introduce a bounty-cumtariff. The greater is the production of tractors, the lower will be fhe cost. That is the road to lower prices that should be followed by the Government. Our objective should be the long-range objective. If the Minister will consider the proposals that have been made by the honourable member for Lalor, the honourable member for Swan and myself, as well as the proposals which, no doubt, will be made by other honourable members, I am sure that the tractor industry will be placed on a proper footing. refreshing for ""Western Australian members to find that at least some members of this House in addition to themselves are prepared to advocate the cause of that State. That recognition, that Western Australia is an important part of the Commonwealth raises some hope in the hearts of Western Australian members that there is a chance of salvation for this Parliament. We are dealing with proposals to continue the payment of a bounty on tractors of various sizes manufactured in Australia and to impose a tariff duty on certain types of imported tractors.

The honourable member for Lalor referred to the recently increased tariff on rayon and similar goods. I shall not enter into an argument now about the merits or demerits of tariff duties imposed on consumer goods, but I point out that there is a vital difference between tariff duties imposed on consumer goods and tariff duties imposed on capital equipment, because the latter duties cause an increase of the costs of production of a section of producers in this country which is not given any protection in return.

249,Mr Leslie,"I shall read on. OnThere are some remarkable instances at' the injustice caused by tariff protection. Let me refer to what must be by uow a classic example. A few years ago, che producers of corrugated iron in this country received from the Goverument protection and assistance equivalent to tbe wages paid by them. The result was that, owing to the very high tariff duty imposed to protect the Australian industry, the cost of imported corrugated iron became prohibitive. Similar considerations machinery of all kinds. Because of the tariff protection that was given to the agricultural machinery industry of this country, primary producers had to pay from £120 to £130 for machines which could be bought in Canada for £70 or 680. The machines available in Canada were manufactured there by the company that was producing similar machines in Australia. They could have been landed here at many pounds below the price which primary producers had to pay for the machines produced locally. The primary producer gained no benefit from the tariff because the difference between the price of the Australian-produced machine and the price of the imported machine was so small. So the primary producer, who was producing the basic wealth of this country, and who had to sell on an unprotected market in Australia, and to take his chance on open markets abroad, was being forced to pay high prices for capital equipment in order to protect a secondary industry whose products were so high in price that for many people primary production became not only unprofitable, but absolutely impossible. primary producer eventually decided that, as he could not change the unwise national policy of protecting both the interests of industry and the interests of the employees, which were protected by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, he would ask for subsidies and bounties? The only reason why primary producers requested subsidies and bounties was to give them protection against the protectionist policy of this country. They had to have subsidies and bounties in order to enable them to continue to exist. That is the reason why the Australian Country party has consistently opposed the imposition of excessive tariffs, particularly on capital goods required for the production of the commodities on which we rely for our overseas funds. The Tariff Board points out, and quotes figures to support its statement, that both the companies concerned in the tractor industry in Australia are unable to meet the Australian demand for tractors. What would be the position if additional tariff were imposed on imported tractors? The apply to agricultural primary producers who need tractors, and who cannot buy them locally because the demand exceeds the supply, would be called upon, quite unjustifiably and unnecessarily, to pay additional costs. If the industry could meet the whole of the Australian demand there might be come reason for taking action to keep imported tractors out; but it is neither reasonable nor logical to make primary producers carry au extra cost burden because the ua tional policy is protectionist. imposed on only a small proportion of tractors used. is sufficient to affect the position very seriously. Both the honourable member for Lalor and the honourable member for Bendigo have repeated the statement that the imposition of tariffs has not increased the prices of capital goods to the user. No matter how much honourable members may argue on that point, the fact is that tariffs have increased the prices of overseas commodities and also the prices of similar local commodities. I w ill not go so f a r as to say that it has been a general oractice for some of the protected indusIsi t any wonder that the tries to engage in some measure of exploitation, but that has not been unknown. Recently the T a r i ff Board said, in connection with the prices of imported articlesI t appears from the confidential information available to the Board that the benefit of dutyfree admission of tractors under the British Preferential Tariff is not reaching the primary producer. On the same page the board saysI t is clear that the retail price structure in Australia is much higher, notwithstanding that imports from the United Kingdom are admitted free nf duty under the British Preferential Tariff.",101,Osborne
250,Mr Clarey,The duties would be,102,Osborne
251,Mr Leslie,"T h a t small proportionThere is no guarantee that in the event of a tariff being imposed the distributors of imported tractors would absorb the duty so that the primary producer would not be called upon to bear the additional costs. The position to-day is that, despite the fact that the local tractor industry cannot meet the Australian demand, and tractors have to be imported, there is not sufficient competition. producer finds he is called upon to pay a higher price for both the local article and the overseas article than circumstances warrant. This is one of the best days we of the Australian Country party have ever experienced, because at long last the Tariff Board has recognized that there is injustice to the primary producing industries in imposing tariff burdens in respect of their requirements. t said earlier that I regretted that Australia is not buying enough from th« Western Australia had been singled out eastern States, or that it is receiving too for this unusual departure by the Golarge a share of the money that has been vernment from the common practice. 1 paid to the Commonwealth Treasury, and point out to the Minister and the House part of which it has contributed in thf that the position is not a happy one for first place, it is obvious that those honorWestern Australia, which suffers severely able members are very selfish and are from the national protectionist policy.

As the honourable member for Fremantle has reminded us, Western Australia has almost no protected industries.

I again emphasize that the big prices that Western Australia pays for goods imported from the eastern States, the value of which is £91,000,000 a year, and for which it must pay with the money it receives for goods sold overseas on the open market, are the result of tariff protection. Western Australia also contributes towards the maintenance of those industries that receive bounties and subsidies. In addition, that State is called upon to pay extremely high transport charges, so that, by the time the goods reach it, they are very costly. On top of all these charges sales tax has to be paid, and of course this is assessed, not on the original wholesale price, but on that price plus the high transport and other charges. . not expect to get goods for nothing. says that we cannot expect to get goods for nothing, but we expect a fair crack of the whip. I am not able to support the honourable member for Lalor( Mr that the Australian Country party has a Pollard) and the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) in their plea for the Government to adopt the recommendation of the Tariff Board, not only because I am a member of the Australian Country party and am protecting the interests of the primary producer, but also because I am a good Western Australian. I am sure the honourable member for Fremantle will adopt a similar attitude, and I feel sure that the honourable member for Swan( Mr Cleaver) will support me when I say that we must protect the interests of Western Australia. I support the Government in its decision not to impose a tariff on these tractors. I add my plea to that of the honourable member for Swan, who said that the local industry should be assisted by increasing the bounty to make up for whatever tariff protection was recommended by the board. I should like to plead with the Minister to the Government, and which I believe isfor Customs and Excise( Mr Osborne) reasonable. The letter readson behalf of Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited in Western Aussee fit to impose a duty of 5 per cent., then tralia. A long period of time must have this elapsed since a secondary industry in that assistance, as recommended by the Board, isState was the subject of a plea for tariff actually received. protection. The matter has been very carefully investigated by the Tariff Board, and at page eight of its report it directs attention to the steps that have been taken by this company to reduce its costs of production. It has taken very far-reaching steps indeed. The board has pointed out that the company has acquired modern precision machinery, that it has installed centrifugal casting machines to enable castings to be used in place of some costly forgings, that it proposes to increase its output by these means to 5,000 tractors per annum, and that it proposes to reduce interstate transport costs. The history of tariff protection in Australia shows that it has been blatantly political, and that tariffs have been granted where there are concentrations of political power. In the years before the war, the tariff policy of the Commonwealth was contrived by New South Wales and Victoria, and it very largely remains that way. Of course, I think that its basis has been one of historical accident. I do not accept the viewpoint history of consistent philosophic opposition to tariffs in its espousal of free trade. The Australian tariff structure was built up after World WarI . by the Bruce-Page Government, and it would not have been possible of achievement without the support of the Page segment of that Government. This is one occasion on which the recommendation for tariff protection is directed at an important industry in Western Australia-on e that is not located in a centre of political power. For defence reasons, the Government has been adopting a policy of decentralization of industry. I think that its attitude in relation to this matter will tend towards the closing down of this industry in Western Australia. I have received from Chamberlain Industries ProprietaryLimited a letter containing a request which, I understand, has been made direct Should the Government for some reason not company is asking that the bounty rates he increased in order that the full measure of",103,Osborne

I should like the tariff protection should cover Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited when selling in the eastern States, where it markets 60 per cent, of its products.

Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [12.27 a.m.] I move That the House do now adjourn. It may be of interest to honourable members, who have discharged their duties -during a very onerous series of sittings, to learn that the number of sittings which we have recorded this year-50 has been the highest since 1945 for the first half of a year. Also the Parliament has sat for a greater number of hours, namely 471, than in the first half of any year since 1931. Therefore, it -appears that we have been on the verge of establishing records for both the number and the extent of sittings. I should like to thank honourable members for their co-operation in making this remarkable performance possible. I might say that I have not recorded the number of times that I have applied the gag, but I think that honourable members will agree that I have probably established an all-time record. However, this has been necessary in order that legislation should be dealt with by the Parliament, and I believe that every honourable member has had an in the way that he wished. Opposition) [12.29 a.m] I should like to thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the oflicers who have helped us in the House, and the staffs of the various parliamentary services for the assistance that they have given during a very strenuous session. It was obvious at an early stage that a great deal of legislation would be hurried through before the 30th June. I think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) will admit that that had to be done. It imposed great strain upon the draftsmen and led to hasty consideration of bills, the effect of which will, doubtless, be observed hereafter, when they are examined more closely by those whom they are intended to bind. I believe that to be fair comment, but on behalf of the Opposition I would like to thank the Vice-President of the Executive Council. ( Sir Eric Harrison) for the occasional merciful treatment that he has given us. He does hold the world's record for the gag. It is unnecessary for me to assert it because he claims it himself. It is a record, but the record that I should like to have is the record that is being announced on the wireless at present. [12.31 a.m.] Mr Deputy Speaker, I should like to congratulate you on the very splendid job that you have done, especially towards the end of this session. When you hear anything of a congratulatory nature from me, you are certainly hearing it from one who speaks unwillingly.

302,Mr Clyde Cameron (Hindmarsh),"you have done a very excellent job in the chair. I want to let the House and you, in particular, know that I feel that you have done an excellent job. Your decision on insisting on a division on the adjournment when that was called for was good, and it is noteworthy that since you have insisted on having a division when one was called for, none has been called. The fact that you have not insisted on the strict interpretation of the Standing Orders in relation to the mentioning of names during question time is a great improvement on what has been the practice in the past, because it is often impossible to ask a question intelligently without mentioning a name. I think that that is another good example of good speakership on your part. I want now to deal briefly with a matter which I hope the Postmaster-General( Mr Davidson) will be able to look at during the recess, and give me an answer in due course. It concerns television. 1. should like the Postmaster-General to check these facts, but I understand that after an intensive study of the problems encountered and the mistakes made in the early design of receivers for television reception in the United States of America and elsewhere, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has determined a series of technical standards to be observed in the production of receivers for use in Australia. Another thing that has come to my notice is that in spite of the fact that this series of standards has been recognized by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, there has been a company established in Australia with head-quarters in Sydney and Melbourne called the Admiral Radio and Television Company which, we believe, is carrying on a policy that ignores the recommendations of the board with relation to the choice of the intermediate frequency channels in the manufacture of its television receivers. We have it on fairly good authority that the use of 21 megacycle system intermediate frequency channels in America has been discontinued and that the parts that have been rejected as a result of the change of policy in America have now been sent to Australia to be used by this company in the sets which it will be manufacturing for sale to the Australian people. Therefore, I should like the Postmaster General to find out whether it is a fact that this particular company is using printed circuits which are not manufactured here but which have been obtained from America with import licences granted by the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Osborne), who is smiling about this matter. I tell him that it really is not a smiling matter. I should like to know whether, in fact, these printed circuits will produce an article which will not give the satisfactory service to the purchaser which, I think, thrboard hoped would be given. jected in the United States of America? have been rejected in the United States. I do not make the assertion, I just say that it has been reported that ihis company has purchased large quantities of these rejected printed circuits for use in the sets which it will be manufacturing for sale in Australia. I merely say it has been reported, and I ask the Postmaster-General to make inquiries into the matter to find out whether it is true that the standards laid down by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board are, in fact, being ignored by this company. If the inquiries reveal that the standards are not being ignored and are in fact being observed, then no harm has been done. If , on the other hand, it is discovered that our standards have been ignored, now is the time for the Government to step in so as to protect the Australian purchaser of these particular articles. Finally, I ask the Minister to confer with the Minister for the Interior( Mr Fairhall), who knows quite a deal about this matter, to see whether it is possible for the Government to establish a trade mark of its own or some mark of standardization which manufacturers of television sets, though not forced to use, may use if their television sets meet the requirements of the standards set by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board so that when the people",109,Adjournment Valedictory Television Mb Speaker

What are the details of the structural alterations carried out and the mechanical services supplied in providing new office accommodation for the right honourable member for Cowper at the Commonwealtli Bank Building, Sydney, at a cost of £609? 2. What items of furniture were included in the outlay of £643 in furnishing the nev office? honourable member's questions is as follows:1 and 2. The right honourable the Prime Minister has furnished information about thr estimated cost of structural alterations and f u r nishings to office accommodation for the right honourable the member for Cowperi n the Commonwealth Bank Building, Sydney. I under stand that this was done by letter in the first place and by a more detailed answer which appeared in notice-paper No. 36 of the 28th May. The Prime Minister gave estimated costs on that occasion and I have since ascertained that the actual cost is now available. This is £161 less than the estimated cost, the final figures being £510 for structural alterations and £641 for furniture and furnishings. I do not propose, unless in structed by this House, to furnish more detailed information than has already been supplied by the Prime Minister. 1.

It is clear that any large-scale development in Australian fisheries will depend on more accurate and complete information being obtained about the factors which lead to fluctuations in the abundance of fish in the surrounding seas. This will involve the division in more comprehensive studies of ocean currents, temperature distribution, salinity of the sea and its content of phosphate, which is the fertilizer for natural marine life, and the influence of these on reproduction, growth and distribution of fish populations. charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, upon notice1.

Did he notice particularly that she said the work of eradicating rabbits by myxomatosis will not be done on a shoe string? 3. What is being done by the Commonwealth Government, and by State governments, to intensify the drive against rabbits by the employment of more scientists, as recommended by Dame Jean Macnamara and by the provision of ample funds to bring thc present campaign of eradication to a successful conclusion? member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. The work on myxomatosis being undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Besearch Organization is not being hampered by lack of funds. As far as the work by State government organizations is concerned these bodies have had grants from thc wool funds in the past and are in a position to apply for additional money from these funds at any time. 3. There has always been the fullest cooperation between thc Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Besearch Organization and State authorities and all State authorities have actively co-operated in the dissemination of myxomatosis in the field. In recent years it is true that because of the infectiousness of the disease and the small number of rabbits remaining less emphasis has heen put on the continued dissemination of the more virulent laboratory strain of the virus. It is now felt that in view of the tendency for resistance to develop in the remaining rabbit population to the mild strain of the virus, active dissemination of the laboratory strain should again be undertaken. Scientific and Industrial Besearch Organization has already arranged for discussions to he held with the States wit h respect to this policy in the near future. A further measure which is contemplated and which it is hoped may add tn the effective dissemination of the virus in those States in which it has been in general less effective-viz. , Western Australia and Tasmania-is the introduction of the rabbit flea from the United Kingdom, since this is a vector which apparently in the TJnited Kingdom has been of primary importance. Discussions are at present being held between the State authorities and the Department of Health, with respect to this matter. It should be madeclear that no one has said or suggested that myxomatosis has outlived its usefulness. All that has been said is that over a period of years a decline in efficiency may be anticipated. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial' Research Organization believes that every encouragement should be given-(a ) to thedissemination of the virulent laboratory strainof the virus; and (6) to the vigorous employment of other methods of rabbit controli.e., poisoning, fumigation, warren ripping, & c An additional possibility which is being investigated by the Commonwealth Scientific and : Industrial Research Organization is the development of a new strain of the virus which would overcome the difliculty of a growingNEW SERVICE RIFLE .
