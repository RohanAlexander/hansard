15,Mr Latham,"This morning.MrM o GRATH asked the M in is t e r for made a public statement two years ago proH o m e A f f a i r s , u p o n not i c e1. What was the cost of construction of the culvert and covering road, near the Power House, known as Wentworth-avenue, Canberra? 2. What was the cost of construction of the culvert and covering road connecting New South Wales-crescent and Giles-crescent? 3. (a) What was the cost of construction of the experimental concrete penetration road in Giles-street, Kingston; (b) are experts of opinion that this road is, in view of its corrugation, a success? 4. Isi t a fact that the culverts referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 were incapable, through faulty construction, of handling storm waters, and were severely damaged as a result of the fall of rain (amounting to 122 points) on Saturday, the 16th instant? orable member's questions are as follow1. (a) The cost of the culvert inWentworth-avenue was £3,214; (.6) the cost of connecting embankments and roadways on Brisbane and Wentworth avenues was £8,(170. 2. (a)' Thecost of the culvert was £602; (b) the cost of construction of the embankments and roadways to New South Walescrescent at the. southern end of Telopea Pork, was. £783. 3. (a)' £1,120; (!>) I am advised that the road' is not corrugated. It is an experimental one and is so> far entirely successful. It is. impossible to express any final opinion on the subject until tlie road has been in use. for' some time, particularly over a complete range of temperatures. 4. I am advised that .one of the criteria used, for thedesign of these' culverts was a rate' of rainfall three inches per hour, which wasi arrived at after consideration of the practice in Melbourne, Sydney and elsewhere. recent fall evidently exceeded this figure in the particular locality involved. The important factor is the rate o i fall and not the total fall over the 24 hours. The small amount of damage whichactually occurred over' the whole of the city (which will, cost not more than £.400 to restore) would probably not have occurred but for the fact that the embankments involved were newly constructed and not consolidated and clothed. As the Canberra atorniwater drainage system is gradually developed some of the stormwater at present flowinginto existing channels w i l t ba diverted! elsewhere and thus obviate' present', difficulties. Home Affairs, upon notice1. Isi t a fact that the Federal Capital Commission have requested residents of the owing to the danger of infection? 2. Isi t a fact that the Chief Commissioner mising that public baths would he immediately erected in Canberra? 3. W ill the Minister give an assurance that up-to-date baths will be ready at the beginning of next summer? honourable member's questions are as follow :1. On the 5th December, 1928, the Federal Capital Commission announced that the standard of purity of the waters of the Molonglo River was then definitely below what was recognized as safe for swimming purposes. 2. and 3. No statement was made by the Chief Commissioner two years ago promising that public baths would be immediately erected in Canberra. Two years ago the matter was considered by the Commission, which decided that funds could not be made available fur the purpose. The position was reviewed last year and provision for the work was made in draft estimates. Funds would not permit, however, of the work being proceeded with. The position will be reviewed in connection with the estimates for next year. Home Affairs, upon notice1.

This system was adopted by the Government in 1021 after careful inquiry and expert advice. It is not a matter of necessity. When electric power and light lines were first installed in the older cities it was found that the only available place to erect the lines was in the front or main streets, and thus the precedent was established. A visit to any of the cities or towns, and especially the suburbs, w ill disclose how objectionable to the general appearance is a mass of poles and wires. The authorities who decided on the regulation for Canberra had in view the "" GardenC it y "" ideal, and, realizing the objectionFederal Capital Commission, stated before the able nature of a moss of wires and poles in the front of houses and public buildings, evolved the source of entry from the rear, thus placing them as far out of sight as possible. Canberra is the only city in Australia where the layout has been considered as a whole, thus making reform on these lines possible. 4. No. 5. The question of the Commission's responsibility would be considered when such a case actually occurred. G. There does not appear to be any danger to residents of the Territory from tlie adoption of the present system. I shall, however, look into the matter. Home Affairs, upon notice1.

I am glad that the conversion of the exchanges at Edgecliff and Caulfield is to be referred to the Public Works Committee, but there are exchanges in other places which also need to be converted. In the electorate which I represent there are many important industrial centres, including Mascot and Botany. Both are catered for by manual exchanges! Would it not be advisable to group together several districts served by manual exchanges, and have them served by one automatic telephone exchange? I understand that within the next month a great many telephone mechanics will be dismissed. Some of these men have been with the department for years, and many of them are returned soldiers who have been in the employ of the department since their return from active service. If it is possible to obtain money for defence purposes, we should make an effort also to find sufficient funds for the conversion of manual to automatic exchanges in important centres, and thus provide employment for men, who after years of service are expert in wiring and installation work.

83,Mr Thompson (New England),"every effort to expedite the installation of automatic exchanges at country places where, at present, the offices, in most instances, are closed at 6, 7, or 8 p.m. I , at that time, believed that the Department would, possibly, be able to commence the installation of these promised automatic exchanges at a comparatively early date. imagination of the country people more than did the promise to provide automatic telephone exchanges in the outback districts. Postmaster-General is not in a position to indicate to the House o'r to the country when this desirable reform is to be instituted, and for that reason I wish to suggest to him that steps be taken without delay by tbe Postal Department to review the whole subject of the provision of country telephone services, particularly in the far distant districts. The telephone service is practically the sole means of communication of outlying districts, and yet, in the majority of instances, the exchanges, which are run by allowance postmasters, some of whom are very poor hands at their job, are closed at 6 p.m., when the farmers and pastoralists are leaving the fields for their homes. ber is in order in making incidental reference to country telephone exchanges, but he may not discuss the whole policy of the Postal Department. that automatic exchanges would be installed in country districts appealed greatly to the imagination of the country people because it offered every prospect of a continuous telephone service. Nothing is more irritating to the country people than their inability to make use of the telephone service after 6 p.m. Particularly is that the case when allowance postmasters are in charge of the exchange, because many of them are hostile to the-local residents, or unsuitable for the positions they hold. Very often the Department promises to give an extra service if the residents contribute, say, from £30 to £50 towards the cost. That is a very unfair method of providing telephone services, because the additional payment usually devolves upon two or three of the residents. master-General to say when the promised telephonic millennium in country districts is to commence. I am pleased to note that automatic telephone exchanges are to be installed in certain centres in Australia, but I regret that this work is to be undertaken Nothing appealed to the at the expense of the country districts. An experiment of this kind should bo tried first in the country districts where telephone services are urgently required. It appears to me that the In Western Australia the outback districts have little or no means of telephone communication. That State is making great progress, particularly in the country districts, whereas development in many of the country settled districts in other States is practically stationary. The population of the electorate of the Postmaster-General has not increased to any extent since federation, yet I venture to say that it has not been neglected on that account. The distance from Norseman to Esperance in Western Australia is 126 miles, yet the intervening area is entirely without telephone facilities. The nearest hospital to Esperance is at Norseman, and it is impossible for sick persons at Esperance or in the centres in between to get into immediate touch with the hospital. If telephonic communication were established there many lives might be saved. I believe that there is some tentative arrangement with the State Railway Department for the use of its line in case of emergency, but that cannot be availed of except in the evening. I invite the Postmaster-General to tour the country districts of Western Australia, especially my electorate. If he does so, I promise him that he will be well received. He would thus be able to obtain first-hand knowledge of the requirements of the people, and, as a result, I believe that, instead of proceeding with the provision of an up-to-date automatic telephone system in the big cities of Australia, he would give the country districts the facilities that they urgently require. cannot complain of the work of the Postmaster-General in respect of the provision of telephone facilities in country districts. I think that he has shown I ask the Postmore consideration to country districts",21,Caulfield Automatic Telephone Exchange

87,Mr Prowse (Forrest) [11.55],"I 'than did any previous Postmaster General, but, at the same time, I desire to express the hope that he will press on with the work of installing automatic exchanges in the outback settlements. That should be a national work. people in the country are working for the nation, and if they have to leave the fields during working hours to use the telephone, their loss of time becomes a national loss. The provision of an automatic telephone system would enable them to put calls through during their leisure in the evenings. I can quite understand the protest of the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) against the setting aside of that portion of the Country party's policy relating to the provision of telephonic facilities in country districts. hardly fair to me. candidates promised before the election that automatic telephone exchanges would he established in country centres, yet one of the first-acts of the Postmasterlast election by the Country party propaGeneral after the election, is to bring down a proposal for the establishment of automatic telephone exchanges at Caulfield, Melbourne, and Edgecliff, Sydney. I have no objection to the cities receiving the attention that they deserve, because in large centres of population, telephone facilities are necessary, but, unfortunately, the Government frequently loses sight of the claims of the country districts. During the recent campaign the Country party propagandists published some rather good literature, which was no doubt helpful to that party. It contained a sketch of the Postmaster General-and a veritable farmer he looked-wit h telephone and telegraph wires all around him. He was depicted as a magician who, merely by a wave of the hand, was about.to provide automatic telephone exchanges for the convenience of everybody in the community, particularly the farmers in the back blocks. It is surprising that he has not yet announced when this comprehensive scheme of telephones is to be commenced. Country party propagandists were sincere, their promise to the electors to provide automatic exchanges in country [83] districts should be given immediate effect,. At one time Rockhampton was promised an automatic telephone exchange. Responsible officers of the Postmaster-General's Department, in evidence before the PubThe lic Works Committee, stated that in Rockhampton au automatic telephone .exchange was urgently needed; yet action to install such an exchange has not yet' been taken, although it would be a great boon to the farming community in the surrounding district. It is more necessary to install these exchanges in country dfstricts than in the city, because the farmers have to work from daylight to dark, and they frequently find that when they wish to use the telephone the local post office is closed, and they have to pay a special charge to have it opened. If these exchanges were established at small country post offices a farmer could ring up at any hour and would not need the assistance of a postal official. I desire that the Postmaster-General should say definitely what is the policy of the department, and whether he intends to give effect to the promises made at the gandists, who suggested that the Nationalists could not be depended upon to provide these facilities for those who live in country districts. If the pact is to be of any value to the unfortunate farmers they should be the first to be given the benefit of future extensions. The Postmaster General should tour the country districts and thus obtain first-hand knowledge of their requirements. I can promise him a very good reception if he visits the Capricornia electorate, and can assure him that numerous deputations of primary producers will wait upon him to urge the installation of automatic tele-' phone exchanges and the liberalization of the existing postal and telephone facilities. Every fair-minded man in Australia must admit that the present Government has, in six years, given greater telephone facilities to the people in the country districts than were given by all of those which preceded it. In. every part of Australia If the the telephone system has been extended during the last few years, largely as a result of the sympathy and activity of tbe present Postmaster-General.

A number of these experimental exchanges have been established, and, doubtless, so soon as the Postmaster-General is in a position to do so he will give approval to further extensions. That was the only promise which was made by any Country party candidate or canvasser during the last election campaign. We, at any rate, are quite satisfied that the gentleman who at present administers the Postal Department has been largely instrumental in having telephonic facilities extended in our country districts. If there is to be any alteraperiod of years. In 1912 the first of such tion of the existing policy it should be in the direction of permitting the use of private lines and community lines at night, without the payment of an additional fee. A similar practice should be adopted at railway stations, where an officer is in attendance for only a few hours during the day. The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr attention to the interests of country disMcGrath) has rendered a very useful service to the House and the country by initiating this discussion. Only rarely do we have an opportunity to listen to a statement of policy by the Postmaster General, not only in relation to the extension of the automatic telephone system, but also in connection with the general administration of his department. I wish to refer particularly to the policy that is pursued in regard to the granting of preference to Australian-made materials, in the equipment of these exchanges. From time to time, by letter and on the floor of this chamber, I have protested to the Postmaster-General against the policy of the department, which in the past has not given the fullest measure of preference and sympathy to the Australian industry. The honourable gentleman should seize this opportunity to make the position clear. I should also like to know whether the construction of automatic telephone exchanges has had a tendency to cheapen maintenance costs, and whether there is a likelihood of rentals and charges being lowered. I cannot refrain from criticizing the attempts that are made by the telephone service. A phase of the department's policy which has evoked considerable criticizm, and that affects every electorate in the Commonwealth, is its demand for what are regarded as exorbitant indemnities against loss, where public telephones are installed. I should like the Postmaster General to make a comprehensive statement of policy. He appeal's to prefer to "" blush unseen and waste his sweetness on the desert air "". well to remember that automatic exchanges have proved successful over a exchanges was installed at Geelong. The policy of the department has been to make the change-over gradually in the . principal centres of population. I believe that I was the first member of this House who raised the question of community automatic exchanges, and I resent the statement of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) that if I were to pay more tricts, my popularity would be greater. It may be news to that honourable member that at the last election I was returned on the votes of the people who live in the country districts of the electorate of Bass. It is only where electric power is available that it is economic to install an automatic telephone service. This facility can be extended only by a process of evolution. If the department is to adopt a policy of providing community automatic exchanges by rapid process this House will have to be prepared to face an expenditure of anything up to £25,000,000 within a short period. Personally, I consider that such an expenditure would be well worthwhile; but it will not be possible to carry out in a few years all the work that is desired in this direction. If the Government were to suggest the immediate expenditure of such a large amount, the Leader of the Opposition would charge it with extravagance, just as he did during the last election campaign. should give credit to those who initiated this discussion.

As the representative of a rural constituency I know the need for these conveniences. Not a day passes but I receive letters asking for an extension of telephone hours.

Honourable members referred to so many matters that I have not time now to answer them all, even if the occasion were suitable. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley), and the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price), referred to the possible manufacture of telephone equipment in Australia. As a matter of fact, there are only three or four systems of automatics in the world, and we are compelled to use a system which will interlink with others. It is not sufficient it to be discussed. for an automatic service to work merely in its own district; it must work through at least three or four other exchanges. Therefore, it is necessary to have -standardized equipment that will work readily with other systems. In Australia vve are not confined to one system, but our choice is limited to two or three at the most. Amongst the manufacturers there is competition, of which we get the benefit. The makers in England aud America are building equipment for systems which will work in -with one another. The department calls tenders all over the world for these installations, but the only firms which can tender are those supplying equipment suitable for our installations. It has been suggested that the material can be manufactured in Australia. I say unhesitatingly that it cannot. To install the machinery required for this work would cost more than the value of the parts we would use in the next 20 years. Works are established in England and America sufficient to make all the equipment needed for the whole world. If we installed a manufacturing plant here it could be kept in operation for only a few weeks in the year. Under present conditions our installations are actually costing less per line than the installations (Corangamite-Post of America. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) stated that the installations of New Zealand were costing less than those of Australia. I can only a member of the Public Works Committee to which this matter is to be referred he will be able to get his colleagues to look into that point.

My reply to the statement that I have given undue regard to applications for new installations in city areas as against country districts is that 56 per cent, of the money available for this work is being spent in the country and 44 per cent, of it in the city. There is no justification whatever for the statement that the department gives the cities preference over the country districts. Motions introduced into the House to refer work of this description to the Public Works Committee nearly always specify city areas because installations in the country rarely cost as much as £25,000, and therefore it is not necessary to refer them to the Public Works Committee.

The honourable member for Wannon asked whether applications for automatic telephone installations were dealt with in order of priority of application. Priority it nearly always determined by necessity. That is the case in this instance. The Malvern telephone exchange has 8,000 subscribers connected with it, and few exchanges can carry that number of lines satisfactorily. It was impossible to extend the exchange, and as 4,000 prospective subscribers live in the Caulfield area, we felt that it was reasonable to do something for them. Questions have been asked about the policy of the Government in regard to the installation of rural automatic exchanges. I have made several statements on this subject. pioneered rural automatic exchanges. We carried out certain experiments with parts manufactured in our own workshops, and after reaching a certain state of efficiency Ave decided to send an engineer abroad to ascertain whether the parts cotild be economically manufactured in bulk so that we could extend the system. wore much too costly to make the system practicable. in tike the parts at a low enough figure to justify its extension.

It is necessary to have power somewhere in the vicinity of the plant in order to operate the service. The policy of the Government in regard to this branch of the telephone service is definite, and hui been announced frequently.

Australia really On the 14th June, 1928, the Minister for Home and Territories submitted a motion asking the House to agree to remit to the Standing Committee on Public Works a report made by that committee on a proposal to erect a National Museum of Australian Zoology at Canberra. The motion was agreed to, biu, owing to pressure of other work, the Those that we manufactured Public Works Committee was unable to consider and report upon tbe reference We could not, even now, prior to the dissolution of Parliament.

Arrangements have been made for the head-quarters of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to be moved to Canberra in due course, and a building scheme has been prepared for the housing of its various activities. The site for the institution is in the area allocated for scientific purposes on the lower slopes of Black Mountain, in the north-west of Canberra, in proximity to the area reserved for the university. The cost of carrying out the scheme will, of course, considerably exceed £25,000, and it is therefore necessary that it be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report. Arrangements are being made for the various sections of it to be submitted progressively for consideration. The project now brought forward comprises the provision of suitable laboratories and an administrative block for the divisions of economic botany and entomology. As required by the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act, I lay on the table plans of the buildings, estimates of the cost, and a detailed description of the project, indicating the purposes of the proposed work, the necessity for its execution, and its present and prospective value.

Message recommending appropriation reported. ister and Minister for External Affairs) [2.16] I move That the bill be now read a second time. This is a bill to validate the financial agreement that has been made between the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. Besides readjusting the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, it provides for the consolidation of the national debt of Australia, and the constitution of a common borrowing authority for the whole of the Australian Governments. The agreement was submitted to the State legislatures, and has been ratified by them, and it now comes before this Parliament. To give effect to the permanent clauses of the agreement it was necessary that the Constitution should be amended, and an act was passed during the last session of the last Parliament, and on submission to the people by way of referendum was approved by nn overwhelming majority. It is, therefore, now possible to validate the agreement, and its permanent clauses will operate as from the 1st July of this year. During the two financial years, 1927-28, and 192S-29, the temporary clauses of the agreement have been operating, and the introduction of this bill is the final stage of long and protracted proceedings. In view of the many discussions that have taken place on the subject, I do not propose to relate at any length the history of the financial arrangements existing between the Commonwealth and the States since federation. What those relations should be was one of the great stumbling blocks to federation, and caused grave concern to the framers .if the Constitution. Eventually, the matter was settled on a. basis which I think was generally regarded as not thoroughly satisfactory, it being provided that for the i>eriod of the 'first ten years three-fourths of the customs and excise revenue collected by the Commonwealth, which alone had power to impose and collect such duties, should be returned to the States. In addition, as at that time the activities of the Commonwealth were limited, a total amount of £6,059,000 was also paid by the Commonwealth to the States during those years. At the end of that period the amount to be paid was a matter for the determination of the Commonwealth Parliament. Negotiations took place between the Commonwealth and the States, and eventually the proposal was put forward that for a further term of ten years-fro m 1910 to 1920a per capita payment of 25s. per annum should be made by the Commonwealth to the States. That involved a reduction of £2,845,000 on the amount previously received by the States. The Commonwealth Government of the day urged that that was a proper reduction because the obligations of the Commonwealth were increasing, and the States had been relieved of the necessity to make provision for defence and for old-age pensions. While this arrangement was in operation the position changed in a dramatic manner. The Great War took place and the Commonwealth assumed new obligations, which I need not at this stage detail. After the war we were left with obligations which amounted and still amount to something like £30,000,000 a year in interest on war expenditure, and our responsibilities to our soldiers. Over £20,000,000 is being paid by way of interest and sinking fund on our war debt, from £7,000,000 to £8,000,000 in respect of soldiers' pensions, and there are various other items relating to repatriation, hospitals and medical attention for returned men.

128,Mr Bruce (Flinders,"Prime MinCommonwealth had so greatly increased that it would not be in a position to continue indefinitely the per capita payments to the States, which had been arranged at a time when the financial position was quite different. I u 1919 a proposal was put before the States that the per capitapayment should be reduced by 2s. 6d. a year until its amount had been brought down to 10s. per head. That, however, was not acceptable to them, and the matter was left in abeyance until 1923, when the present Government came into office. It has been pursued ever since in a way which some of our critics describe as almost relentless; but we were determined to find a solution of this problem in order to remove the States from the position of uncertainty in which they found themselves at -the expiration of the ten-year period 19101920. At any time, on the mere decision of a chance majority of the Federal Parliament, the whole basis of their finances could have been upset by a reduction of the per capita payments. The rights of the States and the basis on which their financial relations with' the Gommonwealth should be settled have been discussed on many occasions in this House; but no one to-day will maintain that the States had any constitutional or legal claim to the maintenance of the per capita payments. Few will argue, even on a moral basis, that any specified sum could be said to be the amount that the Commonwealth should continue to pay. Feeling strongly that, if we were going to subscribe to the principles of federation, the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States should be put upon some basis of security to the States, we have pursued this matter ever since and have now come to the point at which, I trust, it is going to be settled for all time. It has been suggested that I have taken a rather extreme view of this subject of the security of the States. I should like to quote to honourable members the opinion of Mr Collier, the Premier of Western Australia, on this subject. He saidI would infinitely prefer the Financial Agreement to tlie per capita payments, with the possibility and probability of those paywealth and submitted to them. A few ments being abolished at any time. the Prime Minister quoting? Mr YJru.cc. speech on the Financial Agreement. I do not wish to speak at any length on this phase of the subject. The policy of the Governmeiu has been to so arrange the finances of Australia that the States would not be left in the state of uncertainty that hasprevailed since 1920. The first steptaken to solve this problem was the conference with the Premiers held in 1923 -jus t after this Government came into office. The subject was exhaustively discussed, and at one time it looked as if an agreement would be reached. Five of the six States approved the proposals of the Commonwealth in principle; but, unhappily, the negotiations fell through and the conference closed. The matter was pursued by negotiations with the States. A further conference was held in May, 1926, when it became evident that no solution of the difficulty would be found so long as the per capita payments were continued. In 1927 the legislation providing for these payments was repealed. Considerable discussion then took place, and it was urged by some that the States were being treated ruthlessly by this Government. Speaking in this House at the time, I saidI f the States w ill meet us we are prepared to consider any scheme and any method that may be suggested. It is our desire not merely to give the States absolute justice; but, so far as lies in our power to deal with them generously. This Parliament will not permit injustice to be done to them. The purpose of this measure is to give them fair and equitable treatment in a financial re-adjustment which is essential to the interests of the whole of the people, and particularly of the State authorities themselves. That was early in the year 1927. In July of that year the Commonwealth met the States in conference and submitted to them proposals that were practically identical with those which were eventually embodied in the financial agreement endorsed by the whole of the States. The negotiations were begun in Melbourne, and were continued a month later in Sydney. Eventually, an agreement was arrived at with all the States. A draft agreement was made out by the Commonmonths elapsed, in which views were interchanged concerning some difficult questions that had arisen in connection with",31,Financi Al Agreement Validation Bill Second Reading
129,Mr Soullin,From what authority is,32,Financi Al Agreement Validation Bill Second Reading
130,Mr Bruce,"From Mr Collier'stransferred properties. The agreement, in its final form, was then drafted, accepted by the whole of the States, and approved of by their Parliaments and the Parliament of the Commonwealth. It made temporary provision for the period from July, 1927, to June, 1929, and then for a permanent arrangement. It was obvious that if the agreement was to take a permanent form it must have a basis that could not be altered at the whim of a chance majority in any Parliament. The obligation devolved upon the Commonwealth to take over State debts to the amount of over £600,000,000. Obviously, the Commonwealth could not agree to accept such an obligation without absolute security. That aspect of the matter presented considerable difficulty, because only the Constitution, could give the necessary permanency, and if the agreement were embodied in the Constitution it would become inflexible. It was realized that the matter could not be handled in such a way, because changing circumstances in future years might necessitate some variation. Therefore, to give the agreement the necessary degree of flexibility, and to ensure that it should not be altered, save in directions that are acceptable to each of the parties, the electors were asked to consent to the Constitution being amended to enable us to legislate with regard to this or any other agreement that may be entered into with the States, but only with the consent of every party to the agreement. This agreement deals with two questions; first, with Australia's debt, and, secondly, with the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. shall discuss those two separately, because I am inclined to think that, while there is opposition in some quarters to the manner in which the agreement deals with the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, there is a universal acceptance of the principles embodied in that part which concerns the consolidation of the debt, the Loan Council, and the provision of an adequate sinking fund covering the whole of Australia's indebtedness. It is provided that the Commonwealth shall take over and assume responsibility for the whole of tbe debts of the States, which are to be consolidated. The Commonwealth will have to pay interest upoD that debt to the extent of £7,585,000, the balance being made up by the States proportionately to their indebtedness. There is to be a sinking fund of 7s. 6d. per cent, for the redemption of all past debts of the States, towards which the Commonwealth will contribute 2s. 6d. per cent., which, in the aggregate, will amount to approximately £801,000. Thus those debts will be redeemed within a period of 58 years. That is a marked advance; because, while in some cases there was an adequatebr more than an adequate sinking fund, in other cases no provision whatever was made in that direction. If we are to maintain our position as afirst-classborrower, and secure the best terms that are obtainable, we must have an adequate sinking fund for the redemption of our past debts. Since 1923 there has been on the statute book of the Commonwealth, an act which provides for a sinking fund of 10.s. per cent, on the then existing Commonwealth debt and on all future loans. The agreement makes that provision of universal application to future borrowing in Australia, the Commonwealth to contribute 5s. per cent, and the States the balance. The contribution by the Commonwealth with respect to every £40,000,000 of future State indebtedness, will be £100,000 a year. This provision will enhance our credit materially, and also conform with the modern requirement that an adequate sinking fund must be provided for the redemption of loans. In the past, when the market in either London or New York has been approached, the demand has been made for an adequate sinking fund I because of the fact that other borrowers have adopted that practice, their sinking funds in some cases amounting to as much as 15s. per cent.' and even £1 per cent. We shall not be asked to provide to that extent, because we have a recognized sinking fund of 10s. per cent., which is quite acceptable to everybody. Our action has been endorsed in both London and New York, aud has done a great deal to improve our credit. Provision has also been made for the establishment of a Loan Council that is to be representative of both the Commonwealth and the States. For some years such a body has operated voluntarily, and has done J valuable and useful work; but there has always beeu the possibility that one or ruore of the States might withdraw from it. In such a contingency the effect of the principle is destroyed; because one of the principal functions of such a council is to determine the rate of interest tliat will be paid, and if one member of the council should break away aud pay a I'ate higher than the Loan Council think proper, the effect would be to force up the rate against every other member. Even «hen it was on a voluntary basis, the .Loan Council did a great deal to check competition; but when it is on a permanent basis, it will be in a position to ci.ntrol the situation absolutely. It will have to determine each year the amonnt lhat Australia as a whole can borrow, first on the local market without detriment to private enterprise and the requirements of private individuals, and then overseas. The principle upon which it will work is, how much of the desired sum can be borrowed on terms that will be acceptable to a Svst-class borrower, without impairing our credit abroad? It must be remembered that the impairment of the credit (.if even one State would react upon the whole of the existing loans and have a detrimental effect upon the terms of future loans. The establishment Council will in no way infringe the sovereign rights of any government or parliament in this country. When these provisions were first mooted it was imagined in many quarters that the council would be in a position to review the financial proposals of any government, examine the merits of any particular expenditure proposed, and exert an influence upon a State Government with respect to the line of development it proposed to adopt. That is not the position. All that the Loan Council can do is to discuss the position with the representatives of the different governments, and determine exactly what both the local market and the overseas market can stand, as well as to maintain proper terms and kenp up our credit. In that way there certainly is a limitation, but only before the event. A limitation would, in any ease, be inevitable. If Australia endeavoured to borrow the amount required Mr Bruce. Validation BiU. to carry out a ful l programme at a time when obviously the market could not stand it, the terms offered would be unacceptable. Those who are concerned about the sovereign rights of the States should remember that if there is any infringement of those rights there is absolutely the same infringement of the sovereign rights of the Commonwealth. But the thorough examination of the position will show that there is no interference with the sovereign rights of either party. These provisions governing loan operations will be of the greatest benefit to Australia. It is essential to place the public debt on a better basis, and to get rid of the difficulties which have confronted both the Commonwealth and the States from the beginning of federation. This arrangement for the consolidation andgradual amortization of the debt by means of a sinking fund will be most productive of good in the years to come. We can appreciate that belter if we consider the effect upon our credit of the existing uncertainty and the competition of numerous borrowers in the markets of the world. An illustration which I have mentioned on a previous occasion is the best I know, and is worthy of being put before the House again. The officials of the Commonwealth Treasury have calculated that if Ausof the Loan tralian credit had stood as high in 1927 as the credit of New Zealand we should have received £1,000,000 more for the interest we paid. Having regard to Australia's resources and population in comparison with those of New Zealand, our credit, instead of being lower should have been infinitely higher than that of the Dominion. I shall mention another instance of what happened in the absence of a body to determine the basis upon which governmental borrowing should take place. In December, 1925, the Loan Council, consisting at that time of representatives of five States, decided that no government should pay more than 5^ per cent, for loans issued at par. That decision was accepted by New South Wales also, although that State was not represented on the council, and was rigidly observed. During its continuance, £1S,720,000 of new money was raised in Australia, and £28,435,000 of maturing war loans were converted on those terms. Eventually, however, New South Wales, stand for tlie principle of federation. It would not being able to get its loan requirements seem from the borrowings arranged by the be within their own borders, there is only one Loan Council, and being in urgent need proper standard to be observed in the money of money, offered 5-i per cent, for money markets. By thus assuming responsibility for over the counter. Immediately the price Australia at which loans could be issued deprestanding in what are likely to be its two ciated, and instead of the Commonwealth principal banking centres in the future, issuing at par its £36,000,000 conversion London and New York. loan at the end of 1927, it had to accept Those two extracts will give the House £98 10s. If New South Wales had uot an idea of the impression that the agreedeparted from the arrangement the Comment between the Commonwealth and the monwealth would have floated the money States has created abroad. at par. That is a very good illustration would be a tragedy if the agreement were of the effect of competitive borrowing. rejected, because unquestionably that It is desirable that we should realize action would do incalculable damage to bow the arrangement between the ComAustralia's credit in the principal money, monwealth and the States in regard to markets of the world. the control of borrowing is regarded in those markets in which we have raised money and upon which we shall have to depend to some extent in the future for have heardof the funds required to develop Australia. The Financial News, one of the leading financial papers in Great Britain, said, on the 2nd June, 1927I f by the referendum vote the public in possibly too generous to the States, ensurAustralia approve of the 'determination to straighten thing's out in regard to sinking ing as it does the stability of their funds, public credit from that fact alone will finances by pledging the revenues of the he lifted to an extent which will make the Commonwealth too far into the future.

Some of the less the Premiers' Conference at Melbourne is n also to be recognized that whatever the political liberties of confederated States .may State debts and for future loan operations has undoubtedly improved its credit I think it I turn now to that portion of the agreement which adjusts the financial relations the Commonwealth and the States. I the agreement criticized on many grounds. The allegation has been made that it is ungenerous to the States. My reply is that, if there is any ground for criticism, it is that the agreement is practicable, that a better scheme than that been devised for adjusting the financial position whicli had developed tion for that system; it is the most unjust It is of population than any of the other States developed States may have a greater percentage increase, but that is not worth much, having regard to the fact that the population of New South ""Wales is about 2,400,000, and that of Western Australia about 400,000. It is on the numerical increase,-not on the percentage increase, that the per capita payments are made, and if they continued-assuming that the Commonwealth Government could stand up to them-increasingly would be paid to New South Wales, and comparatively small sums to a developing State like Western Australia. could that arrangement be accepted as the most equitable way of dealing with the problem? Surely the financial assistance granted by the Commonwealth to the States should be based upon the needs of the individual States, in order, as far as possible, to bring about uniform development and prosperity throughout Australia. achieved by paying a tremendous sum annually to a rich State like New South Wales, with a large population capable of supplying the financial needs of the State, and only a small sum to Western Australia, which has to face a problem of development that is far beyond the capabilities of a mere handful of people. We must have something better than the per capita system to meet the requirements of the Australian people. It is true that if the per capita system were continued, each individual State would, over a long period of years, receive more than under the agreement, although by the latter, every State will receive more from the Commonwealth for some years. The people who support the per capita system because eventually each State would get more from the Commonwealth than under the agreement, overlook the fact that there is no guarantee that the per capita payments would continue indefinitely. There is a school of thought, a mutual agreement with them. We said to which I frankly admit I belong, that believes the per capita system to be iniquitous. Travelling about Australia, I have met a tremendous number of people who hold that view,, and indeed the case against the per capita system is so overwhelming that inevitably within a few years the people would revolt against it. The Commonwealth finances too would prove insufficient. The Federal TreaMr Brvoe. sury could not continue for ever paying to the States 25s. per head of their population. Some honourable members may be entirely in favour of that system to-day, but I ask them to look ahead and imagine themselves, or their successors in five or ten years being required-as inevitably they would be, because of the growth of Australia's population-to increase taxation large sums from year to year so that the Commonwealth might hand annually increasing amounts to the States, to be expended by How them uncontrolled by the taxing authority. To expect the Commonwealth Government to take the responsibility of raising the enormous amount that would be required year by year in the future to keep up the per capita payments, and so make smooth and easy the financial path of well developed and thickly populated States, would be to expect a most amazing reversal of human nature. No one who That result could never be has looked at this problem dispassionately and carefully could imagine that the per capita payments could continue without alteration for even another ten years. I have been arguing so strongly against the per capita payments that I have perhaps exposed my flank to the very heavy charge that in the agreement I have virtually consented to the continuation of the payments for another 58 years. That would be a just criticism of the attitude that I have taken. But we had to face the fact that since 1910 the States had received a per capita payment of 25s. per head, and that previously they had received a considerably greater revenue from the Commonwealth. Consequently some State leaders took the view that the States had a vested right, to the payments, and that this Parliament should not by force majeure, deprive them of this source of income. Bearing this in mind, .the Government endeavoured to come to that we were prepared to contribute to the State revenues approximately £7,585,000-the amount of the per capita payment in 1926-27-in the form of interest on State debts which we would take over. I pointed out, however, that it seemed to me to be unjust to allocate the amount on a purely per capita basis without taking into consideration the unquestionably greater needs of some of the States. Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania saw the force of my argument that in the event of the £7,585,000 being dealt with in this way the money should be allocated on other than a purely population basis; but New South ""Wales and Victoria considered that it was a positive outrage for such a suggestion to he made. We then suggested that the amounts should be distributed in relation to the amount of the debts of the various States. I pointed out that that would mean a contribution of 1.18 per cent, to each State, whereas distribution on a per capita basis would mean 1.25 per cent, upon the State debt of New South Wales; 1.55 per cent, upon that of Victoria; 1.07 per cent, on that of Queensland; 0.83 per cent, on that of South Australia; 0.78 per cent, on that of Western Australia, and 1.19 per cent, on that of Tasmania. South Australia strongly supported my view. I distinctly remember the enthusiasm of its delegates, for under the per capita distribution it would receive only 0.83 per cent, of its debt. It was im£807,000. It has been suggested by some possible, however, to reconcile the conflictpersons that the object of the Governing views of the States, and eventually it was agreed' that the amount should be distributed according to the several percentages that I have just given. No man on earth could have got the States to agree to the allocation of the money on any other than a per capita basis. This was the only acceptable solution of the problem, although I must confess that I do not tliink it just or equitable. The payments by the Commonwealth under the agreement will include £S01,000 annually in respect of the 2s. 6d. per cent, towards the sinking fund of 7s. 6d. per cent., which is to be built up to redeem the past debts of the States. The agreement also involves a settlement of the long standing and vexed question of the interest rate to be paid upon the value of transferred properties. Ever since federation, the Commonwealth has paid 3 per cent, on the value of these 1 properties, and although almost every State Government, irrespective of its political complexion, has endeavoured to get every Commonwealth Government, irrespective of its political complexion, to increase this to the ruling rate of interest or something near it, not a single alteration has been made. The question should have been settled long ago. Under this agreement the rate of interest will be increased to 5 per cent., which will represent an extra annual payment by the Commonwealth for all time of £165,000. In regard to future loans, the Commonwealth will contribute 5s. towards the 10s. to be paid into the sinking fund, which will represent an extra'payment of £100,000 annually by the Commonwealth in respect of every £40,000,000 borrowed by the States. In 1927-28 the amount payable to the States under the per capita system, would have been £7,741,000, whereas the amount paid under the agreement was £8,569,000, or an increase of £828,000. In 1928-29, the amount payable under the per capita system, would have been £7,S71,000, whereas the amount which will be paid under the agreement will be £8,678,000, or an increase of ment in urging the acceptance of this agreement is to obtain some advantage for itself and to embarrass the States. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the next few years the Government under this agreement will pay more to the States than it would have paid had the per capita system been retained. The payments under the agreement will be greater for the next three or five years at least, than they would have been under the old system. The fact of the matter is that the Government is pressing for the acceptance of the agreement for most disinterested reasons. If it is accepted we shall be obliged to raise almost £1,000,000 more revenue per annum for all the years that we shall yet remain in office, than would otherwise have been needed to meet the extra payments to be made to the States. We ask honourable members to accept the agreement, because we earnestly believe it to be the best that could be obtained. We also think that it provides an equitable solution of this long neglected problem. It has been suggested in some States, that if the agreement is accepted it will bo a final determination of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, and that thereafter no State will ever be granted a penny more by the Commonwealth than it is entitled to under the agreement. Evidence is already available to prove that this is not the case; for since the agreement was made, the arrangement for granting financial assistdiminution of the per capita payments ance to Tasmania has expired, but the Government has intimated that it will be renewed and that if, at the termination of tbe fresh agreement, Tasmania still requires assistance, it will be granted. Asu matter of fact, the agreement will make it possible for the Commonwealth to render assistance to the States on a more equitable basis than in the past. The payment for all time of a per capita grant to well developed and thickly populated States could not be justified, but there is a good deal to be said for the granting of assistance by the Commonwealth to 'Struggling States of large area and small population. I have made it quite clear in the course of my public utterances that the policy of this Government is to grant all the assistance it can to struggling and undeveloped States, and so long as it remains in office it will continue that policy they insisted upon honourable gentlemen in order that the undeveloped States may be brought to the same stage of development as the more thickly populated ones. During the election campaign, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) said that if his party were returned to power, it would restore the per capita payments to the States; but I have not yet seen a definite statement by the honourable gentleman as to the amount of money that would be made available for this purpose, or the period for which the payments would be continued. Did the honourable member mean that by an alteration of the Constitution he would provide for all time for the payment of 25s. per capita to the States? Minister read the printed copy of the Labour platform, which I sent to his office so rhat he might have definite information on the point?

They will, however, have the utmost difficulty in gaining; support for such a proposal. Opposition members now show an amazing sympathy with the States. They would not reduce the payments to the States by one farthing. They must-have forgotten, however,, what took place in 1911, when the Labour Government of that day took the best part of £3,000,000 from the States at onestroke. The States should remember that, not the Prime episode when they are asked to considerthe protestations of regard for their financial safety which are now beingmade by honourable members opposite.

136,Mr Bruce,"Then I suggest thatthis Government has never done anything for Tasmania. That is the unkindest cut of all, because no government has ever done more for that State than this Government. The question submitted to the people by referendum was whether we should alter the Constitution. I was studiously careful, when speaking on the subject, to point out that an affirmative vote would not amount to an endorsement of the financial agreement. I felt that it was only fair to say that, so that the people might know the facts. But I did not stay at that. In my speeches throughout the election campaign I stressed the need for the ratification of this financial agreement. I made that one of the major planks of the Government's policy, and there is no doubt that the great majority of the electors, notwithstanding my desire that there should be no misunderstanding, voted in the affirmative on the referendum in the belief that, by so doing, they were voting for the financial agreement. The sentiment of Australia is in favour of the agreement being validated and made permanent, so that we may obtain a final and definite adjustment of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. I come now to the attitude adopted by the representatives of the States when discussing the agreement, and I ask honourable members opposite to read the speeches of the Premiers who attended the conference at which it was adopted. Honourable members opposite pretend that the representatives of the States were forced to accept the agreement. Well, these are the words of Mr Collier, the Premier of Western Australia, regarding itI do not think there is any possibility of getting as good an agreement under any other conditions. The fact that we are going to be secured in our position for 58 years justifies its adoption by Parliament and the people of the State. I do not fear that we are going to suffer in any way in regard to the money we require for development, or even that there will be any surrender of sovereign rights which will affect the future of the State in any way. There are many advantages in the agreement. Sooner or -later Australia had to face the question of the control of borrowing, and this is a very fine step in that direction. As mentioned in the Constitution, sooner or later adjourned. [24 ] the Commonwealth would have had to consider taking over the States' debts, and that is accomplished under the agreement. Sinking fund payments are provided foT in which the Commonwealth and the States will participate. The gains to the Commonwealth as a whole will be the more effective control of borrowing, the more effective and searching investigations of the borrowing programmes of the different States, and of the Commonwealth itself, the regulation of borrowing on the market. Mr Hogan, then the Labour Premier of Victoria, was another of the gentlemen whom, the Opposition say, I forced to accept the agreement, but who expressed his approval of it. I am afraid that honourable members opposite must abandon that line of argument. Surely the State Premiers and the State Parliaments are able to speak for themselves on this matter without their assistance! My experience has been that the quickest way to rouse the ire of the State Premiers and Parliaments is for the Commonwealth to interfere in their affairs. Whether the agreement is advantageous to the States is a matter for their own determination. This House endorsed the agreement and it has since been ratified by all the State Parliaments. Surely we can leave the matter there! Our duty is to consider the agreement from the Commonwealth point of view. To those who oppose its ratification, I would point out that opposition is useless unless a better scheme can be suggested. Furthermore, we have arrived at this position: that, should all the States and the Commonwealth concur, the agreement may be varied and improved. If the Opposition has an alternative scheme which it considers is better than that which we have made, it will be able, when it gains office at some future date, to ask the States to accept that scheme in place of what is now agreed to. But at this stage I strongly urge the House to accept the agreement as it stands, because it is essential, in the national interests, that it should be ratified by this Parliament. It is the only practicable solution of the financial problems that confront us, and when it has been validated the credit of Australia will be enhanced, and ultimately it should stand as high as that of any other country in the world..",38,Financi Al Agreement Validation Bill Second Reading

That is what' the Government That the bill be now read a second time. listened with pleasure to the speeches of the new members of the Opposition, and I wish to compliment them on their oratory. They are undoubtedly valuabl 0 additions to the debating strength on that 6ide of the House. The subject-matter of the bill was discussed at great length before and during the election. policy of the Government has been endorsed by the people, and there is little need for me to go over old ground. I shall vote for the bill for several reasons. I am sorry that it was necessary to introduce such a measure. Unfortunately, a number of men who sought the protection of the Arbitration Court and promised the judge of that court that if he would expedite the hearing of their plaint they would obey his award, flouted it as soon as it was made. They not only refused to continue at work, but also endeavoured to prevent other persons from operating the transport services. If honourable members opposite had been in office, what action would they have taken to secure the transport of goods? They fought tooth and nail, night and day, the measure that was introduced at the end of last session. Not many hours later they metaphorically went on their knees and begged the men to return to work. At the same time the Australasian Council of Trade Unions held a conference in Melbourne and passed resolutions advising the men not to return to work. The men followed the advice of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions and disregarded that of their elected representatives. There was a well-founded suspicion in the mind of the public that if our friends opposite had been in charge of the affairs of this country they would -have been prevented by some power within the Labour movement from doing what they knew to be right in the interests of the general community. If my friends lived on an island like Tasmania and saw ruin staring them in the face after ' a year of hard work, because some persons in Australia would not work or allow others to work, they would realize the necessity of keeping transport services ' did, and in the only way open to it under the circumstances existing at the time. The position was so serious that it was justified in the action that it took, and its action received the endorsement of the people of Australia. Honourable members opposite endeavoured to make it appear that because the Nationalist party lost a few seats, the people of Australia did not endorse this legislation. It was not the action of the Government in this The matter which caused it to lose seats in New South Wales and South Australia, but matters of purely local concern. This part of its policy was endorsed from one end of Australia to the other. I fought the. election on this issue and it is my duty to assist the Government to give effect to it. Protection had to be given to the volunteers. Frequently in the past men who have performed the work of others who have gone on strike have been thrown to the wolves at the termination of the conflict, and for years attempts have been made to prevent them from obtaining work. That sort of thing should not be allowed to continue. At present, those who wish to obtain work on the wharves must obtain a licence, and if there is misbehaviour on the part of any person who holds a licence the licence can be withdrawn. During my election campaign the statement was repeatedly made that the Government would fall down on the job and allow the volunteers to be sacrificed when the strike was over. My reply was that the Government would carry out its promises as it bad done before. No previous government fulfilled more faithfully than has this its promises to the electors. It is a cause for sadness that Australia should find herself in her present position. If we all worked together more harmoniously, our industries would be more prosperous. There is no reason, why an industry should languish because a unionist or any other man declines to work.
