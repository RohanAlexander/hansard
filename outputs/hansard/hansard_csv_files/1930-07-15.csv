The honourable member for Grey( Mr already made 10,000 trips between MelLacey) spent a considerable time in arguing that, because the Kyogle is unsuitable and costly to run, a modern ship to take its place is necessary. While I do not dispute what the honourable member said in that connection, I point out that he made no attempt to justify the action of the Government in disregarding the recommendation of the Public Works Committee that tenders be called in Australia for the construction of the vessel. Nor have we any explanation from the Minister of the Government's departure from that recommendation. was not here on Friday when an explanation was given. heard what the Minister said. But I did not hear anything which I regarded as an explanation of the Government's decision to ignore the recommendation of the Public Works Committee that tenders be called in Australia for the construction in order in saying that the Government's of the vessel. AlthoughI have listened to all the speeches on this subject to-day, I have not heard any attempt to show that, by constructing this vessel in Australia at a cost about double that at which it could be built overseas, any special benefit will accrue to Australia. The honourable member for Lang( Mr country, or indeed that it will be a key Long) said that the Kyogle is a small ship, about 25 years old, and had, therefore, been in commission five years beyond the span of usefulness for a vessel of its kind. I do not pretend to be an expert in these matters, but I am reminded that the 12,000-ton steamer on which I came to Australia 22 years agoI refer to the White Star liner Persic, then, at least, 20 shipping companies trading on the Ausyears old-wa s only recently ' sold for use as a whaler. Evidently the purchaser of the Persic, which must be over 40 years old, considers that the vessel is fit for use for some time to come. We have another example in the Edina, which, although 76 years old, was recently Proof that her frame is when she came off best in a collision in which she severely damaged another vessel with which she accidently came into contact. Although the Edina, which transported troops to the Crimea during the Crimean War in 1S54, has bourne and Geelong, I understand that the vessel is to be kept in commission for some years to come. In view of such evidence, it is, indeed, extraordinary that the Kyogle has reached a state of maritime senility at the age of 25 years. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr McTiernan) said that the Government's proposal was reasonable, proper and patriotic. In view of the enormous difference between the cost of constructing a new vessel in Australia, and its cost in Great Britain,'or in other ports of the Empire, I submit that the Government's proposal is unreasonable, and its misuse of the taxpayers' money improper. Makin) -Order! The honourable member is not in order in saying that the Government's proposal is improper. your ruling, Mr Speaker, I submit that if the honourable member for Parkes was proposal was proper, I should be within the limits of parliamentary propriety if I said that it was not proper. The honourable member for Parkes spoke of shipbuilding in Australia as a key industry. Does any honourable member say seriously that ship-building is a key industry in this industry wthin the next century? Surely ship-building in Australia can be described only as a very expensive hobby. The demand for ships in Australia is not sufficient to keep a dockyard fully employed. At best, the dockyard would work only intermittently in the building of ships. From the point of view of the tralian coast, the construction of ships in Australia is economically impossible. I have here some interesting figures relating to ship-building costs supplied by",33,Setup

4,. Mr Paterson,"Whil e I bow to the New South Wales Coastal Steamship Owners Association; but as some of them have already been quoted by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr give numerous instances of the enorParkhill), I shall not weary the House by quoting them at length. The manager of Walsh Island gave evidence which showed that a ship of the type required to replace the Kyogle could be built in Great Britain at one-half the cost of building it here. Surely evidence of that kind, coming from such a source, can be regarded as disinterested. If , however, the Government throws economics to the winds and decides that the ship shall be built in Australia, it should consider the recommendation of the Works Committee that tenders be invited for the work. In this connection I desire to give the House the quotations of three Australian tenderers in 1926, when the Queensland Labour Government invited offers for the construction of two hopper barges. It is interesting to note that on that occasion the Queensland Government accepted the tender of a British firm, because it undertook to construct the vessels for £58,000, whereas the New South Wales Government Dockyard wanted £134,800 to do the work. The tender submitted by Mort's Dock was £119,000, and that of Poole and Steele Limited, £93,000. My reason for quoting these figures is not so much to show the disparity between the British tenderer's price of"" £58,000 aud the £134,S00 quoted by the Government dockyard of New South Wales, glaring though that disparity is, but to call attention to the differences between the quotations of the three Australian tenderers. Between the prices asked by the New South Wales dockyard, and that of the lowest Australian tenderer, there was a difference of nearly £42,000. In other words, the tender of Poole .and Steele Limited was less than 70 per cent, of that of the Government dockyard. Seeing that that disparity between the quotations of Australian tenderers existed in 1926, may we not reasonably assume that a similar disparity would exist to-day, if tenders were invited? There is every reason to believe that other Australian firms would be prepared to build this vessel at a price considerably [5.31] I am surprised at the attiless than that quoted by the Government tude adopted by the honourable memJfr. Paterton. dockyard. Returning to the argument that ship-building in Australia is too expensive to be considered, I could mous difference in cost between ships built in Australia and in Britain. In 1922 an interstate company called for tenders for two cargo vessels. A Glasgow firm offered to construct them for £30,000 each. Identical specifications were sent to Walsh Island, and it is reported that the authorities there quoted £59,000 for one vessel and £56,000 for the other. In quoting these figures I am giving hard uncomfortable facts. The Fordsdale and the Ferndale, which were built at Cockatoo Island, cost £64 a ton and £58 12s. 6d. a ton, respectively. At the time that they were being built, British shipbuilders quoted £23 per dead weight ton. There are certain economic limits beyond which we cannot reasonably go in accepting tenders, even in order to give employment to our own people. The Postmaster-General admitted that the other day, even if other Ministers do not. Will any honourable member deny that the late Government rendered a service to Australia when, with a limited sum to spend in the purchase of up-to-date cruisers, it obtained two vessels from Great Britain for the sum that would have been necessary to purchase only one cruiser if built in Australia? Would any honourable member say that we would not be in a better position to defend ourselves with two modern 10,000-ton fast cruisers than with one such vessel, and that we were not wise to obtain two cruisers for the price that one would have cost us if it had been built in Australia? I consider myself as patriotic an Australian as any honourable member opposite, although I was not born in this country. I believe in giving Australians the first chance every time. But there are economic limits beyond which it would be folly for us to go. It would be much better for us to have this ship built in another part of the Empire than to build it here at double the cost. The Government's proposal is economically unsound. ber for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson).",33,Setup
5,Mr E. Riley (South Sydney),"Surely the first duty of a government is to find work for its own people. Seeing that probably the engineering and shipbuilding trades in Australia are suffering more than any other at the moment, it would be utterly wrong for us to have this ship built overseas. In my opinion the Government would commit a crime if it sent this work abroad and left the workers in the ship-building industry might make it necessary to provide our workers with a dole to enable them to live. The honourable member for Gippsland is concerned about getting the ship at the lowest possible price. He must be aware that the rates of wages of those engaged in the ship-building industry overseas are only about half those received by our workers in that industry. in England is very much lower than here. Those who advocate the spending of this money abroad are unfair to our own people. should not talk economic tommy-rot. mon sense. the Postmaster-General refuse to place his contracts locally? were entirely different. We have a first class ship-building plant and skilled mechanics available to do this work, and the Government would do wrong if itdid not place the contract with the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. The honourable member for Gippsland desires to be very generous to the people overseas. He has made it possible for them to buy Australian butter for 4d. per lb. less than nothing in the evidence submitted to the the Australian people have to pay for it. would guarantee that the difference between the price of this ship built here and sequently, the Kyogle might very well be the price of a similar ship built overseas would be no greater, comparatively, than the prices of Australian butter here and overseas, I should favour this work being done here. ber is prepared to tax our people in order to make possible the marketing of our [147 1 butter profitably in England, but he is not prepared to place the country at any financial disadvantage to enable this ship to be built here. Not very long ago the Cockatoo Island Dockyard quoted a lower price than .°uy of its competitors here or overseas lor the construction of two turbines for the generation of electricity, but a verdict was secured from the High Court which prevented the work here unemployed. That from being done at the dockyard. The men who would be engaged in building this ship are our fellow citizens and friends, and their interests should be considered. nor are they the friends of Australia if they want two for one. this instance the honourable member would regard the poorly-paid labourers overseas as his friends. I hope that the Government will adhere to its decision to have this work done at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. If the job goes overseas it will still further increase our , adverse trade balance. Before we give authority for this expenditure to be incurred we should satisfy ourselves that this ship is required. The summary of recommendations of the Public Works Committee contains the following two paragraphs:(«) That a new oil-burning steamer for lighthouse service on the western and northern Australian coasts be provided as early as practicable. (6) That tenders be called in Australia for the construction of the vessel. If lives were being placed in jeopardy by maintaining the Kyogle in commission, we should be justified in considering whether another ship should be built or boughtat, home or abroad; but there is committee to show that the lives of the the Government crew are being endangered by their continuing to go to sea in this vessel.

We should, in my opinion, instruct the Government, as a first move, to try to buy a ship already built. We should not commit the country to an excessively high expenditure in building a new vessel at the very time when we have before us a financial statement which provides for the largest expenditure ever budgeted for in the history of the Commonwealth. There has never been a time when we have had a greater number of unemployed in our midst, nor when poverty has been so rife. If we advertise in the press throughout the world for a vessel of this description I am satisfied that we should be able to obtain one for one-third or perhaps even a quarter of the £120,000 it is now proposed to spend in building one. If , however, we found that we could not buy a suitable vessel, and had to build one, we should call for tenders for the work from overseas as well as from local shipbuilders. It is only a business proceeding to invite all ship-builders to tender for the work. It is our duty to see that the money of the Commonwealth is judiciously spent, and not disbursed with wasteful prodigality. If we allow public money to be spent without proper consideration, we are not worthy to be members of this Parliament. I cannot accept the proposition of the Assistant Minister that because the Commonwealth Government has a dockyard, this work should be given to it irrespective large number of men who live in the elecof any other considerations, particularly as the manager of the dockyard indicated in the evidence he gave before the Public Works Committee that a vessel of this type could probably be obtained overseas at half the price it is proposed to pay for building it here. I advocate the purchase and use of Australian-made goods so far as is reasonably possible, and believe that we should encourage Australian industry in every practicable way, even in providing our own personal requirements. I certainly buy Australian goods whenever I can reasonably do so. If we were being asked to give a preference of, say, 15 per cent, to Australia in this case, no objection would be taken to that, and it is frequently given in government contracts, but it is beyond all reason to expect us to give a preference Sir. White. of 50 per cent, or 75 per cent. Any one in private business would be forced by economic considerations on the prices quoted to have this work done overseas. I submit that if we are satisfied that the ship should be obtained, and we cannot buy one already built, the ship-builders of Australia, as well as ship-builders overseas, should be invited to tender for the work. Mort's Dock would doubtless tender if given the opportunity to do so. There is a ship-building yard at Williamstown in Victoria, which had to cease operations because of the lack of work. It is entirely wrong, in my opinion, to give the work, without any competition, to a government dockyard in the electorate of a government supporter. As bounties are being provided for cotton grown in the division of Capricornia, and for sewing machines manufactured in the division of Bendigo, honourable members opposite think it is right to allow this ship to be built in the division of West Sydney; but I hold a different opinion. I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) say that the instruction to the Public Works Committee to inquire into this proposal came from the Treasury and not from the Lighthouse Department. It is rather strange that the committee should be asked to inquire into a proposal to place a valuable contract in a government dockyard which gives employment to a very torate of the ex-Minister who originated the inquiry; and that private ship-building firms here and overseas should be debarred from submitting a tender for the work. As a rule, government business enters prises are not conducted on economic lines. I do not mean only the enterprises controlled by Labour governments, but all government enterprises. Among the reasons for this is that the management has not the same incentive to make a profit, and that it has no fears about the result of conducting operations at a loss. The managers of private concerns know very well that if they cannot show a profit on their year's work the consequences may be serious to themselves. Seeing that we are passing through a time of severe financial depression we should not even contemplate spending such an enormous sum as £120,000 on a ship of less than 2,000 tons. In arguing that this work should not be sent overseas, because our wage standards were higher than the standards of ship-builders abroad, the honourable member for Lang( Mr Long) spoke in disparaging terms of the people who work in other countries for less money than our workers receive. Yet we shall have to borrow the money overseas to pay for this work. It is extraordinary that, although honourable members opposite decry the workers of countries overseas, they are quite prepared to borrow money from those countries to carry out extravagant undertakings of this kind, even though the adoption of that policy may bring ultimately disaster to Australia. The Government must realize that this is not a business proposition. The only sensible thing to do under the circumstances, if a ship must be built, is to invite tenders for the work from all ship-builders. If the Government desires to do something to make the conditions of the isolated lighthouse employees better than they are, it should spend a little money in equipping the lighthouses with wireless. There have been instances in which considerable inconvenience and grave risk to life have been incurred owing to the absence of wireless installation at lighthouses, as at Cape Don. Recently when two Australians were flying from England they were stranded there without communication with the outside world. If in a business-like way the amount which could be saved would be sufficient to instal wireless equipment at all lighthouses in Australia and thus the isolation and monotony of the lives of the light keepers would be lessened. Although it is proposed to spend unnecessarily a sum of £50,000 by constructing this vessel in Australia, the Government has announced that it could not spare a similar amount to keep a survey ship in commission on the Australian coast. Parts of the Australian coast are not properly surveyed, and in some cases navigators are compelled to use charts based on the discoveries of Cook, Flinders and Bass. severe maritime disaster should occur on the Australian coast the Government, which withdrew the survey ship from commission and a few months later proposes to spend three times more than the amount required to keep that ship in use merely to relieve the workers in a government dockyard, which until recently was in the constituency of a Minister, will be responsible. I intend to oppose the motion unless I can be assured that the construction of a vessel is necessary. If a steamer must be built, the proposal should be considered in a business-like way, and both private and government dockyards given an opportunity to tender. has been urged by honourable members opposite that there is no justification for the construction of a vessel such as that proposed. The evidence of Mr Wallach, the Director of Lighthouses and Engineerin-Chief of Lighthouse Services, is particularly interesting in this connection. The Kyogle, he says, is the only ship available for lighthouse service on the north-west coast of Australia, and has to visit 33 lights, beacons and buoys on a run of 5,390 miles. For many years complaints have been made of the insufficient lighting of this coast, which is of considerable danger to shipping, differing, as it does, in many important physical respects from other parts of the Australian coast-line. It is subject to monsoonal disturbances; there is an abnormal rise and fall in the tide; and the vessels there are from time to this proposition were handled time exposed to very heavy weather. These things make it extremely dangerous to shipping, and necessitate its navigation with extreme care. Mr Wallach statesThe north-west coast of Western Australia ought to have many more lights than are provided at the present time. lights to be provided? that a suitable vessel should be made available to attend to the existing lights. Mr Wallach's evidence continuesThe north-west coast of Australia is exposed to the full influence of the Southern Indian Ocean. We can enter the majority of the If a harbours only at high water. Further provision on that coast is essential; but we could",35,Setup

19,Mr Curtin,"No; the suggestion is not make it with present facilities. The lights Great Britain and the cost of building would need to be outlying from the shore, and a vessel would have to stand by while the construction work was in progress. During that constructional period we should require at least two vessels. He points out that although the Kyogle can work fairly satisfactorily in southern waters, it is impracticable for the vessel to render a proper service on the north-west coast. He further statesThe steaming radius of the Kyogle is too small, and she cannot carry the necessary amount of material to establish an automatic light. A perusal of Mr Wallach's evidence shows that the failure to provide safety measures on this coast is attributable in large degree to the absence of the requisite vessel for the necessary inspection of the lights. The Kyogle could work quite effectively in other localities, but the steaming distance between Fremantle and Darwin is so great that the vessel, apart from the question of sea-worthiness and cost of upkeep, is quite unsuitable for the service. Mr ""WHITE -Cannot the "" Cape"" vessels be used? not. intended for use on the north-west coast, but they are being utilized on. the Queensland coast. At present Australia is not iu a position to provide the required number of vessels of the proper type to render the service necessary on the Australian coast, particularly between Fremantle and Darwin. The question at present is whether, in view of our financial position, we are to entirely neglect a matter which is of such supreme importance to Australia. Apart altogether from the risk to human life on the Kyogle we have to consider the lives of the crews and passengers of ships travelling on the north-west coast of this continent. Expert testimony has been given to the effect that a vessel such as it is proposed to construct is required in order to ensure that this important section of the Australian coast should be well lighted. That should be sufficient to satisfy honourable members opposite. whether the vessel should be constructed in Australia or overseas. I admit that there is a considerable disparity between the price at which a vessel could be constructed in one in Australia. During the last four or five months we have been warned by those expert economists upou whom honourable members opposite place so much reliance that our adverse trade balance, which is one of our greatest difficulties, has been brought about by excessive overseas borrowing, and the fact that we are spending considerably more money outside than within Australia. One financial writer, who is the author of a pamphlet which has recently been circulated among honourable members, says that it is doubtful whether the borrowing of £100,000,000 in Australia would be more serious to the Commonwealth than, the raising of a loan of £25,000,000 overseas. He means that money borrowed outside Australia involves an almost perpetual obligation to pay money outside the Commonwealth. The money required to construct this vessel will be borrowed outside the Commonwealth: but if it is also expended outside Australia the position will be worse. If we are to provide £120,000 it is not uneconomic or unreasonable to ensure that it shall be expended in Australia. To purchase the. Originally those vessels were vessel in Great Britain would mean diminishing the purchasing power abroad of the Australian people to the extent of its cost. It is desirable that our manufacturers and primary producers should as far as possible have the best possible local market. It is, of course, economically unsound to pay a substantial percentage more to manufacture locally; the question is what is a. reasonable percentage. Mr Wnrr.E -1 5 per cent is the usual figure. which the Government is responsible. I seconded a motion submitted to the Public Works Committee that tenders be called in Australia, because I have found that the estimates of cost of public works are usually exceeded. I have always contended that if departments submitting estimates had to back them up with a definite tender, which might be accepted, they The question then arises would be more careful than if they merely had to put in a rough and ready statement of the probable cost.

I. felt that a case could be established for the construction of this vessel in Australia, and I also considered that it would be a safeguard to call for tenders in Australia to obtain an idea of the bedrock prices for which reputable firms would build the vessel.

The inquiries of the committee were limited to Australia, and to inquiries from certain officials in Australia. It seems honourable that no real attempt was made to ascertain if a second-hand vessel could be procured even locally, and I see no reason why the tenders should be limited to Australia. The estimates furnished by government officers vary so much that I do not pay much regard to that part of the evidence.

Wallach, the Director of Lighthouses in Victoria, thought that there should be two vesstis of this new type and that for the Commonwealth there should be a total of six ships in this service. Is not his recommendation so extravagant that it is not worth considering at all? He is apparently one of those officials who are always prepared to recommend increases in the cost of administering their departments. At a time like the present, such officers should be told that they must keep their expenditure within existing limits, and that, if they are unable to do that, other administrators will be found for their departments. The recommendation of the committee might have been more satisfactory if it had contained a comparative balance sheet showing the expenditure incurred in running the Kyogle, and the estimated expenditure in connection with the proposed new vessel. The annual interest charge for the new ship would be £7,000, the depreciation would amount to £5,000, and the oil consumption would involve an annual outlay of £2,500, a total of £14,500 apart from the annual cost of repairs which even a new ship would require. It is estimated that the repairs to the Kyogle cost £3,000 a year; coal, £6,900; and depreciation, £1,000; a total of £10,900. tion to another point that seems to have v escaped the attention of those honourable members who are willing to incur this large expenditure for the purpose of providing employment in Australia. The chief expenditure in the running of the Kyogle is in labour and wages. I have said, it costs £6,900 a year for the coal for this vessel, and £3,000 is spent on repairs. All that money goes out in wages in Australia. On the other hand, if we built an oil burner, in addition to paying intereston the capital outlay we should have to purchase the necessary fuel outside this country. If we changed over to an oil burner, there would be a loss of employment to the coal miners of Newcastle, and a loss of work to men employed in Fremantle and other ports where the repairs to the Kyogle are usually carried out. I hope that the honourable member for Fremantle has not overlooked the fact that the advocate of an oil-burning vessel neglects the interests ing the war period and in the years that Mr Nairn. Mr of workers in Fremantle and on the ships that carry coal on the north-west coast of Western Australia to those ports at which the Kyogle refuels. The chief advocacy of this ridiculous expenditure comes from honourable members from Sydney, who are anxious to provide work for the benefit of the staff at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. For too many years the taxpayers have been called upon to provide nourishment and succour for that class of worker. I have no bouquets to throw at the men employed at that dockyard. If they can build only one ship at the cost at which two vessels can be obtained from overseas, the staff there has not done its duty to this country, and if such men are out of employment it serves them right. them are returned soldiers. his country is no friend of mine; unemployment is what he deserves. The record of Cockatoo Island Dockyard, ever since its establishment, is that the work it turns out costs about double that of the same class of job overseas. Furthermore, it has not done good work. The two "" Cape"" ships, to which reference has been made, are not satisfactory. If we had purchased those vessels abroad, we should not only have saved 50 per Let me direct attencent, of the cost, but they would have been built by tradesmen who turn out honest work, which, apparently, we cannot obtain from Cockatoo Island Dockyard.

Taken generally, they do not call for a reply from me; but the remarks of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) impel me to speak in defence of the Australian workers who have been engaged in the ship-building industry in this country. The statements of that honourable member were absolutely groundless. We, who sit on this side, at all events, are fully aware of the appalling amount of unemployment that is in our midst at the present time. In that vast army of unemployed, there is a large number of workers who were engaged in the ship-building industry dur-",39,Setup

Among them are hundreds of returned soldiers, and also other men who were denied the opportunity of enlisting because the Government of the day considered that their services were of greater value in the fitting out of troopships and the construction of war vessels at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Many of these men have wives and families to support, and are at present on the verge of starvation. The Commonwealth has a responsibility towards the big army of ship-workers that was engaged at Cockatoo Island Dockyard constantly during the war years, and subsequently when naval construction was in progress there. If honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member for Perth, had their way, the construction of this steamer for the lighthouse service would be carried'out overseas, and these men would bedenied the opportunity to earn a livelihood. The honourable member for Perth, in a review of the activities of the Commonwealth in relation to ship-building, attributed to the ship-workers the whole of the blame for the high cost of construction and the lengthy period occupied in completing a vessel. He said that the plight in which these unfortunate men find themselves today is one that they should have expected; that it serves them right; that he has no bouquets to hand to .them; and that they have not turned out a good job. I give an emphatic denial to that ascertion. No one can question the quality of the workmanship in the ship-yards under the control of the Commonwealth, or of the New South Wales Government, or in the different privately-owned yards in three or more of the States. A few weeks ago, I ^received from a man whom I know very well, and under whom I worked for a number of years at Cockatoo. Island Dockyard, a letter that illustrates the serious plight in which these men are placed. His case is typical of that of a large number of men who are anxious to get employment, but who, on account of the anti-Australian policy adopted by the Bruce-Page Government, were denied the right to work in our ship-yards. I speak feelingly on this matter, because I know that many of those who occupy the Opposition benches to-night were a party to what many people describe as a treacherous act-the placing overseas of an order for the construction of two cruisers, the building of which in Australia would have provided employment for these people. If the National and Country party members still occupied the treasury bench, the order for the construction of this lightship would be given toa ship-builder on the Clyde, at Belfast, or elsewhere. The letter that I have received readsI find this letter most difficult to con, but economic pressure is the compelling force. Could you lend me £5? I will repay you as soon as 1 get a position. It is only to enable us to get fiiod. You can well understand our position when I am driven to make this request. If you have a discarded suit and or boots I'would be thankful to accept. You know Henry Lawson's lines ""When your pants begin to go "". I would not be worthy of my manhood, and much less of the position that I hold, if by any utterance or vote in this HouseI supported the construction of this vessel overseas. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn), said in effect that our ship-workers had adopted go-slow methods, or dishonest practices, during the time that they were employed in the ship-building industry. I have had many opportunities of observing the manner in which these men carry out their work, and the diligence with which they apply themselves to it. There is no comparison between the work that they do, and that which is done overseas, in regard to, not only the speed of their operations, but also the quality of their workmanship. The honourable member said, ""Let us go somewhere where we can get an honest job; we cannot get it at Cockatoo."" Such remarks are not worthy of an honourable member of this House; they decry the fair name of not only this country', but also its skilled artisans. The honourable member claimed that we had obtained good ships from overseas. I have a fair knowledge of vessels that have come from' overseas, particularly the war vessels that were built there, from the time that Australia ordered her first torpedo boat destroyer up to the time that she received delivery of the two cruisers for which contracts were let by the Bruce Page Government. They did not specially commend themselves to me as fine examples of good craftsmanship. Many times I went over the old Australia from the upper to the lower deck, and even down to the fuel tauks. I inspected the riveting, the plating, and the other work that was put into that vessel, and did not consider that it compared in any way with the work that was put into the locally-built cruisers Adelaide. The fact must not be overlooked that the submarines Oxley and Otviay were purchased overseas, and that the purchasing of these two submarines from overseas has proved to be a very costly transaction for the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Perth should remember that those two submarines were not out of English waters very many days when they were obliged to call in at Malta, wliere they remained for a considerable time to have remedied certain serious defects that had been revealed. Australia has received a very unsatisfactory article when she has placed orders for naval construction overseas. What can we expect, seeing that these vessels are built by contractors whose employees are in receipt of piecework rates. The chief concern of those E iece-workers is not the proper driving ome of the rivets, or the faithful execution of shipwork, but the amount of work for which they receive payment. workmen at Cockatoo Island Dockyard have always done excellent work. ought to be sent to the Clyde to demonstrate the manner in which ship-building operations should be carried on. up as an authority. During the last seventeen years, however, I have had opportunities to examine ship construction, not only in Australia, but also on the Clyde and iu Belfast. I have met many men who were attracted to our shores as a result of the policy of the Fisher Labour Government, of having war vessels constructed in Australia. We have an obligation and a responsibility to the riveters, platers, caulkers, and other shipyard workers who were induced to come to Australia. For a number of years they were provided continuously with employment; but, unfortunately, owing to the policy of the Bruce-Page Government, that continuity was broken, and these men have* been obliged to pick up a few paltry shillings in the trimming of hedges and at other casual, unskilled labour, instead of being employed in the service of the nation. I regret that there was in office for so many years a government that had such an anti-Australian outlook, and that had two cruisers built overseas at a time when thousands of Brisbane and competent ship-workers could not obtain employment in this country. The construction overseas of those cruisers, which involved Australia in an expenditure of £5,000,000, was just as injurious to the best interests of this country as would be the action of an Australian firm in placing overseas an order for £5,000,000 worth of manufactured goods. Some very fine vessels have been constructed in Australia. The Fordsdale and the Ferndale are typical examples. Ship-building authorities, both here and overseas, have expressed tinopinion that they had only one faultthey were too good. It is true that the cost of ship-building in Australia has been excessive; but the fault for that rested not with the workers in the industry, but with the unsympathetic supervision of the naval overseers, who were not at all concerned about the speedy completion of the vessels. They themThe selves were imported from overseas, and their outlook was anything but Australian. The longer a ship was on the stocks, the longer their job lasted. It is not suggested that those men should share the blame. The contention always is that the shipyard worker, who receives a few I do not set myself paltry pounds a week for working in all weathers and under dangerous conditions at great heights, is wholly to blame. The real trouble has been that wo have not in the past made an earnest attempt to establish the ship-building industry in this country. Had Australia not suffered the blight of Nationalism for a period of twelve years, we would be able to-day to roll our own plates, and thus be independent of supplies from overseas. Wheneveri t is decided to build a vessel for tbe Customs Department, the navy, or any other governmental activity, plates, angle irons aud other materials needed for their construction have to be imported. Big firms like John Brown and Company are given the contract to supply those materials.

They supply their own requirements first, with the result that Australian builders are subjected to delays extending sometimes over months and months. It is not a matter of go-slow tactics on the part of the workmen, but of interruptions and delays in delivery of materials from the other side. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) referred to the recommendation of the committee that the lightship be an oil-burning vessel. All of a sudden he became very solicitous for the welfare of the coal-miners, though it is not very long ago since he and those associated with him were anything but solicitous regarding them. accused the Government of fathering a proposal for the construction of an oilburning ship which would deprive the coal-miners of the opportunity of hewing coal. Apparently this man would endeavour to stem the onward march of progress. For the sake of the coal-miners he would forbid the use of oil-burning ships. His attitude is absurd. One might, as well say that up-to-date machinery should not be introduced in the textile mills because it might throw some workers out of employment. Where is the honourable member's solicitude for the army of shipyard employees, many of whom have been out of work for several months? This is our only opportunity of providing them with employment. My only regret is that we are not building several vessels instead of one. I am sorry that we are not building in Australia all the ships necessary to carry out our own Australian services. The Commonwealth Government should set an example in this respect to the State Governments and other local activities to obtain their requirements within Australia. The placing of an order for the building of vessels overseas would set a very bad example to the State governments and private shipping companies. Honourable members opposite referred to employees in Australia. It is true that there is a great difference between the wages paid here and in the Old Country, but the same can be said of the textile and other industries. That consideration, however, did not deter the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) from increasing duties and assisting local industries when he was Minister for Customs. creased duties other than revenue duties. we should protect the textile industry in Australia, it is only proper that we should also protect the ship-building industry. We should do that much in the interests of the nation. It is essential that we should build up a ship-building industry in this country. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) said that ship-building was not a key industry, and that we could not expect He to establish it here within 100 years. Have honourable members ever heard anything as hopeless as that? An isolated country like this, with a coast-line of thousands of miles should not be dependent for its ships on overseas sources of supply. We should prepare ourselves to meet a national emergency. Do honourable members opposite suggest that if we were confronted with such an emergency we should hold up our hands and cry "" KameVrad"" ; that we should ask our enemy to give us notice of hi3 intention to attack us so that we might establish a ship-building industry, and train skilled workmen to do the job? We must learn to depend on ourselves. Even though it cost an extra £30,000 or £40.000 to build this ship in Australia, it will be money well spent. We may regard it as a contribution to our national defence. Such a sum fades into insignificance compared with the hundreds of thousands of pounds which were simply wasted by the Nationalist Government. They might as well have poured the money down a sink. Honourable members opposite have nothing to say against those extravagances, but when it is proposed to provide employment for a few hundred ship yard workers, they hold up their hands in horror, and suggest that the work should be done overseas. the high wages paid to shipyard project altogether.",42,Setup

The honourable member for Perth had a lot to say about the go-slow tactics and dishonesty of Australian workers. Mr .NAIKN -Not in general; only of those at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. members opposite and others that they have been very silent regarding the misdoings of certain shipbuilders in this country.

Ship-building employees will, if given the opportunity, render faithful service, either to the Commember for Lang( Mr Long), and one monwealth or to private ship-building firms. The people of Australia would be sorely disappointed if the Government were to listen to the pleadings of honourable members opposite, and let this work go out of the country. I have sufficient faith in the Government to believe that it will go ahead and do the right thing. Honourable members opposite have suggested that the proposal to construct this be called in Great Britain and Australia. lighthouse ship is the result of conversaHe received little support for his motiou, tions between the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), and two or three highly-paid public servants.

Neither did the Assistant Minister( Mr Beasley) give the House any information as to whether the Government proposed to I remind honourable carry out the recommendation of the Public Works Committee. It is unusual for a recommendation of the committee to be debated at any length in the House. It is generally understood that the committee has done its work with such thoroughness that its recommendations may be accepted without question. The present case is different, however, because the Government proposes to depart from 1 did not hear anything from the recommendation of the committee. The Minister himself was silent on .that point, and it remained for the supporters of the Government to let the House know the recommendation of the committee is to be ignored, and that the lighthouse ship is to be built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. I listened to the honourable would not imagine from his remarks that he was a member of the Public Works Committee. The same might be said of the honourable member for Eremantle ( Mr Curtin). I have gathered from the record of proceedings of the committee that the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) moved that tenders for the construction of the lighthouse ship and the decision against him was arrived at by four votes to one. The honourable member for Barker( MrM . Cameron) moved that tenders be called in Australia, and this motion was seconded by the honourable member for Fremantle.

It is evident, therefore, that the honourable member for Grey, the honourable member for Lang and the honourable member for Fremantle, voted in favour of the proposal that tenders be called throughout Australia. speech this afternoon. I do not think tnat the honourable member was present. carefully to the speech. I was greatly surthe Kyogle is quite unsuitable for the prised at the manner in which the honourable member tried to wriggle out of the position in which he found himself. I have always looked on him as a broad minded person who would be prepared to stand by his convictions. There is a proposal before the House that a lighthouse ship be built at an estimember for Lang( Mr Long), saidmated cost of £120,000. The Public ""Works Committee, whose duty it was to examine the proposal, has decided that it would be wise that tenders be invited throughout Australia before the work is proceeded with. Prom the evidence which was tendered before the committee, there would appear to be ample justification for that recommendation. A naval architect, in private practice, gave evidence that the vessel could he built in Australia for £97,000, and that if it were built overseas it should not cost more than £70,000. The report of the committee states that there are three ship-building yards in Australia which would be prepared !o tender for this work. Honourable members on this side of the House are as anxious as are government supporters to encourage Australian production, but it is clear from past experience that we cannot build ships in Australia at anything approaching a reasonable price. Therefore, I suggest that if the Government is not prepared to have the ship built overseas, it should at least give effect to the recommendation of the Public ""Works Committee, which is a responsible body, and call tenders in Australia. I draw attention to one passage of the committee's report in which it is stated that as the result of evidence heard, the committee was of opinion that the round figure estimate of £120,000 for the construction of the vessel was high. That is a very deliberate opinion, and as it was justified by the evidence, there is every reason for postponing this expenditure. As to the need for building tbe vessel, the Public Works Committee saysThe committee is of opinion that the Kyogle has still some years of useful life, and recommends that, before any action is taken to dispose of her, a special investigation should be' made to ascertain whether she could be utilized with advantage elsewhere for lighthouse purposes. Western Australian coast. mittee's recommendation contradicts some of the statements made by honourable members opposite. Mr Wallach, Director of Lighthouse Services, giving evidence in reply to questions asked by the honourable I do not agree with the statement that the Kyogle has outlived its usefulness and is uneconomical. There is nothing wrong with the Kyogle. It is an excellent vessel for lighthouse work. The Kyogle has been properly maintained, and there is no reason why she should not render good service for many years yet. evidence the honourable member will find that the Kyogle is not considered suitable for the service in which she is now engaged, and that a new boat is required. dence carefully. I submit that the Government might easily make use of the Kyogle for two or three years longer, at least until the financial position improves and we can better afford a new vessel; but if it accepts the advice of the honourable member for Cook( Mr E. Riley) and builds a vessel in Australia, as trustee of the taxpayers' money, I trust it will endeavour to get the work done in Aus^ tralia as cheaply as possible. Of course, we do not want cheap or shoddy work on anything that is the property of the Commonwealth; we want the best. At the same time, we do not want to spend money simply .for the sake of spending it. To me it seems unreasonable to give the work of constructing this vessel to Cockatoo Island without calling for tenders, when there are other dockyards in Australia ready and willing to tender for the work.

For that reason I am pleased to note the manner in which the Commonwealth Government is grappling with the question of shipbuilding, and trying to do something for the safety of shipping and the merchant marine. On the Continent and in Great BritainI have seen great ship-building yards, and have realized what a great benefit it would be to Australia if the ship-building industry could be carried on here as successfully as I have seen it carried on overseas. I am indebted to the Public Works Committee for having investigated this proposal and for its recommendation. For my part I should be pleased if its sug-' gestion that tenders for this particular work should be called throughout Australia were adopted. That would enable the Government to give the work to the tenderer it thought best fitted to undertake it. It is always stipulated in government contracts that the lowest tender shall not necessarily be accepted, leaving it open to the Government to give any work for which tenders have been called to the contractor it thinks best fitted to undertake it. The Cockatoo Island Dockyard could very well undertake the work of building this vessel, and I should like to see the main work done at Cockatoo Island, but I think that we could spread the engineering work over the continent. In the South Australian Harbour Board and Islington Workshops .is installed some of the most up-to-date machinery in the world, and it would be quite a simple matter to arrange that these workshops should turn out some of the engineering work for the lighthouse steamer. There never was a time when employment was more needed than it is in South Australia to-day. As the evidence shows that the Kyogle, which has been doing lighthouse service work for a great number of years, is obsolete. Australia has probably the longest coastline of any country in the world, and a great many more lights are needed for the protection of life at sea, particularly on the north-west coast, the part of the coastline which this new vessel is intended to serve. The vessel, therefore, will, as time goes on, be of greater service than possibly it can be in the immediate future. The time has arrived, in my opinion, when we should build everything possible in Australia. The honourable member for Cook( Mr 0. Riley), has told us how previous governments have sent work out of Australia. We want to change that policy, and do as much as we can in Australia. We cannot possibly right our adverse trade balance by sending work overseas, and if we have to borrow the money locally to build this vessel, it seems to me that it is false economy to send that money away to pay for work done out of the country. So far as workmanship is concerned, Australia has the men and the materials, and can deliver the goods. I hope that South Australia will get at least a little benefit from the proposed expenditure, so that the unemployed position there may be somewhat relieved. During the course of his remarks, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill), said that there was not more than 15 per cent, of Australian workmanship in Australian-built vessels. He afterwards admitted that it might be 20 per cent. He was far from being correct, because all the material, except steel plates, used in building vessels at Walsh Island was supplied in Australia. I suppose the same remarks apply to vessels built at Cockatoo Island. The fact that the steel plates had to be imported was due to the lack of rolling mills in Australia. In the case of the boats Dorm an, Long built in Australia, everything",45,Setup
49,Mr Price (Boothby) [8.35],To,46,Setup
50,Mr Watkins (Newcastle) [8.41],"except the plates was turned out here. I agree with the suggestion that Australian tenders should be called for the building of this vessel. If from our two government-controlled dockyards, Cockatoo Island, owned by the Commonwealth, and Walsh Island, owned by New South Wales, we may find that the cost of construction is not as high as is now estimated. At any rate the ex-Treasurer promised that serious consideration would be given by the Commonwealth Government to the suggestion that prices should be invited in that way. All steamers built in Australia have stood the test of actual service. Many of them have been sold to private companies for practically a song. Australian-built vessels seem to be good enough when they can be acquired for next to nothing, and not good enough when required for lighthouse work. Ship-owners who are engaged in our coastal shipping are amply protected by Commonwealth legislation, and one would think that in justice to the people of Australia, who give them that protection, they would have their vessels built in Australia, but they do not do so. They get all the protection tihey can from this Parliament, and go to the cheapest market for their goods. I hope that before the Government comes to a final decision in this matter, it will call for prices in the way I have suggested. Question-That the motion be agreed to-put . The House divided. ( MR .

The justification for this measure is the urgent necessity to raise portion of the money that must be found under the budget proposals. In normal circumstances we should not be submitting a bill to increase the postal rates, because we feel that the postal department should not be used as a taxing machine.

We are collecting these extra amounts already and have been doing so for some time, but there has always been a doubt concerning the legal right of the department to make these charges. This amendment will regularize its action. All of the proposed increases in rates of postage are set out in the schedule. The first alteration relates to the bulk rate for newspapers. This rate is being increased from l ^ d . per 20 oz. to l£d. per 16 oz. A comparison with other proposed increases will show that the newspaper bulk rate is receiving a distinct benefit. At present the bulk rate is 25 per cent, lower than the ordinary rate; if the alterations are made as proposed, the bulk rate will be 43.75 per cent, lower than the proposed ordinary rate for newspapers. If the bulk rate remained unaltered it would be 55 per cent, lower than the proposed ordinary rate, which would be a difference too great to be justified. The bulk rate is calculated on an aggregate weight basis irrespective of the addresses of the individual packages comprising the whole consignment posted at the time, and there is consequently a greater concession in postage than the figures I have given show. The present bulk rate for newspapers is not remunerative. It must be remembered also that newspaper proprietors receive important concessions in regard to rates for press telegrams. rates be remunerative? telegrams be remunerative? being touched.

This is an innovation which it is proposed to adopt in order to extend to periodical publications other than newspapers, a bulk rate of postage. Having in mind the fact that Parliament has hitherto always accorded a special bulk rate of postage for newspapers, it is considered, particularly in view of the proposed increase in ordinary rates, that the proprietors of magazines, reviews and other similar publications should also be given some concession when their journals are published with the object of disseminating information of a general character to the public but are of a nature not coming within the definition of a newspaper. It may be mentioned that the bulk rate proposed for periodicals will also be of benefit to many newspaper proprietors who issue such publications in addition to a newspaper. At present they have to pay postage at the rate of Id. per 8 oz. per copy. The new bulk rate is 2d. per 16 oz. on aggregate weight, and like the newspaper rate, will be independent of the number of individually addressed packages contained in the consignment posted at the one time. The third amendment relates to the rate of postage on letters and postcards. The present rate on letters is l i d . per oz. and the proposed rate is 2d. per oz. The present rate on postcards is I d . each and the proposed rate l$d. each. The new rates will be the same as those in force in 1923, except that the unit of weight for letters was then half an ounce. The Commonwealth is compelled by its countries to retain the ounce as the unit of weight for overseas letters and it isconsidered desirable that it should be tralia as well as overseas.

The following paper was presented:Tariff Board's report and recommendation on Sewing Machines. Ordered to be printed. BILL. Debate resumed from 26th June (vide That the bill be now read a second time. dealing with the merits of this bill, I emphatically protest against the wasting of the time of the House upon a measure of this kind. Several times the House was definitely promised an opportunity to discuss the much more important proposals embodied in the various tariff schedules and the prohibitions imposed from time to time. wretched little bill relates to a bounty the House is asked to discuss it whilst hundreds of tariff items of incomparably greater concern to the people are kept in the background. The Government will not, or dare not, afford the House an opportunity to discuss the tariff schedules in detail before the session terminates. Perhaps the Government fears the publicity that will be given to the extraordinary failure of its tariffmaking unemployment statistics will startle honourable members as much as they startled afternoon that since the close of the March quarter the proportion of unemployment has increased from 14.6 per cent, to 18.5 per cent. At the close of the September quarter, a little more than nine months ago, the figure was only 12.1 per cent. ployment has increased by nearly 6 per cent, since the Government began its policy of tar iff-framing. I can conceive of no greater indictment of the recklessness based on crass ignorance which has attended the Government's overturning of the tariff. Of the promises of the Ministry one reminder will be sufficient. The Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 12th December as having said at the opening of an exhibition of Australian-made toys at Grace Bros., SydneyI t has been estimated by manufacturers in Australia that the Government's recent tariff proposals will result iu 30,000 new jobs immediately with a further 100,000 jobs available as soon as extensions have been made of existing plants. How has that prediction been fulfilled? So far from 30,000 more jobs being provided, an additional 50,000 of the one million trade unionists are workless, notwithstanding the multiplicity of tariff schedules. That was bound to occur. -Before Anybody but a fiscal fanatic knew that the entire overturn of the tariff system and the disruption of business at a time of economic depression would do more harm than good; it could not fail to cause industrial wreckage, injury to capital, and infinitely more loss and suffering to the workers. But because this -Order!

70,Mr Gullett,"Thes e remarks areone ordaining that whatever happens in Cabinet, whether it be the Government of the moment or of its predecessors, is never disclosed by any Minister. The honourable gentleman said that the Bruce-Page Government had over-ruled both the Minister for Trade and Customs and the permanent head of the Customs Department iu its decision not to grant assistance to the local sewing machine industry. I do not intend to follow the honourable gentleman in that course of action, but I tender him a word of caution. If he wishes to engage in a competition of that kind I should be quite pleased to enlighten the House as to the attitude of the heads of his department on a number of tariff measures that are now before the House, such as the sewing machine bill, and the cotton, galvanized iron, and flax measures. However, if the honourable member desires, I am quite content to lot the matter remain there. The sewing machine bounty bill is one of a series of tariff proposals conceived for the purpose of bringing about the manufacture of sewing machines within Australia. I ask honourable members to consider the part played by the sewing machine in the domestic life of this country, and, indeed, in that of every civilized country. Without exception, the 3ewing machine is the greatest money and labour-saving device at the disposal of hundreds of thousands of Australian housewives of moderate means. At any time it is a contrivance of first-class economic importance, but with the prevailing high cost of living, with so many homes on reduced incomes and many on none at all, the sewing machine has assumed special significance as a money saver. There are hundred of thousands of homes in Australia that are definitely economizing by using sewing machines more continuously than heretofore. I shall honourable members how this bill will modest means, in the interests of a few speculative capitalists. The measure has been brought down by the Government, not in the interests of existing industries but, so far as one can see, in the interests of a few venturesome company promoters. The proposal of the Government is to ensure that, some day, we shall make our own sewing machines in Australia. Meanwhile, as a result of the new bounty proposals of the Government, sewing machines are to cost the Australian housewife substantially more than they do at present, probably twice as much. mean cheaper sewing machines. able gentleman's tariff proposals were meant to bring about more work! Instead of creating 30,000 additional jobs immediately, they cast 50,000 to 60,000 men into unemployment. That is definitely the achievement of the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs. In the past, sewing machine heads, the actual mechanical sewing part of the machine, entered Australia duty free, while there was a moderate duty of 30 per cent, ad valorem on the table and stand. The Government's proposal is for a £2 bounty and a specific duty of 10s. British and £1 general upon each imported head, a duty of 75 per cent, upon the table, and one of 45 per cent, on the ironwork, together with a duty on the outside casing that previously entered free. The total duty charged, apart from the bounty, represents an increase of approximately 200 per cent. That is done not to keep an existing industry going, but to put easy money into the hands of a few company promoters in Australia. For some years it has been provided in the tariff that a deferred duty of £2 10s. may be charged on each sewing machine head imported into Australia. The Bruce-Page Government contended-and I think that its attitude was a reasonable one-that when it received a dependable assurance of the immediate capacity of the local manufacturers to produce 20,000 sewing machines a year, which represents endeavour to disclose to about 45 per cent, of our total imports, it was prepared to bring that deferred penalize the housewife of duty into action. This Government does not work along business lines such as those. Doubtless its intention, if Australian production reaches a certain stage, is to withdraw the bounty and to apply that deferred duty of £2 10s. a machine; but we know quite well from past events that instead of placing a duty",50,Second Reading

72,Mr Gullett,"Just as the honorof £2 10s. on each imported machine head, which equals about 70 per cent, of its value, there is a far greater likelihood of this Government imposing a straight-out prohibitive duty, if it is asked to do so by the local manufacturers. I now come to what I think is a gross unfairness, and a penalty upon those Australian housewives who are using sewing machines. The Government knows that it is quite impossible to provide this £2 bounty out of its depleted treasury. Although it terms this a national industry, it proposes to place an imposition of 10s. on each of the 40,000 sewing machines that come into Australia yearly, thereby'fining to that extent each Australian housewife who purchases a machine. foreign machine. sents 30 per cent, of our imports. The women of modest means, who buy sewing machines will have to pay the penalty, which will be at least £1 by the time the trading profit is imposed, all for the benefit of local prospective sewing machine manufacturers. unfair that the working women of Australia, who are endeavouring .to eke out a living in these bad times, when clothing is so dreadfully expensive, should have such a penalty placed upon a household necessity. It is one of the most wicked imposts introduced into this chamber in the guise of tariff making. It is a million to one that Australia will not manufacture sewing machines in commercial quantities for at least one year, but this 10s. to £1 on each imported machine will be squeezed out of the housewives of the country for a year for the benefit of the Treasury. by the importing companies. gentleman seriously contend that this £40,000 will be cheerfully contributed by kind importers, and not be passed on to the users of the machines? painful that a grown man should have to stand at this table and listen to childish prattle of that description. As soon as Australia is able to manufacture a few thousand machines this Government will place a big duty or a prohibition on imported m&chines. I want honourable members to consider the destructiveness of the proposal. I hold no brief for the importers, but I have as much respect for an Australian-born citizen who is engaged in the distribution in Australia of sewing machines, no matter what may be their country of origin, as I have for any other Australian. What will happen will be similar to what has happened in connection with other prohibited items during the past few months; there will be an accentuation of this unprecedented welter of unemployment. For the information of honourable members. I may state that one British company operating in Australia importing sewiiig machines has during the past three years employed an average of 905 persons in this country. £1 on each It has spent no less than £903,000 in salaries and commission during that period, and paid £167,000 to customs revenue. The loss of that and other revenue of a like nature has, of course, brought about the sales tax and the general chaos in Australian industry and business. During that time the company paid in income tax, exchange and duty It is grossly stamps an amount of £66,000, or a total expenditure in the Commonwealth in three years of £1,173,000, averaging about £400,000 a year. This is a time of unprecedented depression. The nation has a very small purchasing power, and. it is exceedingly difficult for manufacturers to obtain the capital necessary to expand their business. Expansion to-day is practically impossible. This is not the time to destroy a business that employs people. This is no time to disrupt and bring about chaos to a section of our citizens merely for some distant, visionary, problematical t gain. It is the failure to recognize that position that has landed the Government into the existing tariff mess. I have mentioned the position of'housewives who buy these machines for family use. There is also another class deservI t is ing of a great deal of sympathy, and that comprises thousands of women who use sewing machines in th'eir own private homes as a means of ful l or partial living. It is nothing but cruelty to place upon them, at the present time, a portion of this great welter of increased taxation. As far as I can work it out,",51,Second Reading

Of course, the Minister will say that the Australian manufacturer will not take advantage of this position, but will supply good sewing machines probably at about half the price at which they are being sold to-day. importers will bring down prices. ter ( Mr Forde) has, for the last six months, talked of my friends the importers, and charged me with free trade principles. My reply to him is that since this Government has commenced to give effect to its rotten tariff policy, unemployment has increased 6.4 per cent., and tens of thousands of good Australian workers have been ruthlessly thrown out of their jobs. Yet the Assistant Minister charges me with free trade principles! Let me say that the Government's tariff policy is the most stupid ever brought into this House. It is re-acting cruelly against the workers, and has made more enemies of this country both within and outside of the Empire, than has any other policy submitted to this Parliament. I come now to the practicability of this proposal. Is there a reasonable opportunity in Australia for the manufacture of sewing machines? It is common knowledge that some of the biggest sewing machine manufacturers in the world have, in recent years, visited Australia personally, or have sent their representatives here, to explore this manufacturing field. It must not be forgotten that the manufacture of sewing machines is largely mechanical. The labour employed is relatively small, and, furthermore, the production is cheap because mass production methods are employed. These manufacturers, or their representatives, have decided, one after another, that the Australian market has not yet developed sufficiently to justify local production. These men are highly specialized in this work, and their organizations overseas are 100 per cent, efficient. It would have been child's play for them to extend their operations in Great Britain by establishing branches of their works in Australia. Yet they decided not to do it. member that? be found in the records of the Customs Department. At Bendigo, a few years ago, there was one type of machine manufactured. I believe that it was an obsolete type; because the machine had practically gone out of sale in other countries. There are at least fourteen types of British and American household machines on the Australian market at the present. The evolution of the sewing machine has been rapid and progressive in recent years. The hand turning, and also the foot pedalling machines are giving place to an advanced type of machine that is operated by electricity. This later machine is covered by many exclusive patents, which are not available to an Australian manufacturer. They may be obtained in the future, but only with great difficulty. on the Singer machine. ister made a long speech in this House, but it was entirely devoid of information.

I have every reason to believe that this information is correct. In recent years the city of Kankakee, Indiana, to attract a large sewing machine plant, donated the land and buildings to Foley& Williams for the manufacture of reasonably priced sewing machines. In five years the plant went out of business, although the firm exported machines all over the world.

The White Sewing Machine Company's venture iu running a sewing machine branch factory at Guelph, Canada, proved a financial disaster in that country, which has a larger population than Australia. The King Sewing Machine Company discontinued manufacturing machines at Buffalo, where it had the most modern plant in America. Domestic Sewing Machine Company, with a world-wide name, discontinued its operations. Later, a portion of its machinery was disposed of to the White Company. I come now to the question of labour. The amount of labour employed in the manufacture of sewing machines is relatively small. member that? ber should not get so annoyed. As I have said, the sewing machine is the production in the main, of highly specialized machinery, and relatively little labour enters into it. I do not say that there is not a fair amount of labour employed, but, taken generally, it is relatively low. I eome now to the statement of the Assistant Minister that „ this new duty of from 10s. to £1 a head will not be passed on. justification for passing it on. ter saidTlie importers make over 100 per cent, gross profit on landed cost: therefore, I do not think they will be justified in passing the duty on to the public. The Minister cannot have it both ways. If there is to-day a profit of 100 per cent, between the landed cost and the cost to the user, surely in that margin there is plenty of opportunity for the Australian manufacturer to show us what he can do without this contemptible tax of from 10s. to £1 on the machines used by the working women of this country, a tax which is being imposed one year in advance of the time when a single bounty will be paid out of it. Let me refer again to the Assistant Minister's extraordinary second-reading speech. He showed little knowledge of the subject, and he made several most unfortunate slips as against his own case. He saidI visited the Bendigo company with the member for the district, Mr Keane, and received a deputation, which strongly urged that something should be done by tlie Government to assist the industry for four or five years while it was becoming established. He said that he visited Bendigo. What, an investigation! How long was he there? He received one deputation. He The talked the matter over with the honourable member for Bendigo, and arrived at the vague conclusion that in four or five years the Bendigo industry would be able to carry on, presumably without any assistance at all. vestigation, but on the investigation of the Tariff Board and a special officer of the department. manufacturing sewing machines in Bendigo. The company that did manufacture them went into liquidation years ago. I understand that the honourable member for Bendigo is at present endeavouring to find a little capital for its re-establishment. that company out of business. ordinary example of what must happen when tariffs are introduced in a wild and irresponsible fashion. As a result of this Government's tariff policy, unemployment has increased by. 6 per cent., and tens of thousands of workers have been thrown out of their jobs. Week after week, almost, new tariff schedules have been flung on the table of this house. [Quorum formed-.'] The Assistant Minister( Mr Forde) in one of his irresponsible statements said, "" When producing between 40 and 50 sewing machines weekly the original Bendigo company employed 60 hands"". He went on to sayThat means that if Australia can make all the sewing machines it requires constant employment will be found for nearly 1,000 workers in sewing machine factories, in addition to which local manufacture will immediately bring about a demand for raw material. The Assistant Minister did not give the wages paid to those 60 hands who were producing 40 to 50 machines weekly.

Another £5 has to be added for tbe table or stand, so that sewing machines were produced at Bendigo at a factory price of something like £10, which was £3 or £4 above the landed cost. That additional amount will have to be passed on to the working people in this country. To-day the landed cost of the sewing machine head is between £3 10s. and £4, to which the cost of the stand or table which averages £4 5s. has to be added. The Assisinitiated by the Government. I appeal tant Minister mentioned £1S to £20 as the selling price, but I think he will find matters to remain where they are, that the machine of which I spoke is sold for £12 odd, which gives a gross profit of about 50 per cent. that machine is correct. tant Minister selected the most expensive type. The selling of sewing machines is a costly business. A good deal of expensive canvassing has to be undertaken in order to bring them under the notice of prospective buyers, and this makes the profit of the importer look rather high. I appeal to honourable members to reflect before committing the country to the payment of this bounty and to an increased duty. I ask them to remember what has happened in the past six or seven months, and to ponder for some time before they support either the Minister( Mr Fenton) or the Assistant Minister in connection with these new tariff proposals. I ask honourable members to consider whether it is worthwhile, whether it is wise to throw the sewing machine business in this country into a state of chaos, aud unemployment? mission agents and travellers there are many good Australians who will be affected by this proposal. In dealing with closed by their attitude towards the this bounty, and those proposed on shale oil and flax, I ask honourable members to seriously consider our financial position, and ask themselves where the necessary money is coming from. ""We are in a desperate plight; we are piling up bounty after bounty, the money for which must ultimately be raised by taxation. The business community is in a state of uproar and the whole trade and commerce of the Commonwealth is dislocated. In addition to high tariff imposts additional direct taxation is to be imposed. Is this the time to substantially increase unemployment and cause loss to vested interests, or to impose taxation on existing industry in favour of this problematical industry of the future? Is it worthwhile? I suggest to honourable members that it is not. Our unemployment figures have increased to such an extent that we should attempt to arrest the progress of this foolish tariff policy to honourable members to allow to endeavour to prevent further interruption of trade, and to rehabilitate our existing industries. If we support the Government in proposals of this kind it will lead to more wreckage and additional unemployment and misery. To me this is the last straw. Taxation should not be imposed in this way. It is in the interests of only a few who may be employed in Bendigo or in Sydney, but it will have a serious effect upon the whole community. It is unreasonable to impose a tax of from 10s. to 20s. per head in respect of the 40,000 sewing machines annually imported into Australia, and fully 90 per cent, of which are purchased for use in the humble homes of the workers. I ask the House not to support this proposal, as it is economically unsound and exceedingly foolish. amazed that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett), in opposing the payment of a bounty on sewing machines, should have the temerity to introduce the subject of unemployment.

The late Mr Pratten, when Minister of Customs, was in favour of a bounty; but something happened, as the Prime Minister of the day ( Mr Bruce) turned down the proposal, and a bounty was refused to the company which was then operating at Bendigo.

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that the Assistant Minister for Customs( Mr Forde) disclosed a Cabinet Government refused to grant a bounty to this industry; but the directors of the old company, the press in the electorate terested in this project, knew long before the Assistant Minister made his announcement that the payment of a bounty had been refused by the previous Government. Australia buys 45,000 sewing machines annually, and the Government suggests that a bounty be granted to local manufacturers, and that a duty be placed on imported machines.

In New South Wales, 46 per cent.; in Victoria, 56 per cent.; in Queensland, 33 per cent; in South Australia, 57 per cent., and in Western Australia, 48 per cent, of the people reside in the metropolitan area.

In Bussia, it is 1.1 per cent.; in Switzerland, 3.73 per cent.; in overcrowded Japan, 3.34 per cent.; in England, 11 per cent., and in France, 7 per cent. Over one-half the population of four States of Australia reside in the capital cities, and, in each instance, those cities are located on the coast. The hope of this country lies in the encouragement of manufacturing industries, not in the capital cities, so much as in country centres. Workers in the country are not handicapped by bad housing and sanitation, and impure air. The advent of the industry which this bill is designed to assist should lead to the establishment of other industries in inland cities throughout Victoria and the other States.

I believe that in this matter the Government will have the support of the Country party, because its policy in regard to decentralization is identical with that of the Labour party. Some of the arguments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in regard to unemployment will be refuted by the establishment, of the industry, because from 50 to 200 workers will be provided with regular employment. As boys and girls reach the school leaving age there will be an opportunity for them to take up a skilled occupation. Whether it is established in Sydney, Bendigo, Maitland, or Adelaide, this industry is worthwhile. supply a long felt want, aud furnish to the United States of America, Great Britain, Germany, and other countries evidence of the fact that in the manufacture of sewing machines Australia can produce an article as good as, if not better, than can be produced overseas, and certainly for a lower price. Before dealing with the specific proposal to pay a bounty on the production of sewing machines in Australia, I should like to say a word or two with regard to my attitude towards bounties generally. When the manufacture of any article takes place on a comparatively small scale in this country I regard the bounty method as infinitely preferable to the tariff method of protecting that industry. For one thing the amount of toll taken by an industry can be very definitely measured. One knows just how much it is indebted to the Treasury, whereas, when, a duty is imposed, it is sometimes very difficult to measure the exact amount of toll taken from the general community. Another advantage of assisting by bounty an industry which produces only a small proportion of the community's requirements is that the price of the article is kept down to a thoroughly competitive level. It is true that the bounty is paid by the general public by taxation instead of by the purchasers of the article in the shape of a higher price, proposed that there shall be a bounty of but if this or any young industry can provide, say, only 25 per cent, of the needs of the country, the tax on the community is confined to what will pay a bounty on that 25 per cent., and on. the other 75 per' cent, the community will be tax free. In contrast with that, a duty imposed for protective purposes on the imported article has to be paid for on the wholt; of the consumption of that article, even though only 25 per cent, is made locally. The duty is paid on the 75 per cent, imported, and the equivalent of the duty is paid on what is produced locally, because the price of the local product is usually kept at about the level of the imported article. The bill proposes that a bounty of £2 is to be paid on sewing machine heads, and, in addition to that, a duty of 10s. British, and 20s. foreign is to be imposed. A deferred duty is to come into operation It will later on. The bounty is equivalent to 56* per' cent, of the landed cost of sewing machine heads, and this, with the duty, makes a total protection of 70 per cent, against British competition, and 85 per cent, against foreign competition. By way of interjection I asked the Assistant Minister, when he was making his second reading speech, what was the total number of machines imported annually, and he said 45,000. Their value, I was informed, was £160,000. It requires only a simple calculation to ascertain that the average landed cost of each sewing machine head is £3 l is . When the deferred duty come3 into operation the total amount of protection afforded to the industry will be 70 per cent, against British competition, and 984 per cent, against foreign competition. When the Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney), was speaking on another measure on Friday last, he emphasized the necessity of dealing with it on a sound economic basis. Can this bill, by any stretch of imagination, be described as economically sound, when it proposes to afford such ridiculously high protection to this industry? A bill is to be considered shortly, dealing with the payment of a bounty on flax. There is an extraordinary difference between what is proposed to be done in regard to flax, and what is being done in regard to sewing machine heads. Flax production is partly exported, and it is 15 per cent, for two years, 10 per cent, for",58,Second Reading
110,Mr Pateeson (Gippsland) [10.19],"two years, and 7£ per cent, for one year. That, I suggest, is a reasonable bounty. It bears a reasonable relationship to the value of tbe product. Makin) -The honourable member is not in order in discussing the proposed flax bounty. it only by way of illustration. Contrast the proposals in that bill with those now before the House. The protection proposed to be afforded in this instance bears an unreasonable relationship to the total value of the product. It is absolutely ridiculous. A good deal has been said in this House recently regarding the dictum of a certain arbitration judge, that if an industry cannot afford to pay a certain standard of wages it would be better for us not to have that industry. I think that we have reached a stage in our economic development in Australia when it is high time to apply to our industries the principle that if any one of heads is not worth more than £160,000 at them cannot afford to carry on without a bounty or a duty, or a combination of both, totalling, say, 20 or 25 per cent, of the value of the product, we would be. better without that industry. That is how I feel about it. If the Assistant Minister had seen fit to bring down a measure to assist this industry on a reasonable basis, something comparable with what is being done with regard .to flax mended this assistance after having considered the matter fully. whether it did or not. In my opinion, if an industry requires assistance to the extent of 70 per cent, against British, and 98£ per cent, against foreign competition, it is not even open to argument whether that industry is worth having. An industry which requires assistance to that extent is simply an unblushing mendicant. It will be worse than the galvanized iron industry, on which the bounty and are equivalent to £5 10s. a week for every workman engaged in it . The manufacturers of galvanized iron practically have their wages bill paid out of the Commonwealth Treasury, and now we are coming to an almost similar position, if this measure is passed, in regard to sewing machines. I cannot help thinking that if this industry can only get on with assistance amounting to the huge per cent, on the landed cost of the imported article, which I have mentioned, the cost to the country is too great, and that we should be far better off from an economic point of view by confining ourselves to the production of the stands of the machines, both the iron and the wood parts, leaving the actual manufacture of the machine heads to Great Britain, in which country mass production is possible. According to the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane), if the bounty is paid and the duty is imposed, we shall have not only the company projected in Bendigo, but also one in Sydney, and it is possible that the Singer people may commence operations in Australia. If that should happen, it would be nothing short of a calamity to the industry; because the market for these sewing machine the present time, and, although it might be possibleI doubt if it is-for mass production to be carried out by one firm, to divide it among three would mean overcapitalization and too high overhead charges, with the result that the cost of production in Australia would be much higher-than it would bewith only one firm in operation. This is an industry in which the total value of the importations is about £160,000, and in which mass production is essential if efficiency is to be achieved. It is very doubtful, therefore, if we have a sufficiently large market for efficient manufacture, and it would be rather a calamity than otherwise for more than one firm to undertake the manufacture of sewing machine heads in Australia. Furthermore, if a firm does start in this line in Australia, it would be much better for it to meet the competition of machines made in Great Britain and coming into Australia at a reasonable tariff, rather than a cut-throat competition from other manufacturers within duty taken together Australia. The existence of too many manufacturers leads to too heavy overhead charges and the investment of too much capital in an industry which can have little chance of expanding in a country with a population of only 6,000,000. people.

114,Mr Paterson,"I do not careringah) [10.33] I desire to make some observations with regard to this bill. [Quorum formed.] Although the amount of the bounty involved in the measure now under consideration is not very large, there is a principle at stake which is deserving of consideration. It has already been pointed out that it is not unusual for Parliament to pay bounties to promote the establishment of industries, but the fact that bounties which were unwarranted have already been authorized by this Parliament is no reason why a bounty should be paid in this case, particularly when it is equally unwarranted. The Assistant Minister( Mr or feasible to do so. The suggestion Forde) has repeatedly said that the effect of the tariff alterations made by the present Government has been to get rid of a lot of unemployment and create new sources of employment; but when his attention has been drawn to the figures which show that unemployment has risen from 12 per cent, in September last to 18 per cent, at the present time, he has shifted his ground and said"" What we meant was that there would have been more unemployment except for what we have done."" The Minister's wild speeches at the inauguration of different factories and for the encouragement of manufacturers have all been so much moonshine. The Government could not predict, with any degree of precision, the likely result of its tariff policy. It could to expect Australian manufacturers, who only speculate upon it. A duty . was imposed on sewing machine heads in 1921, when Mr ing concerns overseas. If the Singer Massy Greene Trade and Customs, but it was not to operate until the local manufacturer could provide a reasonable proportion of Australia's requirements. The industry has been thus protected nine years, but has never been in a position to supply even a fraction of the requirements of Australia. been employed? According to the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane), if the bounty is paid and the duty is imposed, about 300 men will be employed. The Singer organization now employs 900 men. If sewing machine heads are manufactured in Australia it reasonably follows that some of these 900 men will be displaced, to a fractional extent, at any rate, by the 300 men who will be employed in Bendigo. The making of sewing machine heads in Australia is not a new idea. I have already spoken of the duty which was imposed in 1921, but as far back as 1918 Senator E. D. Millen, who was then Minister for Repatriation, made inquiries to ascertain if returned soldiers could be profitably employed in making these machines, and Sir Henry Braddon, at that time Australia's Commissioner in the United States of America, made inquiries there as to whether it would be practicable was not carried out because it was realized that sewing machines could only be manufactured successfully on a mass production basis. It is, therefore, the veriest nonsense for the honourable member for Bendigo to say that the Singer organization intends to establish its business in Australia. That company has no such intention. Australian trade represents only 2 per cent, of the world's output, so it is highly improbable that any manufacturing company will transfer its organization to Australia for the purpose of capturing the local market. Also, it is unreasonable have not the facilities for mass production, to manufacture sewing machines cheaper than is possible for manufacturwas Minister for company did establish its organization in Australia, there would be little hope of the Bendigo manufacturing concern remaining in the business, because the Singer company, with its mass production methods, would quickly supply the whole of the Australian demand, and other manufacturing concerns would go under. This is one of the mistakes which the manufacturers of this country are making in their demands for high tariff barriers and embargoes on importation. Once the trade of Australia is worthwhile, outside manufacturers will establish their organizations in Australia, and with their mergers, and combines and control of enormous capital resources they will put out of business a large number",60,Second Reading

119,Mr Archdale Parkhill,"Th eof those manufacturers, who, to-day, are iluinouring for tlie high protection which this Government appears only too ready to give them, to their undoing. The honourable member for Bendigo has urged that this is a bounty worthwhile. No bounty proposal has been submitted with less justification. What is the record of the Bendigo manufacturing concern up to date? The honourable member for IJoudigo has told us that the best imported machines are sold at £19 4s. cash, that the importers are making over 100 per cent, gross profit on the landed n<ist of machines. If the facts are as stated by him, surely this margin of 100 per cent, should be sufficient inducement to local manufacturers. If they would be satisfied with the 10 per cent, return on and I am informed they were imported capital guaranteed under this bill, they would still have a margin of 90 per cent, against imported machines. Where, then, is the need for a bounty? Arc we to understand that they must have a margin >f 100 per cent, plus the bounty before they can start manufacturing on anything like a scale to meet the Australian demand? That, apparently, is what is intended if the statement of the Assistant Minister( Mr Forde) is correct. I repeat that no sewing machines worth talking about have ever been manufactured in Australia. The Bendigo company manufactured sewing machines all except the stands, the outside cabinet, and the inside. bers in matters In other words, it imported the woodwork, the ironwork, and even the ""inside"" of the machine, and I understand that this is the machine which the poor, aged, and infirm women in the local asylums have to use. They like it, I suppose, because they are obliged to use this antiquated machine, otherwise they would have no machine at all. It is an antiquated family arrangement, and I am informed that the companies sell only two .out of every 100 which they manufacture. It is worked on what is called a vibrating principle knows that all household sewing machines arc manufactured on that principle. That is not. so. The Assistant ""Minister is behind the times. The most up-to-date sewing machines are electrically controlled. It has been said that the Tariff Board has given its endorsement to this proposal. I happen to have a copy of the board's report. It is a curiosity; I have uever seen a document like it. Some of the statements in it, if not idiotic, are certainly ridiculous. Sincei t made its report five years ago there have been striking improvements in the manufacand £24 on terms, and ture of sewing machines. In i,ts comments upon the Bendigo manufacturing concern the board stated that the imported parts included the head, plus the cabinet, three bobbins, six needles, feed dog, transfers, bolt and spring. Those parts comprised the internal mechanism, from Germany. The report goes on to state that the value of the imported parts represented .96 per cent, of the total cost of production. I think this is a mistake. I believe that what the board intended to say was that the value of the imported parts was 96 per cent, of the total cost of production, for it is inconceivable that all the parts mentioned represented less than 1 per cent. If that is the best that the Tariff Board can do as a result of its investigation of requests made to it, all I can say is, "" The Lord preserve this House from Tariff Board reports as a guidance to honourable memof this kind.' r The recommendations of the board are all "" ifs "" and "" buts."" Between 45,000 and 50,000 sewing machines are purchased in Australia annually; yet the board proposes a sliding schedule of bounties, commencing with an output of ""1 to 2,000!"" There is no suggestion that of the 50,000 machines required annually, more than 4,000 will be produced locally. The Minister, when introducing the bill, said that it would mean a duty of £2 10s. on every imported sewing machine. It means much more than that. Prior to the 30th June, the duty was 30 per cent, on the complete machine with table and stand. Now the Government proposes separate duties of 75 per cent, on the cabinet work, 45 per cent, on the iron work, and an additional duty on the outside casing, which was not charged for before. Prior to the 30th June the duty on the ordinary seven-drawer machine and stand was £1",61,Second Reading

I am appealing also on behalf of the most sweated women in the communityj tlie white-workers and seamstresses. These women work not 44 or 48 hours a week, but day and night; yet the Government proposes that they shall pay an extra £4 or £5 for the machines by which they earn their livelihood. For their sake I protest against this bounty, and I am amazed that the Government should propose to put upon them this additional burden. The Minister has pointed out that the bounty will be paid out of the duties collected on the imported machines, and the bill provides that those who invest their money in the manufacture of sewing machines shall be permitted a net profit of 10 per cent. The Minister, the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane), and the others who are supporting this bill, are not concerned to guarantee a profit of 10 per cent, to the unfortunate white-workers who are treadling their machines day and night. The tendency of the age is to give more leisure to the working man, and all of us believe in that within reasonable limits. The Labour party advocates a 44-hour week for organized workers, who must not work on Saturdays, although the wives of many of them would be glad if they did. But docs the Government propose to give no consideration to the women, not even to the wives of the organized workers? If the proposed bounty and duties are agreed to, workers' wives who, after spending the day in .scrubbing, cleaning and washing, must devote the evenings to sewing for themselves and families, will have to pay an extra £5 to a pampered industry or do their sewing by hand. Members of the terial supporters, but on every platform on which this legislation is exposed, the Nationalists will be commended for resisting an undue impost upon one of the poorest and hardest working sections of the community. The burden that is being placed on the women of the working class is in marked contrast to the solicitude shown this afternoon for the employees of Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Honourable members opposite I readily voted an extra £50,000 to keep a limited number of artisans in employment in the ship-building yard. But the working women of Australia make no appeal to the Labour party. They are regarded merely as drudges, whose labours are not to be measured by the . hour. It is the obligation of Parliament to ensure that duties are not imposed, and prices raised on articles that are in daily use by the wives of the workers. If the Labour Government was not recreant to the trust that has been imposed iu it by the workers of this country it would see that sewing machines and other home necessities were made available at a minimum cost. This duty is nothing more or less than a flagrant imposition on the workers of which the Labour party should be ashamed, and about which the workers will surely make known their opinion at subsequent elections. should not like this bill to go through without, registering my protest against it. Tho £20,000 that the Government proposes to raise out of the taxpayers to meet this bounty on sewing machine heads will be worse than useless. It will simply be a futile endeavour to create an industry to employ some 200 to 300 at the expense of the whole of the people of Australia. I submit that we already have too many crippled industries in this country. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) very lucidly pointed out that this industry in Australia is to receive approximately 100 per cent, protection.

I venture the opinion that the day is not very far distant when parliamentarians themselves will realize that the taxpayers of Australia cannot meet their present allowances, or continue existing standards of wages and living. It is time that we insisted that industries should stand on their own feet. Too many are narasites upon our export industries, which are at the moment languishing, and they can no longer maintain our exotic industries. This proposal is economically unsound and will inevitably make another contribution to our unemployment.

It was only necessary for the bottom to fall out of our wheat and wool markets to end the illusion.

This proposal promises to impose a permanent disadvantage on the country. I would not care if the whole of our bounties were swept away, many duties reduced, and a revenue tariff introduced. should lower some of its tariffs and insist upon our sheltered industries scratching gravel a little harder. If that were done, there would be some justification in asking the farmers to produce more. This proposal will place us further in the mire. The Australian public, and particularly the unemployed workers, will realize that the Government is leading them along a track that must end in further unemployment, and in making Australia less able to meet its obligations. hesitate to condemn any project that is likely to assist to establish an Australian industry. No great country in the world can remain purely agricultural. I stand for protection, which I have always advochamber. But I believe in sane protection; not in going bounty mad, or in piling up tariffs with a spade. Each bounty should be considered on its merits. Some of those introduced by the Bruce Page Government will stand investiganess and are uneconomic. This proposal comes in the last category. The Assistant Minister( Mr Forde) alleged that it had received the recommendation of the Tariff Board. I ask him specifically did the Tariff Board recommend it ! I do not think that it did. The honourable gentleman based the whole of his speech on the claim that the Tariff Board recommended such a bounty in 1925. gations made by a responsible officer of the Customs Department substantially supported the recommendation of the Tariff Board. WhatI have said is absolutely right.

The honourable member for Bendigo is, of course, justified in his attitude, because the proposed bounty affects his electorate. He said quite a lot about the gold bounty, also in the interests of his electorate. I agree entirely with his remarks about the need for decentralization. That is most essential if Australia is to proceed on right lines without over-populated cities, but that is no argument in favour of the granting of this bounty. The honourable member for Bendigo knows that the company, which he says will do great deeds in the manufacture of sewing machines once this bounty is granted, does not exist. I have received a report from the Titles Office that originally this company had a nominal capital of £50.000. The secretary of the company traded in his motor garage business as part of the assets of the company, and the total capital paid up was £18,000. because the company went into liquidation. company may obtain a bounty of £20,000 a year although its paid-up capital five years ago was only £18,000.

That newspaper on the l l t h of this month published this statementThereupon, Mr Lewis, who so vociferously represents the thriving constituency of Corio, entered upun a long and car-shattering denunciation of non-unionists and all who advocated their claims. He has a natural gift for exaggeration, and it is only in unguarded moments that he falls into careless habits of accuracy. His manner suggests that he looks on his seat in the House of Representatives as only a poor substitute for a ""stump"" on the Yarra hank or in the Sydney Domain. To resume the debate on sewing machines, let me say that the Bendigo Advertiser of the 20th of last month published this statementThe Prime Minister and Federal Labour party have agreed to a bounty of £2 for every sewing machine made in Australia find a deferred duty of 10s. on British, and £1 on foreign sewing machines. This was the text of a telegram received by Mr J. Jeffrey, of Bendigo, yesterday from Mr R. V. Keane, M.P., as the culmination of efforts made to revive the Bendigo sewing machine industry. Bendigo, and I would do anything to assist-the progress of that city so long as there would be no uneconomic reaction on Australia as a whole. The statement continuesA conference to be held in Melbourne on Saturday will be attended by Messrs. Keane and Jeffrey, and a prospectus will then be drawn up and subsequently issued toinvite investment in the enterprise which should induce favorable consideration from investors. I ask the honourable member for Bendigo whether he is the promoter or a director of the company? in effect, that Messrs. Keane and Jeffrey are issuing a prospectus to float a company. the company, and I have no connection with it. The report is substantially correct. I did meet Mr Jeffrey and discuss the proposition with him. speech of the Assistant Minister, this company went into liquidation in 1926. That is confirmed by the records of the Titles Office.

MrW HITE tion on the part of the Tariff Board that no extra tariff protection or bounty may be given an industry unless it can produce 40 per cent, of Australia's requirements. In 1925 the Tariff Board would not grant the request of this company, because of its limited production. At that time it was manufacturing 40 machines a week. It produced about 1,500 machines during the period of its existence, although it was estimated that it could within twelve months increase its production to 40,000 machines per annum. I submit that that is an exaggeration. The Tariff Board further said that only 5 per cent, of Ausduty that should then be imposed, in tralia's requirements was capable of being manufactured by the Bendigo company. I admit that it is preferable to manufacture our own requirements rather than import them from overseas, but the community should not be asked to bear the burden. a most serious financial position to-day, yet this Government continues to increase Commonwealth expenditure. An amount of £50,000 is of no consequence when it comes to a matter of providing work at Cockatoo Island. The Bendigo company has gone into liquidation, yet it is to be re-established at the expense of the people of Australia. Even the locally manufactured machines will contain imported parts. All that the company will manufacture is the frame and cast case, which any small engineering works could turn out.

It is very unlikely, therefore, that the competition frcm the new company will bring down the present price of the imported machine. the market for a century and enjoys a goodwill which no new company could break down. ported machines as well. If the locally manufactured article is to be produced economically, it will be necessary to make it on a fairly large scale, and the company, therefore, will probably confine itself to the manufacture of one type of machine. But many different types of household sewing machines are in use in Australia. I cannot support a measure designed to assist the manufacture of one particular type of machine. The policy of bolstering industries increases unemployment in all localities other than those which directly benefit from the bounties.. Quite an interesting example of that is furnished by the Minister's speech. The honourable gentleman said that if a company became established in Bendigo, there was a probability that another manufacturer would set up in Sydney, and compete with it. He also gave particulars of the number of machines that this manufacturer anticipated he would be able to turn out, and said that already he had under offer a suitable factory. Presumably that is a factory that the tariff has prevented from carrying on. lack of tariff protection rendered idle. finding it increasingly difficult to carry on because of the restricted opportunity of the people to make purchases. This industry will be spoon-fed at the cost of either the taxpayer or the unfortunate people who use sewing machines. agree that a bounty is less pernicious than Mr Parker Moloney should have been an indirect form of protection; but, whatincluded in the list of those honourable ever the form, in the present state of Australia's economic position it must affect employment in other directions.
