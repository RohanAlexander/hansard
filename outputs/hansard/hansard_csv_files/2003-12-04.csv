360,Have Been Working In A Largely Collaborative Mr Abbott (Warringah,"Leader of theThursday, 4 December 2003 ----Calwell Electorate: Broadmeadows Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (9.40 a.m.)-I want to speak today about the strong sense of pride that is steadily building around the working class suburb of Broadmeadows-or ‘Broady’, as it is affectionately known locally-a suburb at the centre of the city of Hume in my electorate of Calwell. You can compare Broadmeadows to suburbs such as Bankstown in Sydney or Inala in Brisbane. Like these suburbs, it has evolved over time and has changed from a strong Anglo-Celtic community to one that now represents a microcosm of multicultural Australia. Broadmeadows has a history of struggle, honourable labour and now, more importantly, a strong sense of community pride. It has been a gateway for new Australians and has welcomed and settled over the years Greeks, Italians, Maltese, British and, more recently, Vietnamese, Turkish, Lebanese and Iraqis. Some 40 per cent of Broadmeadows residents speak a language other than English at home, with over 130 different languages represented in the area. The fierce pride which locals hold for Broady was evident during a recent controversy instigated by some who suggested it was time to change the name of Broadmeadows in order to alter what they believed was a negative preconceived image. Adding to the outrage felt by the locals is an advertising campaign currently run by Tattersalls which seeks to trade on those preconceived images in order to sell its lottery products. People-in this case, Tattersallswho run expensive campaigns that trade on old stereotypes for their self-interest are doing a great disservice to the pride felt by the people living in the Broadmeadows community. The community of Broadmeadows has evolved over the years. Although it has retained much of its traditional demographic, it now boasts an exciting and dynamic nature. Broadmeadows is known as a place that takes care of its own. The community works closely together, collectively meeting life’s challenges. Whether it is the corporate sector or the volunteer networks, all work hand in hand to build a better community. Broadmeadows has had its difficulties. It has also had its successes and success stories. As Age reporter Michelle Griffin noted recently in an article entitled ‘A history of social stigma and success stories’, Broadmeadows still has poverty and inequity but the community deals with it together as friends and neighbours. That is something that we are all very proud of. People born and bred in Broady have never felt anything but pride in coming from Broadmeadows. From Eddie and Frank McGuire, John Ilhan of Crazy John’s mobiles fame, champion veteran power lifter and former Victorian Senior of the Year Sonja Rutherford, ABC broadcaster Francis Leach and former Age editor Bruce Guthrie to Judge Irene Lawson of the Victorian County Court and Australian Rules footy icon Bruce Doull, Broady has and will continue to have its share of success stories, whether they be lawyers, doctors or entrepreneurs. But it will always treasure the generations of honourable working people who have built successful families and futures for their children. MAIN COMMITTEE",283,Financial Services Reform
361,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley) Took The Chair At 9.40 A.m.,"Health: Disability Services Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (9.43 a.m.)-I draw the attention of the Main Committee to the barbaric decline in disability care in Queensland, which was highlighted in yesterday’s edition of two leading publications. Yesterday’s Bulletin magazine featured a double-page spread, on pages 10 and 11, about the inaction of the Queensland authorities leading to yet another abuse scandal threatening to flare up in the face of Premier Peter Beattie. The article says: Police are expected to lay charges in both Queensland and NSW in a case involving the sexual and physical abuse of mentally and physically disabled children and adults in five residential lodges ... one hour’s drive north of Brisbane. The article claims that one of the sacked managers has been found to have served a jail sentence in South Australia, raising questions about how she received a clearance, or a so-called blue card, to work with children. It continues: After complaints were made, the cage was dismantled and it was business as usual – with Disability Services Queensland continuing to pay subsidies to the association and Queensland Family Services continuing to send them disabled children. The complaint was just one of a series by staff, ex-staff, social workers and relatives. After a psychologist went directly to Premier Beattie on 15 August 2002, Premier Beattie wrote back on 7 October 2002 giving an assurance that the facility was being looked at and disclosing his knowledge of other matters being followed up and referred, in this case, to the police minister and the family and disability services minister. It continued but nothing happened. It was only intervention at federal level that forced action in June this year. Submissions that were lodged with separate House of Representatives and Senate committees in recent weeks have ensured that the full ramifications of this scandal are looked at beyond Queensland. Even the Crime and Misconduct Commission has declined requests to include it in its current child abuse inquiry. But page 3 of yesterday’s Courier-Mail portrays yet again a state government in denial. Disability services minister, Ms Spence, said that her department became aware of the concerns in early 2001 but the newspaper points out that investigations were launched only after a federal disability agency became involved in June. The Queensland government appears to be turning disabled care into a nightmare that is much worse than Solzhenitsyn’s gulag. On 27 November the Courier-Mail described a Brisbane family whose disabled adult daughter-one of more than 11,000 such people-had waited since 1998 for funding for disabled care. It described ageing parents with severe health problems reluctantly having to shoulder the burden of care of their children rather than leave them to the mercy of unfunded, unsafe and, in their words, life-threatening neglect in state licensed facilities operating with the blessing of Disability Services Queensland. It told of families that were removing their disabled relatives from state licensed facilities after they had discovered untreated broken bones, extreme medical neglect and physical and sexual abuse cases that were revealed in the Bulletin article. It is a disgraceful state of affairs. (Time expired) Aviation: Air Safety your families. I hope that it is a safe Christmas, but hearing news of that near air collision in Melbourne makes me very concerned for air safety over this Christmas period. The immediate MAIN COMMITTEE",284,Statements By Members
362,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (9.46 A.m.),"Merry Christmas to everyone here and toimpact of Australia’s new airspace regulations has been to increase the workload of regional air traffic controllers and force airline pilots to take extreme precautions to avoid midair collisions. Safety has always been by far the most important element in the development of the aviation industry, so it could be assumed that to jeopardise even slightly Australia’s enviable air safety record there must be huge benefits from the new rules. Yet many in the industry are at a loss to find any benefits of significance and only the slightest saving in costs. There is a concern that the new system has been brought in to benefit private pilots by reducing the restrictions on when and where they might fly and their need to tell anybody about their plans. I highlighted that in a speech earlier this week. It is a romantic, freedom-in-thesky approach that will please the recreational flyer. But neither Airservices Australia, which administers the rules, nor the federal government has succeeded in selling the idea to those who fly for their living. In a system that requires much greater visual checking for light aircraft, commercial pilots are now employing extraordinary measures such as insisting that seatbelts are fastened at 3,000 metres on airport approach in case emergency action needs to be taken. They have also adopted a regime of calling on all light aircraft in the vicinity for position checks. It is a procedure that is usually adopted only in developing countries. Launceston and Hobart, as I pointed out in my speech earlier in the week, are without radar and are at greater risk than airports in major cities. The public are confused, many light aircraft operators are still trying to come to grips with new plans and procedures, and airline pilots are warning of a disaster. The federal government must urgently rethink the whole issue-either fix it or forget it. Those words are similar to those that I used in my speech earlier this week when I outlined the unique circumstances that exist in Tasmania, particularly the problems associated with moving into category E airspace. I offered some constructive solutions which have also been offered to the current Minister for Transport and Regional Services by the Tasmanian minister for transport, who is responsible for air safety in Tasmania. As on most issues dealing with the transport minister, particularly related to airport security and aviation, we have heard no word from the minister. Those words largely came from the Examiner newspaper of 2 December, not from me, and they reflect the views of the Tasmanian community, just as my colleagues and I do. (Time expired) Rainbow Club brated the special event of Christmas. It was a wonderful affair and we had an outrigger canoe that brought Santa Claus to the beach. I am very proud to be patron of that organisation. The senior patron is Murray Rose. It was founded 34 years ago by Ron Siddons, a self-described ‘ordinary guy’ and former beach inspector. He has done a wonderful job. The club provides swimming lessons to children with disabilities ranging from visual and aural impairment to cerebral palsy, autism and down syndrome. Children who have diminished physical and mental capacity also suffer from reduced opportunity. This organisation enthusiastically helps children under the age of 18 with any disability. At the Christmas event last Saturday we also bussed in a whole group from Campbelltown with similar disabilities. One of the club’s original members has represented Australia at the Special Olympics. Another is married with a family. Most clubs are in New South Wales but one is open in Geelong, and 94 children are being taught to swim there each Saturday. MAIN COMMITTEE",285,Statements By Members
363,Mr Baird (Cook) (9.49 A.m.),"Last Saturday the Rainbow Club in Cronulla and I celeCurrently the club is trying to establish a centre at Albany Creek in Brisbane. I mentioned this to Peter Dutton, who is the member for that area, and we hope to get that centre established soon. The aim of the club is to have enough money in the bank account to aim for a facility at Albany Creek ready to go on the first day of the school term in 2004. Discussions have also been held in South Australia about establishing the Rainbow Club there. The Rainbow Club is an organisation which the community has supported extensively. Some of the senior players of the Cronulla Sharks were at the Christmas party on the beach last Saturday, handing out presents to the children. We also had members of the Bulldogs handing out gifts and playing their part. Leading sporting figures in the Sutherland shire are actively involved. Qantas is supporting the club in a significant way by providing items for auctions to assist in the fundraising. It is a community activity that everyone is behind. Not only does the club provide recreation for the children; it also provides a break for the parents. It is often very difficult for parents of children with severe intellectual disabilities or autism just to have a break and some recreation. It is a wonderful organisation that does much for the disadvantaged in the community. I am proud to be involved with it. It does a wonderful job. We certainly hope that the club in Queensland is successful in being established. To my parliamentary colleagues, I wish all the best for Christmas and the new year. Telstra: Services Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (9.52 a.m.)-There is no question that an affordable and reliable telecommunications service is essential for all Australians. In its most basic form, a functioning telephone service ensures that everyone has the opportunity to communicate and to participate in our society. But the reality for an increasing number of Telstra customers is that services are getting poorer while the costs are rising. Staff cutbacks by Telstra and decreasing investment in the telecommunications infrastructure are taking their toll on a frustrated community. I want to take a recent example from one of my constituents-Les Murray, from Kalamunda-which was reported in our local paper under the headline ‘Telstra smokescreen’. The article says: Recently, Les Murray, manager of the Kalamunda Club, reported that the club’s telephone lines were out to Telstra. He was told that they would have a technician there by close of business that day. Fair enough. But no-one from Telstra turned up. The article goes on to explain that when Mr Murray rang Telstra to find out what was going on he was informed that, if he was unhappy with Telstra’s service, there were plenty of other telecommunications operators he could try. Again he attempted to make a time for Telstra to come out and repair his lines. He attempted to contact the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to try and ensure that the club’s telephone services were restored. Unfortunately the staff of the ombudsman were busy and he had to leave a message on the line.

National Residue Survey Excise Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Transactions) Bill 2003 and the National Residue Survey Customs Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Exports) Bill 2003. I will commence my contribution with some comments on the National Residue Survey Excise Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Transactions) Bill 2003. As the minister indicated in his second reading speech, the purpose of the first bill is to correct the rate of National Residue Survey levy applicable on certain exports of lambs. The amendments to the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Act 1998 validate the levy already collected at an agreed rate of 8c per head first set in June 1998 in respect of lamb exports with a value of more than $75 under the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (National Residue Survey Levies) Amendment Regulations 1998. It is surprising, to say the least, that this drafting error has been in place for some years without correction-in fact, since 1 July 2000. I would appreciate an explanation from the minister as to why this problem has remained uncorrected for so long. I note that the Sheep Meat Council of Australia and its member organisations are committed to an NRS transaction levy rate of 8c per head for lamb exports with a value of more than $75. I note that the Sheep Meat Council of Australia has formally requested that this drafting fault be corrected. I would also like to know when the request was made. The levy recovers the cost of the lamb industry’s residue monitoring program, which is required for market access. Labor supports the bill. The second bill is the National Residue Survey Customs Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Exports) Bill 2003. The purpose of this bill is to amend the National Residue Survey (Customs) Levy Act 1998 so as to validate the levy already collected in respect of lambs with a sale price of more than $75 per head. The bill is complementary to the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Transactions) Bill 2003, and once again Labor is happy to support the bill. reply-As the opposition spokesman has said, the National Residue Survey Excise Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Transactions) Bill 2003 and the National Residue Survey Customs Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Exports) Bill 2003 are relatively non-controversial. The legislation corrects an error that has occurred since July 2000 when a levy of 4.7c per head was applied through a drafting fault in the regulations rather than the intended rate of 8c per head.

BILL 2003 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 November, on motion by Mr Truss: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment (Wine Grapes) Bill 2003 proposes an amendment to the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 and affects only the maximum rate of levy that may be applied to the research and development component of the wine grapes levy. The maximum rate currently is $3 per tonne of wine grapes and the present operative rate set under the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Regulation 1999 is also $3 per tonne. This amendment will allow future changes to the operative rate to occur within the proposed $10 maximum rate. Any attempt to increase the actual levy must meet the 12 levy principles introduced by the government in January 1997. One of the principles relates to the need for demonstrated support from the industry-in this case, the wine industry-for any change to the levy rate. That will require proper consultation with the industry and evidence of support for any increase. Labor will ensure that all 12 tests are met before any levy is endorsed by the parliament, and we will be ensuring that we widely consult with the industry. The Australian wine industry first sought the imposition of a levy in 1979 to assist research and development through the Grape and Wine Research Development Corporation. Since then, the operative rate of the levy has been increased to $3 per tonne, with the last levy increase occurring in February 1999. This industry has expanded enormously in recent years, with exports now valued at around $2.4 billion. Some of my colleagues from South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, Western AusMAIN COMMITTEE",288,National Residue Survey Excise Levy Rate Correction Lamb Transactions Bill 2003
368,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (10.45 A.m.),"The Primary Industries (Excise) Leviestralia and perhaps Queensland may disagree, but the Hunter is Australia’s premier wine region. In their own right, winemakers in the Hunter make an outstanding contribution to the industry, the local economy and the national economy and play an increasingly important role in Australia’s tourism sector, which, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you know I have a deep interest in. As the minister said in his second reading speech, the Australian industry is globally recognised as a technological leader. Australian growers and winemakers have always been open to new ideas and keen to adopt new technology. That is clearly the key to our success in the international marketplace. Support for this amendment from the Winemakers Federation of Australia confirms the industry’s commitment to research and development as a platform for the future. The Winemakers Federation is the declared winemakers organisation for the purposes of the legislation and represents some 95 per cent of wine production in Australia. As with other rural R&D arrangements, the government matches the expenditure of these levy funds on eligible R&D projects up to 0.5 per cent of the determined gross value of production of the industry concerned. The amendment will provide the industry with the capacity to seek an increase in the operative rate of future vintages from 1 July 2004. On that basis, the opposition supports the bill and the changes wholeheartedly. I will just go for one moment to the amendment’s impact on my own local region. The Hunter is emerging as an export engine room of the Australian economy. This has had enormous implications for the region’s economy. My own home town of Cessnock was founded on coal mining and has, therefore, experienced a massive economic adjustment over the last decade or more, with coal mining moving further up the valley. Only one coalmine now remains in Cessnock. Also, the textile and clothing industry has effectively moved on, and there have been reductions in other areas such as aluminium production. So wine tourism has been my local home town’s great saviour. More people now work in wine related tourism than in the coal industry, which is a significant change indeed. As small as this amendment might seem, it is important for the industry in its quest to further strengthen its position in a competitive global market. On that basis, I want to make one quick reference to a little bit of a disagreement my local winemakers are having with the Geographical Indications Committee-a body under the auspices of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. They are seeking to have some subregions identified for marketing purposes in international markets. This is always a difficult debate within the industry, and one we have dealt with since the French in particular decided, under the WTO arrangements, to push their right to claim the names of certain wine regions. We accept that, but we must go forward collectively to ensure we have the balance right. In my own area, for example, winemakers are still very keen to export under the Rothbury subregion label, something they have been doing for some time. It is a label that people in our overseas market identify with. It is very important that the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation listen to my local people and what they are saying about these issues. This is no halfsmart trick to secure some regional advantage over other winemakers in the nation; this is an issue which they see as being very important in their ongoing efforts to grow their market share in the international marketplace. SoI appeal to the Geographical Indications Committee to have another look at what the Hunter Valley’s winemakers are putting forward as a sensible means of protecting the integMAIN COMMITTEE rity of the branding of our Australian wines but, at the same time, ensuring that the Hunter winemakers continue to make inroads in those international markets. Once again, Labor supports the amendments. Levies Amendment (Wine Grapes) Bill 2003 I want to do three things. Firstly, I want to pay tribute to my local grape growers and winemakers, who have had the foresight to create-and I respectfully disagree here with the member for Hunter-perhaps the premium wine growing area within Australia. Secondly, I want to address the issue of the wine equalisation tax and, thirdly, I would like to address the provisions within the bill and specifically make a pitch for an adequate share of research and development grants which will flow from the amendment to small winemakers and boutique wineries. The growth of winemakers and grape growers within the Mornington Peninsula and Western Port region, which comprise my electorate of Flinders, is a great story. It is a story of pioneers and people who have taken on those who have said it could not be done-people such as Nat and Rosalie White, Ballieu Myer, Brian Stonier, Sir Peter Derham, Andrew and Terryn Hickinbotham, Gary Crittenden and a host of others such as Lindsay McCall and many other people with great courage, foresight and determination and incredible winemaking skills. Together, over 120 wine grape growers and over 50 winemakers have created an industry on the peninsula which has tremendous impact in terms of the quality and branding of our area and directly in terms of the agricultural success and income for the Mornington Peninsula and Western Port regions. Theirs is a story to be proud of; it is a story that they should be absolutely proud of, because this industry did not exist on the Mornington Peninsula 30 years ago. The pioneers and those who have come along as the industry has progressed, who have invested their time, money and capital and, above all else, their energy, deserve success and congratulations. Within that context, one of the issues which the Mornington Peninsula Vignerons Association has raised with me, about which I am passionate and which I have raised at all levels of government, is the notion that the wine equalisation tax might perhaps be adjusted in some small way to take into account the needs and concerns of small winemakers throughout Australia and, in particular, within my electorate of Flinders. This tax, which was established in 1999 as part of the new taxation provisions, does have an impact on small wineries. In particular, the National Small Wineries Association has argued that a WET can have detrimental effects on some small wineries as it is based on the sales price, not volume. In that context, I have made representations to the Treasurer and to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, and to the Assistant Treasurer in person only this week, in relation to the fact that what we are looking for is an exemption on the first 600,000 litres of domestic sales under the WET. That is a position I have put publicly and privately, and it is one which I will maintain and work towards. Mrs Moylan-And supported by the member for Pearce.

371,Mr Hunt,"AndI am happy to say it is supported by the members for Pearce, Maranoawant to move on to the third part of my presentation. I want to talk about the provisions of the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Wine Grapes) Bill 2003. This levy for research and development was introduced in 1979 to help the Australian wine industry. Since that time, the Australian wine industry has undergone a significant transformation. Traditionally, the industry had been focused on the domestic market. Since 1979, there has been significant growth and expansion in the export market. Australia now ranks as the fifth largest exporting country in the world in relation to wines and, within the panoply of Australian exports, wine is playing an increasingly significant role. Research and development has been part of that growth and in particular there is more that can be done. Looking at the background to this bill, we see that the government is proposing an amendment to the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 in response to the recommendations of the Winemakers Federation of Association. So it is the winemakers who are driving this change. Effectively, the amendment will increase the levy on grape production so as to allow for a larger pool of funds to be available for research and development. The pitch that I want to make to this House and to all of those involved in administering the research and development plans approved by the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation is simple: there needs to be a balance between the interests of the larger growers and the smaller growers, or the boutique winemakers, so as to ensure that an adequate proportion of funds are dedicated to the smaller growers-those with the high-value product which in particular are leading our capacity to export. Their work, their brands and their names open the markets for Australia overseas. Unashamedly, not just for the Mornington Peninsula but for small winemakers throughout Australia, I make the representation to the parliament that an adequate proportion of research and development should be focused on the high-value products because they crack open the door and open the market for all Australian products. Producers such as Stoniers, Red Hill Estate, Dromana Estate or Paringa Estate, or any such vignerons, have a key role in developing and branding the Australian industry. In that context, what this bill will do is threefold; firstly, it will increase the technical ability to respond to world consumer preferences and deliver products that are price and quality competitive; secondly, it will remove some of the barriers to viticulture research and allow for monitoring the impact of viticulture on the environment; and, thirdly, above all else, it will enhance our reputation for delivering on flavour and value across the range of all price categories. I particularly want to ensure that there is adequate provision in the research and development for some of the more complex varietals grown in areas such as the Mornington Peninsula and Western Port, where they have small wineries which make premium wines, so that these products can be enhanced. In that context, I am delighted to support the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Wine Grapes) Bill 2003, but I emphasise my position both on the wine equalisation tax for small vignerons and winemakers and on the need to ensure that there is an adequate distribution of research and development funds, again, for the small and boutique wineries. about the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Wine Grapes) Bill 2003. The proposed change to the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act dealing with wine grapes relates to the maximum rate of levy that may be applied to the research and development component MAIN COMMITTEE",291,Primary Industries Excise Levies Amendment Wine Grapes
372,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (10.59 A.m.),"I rise in the Main Committee today to talkof the wine industry grapes levy. The current maximum rate is $3 per tonne of wine grapes, and this amendment will allow for possible future increases in this operative rate to occur within the proposed $10 maximum rate. As outlined by the minister in his second reading speech, the Australian wine industry first sought to impose a levy in 1979, with the funds going towards research and development. That levy is now set at $3 per tonne. The federal electorate of Maranoa is a very important emerging wine growing industry in Australia. My interest goes way back in history because it was my great-grandfather who first travelled in a bullock wagon carrying vines from the Hunter Valley region of Australia to my home town of Roma, where he first settled in 1863. In fact, I well recall my early holidays working in the cellars packing grapes; I might have been eating more than packing. SoI have a very long association, through my family, dating back to 1863 in my region. Whilst mine is a very diverse agricultural electorate and I am very proud of the strengths of our wine industry and also of the producing areas within the electorate, the places that would stand to benefit from the boost in research, which is what this bill is about, and to develop under the maximum allowable rate of $10 per tonne are in the Stanthorpe region-the Granite Belt: Dalby, St George and Roma. There are also a number of table grape growing communities in Maranoa, including Emerald, Cunnamulla and St George. St George aside, they have the potential over time, with good research in the wine industry, to develop and diversify their products, producing not only table grapes but also wine grapes and moving into the related industry. St George is already growing wine grapes as well as table grapes. The wine industry are always looking to strengthen their exports, and I believe this bill will provide for the development of new research and technology. We in this House are all proud of the way the wine industry have grown their exports and the way they are going about developing new markets and also enabling themselves to take on what were considered to be some of the premium wine growing areas of the world. I think our wine growers have demonstrated that they can match it with the best in the world. Their reputation now, which is of course supported by the strength of our growing exports from Australia, is vindication of the wine industry’s strength and its place in our national economy. Parts of my electorate are already seeking to expand their knowledge, their know-how, of wine and wine tourism. For instance, Stanthorpe State High School, which is in the Granite Belt, in conjunction with the Queensland Wine Tourism Training Centre Steering Committee, currently has a funding application before the federal government and the Australian National Training Authority for assistance towards a college of wine tourism to be based in Stanthorpe. The federal government has already given Stanthorpe high school money for a science laboratory, which I opened last year. What impresses me about taking these facilities to high school campuses is that it introduces the high school students, whilst they are still studying, to an industry that is in their district. In other words, it links them to job opportunities and potential careers in their own community. So often we have talked in this place-and I know that in my own electorate we often talk about this-about the greatest export from our rural areas being our young people. This is a great initiative of the Queensland Wine Tourism Training Centre Steering Centre. I am certainly supporting it, and I look forward to a positive result on the funding application. The study that Stanthorpe State High School has done, which has been developed within the wine and tourism industry, demonstrates that wine is associated with tourism, and tourism MAIN COMMITTEE and hospitality are job creators for all our electorates. Of course, as I outlined, if the application before the federal government at the moment to establish the training centre in Stanthorpe is successful, that too will lead to a focus for the Queensland wine industry for training in winemaking and tourism, because the two are very much linked. The Stanthorpe State High School is undertaking the lead agency role in the establishment of this college of wine and tourism. The school has a very well-established, productive relationship with the wine industry and is regarded as a leader in the provision of vocational education in Queensland. For instance, Stanthorpe State High School today has some 25 students who have been oriented to employment in the wine industry, including 10 school based trainees, which reinforces the earlier comments I made. The school currently supports 36 school based trainees, and it is now anticipated that with the construction of a college of wine and tourism there will be a significant increase in student numbers both from the Granite Belt as well as from northern New South Wales and the south Burnett regions of Queensland. I know that our time is limited this morning but I would like to support the member for Flinders. We heard the member for Franklin refer to the WET tax. I certainly support the exemption for our small wine producers. Our small wine producers are a vital part of regional development. They are a vital part of creating jobs in their regions. I believe that we have to look again at the WET tax, because I know that small wineries do struggle to meet this commitment. I certainly hope that the minister will be able to shed some further light on whether we are making progress in this regard. The wine industry and small wine producers are looking for some relief. The measure certainly has my support, as was outlined by the member for Flinders in his earlier presentation. reply-I thank honourable members who contributed to this debate for their support for the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Wine Grapes) Bill 2003. All of them come from wine producing areas, as do I. Therefore, we have a particularly keen interest in this legislation. As a very progressive industry, the wine industry has always been conscious of the importance of research and development to make sure that it maintains its cutting edge. In fact, tomorrow night I will have the privilege of presenting the Wine of the Year Award in Adelaide, which again will underpin the excellence of the Australian wine industry and its capacity to compete effectively around the world. Indeed, in spite of difficult trading barriers, the wine industry has done exceptionally well in that regard. But it is a fact that there is a large number of comparatively small wineries in Australia that compete for just three or four per cent of the market. In that regard they face particular economic difficulties. I have spoken about those difficulties in the past. The government has responded through the wine skills program to help provide assistance to small winemakers in developing business plans and understanding more about the business that they are in. Many people have entered the wine industry because of its glamour and because of the perception that it is an industry in which profitability is almost assured. There is no such thing as a business in which profitability is assured. Even in an industry that has been as successful as the wine industry, if you want to succeed you have to have some plans for your business and an understanding of how you are going to sell your product. It is just not good enough to have a passion for producing good wine-though that is often the motivating influence among people entering the profession-you also need to have some idea about where that wine is going MAIN COMMITTEE",292,Primary Industries Excise Levies Amendment Wine Grapes
373,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (11.07 a.m.)-ingoing to be sold and how it is going to be placed on the market. It has been in marketing and in providing suitable outlets for the production from small wineries, particularly those with less than 1,000 tonnes of production, where there have been particular difficulties. The wine skills program is a very successful response to those difficulties. We have also had a major review of the issues associated with small wineries to try to better position them for the future so that they can also be partners in the great success that this industry has been over recent times. I know the industry talks a lot about the so-called wine equalisation tax-the WET taxand I, as well as other members who have spoken, have been subjected to the view expressed by small winemakers that they should receive further concessions. It is important to note that small winemakers who make sales through the cellar door already receive significant concessions from the federal government and there is also a range of concessions provided by the states. I think there would be merit in simplifying those concessions but that would require agreement from the states, and that does not seem to be forthcoming at the present time. The industry does receive concessional taxation, when wine is compared with other alcoholic beverages, but I am aware that the industry would always like to receive further concessions. That is essentially a matter for the Treasurer in dealing with tax policy, and I know that the industry has been active in lobbying the Treasurer in that regard. Of course, this particular bill is not about the WET tax. It is about the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act and increasing the maximum allowable rate of the research and development component of the wine grapes levy. The proposed higher maximum allowable rate will take effect from 1 July 2004, which is the identified levy year for this particular levy and is therefore the most appropriate date from which to commence the new maximum rate. This amendment to the maximum rate will have no direct financial impact on the Australian government or, for that matter, on producers themselves. Any future increase to the operative rate is actioned through a regulatory process that will need to meet Australian government requirements, including adhering to the levy principles. Of course, any future change through this process comes under the appropriate scrutiny of the parliament. This amendment has the full support of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, which is the peak winemaking body representing the Australian wine industry. I thank honourable members who have indicated their support for this legislation. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.

374,Mr Price (Chifley) (11.13 A.m.),"I made a few remarks on this report earlier, and I wishhaving with the Manager of Opposition Business, the whips and the Speaker. If we want to get reform in this parliament we really do need to have a commitment from the government. If we do not have that commitment from the government, which obviously has a majority in the House, we will not get reform. I am not reflecting on the honourable member for Wentworth, because I acknowledge his fine contribution to the Procedure Committee as someone who has just come into this parliament. It has been very valuable. But we have to involve the key players. It is for this reason that the Australian Labor Party have adopted as policy that we should change the name of the Procedure Committee to the Procedure and Modernisation of Parliament Committee and have as members of that committee the Speaker, the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business. With such a committee bringing down reports, I think you would see that a government would be, in the main, totally committed to it. Notwithstanding the good work of the Procedure Committee over the years, I think too many reports have languished and gathered dust in the bowels of the parliament. I congratulate the chair of the committee, because I understand that at her party room meeting she spoke to coalition members about the report. You would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, that there was a tad of excitement at our party meeting on Tuesday. I have to say, as much as it pains me, that arrangements for second reading speeches were not very high on the agenda. like to ask a question. Is the honourable member willing to take the question? of this important parliament are even less important than the issues that were referred to at the meeting he just mentioned? as much as I get very entangled in the procedures of this place and in wanting to improve them, it is a passion not always shared by my colleagues. I regret to say I must answer in the negative. I thank him for his question. I did not have the same opportunity as the chair of the committee, but I think it is the case that members of parliament should not be concerned about these proposals. There is this opting out procedure. As I said before, I am not in favour of it continuing indefinitely, but I think it has been a good transitional arrangement. Clearly, newer members of parliament coming in after the next parliament will want to use this chamber much more than the House so that they become familiar with interventions. If members can handle interventions, they are certainly going to be able to handle a question at the end of a second reading speech. I commend these proposals. I think it is fair to indicate that the former Manager of Opposition Business, now the Leader of the Opposition, has indicated his strong support for this. I believe he is committed to reforming the parliament. He is certainly committed to seeing more extemporaneous contributions in both this chamber and the other. I think that would be a good thing.

379,Mr Price,"I must reply truthfully to the honourable member for Wentworth and say that,Although we had in the standing orders since the beginning of Federation-and it was removed only in 1965-the standing order that said that you could not read a speech, I can well remember points of order being taken about a member reading a speech. Erskine May is still the authority, to the extent that it says that a member may only refer to copious notes. I commend the report to all honourable members. I particularly commend the work of the members of the committee-particularly the member for Wentworth-for their contribution to six reports in this parliament. tice as I was sitting here listening to this important debate-before the speech from the honourable member for Chifley, I should add-that you were rubbing your eyes and staring at the ceiling. Indeed, it was even observed that you were actually propping open one of your eyelids. being said, Mr Deputy Speaker, but finding the topic and the speeches rather soporific. Wentworth to come back to the question before the chair. soporific or boring speeches are given by members of this House: they are set pieces; they are not speeches which are given off the cuff but speeches which are read. I think it is fair to say in your defence, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the reason that you were propping open your eyelids and looking at the ceiling is because one of those occasions was occurring in this very place. That is a reason why we ought to think about the sorts of reforms that are being proposed in the Main Committee by the Procedure Committee. It is also important to note that there are other possible explanations for the emptiness of the chamber, which is part of the problem being addressed by the Procedure Committee. One explanation, unfortunately, is the incredible amount of committee work that many of us have to undertake. I sit on four committees of the parliament and I sit on several other committees of the backbench of my party. I find that I am continually going from one meeting to another. I do not have the opportunities that I would like to sit in the House and listen to some of the second reading speeches, which I think are of great importance. The other problem is television. We have TVs in our rooms. Why would we come down to the chamber if we can sit in our rooms, put our feet up and listen to the speech as it is being given without having to go all the way down to the chamber? Another problem is that we have constituents and lobbyists continually knocking on our doors wanting to have a bit of our time, wanting us to hear their arguments and wanting to advance their cases in relation to particular aspects of either their work or their constituency concerns. So there are a lot of calls on the time of ordinary members of parliament. I have mentioned a few of the reasons we sometimes have an empty chamber for second reading speeches, which is the concern of the Procedure Committee and the matter that is before the parliament at the moment. I agree warmly with the comments of the member for Chifley regarding the need for this reform, but I am not sure that the mere fact that we are going to shorten the second reading speech by five minutes is necessarily going to lead to MAIN COMMITTEE",296,Committees

384,Mr King,"Some people say that the reason we often have an empty chamber is thatgreater participation in the parliament and more members coming in to listen to what is being said. There is also a caveat. We ought to recall that the second reading speech is a formal occasion as far as the government and opposition spokespeople are concerned. It is important from the point of view of the courts of the land and tribunals that they observe, hear and are able to read precisely what the government has to say about any piece of legislation, so that when it comes to interpretation, as is provided for under the Acts Interpretation Act of the parliament, they can take into account those comments. However, courts do not take into account the observations of ordinary members of parliament in their debates on a particular measure; therefore, there is an opportunity for greater flexibility in our procedures in that regard. This is where it seems to me that we can make an advance that might solve this problem of sterile debate and an empty chamber. That advance is in the proposal put forward by the Procedure Committee to permit questions. It is suggested in the proposal that, at the commencement of his or her address, the speaker could opt in or opt out of accepting questions. I would prefer to be a little more dictatorial on that and suggest that the trial is not going to be effective unless we require every second reading speaker, other than the formal set piece debates that I have mentioned, to submit himself or herself to that interrogation or to the possibility of interrogation. At the end of the day, it seems to me that the real reason this measure will enliven debate is not because we will not be listening to any more soporific speeches or we will be dragging people out of their rooms because they are not taking meetings with constituents or listening to lobbyists or watching the TV. The real reason is because they will be able to take points on their opponents-and that is what this chamber is really about, at the end of the day. As Disraeli said, the duty of the opposition is to oppose. Members of the opposition will be able to come in and take points on government speakers. Indeed, it will also work the other way around: members of the government will be able to take points on the opposition and expose the emptiness of their concerns and their opposition to government legislation. I can see benefits and merits in this proposal from the Procedure Committee from both points of view. But at the end of the day I think it will really achieve some improvement in relation to the problem that it is designed to address. I commend the chair, the deputy chairthe member for Chifley-and the other members of the committee for this proposal. There should be some improvement in the amount of interaction in the debate in the parliament so as to improve our presentation and the level of debate and to solve the issues of the sterile debate and the empty chamber.

385,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.26 A.m.),"by leave-The reason I have sought leave to coning Committee on the National Capital and External Territories will add another dimension to the island’s chronicles. I hope, with goodwill, it will not be a bumpy ride. The report’s title-Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?-translates literally to ‘Who guards the guards themselves?’ or, if you like, ‘Who guards the guardians?’ In a small independent community, the quality and integrity of leadership must not only be present but must be seen to be present. I expect that there will be some soul-searching after the release of this report, which calls for wide-ranging changes to the conduct of governance on Norfolk Island. Let me make one thing clear from the outset: the committee have an overriding interest in preserving the principle of self-government for Norfolk Island. We do not want to change the system simply to change its operational nature. Those who oversee the governance of Norfolk Island on a day-to-day basis must realise that, while they have a large degree of autonomy, the island remains under the umbrella of Australian law, and for its future well-being its governance must be consistent with that law. While I never enjoy using heavy-handed tactics, it has to be acknowledged that the standards and practices of governance on Norfolk Island must be made more transparent and effective. It is disturbing when so many witnesses giving evidence at a public inquiry ask to be heard in camera. Fear of this sort-real or perceived-can have no part in the Australian experience, whether that be in the most remote inland community of Australia or the most distant island territory. While Fletcher Christian was in one sense the founder of the Pitcairn community, which later became the Norfolk Island community, it has to be said that John Adams, with his sense of decency, ethics and fear of God, established a new platform for decency, cohesion and community progress. In a parallel sense, I hope that this report may be a new platform for a second stable period of great advancement for Norfolk Island. Let me make it perfectly clear: I am a passionate supporter of Norfolk Island and its right to self-government. But that carries with it responsibilities. In fact, I believe Norfolk Island has the potential to be a model for other Pacific independent units and nations, and I genuinely think it is well on the way to achieving that goal. Norfolk Island is unique. It has a unique culture, environment and heritage, and truly unique people. I for one will have no part in harming those most charming attributes of the island and its people. However, the fact remains that it badly needs a range of accountability mechanisms to be put in place to ensure that all residents enjoy fair governance and there are processes that protect the rights of the individual. We are not asking for the impossible. We are simply saying that Norfolk Island should bring its laws and regulations, to the extent possible-and I understand that, with 3,000 people, you cannot make everything fit into a Queensland, New South Wales or Tasmanian mould-into line with all other levels of Australian governance. Chifley would like to address the chair? sustainability of Norfolk Island. The second report, covering financial sustainability measures, will be issued by the committee next year.

388,Mr Neville,"Please do! This is the first of two reports on the governance and financialthese recommendations. As I said, the issue will be investigated in more detail by the committee next year. I assure the residents and government of Norfolk Island that the committee members will do a thorough job. There are other issues that will be investigated by the committee next year. It is my belief that the committee should play a more supportive role in matters of transport, health and aged care. Australia has always fulfilled its obligations to its offshore islands and territories. Indeed, we have an almost pastoral affection for our friends who live off the mainland. But our overriding interest in good and fair governance throughout the Pacific means that these recommendations must be heard and put into practice. The report recommends that the continuation of self-government for Norfolk Island be conditional upon the timely implementation of specific external mechanisms of accountability and reforms to the political system recommended by the committee. These external accountability mechanisms include oversight of government conduct by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, financial and performance audits by the Commonwealth Auditor-General, oversight of elections by the Australian Electoral Commission, extension of the jurisdiction of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption to Norfolk Island and application of freedom of information and whistleblower legislation. These measures are essential to the long-term future of Norfolk Island and, in the committee’s opinion, they are not negotiable. They are necessary to bring Norfolk Island’s system of administration into line with the rest of Australia in the interests of cohesion, good governance and building a stronger foundation for the years ahead. Wide-ranging reforms to Norfolk Island’s political system are vital to the reforms of its governance. Those reforms include that all meetings of the Legislative Assembly be publicised in advance and held in public, except for matters relating to employment conditions of public offices; that a code of conduct be adopted for members of the assemblyof Norfolk Island from Australia’s migration zone? governing territory and I would find it difficult to envisage that circumstance. I will go on in this speech to talk about the internal migration matters of that island. As to whether government intends to add something of that nature, I am not aware. The list of political matters includes the establishment of a register of pecuniary and nonpecuniary interests for members of the assembly; the Chief Minister being elected from members of the assembly, with the right to appoint three ministers from the remaining members of the assembly; the appointment of an independent speaker and deputy speaker by the island administrator on the advice of the federal minister for territories; the establishment of the Norfolk Island assembly standing committee to review government expenditure; and four-year terms with the possibility of the assembly being dissolved in the fourth year if two-thirds of MAIN COMMITTEE",299,Committees

394,Mr Neville,"I do not think that is really relevant to the report in question. It is a selfthe assembly agree. Without a doubt these are the most basic fundamentals in running a modern-day government. Other key recommendations of the report include that the federal government remove Norfolk Island’s power in respect of immigration. I find that interesting and perhaps one of the more visible recommendations of the committee’s report. As it stands, Norfolk Island upholds its own Immigration Act 1980, which is overseen by an immigration committee and the minister, with decisions reviewable by the federal minister. The issue of immigration was investigated by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 1999. The commission recommended that, on balance, the island’s immigration regime be repealed and that the Commonwealth’s Migration Act 1958 be extended to Norfolk Island, thus bringing it into line with the other Australian offshore territories. That raises a matter that was implicit in the question raised earlier. We realise that retaining the Pitcairn culture and the feel of Norfolk Island is paramount. Committee members are sympathetic to the challenges which will come from trying to achieve the right balance between tradition and development. However, the immigration policies are not the best way to achieve balance. There are factors such as housing availability and employment opportunities and the practical aspects of holding a passport for travel to the mainland, and these are thought to be deterrents enough to unsustainable population growth on the island. I personally believe that other measures may need to be taken. The island is small and fragile. It has a number of itinerant workers, and that needs to be regulated in some way. However, I think that the six-month residency rule for the right to vote is consistent with the longest period of qualification amongst the Australian states, namely Tasmania, but as I said I would support measures to ensure that this rule is complemented by regulations concerning temporary workers, permanent residence and environmental sustainability. Other key recommendations include the extension of the Model Criminal Code with respect to corruption on Norfolk Island, and that the federal government review and assess the level of income support and health and medical assistance required by Norfolk Island to ensure parity with entitlements paid to mainland residents. In particular, the committee recommends that the federal government consider resuming responsibility for social security and extend Medicare and the PBS to Norfolk Island, and that Norfolk Island be included in the federal electorate of Canberra for the purposes of voting in federal elections and referendums and that this be made compulsory for all eligible Norfolk Island residents. However, I might add that for the local roll the government are allowing people who are currently on the rolllargely New Zealand or British citizens-to be grandfathered and they will be allowed to remain on the roll. The only people joining the roll in future will be Australian citizens. Norfolk Islanders are currently excluded from most Commonwealth programs and services because they pay no Commonwealth tax. I think at times that government departments have hidden behind that shield and have not delivered services that might be expected by people in other remote parts of Australia. I believe that Norfolk Island is entitled to special taxation measures and I respect the duty-free status as part of its unique tourist profile. I have no doubt that the vast majority of the Norfolk Island community are hard working, conscientious people who want to see their home territory prosper and flourish. I am quite confident that Norfolk Island can and will take its place as a leading Pacific island community. This report is the first step in the way forward, and I urge all residents, community leadMAIN COMMITTEE ers and businesses to get behind these recommendations, put them into practice and build a brighter and better future for Norfolk Island as their antecedent Adams desired for them. Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, of which I am a member, for its work on this very important report, entitled Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? I am pleased to have the document here in my hand and for it to be distributed across Norfolk Island and throughout Australia. I understand that one of the important distribution processes of this report is that it is to be put into the post office box of every resident of Norfolk Island. I think that is an important step because the people on Norfolk Island need to see the actual words of this report-not just the rumour and the innuendo about what we may or may not have done but the actuality of it, and what is actually proposed. I like the title, which means ‘Who guards the guardians?’, but I would prefer that it had been put in English and not in this other language-what is it, Latin?-because this is really a down-to-earth, sensible series of recommendations for the people on Norfolk Island, who I think have waited too long for the kinds of recommendations that are contained in this report. I think the core issue on Norfolk Island is the electoral system, which at the moment is bizarre. I think that a system in which residents on the island can vote up to four times for one candidate shows just how crook things are on Norfolk Island. A system in which people can vote up to four times for one candidate is open to misinterpretation at best and abuse at worse. I think the problem it highlights is that, while there is not necessarily corruption and abuse of the system on the island, it is open to abuse and corruption. That creates fertile ground for rumour and innuendo and an assumption that there is corruption. I do not think that in Australia today any Australian should be in a community, in an environment, in which those sorts of doubts exist. We have a free and open society in Australia, and all Australians are entitled to that. They are entitled to be able to express their views without fear or favour. They are entitled to pursue and represent their political views without fear or favour. On Norfolk Island, for some reason or other, there remains this doubt. There is confusion, and people misinterpret the system. For instance, some people on Norfolk Island maintain the view that they are somehow divorced from Australia, that they are not part of Australia. This kind of confusion should not exist. People’s rights and obligations as part of Australia should never be in doubt. This committee has done a good job in seeking out where there is confusion and doubt in the minds of people and in trying to put it straight. I believe there are many people on the island who are inordinately powerful, or there is a perception that they have an inordinate amount of power. On the other hand, there are people that, I feel, are quite powerless. I think there is an underclass on Norfolk Island. I think the committee has done a good job in seeking to balance the interests of those two groups. It is important that we require more accountability of those that are powerful and that we provide more opportunity for those that are powerless. I think we have done that quite effectively. It is absolutely vital that the government respond to this report by the committee. The problem in the past has been that there have been many reports produced and no action has been taken. People have got the idea that there is no connection between the recommendations made and the reality that then follows. That is the problem that I think Norfolk Island has today. We have ended up with the situation where there are inferences rather than realities. I MAIN COMMITTEE",300,Committees

And the same thing happens over on the island: the guardians that are discussed in the committee’s report get reports and proposals and they say they are going to act on them-that is what happens here and it happens on the islandbut no action is ever forthcoming. People on the island, whether they are the privileged few or the underclass, think, ‘The situation will never change and we’ll continue to grind on as we have in the past.’ But in this report we are talking about the introduction of ICAC and having it review the activities of governments. That is a reality anywhere in Australia today; it should be the reality on Norfolk Island. There should be a body that is prepared without fear or favour to look into the activities of government and say whether there might be corruption or whether there might be something that is being done in a way that is not proper and suggest ways in which such activities should be corrected. That should apply on Norfolk Island just as it applies anywhere else. The Auditor-General should review the activities on the island of the government and the public service, which of course is the norm everywhere else in Australia. It applies to all other bureaucracies; it should apply on Norfolk Island too. On the other side of things-talking not just about accountability but about the rights, responsibilities and entitlements of people-the extension of Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is something that is a welcome norm for people on Norfolk Island, just as it is the norm for the rest of Australia. The disclosure of people’s pecuniary interests when they seek to speak in the legislative assembly on a particular issue is important too. Of course it is important that their pecuniary interests be noted and open for all people to see when they are discussing legislation and the future of the island and what it is that they want done. The implementation of the new electoral system that is in the report will replace the quirky Illinois system with something which is first past the post. I am not a big fan of first past the post necessarily or this block-vote system, but it is a hell of a lot better than this bizarre Illinois voting system, where everyone gets four votes and they can give them to whomever the hell they like-I mean, really! I think the combination of that Illinois voting system and the very long period in which people are required to wait before they can vote on the island-900 days-is what has cemented the privileged group and the underclass in place. If you are in the underclass, firstly, you are probably waiting to get your vote, and, secondly, the four votes that can be distributed are certainly not going to be distributed in a way that is going to assist those people in the underclass group who are so disenfranchised. The inclusion of Norfolk Island in the electorate of Canberra is something I feel very strongly about. The people on Norfolk Island need to have a voice in Canberra. It is no good that every time they want to have a say on something that affects them they have to put their Chief Minister or some other minister on a plane and fly him to Canberra. Then he has to wander around Canberra, like some kind of alien in his own hometown, and speak up about what should happen on Norfolk Island. There should be a representative of Norfolk Island in the parliament in Canberra. Of course, this is how we do it: we make Norfolk Island part of the electorate of Canberra and that, at last, would give them a voice here in Canberra. The AEC oversighting elections is something that happens all across Australia. It ensures that the MAIN COMMITTEE electoral system is being properly attended to. It is the standard and the ruler that is run over every other electorate in Australia; it should also apply to voting on Norfolk Island. Freedom of information is a two-edged sword, because it is not always entirely effective, but it certainly is something that we all have to aspire to. Giving the public more information about the business of government is a very good thing, something we need to pursue, and of course it should apply on Norfolk Island just as it does here. This report says we should move away from this quirky 900-day registration thing down to a six-month thing, and I note that the government and the minister are currently producing legislation with a view to doing that. Well, isn’t that great? We have the minister and the government in agreement with the findings of this committee. In a great epiphany, perhaps we can move towards that more quickly than we otherwise would. That is a good outcome. I think the idea that the people on Norfolk Island should be Australian citizens is fantastic. I think they should acknowledge the fact that this is where they have their link. It is no good to have this weird collection of people who maintain that because they are British subjects they can somehow exercise a position on Norfolk Island that they do not anywhere else in Australia. This idea is merely providing the sort of standardisation that applies everywhere else. The idea that legislation can slip behind in the way that it does on Norfolk Island currently is something we have to address. This report identifies the long list of legislation. This reflects the fact that, like the reports that have been allowed to sit there on the shelves gathering dust, the same thing has happened over there with legislation. How can you have a situation where child welfare laws are allowed to remain in dispute? This legislation picks that up and says that they should comply with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the same as everywhere else. I really have a question in my mind when I see events currently on Pitcairn Island and what is going on there. I do not think that we should have another group of Pitcairn Islanders, which is what the heritage of many on Norfolk Island today is. We should not allow that to be in dispute. The fact is that child welfare laws are important, and so is the reformation of the criminal justice laws on Norfolk Island. They cannot be allowed to simply lie there any longer. Along with the regulation of companies, it is necessary that all these things on Norfolk Island are kept up to date, making sure that there are no loopholes. These are things that have to happen on Norfolk Island, just as they happen in Australia, New Zealand and all other First World countries. It is important that we extend to Norfolk Island, the right for that to occur on that island in the same way as it occurs in every other part of Australia. In closing, I implore the government to read very closely this report and to act on it. Because Norfolk Island has only 2,500 people and is so far out in the ocean, it does not mean that it should be divorced from all the rights and obligations of the rest of Australia. It is important that we move forward. We cannot just sit here and say, ‘Well, isn’t it quirky out there on Norfolk Island? Isn’t it lovely? It’s beautiful scenery, lovely weather and great for the tourists, so let’s just let it slip by.’ That is not the case anymore. We have to move on into the 21st century on Norfolk Island, just as we do in every other part of the world. As the tourists come and go, it is great for them to be able to look and marvel at the wonderful convict heritage. It is great for them to look at that beautiful island and the environment over there, but when they go there they should not be subject to 18th century environmental laws or 18th century electoral laws. You are not going into a time warp. You are going there to MAIN COMMITTEE look at history, not to experience it. You should not be flogged with a cat-o’-nine-tails just because you are on Norfolk Island. This is not the total experience that we are seeking. What we want are 21st century laws to enable the experience of people who live on Norfolk Island to be just as good as that of every other Australian, for them to enjoy their heritage and their place in the world without having doubts about exactly what their entitlements and protections under Australian law are. That has been the situation for far too long. By proceeding as suggested in this report, we will definitely overcome any of the hesitancies that may have applied in the past and proceed definitely into the 21st century. Debate (on motion by Mr Wakelin) adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Veterans’ Affairs: Australia Remembers about a wonderful program that many years ago as Minister for Veterans’ AffairsI had the pleasure of conducting on behalf of the Keating government. It was known as Australia Remembers. I say this because only a couple of weeks ago in Brisbane the Greenslopes Private Hospital, which used to be known as the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital, had a special function to which they most graciously invited me, along with my wife, as the special guest. They billed it as the Australia Remembers dinner. It was a wonderful occasion. They invited people who were involved in the commemorations back in 1995. Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, you may remember that in 1995 we celebrated-or commemorated, rather; it was not so much a celebration-the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. We took the opportunity of thanking all those generations of people-such as the generations of the 1930s that were brought up after the Great Depression-who were asked to go and fight for their country at a time when this country’s sovereignty was at risk, when we actually did have Japanese submarines in our waters, when Darwin was bombed and Broome was strafed, if I remember correctly, and there were Catalinas in the bay there. As part of the celebrations I went up there and we held special commemorations. It was a wonderful time. Ex-service men and women were remembered. Some people say that it was that remembrance program that reignited interest in ANZAC Day and, in many respects, that is why we are getting so many thousands of people coming along to ANZAC Day ceremonies. At Cleveland in my own electorate, I remember that before Australia Remembers you would get 300; now we are getting 3,000. I think that is replicated right around the country. That is a marvellous thing. The reason is that at the time we made sure that the program was on a completely bipartisan basis and that the young people-in fact, the member for Moncrieff might remember it as he might have been at school then, although probably not; but in any event he would remember it-the children, the youth of this country were being told about how much they owed to the generation of that time. Mr Alan Kinkade is the General Manager of Greenslopes Private Hospital, which is a hospital owned by the Ramsay Health group, owned by Paul Ramsay. They organised it at their expense. They invited people who were involved at the time. I had the great pleasure of seeing once again a person who is so well known in this country and not understood muchMAIN COMMITTEE",302,Committees

397,Mr Sciacca (Bowman) (11.55 A.m.),"I rise in this adjournment debate today to talkparticularly by people from my side. I talk about the one and only Bruce Ruxton. Bruce Ruxton was there. He is a friend of mine. I have no hesitation in saying that. He is the sort of person who will carry you on his shoulders a thousand miles. He is that sort of person. If he is you friend, he is your friend. He did a marvellous job during his time as the president of the RSL in Victoria. Others turned up as well. Mr Paul Ramsay himself, who it is very difficult to get to come to these sorts of things, came along because he himself has a great emotional attachment to that generation of Australians. I was very honoured to see him there. There was Mr Cyril Gilbert, who was a prisoner of war in Changi and with whom I had the pleasure of visiting the Changi prison in Singapore. Then there was Josie Jones, a wonderful lady and a close personal friend of mine from Mildura, who went all the way up there to be part of this remembrance dinner. I want to say that I cannot believe how well the Ramsay Health group did this. Alan Kinkade used to be the manager of the Concord Repatriation Hospital in Sydney some time ago, and his new job is at Greenslopes. At Greenslopes, they concentrate on veterans. It used to be a public hospital but it was sold by the Commonwealth government at the time, just before I became minister, to the Ramsay Health Group. I want to place on record the marvellous job that they do for the veterans of Queensland. I want to place on record that in all the time. I have been a member of parliament not once have I received a complaint about the service that that hospital gives to the veteran community. All in the veteran community love to go to Greenslopes Private Hospital if they have to go to a hospital-that is the one they want to go to. I want to thank Alan Kinkade, the people in charge of the Greenslopes hospital, Paul Ramsay and those wonderful veterans who fought so hard for us during those dark years. I want to place on record in this parliament that I truly appreciated what they did with the Australia Remembers dinner. (Time expired) Australian Labor Party: Policies today an issue about politics as a craft. It is said by some that politics is the art of the possible. I have to say that it seems to me that there is a certain measure of truth in that statement, which I would prefer to translate this way: politics is really about people and not so much about power games, big names or even big ideas. At the end of the day, politics is about people and about how one represents the concerns of people in this place. It seems to me that it is appropriate to reconsider that proposition and the nature of the craft that those who work in this place use and how we apply it to our work and the issues that are currently before the parliament. I say that because it seems to me that the opposition has forgotten that fundamental precept. We have an opposition that is disunited not only in its leadership but also in relation to the policies that it is attempting to put forward in this parliament. It is difficult to see any clear direction in relation to economic issues. A good example of that concerns the flying of the kite about negative gearing by the new Leader of the Opposition. The suggestion that negative gearing should be abolished would, in my electorate, create tremendous concern. A lot of aspirational voters in my electorate-and there are many-would be extremely concerned about that proposal. I do not propose to allow the opposition or the people in my electorate to forget that that proposal has been seriously MAIN COMMITTEE",305,Adjournment
398,Mr King (Wentworth) (12.00 P.m.),"I wish to raise for general discussion in the debateadvanced by the opposition in this parliament and that if they become elected that will be a proposal that would be seriously considered by the new leadership of the opposition. But it is not just that issue which I would point to in this regard. Another concerns defence issues. As a serving officer in the reserves of this country and as a parliamentarian I see issues regarding the defence of this nation and our security as being of the utmost importance. Therefore, I have listened with great concern over the last few months to the proposal that the defence of this country should be supplemented and to some extent taken over by a coastguard that would in some way replace or substitute our naval forces. It seems to me that that proposal is a half-baked one that forsakes the traditional concerns of this parliament and the Commonwealth for a proper and serious defence policy profile for the Commonwealth and that it is one that should be exposed for what it really is. It is said that this is a measure that would help to address the problems of border security and be an alternative to the government’s refugee programs in that regard by stopping illegal entrance into this country. But, with the greatest respect, I believe the opposite may well be the case, because the effect of a coastguard would be to bring people to Australia, not keep illegals out. RecentlyI had an example of another issue, this one concerning veterans’ affairs. I spoke in my electorate, as a representative of our Prime Minister, on several issues relating to veterans’ affairs. Bruce Ruxton and others were there. I became concerned that the tenor of the opposition’s views was completely opposed to some of the basic issues that the veterans were proposing. I do not propose to say much more about that, other than to simply say this: politics is about people; it is not about power or big names or power games. The government of this day remembers that, and that is why it will remain in office. (Time expired) Newcastle Electorate: Rugby World Cup 2003 Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.06 p.m.)-TodayI would like to draw the House’s attention to an ongoing problem in Newcastle, but first I would like to say that in Parliament House we had the great pleasure of greeting and congratulating the Australian Rugby World Cup team. I certainly want to send my best wishes to Ben Darwin for a speedy recovery. We look forward to his returning to Newcastle to take up his studies. Although the Australian team came second and was not the final winner, the Australian economy certainly was. The Australian Trade Commission estimated the national economic impact of the event at between $800 million and $1 billion. International sport is big business, and we know that. But we in Newcastle do not have an international standard football stadium, so we could not host and thus benefit from the world cup. That was not the case for other cities and towns around the country. Using research by Citigroup and the London Financial Times, I put forward the following estimates of how much each city and town in Australia gained from hosting the world cup: Sydney, 12 matches, $171 million; Gosford, an hour’s drive from Newcastle, hosted three matches to the tune of a $43 million spin-off for that city; and the town of Launceston in Tasmania hosted one match, worth $16 million, and that is a conservative estimate. The sixth largest city in Australia, Newcastle, does not have an international standard football stadium and could not host even one match, yet one match at Launceston was worth $16 million. The economic spin-offs do come, and they are important. The city of Newcastle still has an unemployment rate, according to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, of 10 per cent. Our unemployment is not diminishing. Unemployment has diminished in the Upper Hunter, where mining has conMAIN COMMITTEE tinued to flourish, but certainly young people’s unemployment in Newcastle, where the rate is 27 per cent, remains critical. We have been saying for too long that a stadium is not just about football; it is also about economic and employment benefits to the city of Newcastle, but for too long we have been ignored. I point to a speech made by Mr Baldwin, the member for Paterson, on 4 June 2002. He understood very well that sport related tourism was essential for the Newcastle and Hunter areas. He said in that speech that he was ‘disappointed’ that the New South Wales Labor Party had walked away from the Energy Australia Stadium. I would point out that, three weeks after that speech, the state’s Premier made a contribution of $23.6 million to the stadium. Newcastle and Hunter citizens have done their bit-18,000 to 20,000 of them attend Newcastle Knights football matches-and have certainly paid their dues towards a new stadium. Mr Baldwin suggested that the lack of funding for Energy Australia Stadium was one of his biggest disappointments. He said that because he knew that without adequate stadia we would not be able to host a world cup, and that would be a dreadful thing. It was a dreadful thing. Apparently he has no influence over the Prime Minister, otherwise the government would have contributed its share of money to the redevelopment of our stadium. I have before me 10,000 signatures collected by the state members in the Hunter. I would mention John Bartlett, Bryce Gaudry, Kerry Hickey, Jeff Hunter, John Mills, Matthew Morris, Milton Orkopoulos and John Price and I thank them for their hard work in collecting those signatures. I am delighted to put those signatures forward on behalf of the other three Hunter members who are in the House-the member for Shortland, Jill Hall; the member for Charlton, Kelly Hoare; and the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon. The four of us have worked very hard and we demand to see some money soon, particularly as we know that the Prime Minister received an estimated boost of around two per cent in GDP for the December quarter to the economy, just from the World Cup. That is almost $1 billion spent in Australia that was not anticipated. It is a lovely boost to the economy. We would now like to see a lovely boost to Newcastle and the Hunter, and we would like to see the remaining cost of our stadium redevelopment funded. Right now we are actually reconstructing that stadium with the money put forward by the New South Wales state government. We all look forward to and anticipate enjoying some cover that we have not had. I am a long-term football supporter and attendee, and I always take my plastic poncho with me. But we would love to have some cover and proper seating at our stadium. More importantly, we would love the opportunity to host international events and see our economy and employment flourish. It is time Mr Baldwin and his colleagues down here pressured the Prime Minister and made sure he put up his $20 million. Labor promised it at the last election and they stand by their commitment. We need that money ASAP. Bob Baldwin, member for Paterson, it is your turn now-get us that money so that we can enjoy the benefits of international sporting events and economic growth from sports related tourism. (Time expired) Moncrieff Electorate: Carrara Stadium Newcastle, who represents Australia’s seventh largest city. Ms Grierson-Sixth largest city! MAIN COMMITTEE",306,Adjournment
399,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (12.11 P.m.),"How fortuitous that I should follow the member forsixth largest city, but I cannot help but think that they are fudging their numbers a bit. When you take into account the actual population numbers for the cities of the Gold Coast and Newcastle, you recognise that, in fact, the Gold Coast is Australia’s sixth largest city. The reason that I say it is fortuitous is because I too rise today to speak about the need for a new sports stadium on the Gold Coast. Rather than the need for a new one from scratch, I rise to speak about the fact that the Queensland Labor government, unlike the New South Wales Labor government, is yet to put any real money whatsoever into the stadium at Carrara on Queensland’s Gold Coast. It was with great interest that I listened to the member for Newcastle speak of how the New South Wales Premier put $23.6 million into the stadium at Newcastle. I wonder why it is that the Beattie Labor government refuses to fund in any real sense a new stadium at Carrara. Over the past decade or so we have seen the Carrara stadium being labelled a white elephant and called a hole in the ground into which money is continually poured by the Gold Coast City Council. But the reason is that the Gold Coast City Council is not in a position to make the kind of substantial funding allocation required to ensure that Carrara stadium-that is, Gold Coast stadium-reaches a level that will be appropriate to ensure that we attract and have regular sporting events on both the national and international scale. I also listened with great interest as I heard the member for Newcastle speak about the economic spin-offs that flow as a consequence of having a sports facility. I heard the member for Newcastle speak about Gosford’s $43 million boost and Launceston’s $16 million boost as a result of the Rugby World Cup. Yet the Gold Coast, Australia’s premier tourism playground and with Australia’s sixth largest city, failed to have any capture whatsoever of any events to do with the Rugby World Cup, despite the fact that the English team indeed trained for part of the time on the Gold Coast and very many of those tourists that visited Australia no doubt would have come to our city for part of their holidays. Gold Coast city is working closely to try to obtain a national rugby league team. My colleague the member for McPherson is part of the bid team to secure an NRL team for the Gold Coast. But a crucial first step is some investment by the Beattie Labor government. The Beattie Labor government in Queensland knows full well that it has primary responsibility for infrastructure spending on events like this. I heard the member for Newcastle and I take note of her comments, but they are further along the process than we are in Queensland. At least in New South Wales, the Labor Premier has been willing to put his hand into his pocket. It stands in stark contrast to the Brisbanecentric Beattie, who put $320 million into a new stadium in Brisbane yet continues to refuse to put any dollars into a stadium on the Gold Coast. It is, as I said, quite fortuitous that I should have the chance to raise this today immediately following the member for Newcastle. It is high time that we had a stadium on the Gold Coast. I know I speak for all Gold Coasters when I say that we want a quality stadium on the Gold Coast. We want one that is funded, in conjunction with private operators, by the Queensland state government, who need to stop investing literally billions of dollars into Brisbane, a city that is 80 kilometres up the road, at the expense of what I am sure Premier Beattie sees as its poor second cousins which live on the Gold Coast.

Fittingly, I presented certificates to teams and individuals at the Gold Coast Sporting Hall of Fame in Southport. The Moncrieff Sport Achievement Awards recognise the great achievements of our local sports people, sports teams and supporters at both a community and an elite level. Young and old athletes were among those who received a certificate and it was pleasing to see so many family members, coaches and supporters there to congratulate each award winner. We have a proud sporting history. I am particularly proud that the Gold Coast is breeding a wealth of sporting greats and future superstars. The Gold Coast is fortunate to have a wonderful climate, good facilities and many great sporting role models in our own backyard, some of whom I met last Friday. I would particularly like to thank Les Jones from Gold FM, who was master of ceremonies for the event, and also Daphne Pirie and her colleagues from the Gold Coast Sporting Hall of Fame, who helped make the event a great success. (Time expired) Cunningham Electorate: Employment tainable jobs for the people in my electorate of Cunningham, despite the government’s indifference to this issue, as evidenced by the region having some of the highest rates of unemployment in this country and basically the government doing little about that. And despite having a budget surplus in the billions of dollars that would enable public works on repairing and creating the social capital of our railways, hospitals and schools the length and breadth of the Illawarra for decades-improving the quality of life in the entire Illawarra regionwe still have problems. Despite this government’s inaction, though, I have been consistently championing further development of Port Kembla as part of a strategy to increase employment opportunities for sustainable jobs in the Illawarra since I was elected in October 2002. Yesterday I welcomed news that Patrick Stevedores and P&O have indicated a preference to relocate their existing New South Wales general cargo stevedoring trade from Sydney Harbour to Port Kembla by 2006. That is good news for my electorate and good news for the Illawarra generally. The New South Wales government has also come on board by responding to my call last week and releasing its plan for the relocation of shipping business away from the Port of Sydney and towards Newcastle and Port Kembla. Whilst the plan is very light in detail, particularly in terms of the government’s financial contributions, it does reveal that the operators of the general cargo terminals at White Bay and Darling Harbour want to relocate to Port Kembla because mixed cargoes of containers and break-bulk cargo cannot be cost effectively stevedored at the major Port Botany container berths due to a combination of irregular shipping timetables and specific equipment and storage requirements. Nonetheless, I am also concerned that the state government’s priorities are skewed, as Macquarie Street sees the expansion of Port Botany as being the best way to respond to increased demand for port services, despite the long standing opposition to any expansion of the port by residents and the broader community of the Botany area and despite the Illawarra and Newcastle needing much more to be done to reduce unemployment rates. In a predictable move aimed at taking the heat out of the protests of the residents of Port Botany, the New South Wales government has announced a commission of inquiry into Port Botany’s expansion. According to reports, this expansion will require the reclaiming of 57 MAIN COMMITTEE",309,Adjournment
401,Mr Organ (Cunningham) (12.16 P.m.),"I rise to speak on the progress of getting susacres of land on Port Botany or, to look at it another way, 57 hectares of marine ecosystem will be destroyed. So here you have, on the one hand, the destruction of an ecosystem, in combination with vocal opposition from the community of Port Botany against any expansion of the port. On the other hand, you have the people of the Illawarra with a port raring to go but neglected and forgotten by this government, receiving not much more than the scraps of Sydney Harbour. Accordingly, I call on the New South Wales minister for the Illawarra-whose performance so far at best can be described as flaccid in his support for the region that he purports to represent-to pull his finger out and do more for the Illawarra so that all members of the Illawarra community can have as much access to work as they want and deserve. That is right: the responsibility for job creation rests squarely on his shoulders. He is in the government and he is a minister. He must go into bat for the people of the Illawarra and get them a bigger slice of the state’s port action. The people of the Illawarra and its surrounds deserve no less. If he cannot do this, he must reconsider his future. On a similar theme, I take this opportunity to remind the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services of my invitation to join me on an inspection of facilities at the port as part of my call for specific federal funding for expanding Port Kembla’s share of Australia’s transport infrastructure under the AusLink green paper. I wrote to the minister over two weeks ago-on 18 November-inviting him to the Illawarra for this purpose but I am yet to receive a reply. It is my sincere hope that an acceptance of my invitation is in the mail. AusLink could create jobs where the state government does not. I therefore look forward to a truly Commonwealth approach where the state and federal governments both work together to provide long-term sustainable jobs in and around Port Kembla and in the Illawarra region. Fisher Electorate: Passeggi Family stration) (12.20 p.m.)-I am particularly pleased to be able to speak in this adjournment debate and to welcome back to Australia and to the Sunshine Coast a family from Uruguay who have made their home at Buderim in my electorate for the past seven years. The Passeggi family had applied to come to Australia on a business visa but through no fault of their own their business, and another they attempted to get off the ground, failed. During the time they were here they became an integral part of the community and received the support of the Stella Maris Catholic parish at Maroochydore. In fact, more than 2,500 parishioners signed petitions and regularly held events to raise funds to assist the Passeggi family in their fight to remain in Australia. Father Joe Duffy, the parish priest, Musgrave lawyers, and Alan Musgrave and Mick Bull from that firm, and indeed the whole community worked very hard with me as the federal member to attain a situation where they were able to return to Australia with Australian residency visas on a permanent basis. The Passeggi family travelled to New Zealand just a short time ago and were able to return with permanent Australian residency visas. We were able to facilitate the quick processing of their applications, and their return home was a Christmas present not only for them but also for the entire Sunshine Coast community. I became aware of the family’s predicament earlier this year when it became clear that they needed assistance with their efforts to remain legally in Australia. I want to place on record my praise for both the former immigration minister, Philip Ruddock, and the current immigraMAIN COMMITTEE",310,Adjournment
402,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Adminition minister, Amanda Vanstone, for the way in which they were able to assist in working through the problems to make sure that these people were able to legitimately become part of our Sunshine Coast family. In my 10 years as a representative of the Sunshine Cost, I have never seen anything like the overwhelming support that this family has received, including front-page stories in the local paper, editorials, fundraising functions, letters to the editor, deputations to me, and letters from the children’s school mates. This family’s humility has touched so many people and everyone was prepared to work with them to make sure that they were able to come to Australia permanently. I want to place on record also my belief that the situation with the Passeggi family is a fine example of an immigration system that works. It shows that in individual circumstances the government is able to look at the plight of individuals who are worthy applicants for permanent residence. Our immigration system is fair. It recognises patience and hard work and it stresses the importance of families. It also recognises that when people do the right thing the law ought as much as possible to be compassionate in their situation. The Passeggi’s case, while unique and complex, is proof positive that the government’s immigration laws do allow eligible migrants who go through the proper channels to remain in Australia while balancing the need to protect our borders and way of life from those who queue-jump and attempt to enter the country illegally. Australia is a country which has freedom, stability and a way of life that is the envy of people throughout the world and it is no surprise that more than one million people knock on Australia’s door each year seeking to become permanent residents of our nation. As far as the Passeggi family is concerned, the local community saw the decision as one that indicated that the government and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs were prepared to listen to the case and plight of individual people in individual circumstances. The local community also recognised that the Passeggi family had a particularly worthy case and appreciated the efforts that the ministers and I had made on behalf of the family. The Passeggi family are now looking forward to a very bright and permanent future on the Sunshine Coast, with some of their children making plans to study at university and travel around Australia. Horatio Passeggi said he and his wife Stella chose to move to Australia to give their children the best opportunities they could. He said that since then the children have thrived, and he and his wife look forward to the children creating their own futures in what they see as truly a land of opportunity. The Sunshine Coast offers the Passeggis a myriad of opportunities and, as part of the visa, Horatio has been sponsored by Peter Shadforth of Shadforth Civil Engineering Contractors, a successful coast company, and he will be working with the company using his expertise to assist with the import and export of machinery from Japan and South America. I want to take the opportunity to salute this family. I greatly admire them and I am pleased to be able to welcome them into Australia.

404,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Corcoran),"I think you may be able to refer to the petiistered their strong opinion in relation to the Ipswich Motorway. This is indicative of the level of support that exists in south-east Queensland-not just in my electorate of Oxley but also in the electorate of Blair and in the surrounding region. These people have without doubt made a strong statement to the parliament that there are some things that are more important than politics-things like infrastructure. Infrastructure development in our communities is right at the centre of things that people need not only to grow and develop the economy but also to deliver jobs. People want and need jobs in our community, and the only way that those jobs can be brought to them is through infrastructure development. I want to put a couple of things on the record. The Ipswich Motorway has been an issue that we have debated for years. For me, the time for debate is over. It has been over for some time. We have an excellent report that was partly funded by the federal government-thank you to the federal government for doing that-and partly funded by the state government. There was an excellent outcome from that report. Everybody that was involved in an exhaustive consultation process agreed on one thing: the Ipswich Motorway needs a major upgrade. It needs a major upgrade because there is really is no other place for the traffic on the motorway and the people who live along it to go. I have made my views very clear not only in the House but also through the media and publicly at meetings. We can always talk about other roads, but at the end of the day you have to fix the central problem. I am happy to have as many roads as we possibly can, but the reality is that we need to get on with the job. In conclusion, by bringing these 4,792 names to the parliament I think I am making a clear statement as to the strong view of the people of the Oxley electorateHouse of Representatives. I put the question. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 12.29 p.m. until Wednesday, 11 February 2004 at 9.40 a.m. in accordance with the resolution agreed to this day.

406,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley),"Order! A division has been called in theThe following answers to questions were circulated: Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws (Question No. 1415) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 6 February 2003: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article by Paul Barry titled “Bankrupt in Paddo: barrister’s $3m unpaid taxes” which appeared in The Sydney Morning Herald on 26 February 2001, detailing the bankruptcy history of Mr Stephen Archer and attempts by creditors, including the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), to recover debts. (2) Is he aware that Mr Archer again comes up for a full public examination at the Federal Court Sydney Registry on 19-20 February 2003. (3) Is he also aware that this will be the third time Mr Archer has come before a court of law in a bid to use serial bankruptcy to avoid paying his creditors, principally the ATO, millions of dollars. (4) What action is the Government taking to deal with serial bankrupts like Mr Archer. (5) What action is the Government taking so that it will be able to alert the Law Society of New South Wales and the Bar Association of New South Wales of individuals like Mr Archer who use serial bankruptcy and family law and other legislative provisions to avoid paying tax. Refer to answer to question no. 1433. Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws (Question No. 1545) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 March 2003: How many (a) barristers and (b) solicitors paid the top marginal rate of income tax during the financial year ended 30 June 2001. See answer to Question on Notice number 43 tabled on 11 February 2003. Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws (Question No. 1884) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 May 2003: (1) Has the Commissioner of Taxation received a letter from the President of the New South Wales Bar Association referenced 01/120 and dated 9 February 2001. (2) Did that letter express concern regarding the divulging of information by certain officers of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) regarding certain Bar Association members’ taxation obligations. (3) Was information divulged to the media; if so, under what authority. (4) Does the letter say, in part, “I (the then NSW Bar Association President) made it clear… the Association was prepared to work with the ATO to inform barristers of potential tax problems” and later “Regrettably they have never come back to the Association…”. (5) Is it a fact that (a) in 1997 the NSW Bar Association unsuccessfully petitioned the Legal Services Commissioner about Mr Thomas Harrison, and (b) in 1999 the NSW Bar Association successfully",313,Adjournment

408,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:petitioned the Supreme Court to strike out Mr Stirling Hamman; if so, did the ATO notify any breaches of tax laws by either of these two former barristers to the NSW Bar Association. (6) Is there an existing protocol or procedure for the ATO to notify the Bar Associations in each jurisdiction upon the discovery of a barrister’s breach of taxation laws so that the Bar Association may commence action under the Legal Profession Act (NSW), or its equivalent in the other jurisdictions; if not, why not. (7) Is there an existing protocol or procedure for a Bar Association to notify the ATO upon the discovery of a barrister’s breach of taxation laws so that the ATO may consider prosecution; if not, why not. (8) Is it the case that the ATO gave information on the taxation affairs of Mr Thomas Harrison and Mr Stirling Hamman to the media and that this information was not provided to the Bar Association despite its repeated requests for this information; if so, why did the ATO give this information to the Media (namely Mr Paul Barry of The Sydney Morning Herald), rather than to the NSW Bar Association. (9) Can he confirm whether the Association’s letter to the Commissioner of Taxation dated 9 February 2001 contained the statement “This Association views with grave concern the fact that the ATO is apparently more prepared to deal with the media than this association”. (1) to (5) It would be inappropriate to comment on the private communications of the Taxation Commissioner. (6) No. Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 prevents the Commissioner of Taxation from discussing the affairs of individual taxpayers with others except when expressly empowered to do so under the Act. The Bar Association of New South Wales is not an entity to which the Commissioner can provide such information.

Funding and expenditure are normally linked to administrative areas which are used for a number of purposes related to the operation of a program, for example, Labour Market Regional (LMR), Employment Service Area (ESA) or Area Consultative Committee (ACC) location. The borders associated with these administrative areas do not necessarily coincide with electorate boundaries. 2. Where additional information is held such as the location of a program, this has provided a basis to link expenditure to an electorate. The information provided in the attached spreadsheet is therefore an approximation based on information available. 3. Figures in the attached spreadsheet generally indicate monies allocated, not monies spent. However, it should be noted that all Indigenous Employment Programme figures reflect actual expenditure. 4. An asterisk (*) assigned to a programme indicates that allocated funding is GST inclusive. 5. Only those DEWR programmes administered in the examined electorate are detailed in this document. Programmes detailed in the attached electorate expenditure report include: Community Support Programme (CSP) * Year and participant numbers: 1998(3,352); 1999(5,772); 2000 (13,810); 2001 (17,579); 2002 (5,286). In the 2001-02 Budget the Commonwealth Government announced the Personal Support Programme (PSP) as part of Australians Working Together. The PSP, managed by the Department of Family and Community Services (DFaCS), replaced the CSP and improves on the CSP by expanding the eligibility criteria and tailoring the programme to better meet the needs of its participants. The above figures are allocated to electorate based on the postal address of the recipients. Funding figures are based on actual expenditure. Employee Entitlements Support Scheme (EESS), General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) Recipient electorates are determined by claimants’ postcode where available. Some postcodes cover more than one electorate and the information contained shows all relevant data for each electorate. Due to postcodes covering multiple electorates, some payments to recipients will be assigned alphabetically to an electorate. This may result in a minor statistical anomaly. Funding figures are based on actual expenditure. Indigenous Employment Programmes (IEPs): Wage Assistance (WA) and Direct Assistance Offered under the umbrella of the Indigenous Employment Policy, the Indigenous Employment Programmes were implemented progressively from 1 July 1999 and include: Structured Training and Employment Projects (which replaced the former Training for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Programme), Wage Assistance, Direct Assistance, the Community Development Employment Project Placement Incentive, the Corporate Leaders for Indigenous Employment Project, the National Indigenous Cadetship Programme and Indigenous Community Volunteers (previously the ‘Voluntary Service to Indigenous Communities Foundation’). Services are also offered to Indigenous job seekers through the Indigenous Small Business Fund, Job Network services and Indigenous Employment Centres. The expenditure figures for the Wage Assistance and Direct Assistance programmes relates to claims for payment by contracted employers. Data is presented on the grounds that the address of the contracted employer that received funding was in the specified electorate. In many cases this will be the postal address of the contracted employer and does not necessarily reflect the location of actual employment. Figures provided reflect actual expenditure exclusive of GST. These figures are subject to change due to lags in data entry and ongoing systems reconciliations. Job Network Programmes Data on Job Network cover the following programmes: 1997-1998 to 2002-2003: Intensive Assistance, Job Matching, Job Search Training, New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, and Project Contracting (Harvest Labour Services) 2003-2004: Job Network Services, Job Placement Services, New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, Harvest Labour Services, National Harvest Labour Information Service, and the Employment Innovation Fund (there has been no expenditure for the last two programmes as at end September 2003). Job Network is administered on the basis of 19 Labour Market Regions and 137 Employment Service Areas, the boundaries of which do not align with those of federal electorates. Expenditure has been allocated to electorates on the basis of the location of Job Network sites. Small or zero expenditure against electorates does not mean that job seekers living in those electorates are not receiving Job Network services. The distribution of sites by electorate is entirely coincidental; sites are generally located near shopping centres and centres of employment. Job seekers choose Job Network members for a variety of reasons including location, proximity to transport routes/Centrelink office, satisfaction of friends and others. Figures are based on actual expenditure. Return to Work (RtW)* and Transition To Work (TtW) Return to Work (RtW) programme places were allocated by Labour Market regions (LMRs) and expenditure has been attributed to the electorates relevant to the region, giving regard to area of the electorate and the size and distribution of population within it. Year and participant numbers of RtW were as follows: 1999/2000 (596) 2000/2001(3,851); 2001/2002 (7,455). RtW became Transition To Work (TTW) as part of the Australians Working Together (AWT) initiatives. TTW is now one part of the AWT transitional pathway, whereas RTW was formerly a discrete programme. RtW was primarily aimed at carers who had been out of the workforce for two years or longer. Figures are based on projected expenditures. Return to Work was superseded by Transition to Work (TtW) in July 2002. To date there have been approximately 12,000 commencements in TTW. Due to a high demand for places, 2,500 additional places were approved and distributed in the first year. Transition to Work Services is a key component of the Transitional Support pathway in the Australians Working Together initiatives. The service aims to assist parents and careers, mature age people 50 and over, those who are starting work for the first time, are not currently in full-time education or training, or are returning to work after at least two or more consecutive year’s absence. Participants do not need to be in receipt of any type of income support from Centrelink to access these services. Job seekers participating in or eligible for other services such as Job Search Training, Intensive Assistance or Work for the Dole are not eligible for participation in Transition to Work. Work for the Dole Programme (WfD)* All figures derived in this spreadsheet are based on funding approved. Funding to deliver activities has been linked to electorate by the geographic location or locations where the activity occurs (as advised by the activity sponsor). Where, as a result of this process, the locations associated with an activity fall into more than one electorate, the funds and approved places associated with the activity have been divided equally among the electorates involved. Funding figures are GST inclusive. The number of approved places for which funding is available has been provided because the number of recipients by electorate is not available. Funding and expenditure are normally linked to administrative areas which are used for a number of purposes related to the operation of a program, for example, Labour Market Regional (LMR), Employment Service Area (ESA) or Area Consultative Committee (ACC) location. The borders associated with these administrative areas do not necessarily coincide with electorate boundaries. Figures are based on approved funding, not actual expenditure. Information applies to projects approved to 30 August 2003. Wfd activities are approved on a rolling monthly basis and August is the latest month’s data available when these reports were coordinated. Special Employee Entitlement Scheme for Ansett (SEESA) Recipient electorates are determined by claimants’ postcode where available. Some postcodes cover more than one electorate and in this situation some payments to recipients will be assigned arbitrarily to an electorate. This may result in a minor statistical anomaly. Funding figures are based on actual expenditure In addition: 1. Currently 105 employees with a gross total SEESA entitlement of $2,831,915.98 have postcodes that can not be identified with a specific electorate. 2. 28 employees receiving gross total entitlements of $590,964 do not have postcodes recorded in their files and therefore cannot be allocated to a specific electorate. 3. $2,928,225.84 has not been allocated to specific employees. 4. Any prior adjustments requested by the administrators during the 2003 financial year in relation to employees originally paid in the 2002 financial year have been reflected in the 2003 financial year. Additionally, any prior adjustments requested by the administrators during the 2004 financial year in relation to employees originally paid in the 2002 or 2003 financial year have been reflected in the 2004 financial year. Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws (Question No. 2450) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: Further to the answer to question No. 1596 (Hansard, 12 August 2003, page 18167), has the Australian Taxation Office received any feedback from any of the attendees at the seminars conducted to promote compliance with taxation law by members of the legal profession; if so, what are the details of that feedback and was there any negative feedback. No. Some feedback letters have been provided by the external co-ordinators of the presentations. There has been no negative feedback. Taxation: Information Sharing (Question No. 2454) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: Further to the answer to question No. 1882 (Hansard, 12 August 2003, page 18176), what is the nature of the information shared between the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission and the Insolvency and Trustee Service of Australia. The Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA) notifies the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) of new bankruptcies where the Commissioner of Taxation is a creditor. The ATO will refer information it uncovers (to both the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) and ITSA) that appears to relate to an offence against provisions for which one of the other agencies is responsible. The ATO is bound by secrecy provisions prohibiting the disclosure of taxation information, under section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and section 3C of the Taxation Administration Act 1953. There are however a number of specific exceptions which authorise the disclosure of taxation information. These include:",315,Questions On Notice
412,Mr Costello,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,320,Questions On Notice
413,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Forwarding relevant information to liquidators or trustees, provided the information is incidental to maximising the return to unsecured creditors in liquidation or bankruptcies where the Commissioner is a creditor. Caution will be exercised where it is unlikely the provision of information will enhance the prospect of a dividend, or lead to an increased dividend, to unsecured creditors. Disclosure of taxation information to ASIC is authorised in accordance with paragraph 16(4)(hca) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 for purposes of administration of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. Information is also provided to ASIC via section 3E of the Taxation Administration Act 1953. This provides for the disclosure of taxation information to authorised law enforcement agency officers (this includes ASIC) provided the Commissioner is satisfied that the information is relevant to: (a) establishing whether a serious offence has been, or is being, committed, or (b) the making or proposed or possible making, of a proceeds of crime order. A ‘serious offence’ is defined in subsection 3E(11) as “an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory that may be dealt with as an indictable offence”. Health: Cochlear Implants (Question No. 2532) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 7 October 2003: (1) On what date was the decision made that legislation could not be used to force private health insurers to fund cochlear upgrades whilst the Private Health Insurance Regulatory Review is being conducted and what were the reasons for this decision. (2) What services does his department provide to assist adult implantees who do not qualify for Australian Hearing funding to access upgrades or be guaranteed an upgrade or replacement if they ever require reimplantation. (3) Is there an appropriate forum to involve the Implant Community in giving advice to health funds. (4) Is there a practicing paediatric audiologist who (a) reports to the department and advises on the needs of children with hearing problems and (b) who advises the department on matters affecting adult implantees. (5) On what clinical grounds does his department decide that the health funds are not obliged to fund second or replacement speech processors. (6) What ‘whole of life’ plan does his department have, or is his department developing, to ensure that cochlear implantees are catered for within the Health Act. (7) When can the cochlear community expect a decision on whether or not private health insurers will continue to be required to provide cochlear upgrades. (1) The legislative basis for the payment of benefits for surgically implanted prostheses is provided by paragraph (bj) of Schedule1 to Section 73BA of the National Health Act 1953 (the Act). This paragraph relates to the level of benefit payable in respect of an episode of hospital treatment. The list of prostheses, human tissue items and other medical devices is in Schedule5 to a Ministerial Determination made on 30 June 1999. Under paragraph (bj) health funds are required to fully fund cochlear implants, as they are surgically implanted during an episode of hospital treatment. This requirement covers the implant and the initial speech processor, which is fitted shortly after the surgery. Cochlear implants and speech processors are listed on Schedule 5. However, the Private Health Insurance Medical Devices Expert Committee (PHIMDEC), the Committee which provides advice",320,Questions On Notice
414,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:on the prostheses items that should be included in Schedule 5, reviewed the listing of cochlear speech processors in December 2001. PHIMDEC recommended to the Minister that replacement speech processors should be removed from Schedule5 as they do not fall within the scope of the legislation in that they are not provided as part of an episode of hospital care. This was under consideration when a review of private health insurance regulation was announced in April 2002. No further action has been taken on the matter since that time. (2) A number of funds pay benefits for upgrade or replacement speech processors either from their hospital tables, their ancillary tables or as an ex gratia payment. These benefits are supported by the Government’s 30 per cent Private Health Insurance rebate. (3) There is no single forum through which the implant community can give advice to the health funds. However, there are a number of channels that consumers can use to make health funds aware of their concerns if their fund does not currently provide a benefit. Members can discuss and request cover from their own health fund. They are also able to lodge complaints about their dealings with health funds with the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman (PHIO). The PHIO advises the health funds of the issues raised with him, and assists consumers to understand their cover and entitlements. In addition, the implant community can discuss any concerns they may have in relation to their private health cover entitlements under Schedule5 with the Department of Health and Ageing. (4) (a) and (b) The Hearing Services Advisory Committee, which includes practising audiologists, provides advice to the Minister on hearing services for both children and adults with hearing problems. Although the focus of the Committee is primarily on the operation of the Commonwealth Hearing Services Program, the Committee can provide advice to the Minister on broader issues concerning hearing in the community. In addition, the Office of Hearing Services in the Department of Health and Ageing has a number of audiological staff who hold certificates to practise, although none of them are currently practising as paediatric audiologists. (5) Not applicable. See answer to question 1 above. (6) The Government has no ‘whole of life’ plan to ensure that cochlear implantees are catered for within the National Health Act 1953. (7) It is not possible to advise whether or when such a decision might be made. Health: Autism (Question No. 2559) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 8 October 2003: (1) What data is available on the number of children in Australia on waiting lists for an autism/autism spectrum disorders (ASD) assessment. (2) What data is available on the waiting times for children to have autism/ASD assessment. (3) In respect of Table 5.6 on page 70 of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) report The burden of disease and injury in Australia, what data was used to estimate that autism represents Australia’s fourth highest burden of disease and injury for boys aged 0 to 14 years. (4) Is the AIHW planning to review health outcomes for people with developmental delay; if so, when will the result of this review be available. (5) How much (a) in total, and (b) as a proportion of the National Health and Medical Research Council funding will be spent on research specifically related to autism/ASD in (i) 2003, and (ii) 2004. (6) How much (a) in total, and (b) as a proportion of the Australian Research Council funding will be spent on research specifically related to autism/ASD in (i) 2003, and (ii) 2004. (7) Will he identify any other funding programs or projects being conducted specifically in respect of the treatment for autism/ASD in Australia. (8) Does the Government direct or intend to direct any funding specifically to autism/ASD research in Australia. (9) How does the proportion of Government research funding spent on autism/ASD compare to the relative burden autism/ASD imposes on the Australian community. (10) Is the Government aware of any data on the financial cost to Government when people with autism are not treated appropriately. (11) What data is available on the long-term cost-benefit resulting from evidence-based treatment of children with autism (eg. as a result of the reduced need for intensive services when the child becomes an adult). (12) What data is available on the direct cost to Government of caring for Australians with a diagnosis of autism/ASD. (1) and (2) There is no national data on waiting lists of people with autistic disorder and/or Asperger’s syndrome and/or pervasive developmental disorders. (3) The estimates by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare of the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder in 1996 (AIHW : Mathers et al 1999) were based on overseas studies. By applying an average of overseas prevalence rates to the Australian population, it was estimated that the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder in 1996 was 29,730 with about 528 new cases per year. This is an incidence rate of 0.66 for 0 to 4 year old boys per 1,000 population and 0.14 per 1,000 for 0-4 year old girls. (4) These estimates will be revised in 2004, and will take into account recent Australian studies and data. (5) (a) and (b), (i) and (ii) National Health and Medical Research Council funding for research related to autism in 2003 will be $717,512. This is approximately 0.3% of the total National Health and Medical Research Council funding for new and continuing grants in 2003. In addition, the National Health and Medical Research Council will provide approximately $31 million in 2003 for funding of research projects into mental health and neurosciences, which may have the potential to benefit those suffering from a range of conditions including autism. Information relating to funding in 2004 is not yet available. (6) (a) and (b), (i) and (ii) The Australian Research Council does not fund research in the area of clinical medical research. However, in its area of responsibility the Australian Research Council has provided $241,360, between 1999-2004, for socially based autism/ASD related projects. (7) I am unaware of any other funding programs or projects being conducted specifically outside the work of the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Australian Research Council. (8) The National Health and Medical Research Council funds health and medical research across a wide range of mental health and neuroscience disciplines which may include autism. I am unable to comment on the funding arrangements of other organisations. (9) (10), (11) and (12) The comparison cannot be made because there is no national data on the diagnostic profiles of people with autism/ASD.",321,Questions On Notice

The Family Court of Australia and the Federal Magistrates Court (FMC) advise that the courts share duty solicitors in Melbourne, Dandenong and Parramatta. In addition, the Family Court of Australia has duty solicitors available in Sydney and Adelaide. The Family Court in Melbourne has a duty solicitor on site five days a week. A duty solicitor is also available two days a week for the FMC in Melbourne, as well as in most regional areas where the FMC sits. These services are provided by Victoria Legal Aid. The registry in Dandenong has a duty solicitor four days a week provided by Victoria Legal Aid. Victoria Legal Aid advises that the cost of these services, which are funded by the Commonwealth through the Legal Aid Program, is approximately $243,600 per annum. Victoria Legal Aid also provides a duty solicitor service to the Federal Court/FMC Registry in Melbourne to assist self-represented litigants in migration matters. Two legal aid solicitors are on duty on the days of migration list callovers and directions hearings (one afternoon a month). Victoria Legal Aid advises that the approximate cost of this service is $5,040. The registry in Parramatta has two duty solicitors available four days a week to assist self-represented litigants in the Family Court and the FMC. These services are provided by the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales (and funded by the Commonwealth through the Legal Aid Program). The NSW Legal Aid Commission advises that the approximate cost of the services is $67,488 per annum. In the Sydney registry, the private legal profession provides a duty solicitor service on a pro bono basis. The NSW Legal Aid Commission provides a duty solicitor in the Sydney registry once every four weeks (and advises that the approximate cost is $5,000 per annum). While the FMC does not conduct family law work in Sydney, there is a Local Court in Sydney which specialises in family law matters. The NSW Legal Aid Commission provides a duty solicitor on each of the two days each week on which Commonwealth family law matters are listed at the Court. The Commission advises that the approximate cost of this service is $35,000 per annum. A duty solicitor service staffed by a lawyer provided by the NSW Legal Aid Commission will commence by the end of the year at the Family Court/FMC in Newcastle. Duty solicitor services will be provided two days per week, increasing to three in the week the Family Court Judicial Registrar’s circuit operates at Newcastle. The Adelaide registry has a scheme arranged by the Family Law Society under which duty solicitors attend the court on Monday and Friday mornings. The Rules of the Federal Court (Order 80) provide for court-appointed referral for legal assistance. Under Order 80, the Court or a Judge may, if it is in the interests of the administration of justice, refer a litigant to the Registrar for referral to a legal practitioner on a Pro Bono Panel for legal assistance. The Pro Bono Panel, which is maintained by the Registrar, is a list of legal practitioners in the State or Territory where the relevant District Registry is located who have agreed to participate in the scheme. The FMC also has a pro bono scheme limited to general federal law matters which is modelled on the scheme established by the Federal Court. Assistance is also available to self-represented applicants in applications to the Federal Court or the FMC for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal, through a migration assistance program",323,Questions On Notice
416,Mr Mcclelland Asked The Attorney,"General, upon notice, on 9 October 2003:",324,Questions On Notice
417,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:currently operating in New South Wales and recently established in Western Australia. The NSW scheme began in July 2000 as a pilot program. The scheme utilises a panel of solicitors and barristers nominated by the NSW Law Society and NSW Bar Association who have specialist knowledge and experience in migration law. The migration assistance schemes give self-represented applicants in migration matters an opportunity to receive independent legal advice on their prospects of success and assistance in drafting applications. The schemes are funded year to year by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA). The amount paid per application is $737 (standard consultation) or $929.50 where a client is in detention. An administrative fee of $55 is also paid to the Law Society or Bar Association for costs associated with operating the panel and referring matters. In the 2002-2003 financial year, DIMIA spent approximately $190,000 on the NSW scheme. The Registrar of the High Court sometimes arranges for pro bono legal advice or representation for selfrepresented litigants from members of the Bar. The federal tribunals within my portfolio responsibilities, namely the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), the Copyright Tribunal, the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Tribunal, the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal and the National Native Title Tribunal, do not operate duty solicitor schemes. However, I am advised by the AAT that it plans to trial a duty solicitor service in Sydney in 2004. A lawyer from the NSW Legal Aid Commission is expected to attend the AAT one half day each week to provide legal advice and assistance to unrepresented parties in social security, immigration and citizenship matters. The AAT is investigating the possibility of similar trials in Brisbane and Melbourne. The duty lawyer service will complement the AAT’s existing procedures for assisting unrepresented parties. On receiving an application from an unrepresented person, the AAT usually sends the person information pamphlets explaining the review process together with a list of legal aid offices, community legal centres or other organisations that may be able to assist the person. The AAT subsequently contacts unrepresented parties by telephone to provide information on the AAT’s procedures, organisations that may be able to provide legal or other assistance and to discuss any special needs an unrepresented party may have. The AAT occasionally makes appointments for unrepresented parties with a legal aid office or community legal centre. Under the Native Title Act 1993 (s 78), the Native Title Registrar may give such assistance as he or she considers reasonable to help people prepare applications and to help people at any stage of a proceeding in matters related to the proceeding. I am advised by the National Native Title Tribunal that the assistance provided does not extend to the provision of legal advice or representation for persons before the Tribunal or the Federal Court. I am further advised that native title applicants are generally represented by native title bodies which are funded to perform that work through Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services. As regards the Copyright Tribunal, Defence Force Discipline Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal, the Federal Court Registry will, where appropriate, provide advice and assistance on procedural issues, such as referring litigants to the relevant rules and forms and assisting them to understand procedural requirements. Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (Question No. 2581) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 9 October 2003: (1) Has the Minister seen a report by Sue Dunlevy titled “US may force up prescription drug prices” in The Daily Telegraph on 22 September 2003. (2) Can the Minister confirm whether US free trade negotiators have asked Australian officials for information on how Australian patent and intellectual property rules affect US pharmaceutical companies; if not, why not. (3) Can the Minister confirm whether US negotiators or US pharmaceutical companies are targeting the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) price control mechanisms as part their Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) negotiations; if not, why not. (4) Will the proposed AUSFTA threaten the PBS; if so, how; if not, why not. (5) Can the Minister guarantee that the PBS will be exempted from any further AUSFTA negotiations; if not, why not. (6) Can the Minister guarantee that any final AUSFTA will not undermine the PBS and lead to increases in the price of essential medicines; if so, how; if not, why not. (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) US negotiators have indicated an interest in the transparency of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme processes, but, thus far, they have not presented any proposals to Australian negotiators. (4) No. The Australian Government has confirmed that there is nothing in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations that will limit the ability of the Government to provide affordable medicines to Australians through a sustainable Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. (5) The Government is committed to ensuring that outcomes from the FTA do not impair Australia’s ability to meet fundamental policy objectives in health care. However, for negotiations to be constructive, each party must be allowed to explain its point of view on matters that it considers relevant. (6) The Australian Government has confirmed that there is nothing in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations that will limit the ability of the Government to provide affordable medicines to Australians through a sustainable Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Insurance: Medical Indemnity (Question No. 2589) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 13 October 2003: (1) Can he confirm that he received a letter dated 1 October 2003 from a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon at Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick, saying, that as a direct result of the Federal Government’s levy to cover incurred by not reported claims, five of his colleagues are resigning from the hospital and he will be the only remaining orthopaedic surgeon. (2) What is he doing to ensure that this surgeon and his colleagues do not resign from the Sydney Children’s Hospital on 1 January 2004. (1) I can confirm that I have received this letter. (2) On3 October 2003, after productive discussions with the AMA, I announced that the Government would undertake a policy review process to consider medical indemnity insurance issues in order to ensure a sustainable and affordable medical indemnity insurance system and to ensure that doctors, like the orthopaedic surgeons mentioned in the letter, do not resign from their posts but rather continue to provide their invaluable services to the community. In the meantime, the Government has put in place an 18-month moratorium on IBNR contribution payments limiting contributions during that period to $1,000 per annum. Further exemptions have",324,Questions On Notice

Current IBNR contribution notices will be withdrawn and existing payments refunded, pending the outcome of the policy review process. The policy review process will focus on the need to ensure that doctors can continue to treat their patients with certainty and confidence, and that the medical indemnity arrangements which underpin this confidence provide secure and affordable long-term protection for all patients and doctors. The policy review panel, which comprises members of the medical profession and Government, as well as a lawyer experienced in insurance issues and a financial expert, will report to the Prime Minister on 10 December 2003. United Nations: Trafficking Protocol (Question Nos 2596 and 2597) Mr Kerr asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 13 October 2003: (1) When and where was the UN Protocol to Prevent Suppression and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children opened for signature.

Attorney-General’s: Court and Tribunal Representation (Question No. 2610) (1) Is he or his department aware of any research, reports or submissions which address the relationship between legal aid policies and levels of self-representation before courts and tribunals; if so, what are the details. (2) What steps is he taking to address the number of Australians going before courts and tribunals without legal representation. (1) The Attorney-General’s Department is aware that there is a range of reports and submissions that make reference to this issue, including a number of submissions to the current Senate Inquiry into Legal Aid and Access to Justice. It would not be practical for my Department to provide details of all such material to which it has had access.

422,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) The Government is aware that there are increasing numbers of self-represented litigants appearing in the High Court, Federal Court, Family Court and Federal Magistrates Court and that all courts are giving close consideration to how to provide more effective assistance to these litigants. The Government will continue to work with the courts on this issue. The Government has provided funding across the broad network of dispute resolution services. These include primary dispute resolution services, community legal services, clinical legal education programs and Australian Law Online. A Project Team within the Attorney-General’s Department is developing a strategy paper on the future of the federal civil justice system. The Team will examine the issue of increasing numbers of self-represented litigants and the consequences for federal courts, amongst other things. A list of initiatives from bodies within the Attorney-General’s portfolio to assist self-represented litigants is below: the Family Court project, ‘Self-represented Litigants – a Challenge’, launched on 5 December 2000, which is aimed at developing a coordinated national approach to service delivery for self-represented litigants the Family Law Council’s report, Litigants in Person (August 2000), which examined the effects of self-representation on the way in which a case was conducted the Family Court Future Directions Committee’s report (July 2000) on problems confronting self-represented litigants, which lists recommendations for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of court services the Federal Court’s Self Represented Litigants Management Plan, adopted in August 2002 to better meet the needs of Federal Court Self Represented Litigants, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Outreach Program, which provides information about the Tribunal’s practices and processes to people who are unrepresented, and the Federal Magistrate Court’s project ‘A day in the life of a self-represented litigant’, which is designed to give the court a better understanding of the needs of self-represented litigants and assist it to address those needs. The Family Law Assistance Program funded through the Community Legal Services Program assists people who would otherwise be unrepresented before the Family Court of Australia Dandenong Registry. This service is run by Monash University and Monash-Oakleigh Legal Service with assistance from the Victorian Court Network. The Caxton Community Legal Service in Queensland receives funding to operate a specialist Family Law clinic in partnership with Griffith University School of Law which provides advice and support for litigants in person. The NSW Court Support Scheme which is also funded through the Commonwealth Community Legal Services Program provides court users with information on court procedure, sources of legal assistance and general information, support and referral to individuals affected by the judicial system. The Government funds a wide range of family support services under the Family Relationships Services Program to help families stay together and, where they do separate, to assist separating families to resolve family law disputes in a non-adversarial way outside the courts where possible. Under this program the Attorney-General’s Department funds community based services which provide family relationship counselling, family mediation, conciliation, primary dispute resolution services in regional areas and children’s contact services. The 2003-04 appropriation to the Attorney-General for the Family Relationships Services Program is $29.7m. Health: Autism (Question No. 2657) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 16 October 2003: (1) How many people in Australia were, and what proportion per 100,000 of population was, diagnosed each year for the last ten years with (a) Autism, (b) Asperger’s Syndrome, and (c) Pervasive developmental disorders or autism spectrum disorders and related disorders. (2) What are the comparable international rates of diagnosis (either an international average or figures for comparable nations). (3) Is the Government aware of (a) the availability of diagnostic services for autism and related disorders in each State and Territory, and (b) any waiting lists for diagnostic services; if so, how long are the waiting lists. (4) Does the Government have any evidence indicating that Australian children are being diagnosed incorrectly with autism; if so, (a) to what extent, and (b) by whom. (5) Does the Government have any evidence indicating that Australian children are being diagnosed incorrectly with Asperger’s syndrome; if so, (a) to what extent, and (b) by whom. (6) Is he aware of the value of intensive behavioural programs in reducing the requirements of children with autism for special education and other costly interventions (Medical Journal of Australia 2003; 178 (9): 424-425) and does the Government provide any policy, coordinating or monitoring role in relation to these services. (7) In respect of these programs in each State and Territory, does the Government collect any information on the (a) availability in each State and Territory, (b) funding, (c) level of intensity, (d) evidence of effectiveness, (e) specialist supervision by State and Territory governments of service delivery, (f) number and proportion of children with autism accessing an intensive behavioural program, and (g) parental involvement; if so, can this information be provided for the most recent year available. (8) Does the Government have any information on comparative health outcomes for Australians with developmental disabilities; if so, can this information be provided for the most recent year available. (9) Does the Government have any specific plans to further investigate, review or improve the health outcomes of Australians with intellectual and developmental disabilities; if so, what are the details. (1) (a), (b) and (c) and (2) There are no Australian or internationally agreed figures for people with autistic disorder, Asperger’s Syndrome, pervasive developmental disorders or autism spectrum and related disorders. (3) (a) and (b) The Australian Government does not provide services in relation to the diagnosis of children with autism and related disorders or Asperger’s Syndrome. This is a state and territory responsibility and the provision of treatment is the responsibility of the treating clinician. The Australian Government does not collect data on availability of services or on waiting lists. (4) and (5), (a) and (b) It is well recognised clinically that autism and Asperger’s Syndrome can be very difficult to diagnose with the spectrum of Pervasive Developmental Disorders. There is no information of which I am aware that has formally assessed the accuracy of diagnosis in Australia. (6) There is increasing evidence that behavioural intervention may improve cognitive, communication, adaptive and social skills in young children with autism. However this is by no means accepted in mainstream approaches to clinical care.",330,Questions On Notice
423,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The Australian Government does not provide any policy, coordinating or monitoring role in relation to these services. (7) (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) As stated in Questions 1 and 2 above, there are no national data on the diagnostic profiles of people with autistic disorder, Asperger’s Syndrome, pervasive developmental disorders or autism spectrum and related disorders. (8) The AIHW in its 2003 publication, “Disability support services 2002 – National data on services provided under the Commonwealth/State Disability Agreement”, includes data on service consumers with autism reported as the primary condition. There were 2,500 service consumers recorded with autism as the primary condition on the snapshot data collection day (3.8% of consumers), and 73% were aged under 25 years. Only 301 (12%) were accessing employment services, and of the 1,276 consumers aged 16 years or more only 42 (3%) reported paid employment as their main income source. Some 89% reported the Disability Support Pension as the main income source. (9) There is no specific review underway. The National Health and Medical Research Council will provide approximately $31 million in 2003 for funding research projects into mental health and neurosciences, which may have the potential to benefit those suffering from a range of intellectual and developmental disabilities. Hospitals: Patient Treatment (Question No. 2666) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 23 October 2003: (1) In respect of the statements made by Mr Jon Evans, Acting CEO of Western Health, at the Melton Health and Aged Care Forum, held at Melton Community Hall on the 3 October 2003 regarding a hospital services report by the Victorian Department of Human Services, can he confirm that the number of patients treated by the Sunshine Hospital Emergency Department increased by 5.1% from March to June 2003. (2) Can he confirm that the number of patients treated by the Western Hospital Emergency Department increased by 4.3% from 2002 to 2003. (3) Can he confirm that 10% more people attended Western Health Emergency Departments than in the previous year. (4) Can he confirm that 70% of this increase in Emergency Department presentations was in Triage categories 4 and 5. (5) Is he aware that, according to Western Health, patients are increasingly presenting at emergency departments with minor illnesses because of the shortage of GPs in the West, and because of the lack of bulk-billing doctors. (1) (2) and (3) The Australian Government does not currently collect this information. The Victorian Department of Human Services publishes quarterly the Hospital Services Report. Data from the Hospital Services Report June quarter 2003 is consistent with the data provided in the questions. The Department has no means of confirming this data. (4) This data is not reported in the Hospital Services Report June quarter 2003. (5) While the issues of bulk billing and doctor availability vary from region to region it should be noted that for the area of Melton, where the Melton Health and Aged Care forum took place, the bulk billing rate actually increased between the March and June quarters 2003 (to 58%).",332,Questions On Notice
424,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:This data also shows that there are a number of doctors in this area who bulk bill all (100%) of their patients. Almost a third of services provided in this region were provided by these doctors. In fact, the doctors bulk billing less than 20% of the services only provided 3% of all GP services in Melton in the June quarter 2003.

(2) Diplomats generally perform a range of diplomatic, consular and administrative functions. (3) The Government has not been negotiating the issue of live sheep exports with officials of the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Canberra. (4) The Australian Government has called in the Saudi Chargé d’Affaires to express its concern with the Saudi decision. The Chargé advised that he had not received any advice from Riyadh on the Cormo Express rejection. Health: Logan West Area (Question No. 2704) Dr Emerson asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 4 November 2003: (1) Is Browns Plains, in the Logan West area of Queensland, classified as an outer metropolitan area for the purposes of the Government’s Outer Metropolitan workforce incentive programs; if not, why not; (2) If Browns Plains is classified as an outer metropolitan area for the purposes of the Government’s Outer Metropolitan workforce incentive programs, is it also classified as (a) a District of Workforce Shortage, and (b) an Area of Consideration; if not, why not. (3) When did the Department last assess Browns Plains’ eligibility for (a) Outer Metropolitan, (b) District of Workforce Shortage, and (c) Area of Consideration status.
