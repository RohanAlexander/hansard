It is an allowance paid to the man during the period in which the Department is training him to become a skilled workman. 3. Under the War Service Homes Act a definite obligation is placed on the Commissioner that assistance is not to be made available to any applicant unless the Commissioner is satisfied that that person is in a position to meet the necessary repayments. The assumption that this applies to vocational trainees only is incorrect, as any applicant would have to satisfy the Commissioner on this point before his application could be proceeded with. BILL.

As to that, however, I have my doubts. Our experience of Territories has not been very happy. In 1905 we accepted the Territory of Papua, and I remember the late Hon. Alfred Deakin standing in this House, and painting a rosy picture of it, just as rosy as that which the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) painted yesterday of German New Guinea. But our experience has not been up to the standard of the picture painted. years it has always been a case of "" it will be,"" but so far anticipations have not been realized. been spent in development. country fifteen years is not a long period the Commonwealth, by the name of the Territo spend in development, but let us go a little further, and analyze our experience I do'not think we'would be entitled to of the Northern Territory, which we took over from South Australia in 1910. out our contract with South Australia, and built the north-south railway. member imagine that the building of that rai-way would have brought prosperity to the Northern Territory? member realizes that the Territory has already cost the Commonwealth enough. However, I admit that with all the experience we have had of the Northern Teranan New Guinea, where the planters ritory and its mismanagement, we would probably do as we did in 1910 if we were asked again to accept the responsibility of administering it. No single State ought to be asked to bear the burden of either the Northern Territory or Papua. It is far better that the"" Commonwealth should control the latter Territory than Queensland, which for some years administered it. But we have not been too successful in administering our Territories. contend that we are more likely to achieve success when administering German New Guinea and the Pacific Islands under the terms of a mandate, especially with all the problems which will confront us in them ? I do not think we will. But I admit that we must administer them. We read nearly every day in the newspapers that the Japanese are extending their control as far south as the Marshall and Caroline Islands, over which they have a mandate, and every honourable member agrees that as soon as practicable the military administration of German New Guinea should be replaced by civil government. I do not want to have military administration retained in any part of the Commonwealth or its Territories a moment longer than is necessary. We ought to set out specifically our ideals in regard to these Territories. The Papua Act of 1905 went a good deal further than the Bill before us proposes to go. Section5 of that Act saysThe possession of British New Guinea is hereby declared to be accepted by the Commonwealth as a Territory under the authority of tory of Papua. insert a similar provision in this Bill until the actual terms of the mandate are known to us. So to speak, we are now legislating in the dark in regard to these Territories. Section 29 of the Papua Act provides definitely for the establishment of a Legislative Council. This provision was inserted for the purpose of allowing the inhabitants of the Territory to govern themselves. We have had outcries in Australia from districts which are represented in this Parliament that they cannot he effectively governed from Melbourne. Surely such an outcry would come wibh much greater force from Gerand other settlers will have to face problems differing widely from those to which we are accustomed on the mainland. Nevertheless we ought to take more direct .parliamentary control than is proposed in the Bill, if the terms of the mandate will permit it.

21,Mr Tudor,"Surely the honorableOrdinance within six months of the Lieutenant-Governor's assent to it . The most important provision in the Act, however, is sub-section 10 of section 41, which prevents the Lieutenant-Governorf r o m giving assent to any Ordinance relating to the introduction or immigration of aboriginal natives of Australia, Asia, Africa, or any island of the Pacific, and reserves such measures for the assent of the Governor General. In other words, it protects our White Australia policy. No provision of this character is contained in the New GuineaB ill . There is nothing in it to prevent the White Australia policy being absolutely abrogated in these mandated Territories. Of course, nativeborn Pacific Islanders will be entitled to return to their own islands, and also the natives of German New Guinea will be protected, but there is nothing in the B ill to prevent any aboriginal natives of Asia or A f r i ca froan entering the Territory, and we must be on guard to see that we have complete control over this Territory in this regard just as we have over the contiguous Territory of Papua. overrun by persons who are restricted from entering the Commonwealth or Papua. The provision, therefore, which we saw f it to insert in the Papua Act 1905 ought to apply equally to this measure before us to-day. Clause 13 of the B ill before us nrovidesExcept as provided in this or any Act, the Acts of Parliament of the Commonwealth shall not be in force in the Territory unless expressed to extend thereto or unless applied to the Territory by ordinance made by the Governor General under this Act. In my opinion the principle adopted is altogether wrong. We ought to provide that the Commonwealth Acts shall atmly to the Territories unless specifically exempted by this Parliament. In the case of the Northern Territory, the Act of 1910 sets out what Acts are to apply to that Territory. I now move That all the words after "" now "" be left out, with a view, to insert in lieu thereof the followTerritory except for essential public works ing words:-''withdrawn introduced after re-drafting so as to provide for complete government by the Australian Parliament of the Territories and Islands of the Pacific under the terms of the mandate, and to provide that the laws of the Commonwealth shall apply thereto unless specifically exempted by the Parliament."" Mr Tudor. orable member mean by "" complete government"" ? have complete control and the Territory should not be administered merely by regulation or by act of the Executive Council. It is very important that this Parliament should know howthese Territories are bein? governed. We specifically enacted that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. the Secret Commissions Act , the Land Acquisition Act, and the Australian Industries Preservation Act should apply to the Northern Territory and Papua. All of our laws should apply to the mandated territories, unless they are specifically exempted. Of course, there are certain Acts which cannot be applied to them, but the decision on this matter should be made by Parliament. ber should state which of our laws should apply in New Guinea. striction Act should apply to New Guinea just 'as .it applies to Papua. The line of Otherwise the latter may be demarcation between Papua and New Guinea is nothing more than the border dividing any two Australian States. Yet on one side of that imaginary line the White Australia policy is to apply, but on the other side, in the territorv covered by the mandate, it may not apply. Of course, unti l we see the terms of the mandates, setting forth the conditions upon which we are to govern these Territories, we shall be legislating, to a certain extent, in the dark. However, the White Australia policy is one of the principles that should apply to -German New Guinea. Not even the most rabid "" White Australian "" has ever advocated that the aboriginal natives of the country should not be allowed to work; but we do object to the native labour being exploited. I may be told that, there is a provision in the B ill which will prevent exploitation. The only portion which bears upon that point is sub-clause 2 of clause 15No forced labour shall be permitted in the and immediately reand services, and then only for adequate remuneration.

Parliament should have control over the acts of all Governments. control under clause 14. vides that u n t i l Parliament makes other provision for ithe government of the Territory the Governor General may make Ordinances having the force of law, and that every such Ordinance shall be notified in the Gazette, and be laid before both Houses of the Parliament within fourteen days of the making thereof, or, if the Parliament is not then sitting, within New Guinea and Papua. fourteen days after the next meeting of the Parliament. (3) If either House of the Parliament passes power to say that our legislation shall a resolution, of which notice has been given at any time within fifteen sitting days after any such Ordinance bas been laid before the House disallowing the Ordinance, the Ordinance shall thereupon cease to have effect. How manv honourable members have read the Gazette during the last twelve months? I do not think I have read a copy for six months. A few days ago I received a bundle of about t h i r t y regulations, made under different Statutes; honourable members have received about forty of these regulations within the last fortnight. for Herbert( Mr Bamford) gave notice of a motion to disallow a certain regulation, but the House never had an opportunity of discussing it . . During the 191719 Parliament several honourable members tabled motions for the disallowance of regulations, but the notices were ignored. They were included in private members' business, placed at the bottom of the notice-oaoer, and lapsed at bhe end of the session. So this power to disallow all Ordinances made under this B ill w ill not give Parliament any effective control. member means is that the minority in the House has no control. But the House itself has control. drawn from the Treasurer's remark is that minorities have no rights. I dissent from that view. It will be a wise precaution if this Parliament insists upon having complete control of all things done in connection with these mandated terriSix tories. If there is any part of the Commonwealth where trouble and difficulties are likely to arise it is in the NorthEast. orable member think that Parliament has any control over the present Government? the House nearly had control on Friday. No doubt the Government, like most Governments, think they are in oflice for ever; but the Opposition has always a chance of unseating them. Regardless, however, of what Government may be in power, I desire Parliament to have control , and to declare that the White Australia policy shall apply both north and south of the imaginary line which divides It should be the Parliament which should have the or shall not be made applicable to the Northern Territory, or to these new Territories. We sliould not provide in our legislation that none of the Commonwealth laws shall apply to any particular territory if the Government think otherwise. There are other phases of the B ill which are important. The PrimeM in ister remarked yesterday that he did not accept the opinions of the members of the Royal Commission to the effect that the In 1913 the honourable member area of cultivable land was limited, and he ventured to say that two of the Commissioners had not gone very far, and, consequently, had not seen very much. The Commissioners, namely, Messrs Murray, Atlee Hunt, and Lucas, statedI t is important to remember that the area of cultivable lands in these, as in other tropical volcanic countries, cannot be gauged from the total areas mentioned, as, owing to the fact that so much of thc country is mountainous and so much swampy or inaccessible, or of poor quality, the extent of land available for settlement is comparatively limited. It has, moreover, always been a principle of both German and British Administrations that alienations should not be permitted where the land in question was required by the natives for purposes of food supply. As the natives depend almost entirely on the products of their gardens and",22,Hughes

62,Mr Fenton,"Then Ministerialfortunate than are members of tbe Opposition. The Peace Conference laid down a Labour charter for the world. Surely we are going to pay some regard to that charter, to which our representatives affixed their signatures. We must take care that this Sill, which provides for a civil administration for New Guinea, contains no provision likely to cause alarm to the League of Nations. There must not be even'a suggestion that this Parliament will tolerate forced labour among the natives. So far as the Australian aborigines are concerned, the legislation of the States has always been in the direction of ameliorating their condition, of caring for them, asking that this be done? and not forcing them in any way to work. In the case of New Guinea, if we are not careful, we may have a repetition of what occurred in the early .convict days of some of the States. We may have slave-drivers at work in this new Territory. I ask the Treasurer to give the House an assurance that New Guinea will not be governed by means of regulations or Ordinances, and that there shall be a direct command from this Hoiise to the civil administration that no act calculated to bring this country into disrepute shall be permitted. The position taken up by the Opposition is that the Parliament itself should be responsible for the proper government of the Territory. That is all that the Leader of the Opposition asks, and the only reply he receives from the Treasurer is a stentorian "" No ."" a loud "" Yes.""

L e t us adopt a new policy; let us lay down f i rm principles as a basis for the administration of this Territory. It is more important that we should do so in this case that in regard to legislation applying to the mainland, because the eyes of the nations of the world are upon Australia to see what we w ill do, and what k in d of pace we shall set for other countries. Because, let us once decline from our true principles in the administration of the Territory, .there is one other country which w ill take immediate advantage of any lapse on our part,, and in connection w it h islands which lie to the north of the Equator, do something h u r t f u l to the Australian people.

If we do this, we shall. have nothing to be ashamed of in regard tp the administration of these islands. shall vote against the amendment. objections urged by the Leader of the Opposition, and others, against the B ill are entirely without foundation. fear of honourable members who have spoken seems to me to be that, by this B ill , the Commonwealth Parliament is giving up its control of matters in New Guinea and delegating its authority; but this measure, as applying to the government of that Territory, is purely a tentative one. Eor instance, in clause 14, dealing w it h the Ordinances, which are to apply, we find theee words, "" Until the' Parliament makes other provision for the government Obviously, the intention of the B ill is t h a t it is to be regarded as purely tentative. tentative owing to the fact that the mandate has not yet come to hand. Sir member is overlooking succeeding words in clause 14, which show that we are not delegating our authority. accurate in using the words ""delegating authority."" In fact, I intended to point that out. There are two safeguards in the B ill which are quite complete. The first safeguard is that Parliament retains f u l l control over tha laws that are to operate in the Territory In establishing civil government there we first send up an Administrator and his staff. Their first duty w i ll be to ascertain exactly whab are the conditions obtaining there. Having done that, they w ill frame Ordinances and submit them to us for our approval. Ordinances are made by the GovernarGenoral. tained the conditions obtaining in the Territory, the Governor General w ill make Ordinances and submit them to Parliament for approval. Mr MA X.WELL -^Oku30 14 .provides TEvery such Ordinance shall be h i d before both Houses of the Parliament within fourteen days of the making thereof, or if the Parliament is not then sitting, within fourteen daysafter the next meeting of the Parliament. If either House of the Parliament passes a resoI lution, of which notice has been given, at any The time within fifteen sitting days' after any such Ordinance has been laid ibefore the House disallowing the Ordinance, the Ordinance shall thereupon cease to 'have effect. TheI t is a case of the application of the adage, "" Silence gives consent."" If we say nothing after an Ordinance has been submitted for our approval, it remains the law of the Territory. If we object to it , Parliament w ill disallow it . Prom my point of view, that is quite a sufficient safeguard; but there is still another safeguard, which, I think, should meet the fear which the honourable member for Maribyrnon g ( Mr Penton) has exof the Territory."" pressed, namely, that we may appoint an Administrator who w ill treat the natives in such a way as to b r in g ourselves into discredit w it h other nations, and possibly it is necessarily w it h tlie League of Nations.

I have -met many traders from Papua'and. the South Sea Islands, and the only complaint I have heard has been that the Australian and British Governments are treating the natives too well, and will not allow traders and others to exploit them without let or hindrance. In -regard to the question of forced labour, the people of the Commonwealth have to pay taxes in order to meet the cost of constructing roads and providing transport to carry out the ordinary functions of government In Papua, there is no money amongst the population, and it is necessary that the operations of government, which are to improve the country for the betterment of the natives themselves, should be contributed to by them. There is no way in which that can be done except by a contribution of labour, which cannot' be designated as slavery, because in every case some payment is made. The payment may not be much according to our money values, but it may bo considerable in the eyes of the natives, and it is a remarkable fact that many natives who have been indentured in Papua have returned and asked for a further -period of indenture. I think these facte dispose of the contention that forced labour can be and should be dispensed with.

Sooner or later this Parliament will have to consider the general administration of our Territories.

100,Mr Bkennan,"we conscript the infants for the defence of the country under the pleasant title of "" compulsory training."" I am certainly opposed to the conscription of coloured races for the defence of any territory under the control of Australia, and therefore, whilst I am against this Bill generally and all that it ' stands for, yet, as it must become law, I have some hope that it will not be disfigured by this objectionable provision. I hope that when the Government introduce a Bill in which they promise th;it forced labour shall not be carried onunder which slavery shall cease to exist -the y will give more tangible evidence of their sincerity than is contained in this measure, seeing that it provides that forced labour may be permitted for the carrying on of essential public services at an "" adequate remuneration."" I emphasize that clause 15 actually invites the application of the policy of enforced labour to 'these Territories, and imposes slavery in the very clause that prohibits it . To sum up: It is unfortunate that honourable members should be called upon even to consider and discuss such a Bill as this. I am against the ambitious spirit of useless Imperialism which seeks to add to our responsibilities. I am against a policy which makes the acquisition of Territories a breach of that faith which was crystallized in the immortal fourteen points of President ""Wilson. ' AndI am especially against certain clauses of this Bill which seek to make slavery possible and probable, and which would make the conscription of the natives of these Territories likely in the interests of defence, if and Australia, I thought that that would war or local disturbances of the kind in contemplation should ever take place. Unless the clause to which the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has just taken emphatic exception is deleted, I shall have no hesitation in opposing the Bill, or in saying that the measure is one for the institution of slavery by camouflage. We have had some experience of slavery in this country: I allude to the Kanaka blot, which once defiled the fair face of Queensland. There has been another historic instance, namely, in Western Australia. When the Imperial Government removed permission to the Western Australian authorities to lash the aborigines of that colony, the first Administration of Western Australia reenacted the Ordinance. I recall that the then Attorney-General of Western Australia, Septimus Burt, gave expression to the incomprehensible opinion that "" these poor aborigines actually liked the lash."" AndI remarked, during the lifetime of that gentleman, lhat I would havo liked to try the lash on him, and to ask him if he liked it. However, as all honourable members know, while that blot was reinstated, the Queensland blot was removed. I believe that I was the only member of Parliament who saw the Kanakas being taken back to their homes in the New Hebrides. Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company did every whit of their duty by those natives and by the Gommonwealth Government, and they certainly left no scope for criticism in anything that I saw. An example may be cited concerning the company's thoroughness in repatriating the Kanakas. As our vessel was travelling from island to island, disembarking little groups of natives here and there, the weather was such as to preclude the landing of one Kanaka at his own home beach. Although the captain af the ship could have landed him at a -spot 1 mile from his village, the native objected. He said, "" No, if you land me there, I will be made ' Ka Ka.' "" So, three times that ship, in the course of its journeying? fi-om island to island, returned to put that individual native ashore on the exact spot where he desired to land; and only on the third attempt did the representative of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company succeed. When we wiped out the infamy which disgraced Queensland be the end of slavery; but I look now with great trepidation to the operation of this objectionable clause The coloured races everywhere have been utilized with a desire to secure cheap labour. Years ago I visited Queensley-afterward s Senator. Findley-and we had a long conversation with a gentleman who was connected with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. After talking to us for more than an hour he remarked that he considered that he had proved to me that the employment of Kanakas was not cheaper than the utilization of white",32,Joseph Cook Th E Honourable Report To The Council Of The League Of Nations
101,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [4.8],,33,Joseph Cook Th E Honourable Report To The Council Of The League Of Nations
102,Land In Company With Mr Find,"men; and that the Kanakas cost as much, while white men could not do the work. He was rather startled when I remarked, "" I will go on every platform in Queensland and advocate the retention of the Kanakas, rather than their removal, if you will undertake to do one thing by your native labour."" He said, "" W h a t is that?"" I replied, ""Give them an eight hours day, and pay them a white man's wages."" That ended the discussion. In conversation with a man in the Bundaberg district, I asked him whether he would give up sugar growing if he were precluded from employing Kanaka labour. He said, "" No blanky fear""; and he continued, "" But I have no false opinions about the value of the Kanaka. You see that youngster over there ""-pointin g to a fine stripling of an Australian youth, who appeared to be about nineteen years of age, but was only fifteen-"" I will back that boy for any wager against any Kanaka in Queensland, to cut cane, to strip it , to load it, there in consideration'of a large income, and to carry it. But you. cannot blame me for preferring to employ Kanaka labour when I can get a full grown man for 5s. a -week and less, who will do a good deal of work for me, although not as much as a white man would do."" We know that the ereatest output of sugar from Queensland has been during those years since the repatriation of Kanakas, when white men have performed the labour on the sugar cane plantations. If this objectionable clause remains, I shall insist that it is nothing but an effort to reinstitute slavedom by camouflage. What is forced labour other than slavery? Honourable members know that nearly the whole of Europe, 120 years ago, was in a state of serfdom. German peasant could not move away from his home without Nearly the whole of Denmark was owned by about 100 landlords. We know of the condition of the Russian serfs. There is little good that I can say of the rule of the Czars. Yet it is to their credit that they freed more than 11,000,000 slaves from the grip of the nobles, and paid them Â£300,000,000. In those days the serfs were able to save a little; but, with respect to those who had nothing, it was provided that they could claim 10 acres from any noble in Russia without payment of one penny. Even although I can Dr. Maloney. only speak of the rule of the Czars with anger, and, indeed} with horror, yet their emancipation of the Russian serfs compares wonderfully well with the freeing, of the 4,000,000 slaves in the United States of America. The removal of the shackles in .Russia stands out as something higher and greater than was the awful civil war in America, which entailed the killing and wounding of close upon 1,000,000 men. Not one Russian life was involved in the freeing of the serfs. I can imagine how Wilberforce would have spoken in the House of Commons had an Imperial Government dared to introduce into any piece of legislation such a clause as that which blots the Bill now before the House. In the course of the debate allusior? has been made to the Northern Territory. That portion of Australia has never had a chance. A designing man was sent together with a very large amount for allowance. But what did that parasite do ? He came down and remained in this part of Australia for more than eight months, drawing the while two guineas a day extra expenses, because, forsooth, he had condescended to leave his post in the Territory! How could any man hope to make the Territory pay while he -stayed here, drawing his fat income and additional expenses daily? This individual was a doctor of veterinary science, holding the highest possible diploma in that branch of scientific attainment. But in mental ability he was a child in comparison with that other doctora doctor of science-whos e name has also been linked with the recent history of the TerThe ritory. I refer to Dr. Jensen. It was not until I made a considerable disturbpermission. ance that the doctor of veterinary science was sent back to his job. I remember once telling my beloved friend-althoug h my political opponentMr Glynn, that the Northern Territory was rotten through and through. And now we have had this business in which Judge Bevan has been involved-Judg e Bevan, whom I would not permit to try a Newfoundland dog of mine. He is down here, drawing good money, when he ought to be sacked. The whole gang ought to be sacked, and would be if they were working men. It was decided to send a magistrate to the Northern Territory to camouflage the deeds of these men, and to whitewash them; but when a man of the calibre of Mr Justice Ewing was appointed I knew full well that there would be no camouflage work. I said to Mr Justice Ewing, in fact, "" They expect you to camouflage the Territory."" However, I knew this man as I had known his brother when he was a member of the Federal Parliament, and I knew that he could be trusted. Still, some of the members of this gang are drawing their money down here, and I ask that the same justice be meted out to them as to any ordinary individual. The defence of this country depends upon our preparations beneath the surface of the sea, and in the air. The day of the super-Dreadnought has passed. admirals of the recent past, namely, Admiral Sir Percy Scott and Admiral Lord Fisher, have made known that fact in no uncertain fashion. Any honourable member who cares to read Lord Fisher's memoirs must come to the same overwhelming conclusion. In my view, the great battleship has aj)peared, for many a day past, to be ahout as helpless as the armoured men of the middle ages, when, if one of these doughty individuals tumbled off his horse, two or three other men were required to l if t him back into the saddle again. We know that in the days of old, on the plains of France, the men in armour sat on their horses all night long, and. when the grey dawn arrived, they could not lift their feet out of the mud. Then the English archers, with no armour, and no arms except the bow and arrow, but quick to move, attack, or retreat if need be, shot them down in their uselessness. As the Brennan) truly said, population is our greatest defence: but, as a matter of fact, the Australian baby is regarded as almost a prohibited immigrant. Landlords and landladies, who go to church on Sunday and mouth their false-hearted prayers, always ask a prospective tenant if there are any children, and, if there are, they refuse to let their houses. agents, too, have to carry out the behests of these parasites. I have always been agaiust landlordism, and I am stronger against it to-day than I was thirty years ago when I first entered politics. In this connection I have always tried to set an example. At one time. I owned about thirty houses, but I have made all the tenants owners, and now I have but one house. Every honourable member will agree that the Australian babe is the best immigrant we can have; but in every city of Australia to-day we find the same abominations, the-same un-Christ-like attitude, on the part of landlords. There is one case to which I could refer, and in regard to which I have to thank you, sir, on behalf of many people outside, for the action you took. Could greater scope for a dictator be given than in a mandate government by regulation? During the war the Defence Department ground out laws like sausTwo of our greatest ages. These were called regulations; but if, under a regulation, a man may be fined or imprisoned, that regulation is really a law. While we may look on this century as, perhaps, the century in which more seeds of human love are being planted than in any preceding century, I view with much trepidation that clause in the Bill which has to do with the forced labour of the natives; and I shall vote for an amendment, which I understand will be moved, and which I hope the Government will accept. I know that the majority of honourable members quite agree with what I am saying at the present moment, but actions speak louder than words, and have more weight than long, and sometimes unintelligent, prayers; and I ask all to vote for the elimination of the offensive words to which I refer. with in the amendment before us. dealt with in another amendment, but if provision is made for adequate remuneration, based on white men's hours and white men's wages, the ground of much of my criticism will be removed. rise to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor).

105,Mr Ryan (West Sydney) [4.23],"Iof the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Yarra has made his point very clear. He wishes to have the government carried on by Parliament instead of by the Executive. As I understand the B ill , it is a kind of War Precautions measure; it is certainly on the same principle, because it gives complete power to the Governor-Generali n Council. That means that the honourable gentlemen who occupy the f r o nt Treasury bench will have absolute power to legislate, by means of Ordinances, exactly as they think fit in the government of the Territories. We are told that Parliament has the right to approve or disapprove of any Ordinance that may be passed by the Governor-Generali n Counci l ; but we know from experience that it is almost impossible, though a m a j o r it y of the Parliament may be in favour of disallowing any particular Ordinance, to have it even discussed, if the Ministry are unwilling that it should be discussed. We have had an example of this in the. last six weeks. Nearly three months ago, I think, I gave notice that I proposed, on a certain regulation being tabled under the War Precautions Act. to move that it be disallowed. The regulation was laid on the table, b u t my motion has been put at the bottom of the business-paper, with no chance of being discussed. Y e t we are told that Parliament wil l have control over the regulations made under this B ill . Sir tainly has control. even given an opportunity to place before members reasons why any regulation of the sort should be disallowed. cannot control Parliament. If there is any foundation for the position taken up with regard to the government of these islands-if ttie control of Parliaiment still remains-wh y not make all laws in the same expeditious manner ? I have no doubt that the Treasurer would like to do t h a t; at any rate, he has been governing Australia in that way for four years or more. It is one thing to have a proposal brought forward, initiated in Parliament, and discussed and approved by Parliament, and another thing to allow an Ordinance to be made by a Cabineti n secret conclave, with the proviso that Parliament may disallow the regulation or Ordinance under certain conditions, which, however, it is almost impossible to comply with . of Parliament, I have never known a regulation disallowed. pens. The Treasurer gave his case away when he admitted by interjection to me that the proposal in the B ill with regard to the issuing of Ordinances was of the same nature as the power to make regulations under the W a r Precautions Act . The Treasurer frankly admits t h a t ; he makes no secret of it . I have no apology to make for supporting the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition. issuing Ordinances is in this B ill , which Parliament is asked to approve of. Opposition, quite rightly, does not desire Parliament to approve; he does not wish to hand over to the Government absolute power to make laws for the government of these Territories, but to retain that right to Parliament. That is the proper attitude, and we should not delegate our authority in this respect to the Executive of the Government of the day. the war under the War Precautions Act. war. dissatisfaction that has arisen out of the T h a t is not so; we are not exercise of the power.

It is one thing to hand over the whole power of legislating, as proposed by the Bill, to the Executive, and another thing to give power to the Executive to make regulations to carry out the purposes of a particular measure.

We have had experience of their dealing with Nauru Island, for example; we know that they have made payments for this island without the authority of Parliament, and the Treasurer has never taken the trouble to explain why these payments were made. Then, the Executive have included Ocean Island in the agreement, and, furthermore, have paid for it, without the authority of Parliament. dred and seventy thousand pounds. sands of pounds were paid by the owners of these places by way of bonuses to their directors.

From one extreme, honourable members opposite swing to the other. all some other nations, possibly unfriendly, are to guard our snores and see that our White Australia is not impugned ; and when that objection is overcome they say, "" Y o u must have a completer form of government than you are providing for here."" liament. able member would define what he meani, by government by Parliament, we should get to much closer grips. not known it for the last few years. .member means that Queensland has not. the honourable member's remark is absolutely correct as applying to the northern life of the honourable member for West State; hence their troubles there. We are told that we must withdraw the Bill to provide for complete government by the Australian Parliament under the terms of the mandate. In other words, before the mandate is delivered, we must haye a complete form of government under it. Is not such a claim a little inlating to other Territories we are now consistent ? Is it possible to have a comgoverning. For instance, the provision plete form of government under a mandate before it has been delivered? honourable member for West Sydney must see how absurdly the amendment has been drawn. It is absurd enough for the honourable member himself to have drafted it. However, I want to say that, just viow, the position is rather delicate and difficult, and the honourable member and his leader would serve the best interests of Australia far better by not insisting on doing something which is impossible, and which would not be tolerated by the League of Nations; and which, moreover, if its effect had been known before, would have had the tendency to prevent the mandate from coming here. to that sort of humbug for years now. member is a good judge of humbug. The amendment asks us to provide that "" the laws of the Commonwealth shall apply to the Territory unless specifically exempted by the Parliament."" How are we to apply the laws of a White Australia to First of a black population? the "" open door "" against which you have railed so much ? right! I stand for a White Australia, and will take all sorts of good care that we do not prevent the possibility of maintaining it here by any such foolish statements as those to which the honourable member has given utterance. As to the question of making laws, honourable members would imagine that we had done something quite unusual in providing for theadmin istration of this Territory; but let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that, if we are going wrong now, it is only through following the example set by his party when they were in office. Somehow or other, the one object in Sydney seems ""to he ito denounce everything that his party has done. They may always have been wrong; but if the honourable member is right now, he has always been wrong in the past, because he was part of a great party which used almost identical language in legislation rerelating to Ordinances which applies in . The the Northern Territory is exactly the same as that in this Bill. Parliament applied in the Northern Territory measure? able member will listen, he will learn something. iSection 13 of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act passed by the Labour party saysUntil the Parliament makes other provision for the government of the Territory This is white Territory, and the laws applying there and the laws which run there do not apply to bladesthe Governor General may make Ordinanceshaving the force of law in the Territory.

224,Sir Joseph Cook,"The honorablepointing out the fundamental distinction between the Act which his Government passed and the Bill now before the House. This measure represents a completer control by Parliament than did the Papua Act passed by a Labour Government. When the honourable member tells me that the Lieutenant-Governor could make Ordinances only with the consent of the Legislative Council, I say again that the Legislative Council was shaped, controlled,, and elected by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Territory himself. This Bill aims at the creation of some simple machinery, tentative in the very nature of things. When we receive our mandate, and the reports as to the possibilities of the Territory, there must be completer legislation than is provided for in this Bill. moment is to set up machinery .in the meantime, and to get the administration in operation as a going concern. Afterwards, when the mandate is delivered to us, and in the light of the full knowledge we shall have obtained as the result of the investigations which are being made, whatever is required for completer government and control by Parliament can be provided. The Prime Minister told the House yesterday that investigations are proceeding. Information is being obtained on which to base a completer form of government, but the Leader of the Opposition asks us to withdraw the Bill, and tells us that he will have nothing to do with it unless we at once bring down a measure for a complete form of government, even before the mandate is received. Nothing will tend more to cripple our mandate, or even jeopardize its receipt, than a proposal such as has been suggested by honourable members opposite. I beg of them not to press this amendment to a division, but to leave the situation to be cleared up after we have obtained our mandate. even only one member will support me. honourable member will; he is very angry this afternoon. It is time to point out that there is a little inconsistency in these oi able member is not in order in conasseverations by honourable members opposite, who have only discovered a democratic language in relation to these Terri-. tories since the whole position has been made comparatively secure. While the question was in the balance, and we on this side were putting up the fight of our lives in order to get control of the backyards of Australia, and so be able to shield our White Australia policy, honourable members opposite were ridiculing our every effort; they were saying that Australia did not desire to fight for those lands, which were miserable clods of earth not worth fighting for; they were insisting that the islands were no good to us, and that we should not shed our blood for them, but should leave them to some form of international control, to government by some other people.

As an indication of how anxious the Government were to preserve the White Australia policy, the honourable member for Perth tells usMr Hughes blundered very seriously in his handling of the Pacific Islands question. In Listening characteristic fashion, and with an utter disregard of the delicacy and gravity of the situation, he put every consideration aside to pose as the champion of Australia against a menacing move.by a potential enemy. It was only a pose, but the temptation to strut before the world in pasteboard sword and armour could not be resisted by the gentleman who had, in an earlier stage of his career, tTod the boards of the "" heavy lead,"" and could get well into the limeAustralia, said Mr Hughes, in effect, if not in as many words; but he would save tlie situation. He demanded that Australia should have absolute ownership of all the late possessions of Germany up to the Equator. Had the claim been allowed, then the same concession would have had to be made to Japan in respect of those islands she had captured north of the Equator. Given the ownership, it is a certainty that the Japanese would have proceeded to fortify the islands, which would have necessitated similar precautions on the part of Australia. Can any one say how and where this would have ended? Apart from the provocation to warfare embodied in such hostile preparations, it meant, for the small community of Australia, an effort she .could hardly afford, in providing warships and munitions for the setting up of an armed imperialism of our own in the Pacific. In: this matter the Peace Conference saved Australia-fro m Mr Hughes.

Prime Minister stood for the policy or complete annexation, and when the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr. Ryan) stated, in effect, just what is contained in this extract, he was accused by the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) of having made a partisan statement. Side by side with it , however, is this statement by a supporter, if not a friend-a n effective supporter, if not a docile one-of the Prime Minister. As a matter of fact, what was done at the Peace Conference followed absolutely along the lines of the Australian Labour manifesto. The Treasurer knows that, but it was convenient for him to misrepresent the facts, as he usually does. I emphatically assert that what was done by the Peace Conference was based upon the principles asserted in the Australian Labour manifesto. orable member read the exact wording of those resolutions t orable member is as familiar with them as I am, and he knows that what I have said is correct. When the Treasurer lectured this House concerning the White Australia policy, one would naturally be led to believe that the policy of the Government was similar to the principles laid down at the Peace Conference; b u t such is not the fact. The policy agreed upon at the Peace Conference was the very^ opposite from that which the Prime Minister had advocated there. That is the crucial point, which, however, the Treasurer sought to cover up. He would have this country believe that the Government have been standing for the principle of a White Australia. But the Government are really opposed to that principle, so f a r , at any rate, as these Island Possessions are concerned. The advocacy of the Prime Minister at the Peace Conference was diametrically opposed to the policy of a White Australia. The key to the back door of Australia . was sought to be handed over to Japan by the Prime Minister of Australia, whose word, fortunately, was not accepted by the Peace Conference. W h at the Prime Minister said at the Conference was based on the policv of his Government, which policy is opposed to the principle of a White Australia. The policy adopted by the Peace Conference was strictly along the lines of the principles of the Labour party in Australia.

I cannot see any reason why one portion -of New Guinea as well as another cannot be administered by the present Lieutenant-Governor. ritory could be administered as well from Port Moresby as from Babaul? say whether the Territory should be administered from Port Moresby, Rabaul, or any other place, but I do not see the necessity for setting up two expensive offices for the control of these Possessions. When the mandate arrives the whole position, of course, imay be reviewed, and we mav be given some clear understand-, ing of what the Administrator will have to do, and what are the difficulties in the way of bringing the whole under one official. hope that the Government will appoint as Administrator a man who is a sympathetic Australian. general ? person. What is required is a man of considerable Australian experience and wide views. My reason for this suggestion is that Northern Queensland, principally Cooktown, has been mainly responsible for the opening of the mining fields of New Guinea, and those concerned in the work have been considerably embarrassed, not to say hampered, by some who were able to interfere with their progress. I am told by men who have been to G e New Guinea that in that Possession there are supposed to be areas which contain gold in payable quantities. The German Government were not sympathetic to prospecting, and were opposed to the Australian prospector, and they imposed such conditions as made it impossible for any Australian to do prospecting. I believe that the licence cost Â£ 1 0 , and a royalty was demanded of, I .should say, 10 per cent, on the gold recovered. This made prospecting so costly, in view of 'the further fact that carriers had to be employed to carry food, tools, and so forth, that practically no prospecting was done. TheA d ministrator under the Australian Government ought to be one who will give Australian prospectors every possible support If this B ill is tentative, w ill and help in developing what are supposed to be valuable gold-bearing areas. I understand that the waters that flow from the Stanley Ranges towards bhe north-east coast traverse regions in which quartz reefs are known to exist; and I hope the Government will bear my suggestion in mind. I support the suggestion made by the I do not honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr. Hector Lamond). This is a tentative measure, and I presume that is the reason the Administrator is to hold office only "" during the pleasure of the Governor General."" A t any rate, it is clear that any appointment made now may be terminated at bhe will of the Government, and some' new man appointed. During the initia l stages of the administration of the Territory I see no reason why the present Lieutenant-Governor of Papua should not preside over the destinies of I both areas. It does not-seem to be quite realized by some that the Dutch hold about half of bhe New Guinea lands, and we do not know whether they will enter necessarily a sympathetically into an administration of an up-to-date, white-Australian charN o t necessarily any acter -However that may be, I think that in the meantime the present Lieutenant-Governor of Papua might suffice. If a permanent appointment is not now to be made, I think it would be wise to allow the Lieutenant-Governor of Papua to act in the meantime. Treasurer) [5.51] I should not like to say that the man to be immediately appointed to this position w ill necessarily r m a n have to vacate it later on. I should think that if he does well in this sphere he will go up to the higher one. If he does good work, I think that his services will be retained. Territory will be under the provisions of the mandate. the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) has been referring to the person to be appointed as Administrator of the Territory.

In regard to the White Australia policy, he saysTihe subject of a Wlhite Australia in connection with the Conference bas been dealt with by Mr Hughes in some detail. It may be interesting, in the first place, to explain how the matter arose. The Japanese delegates formulated a demand for the recognition of the principle of racial equality in the Covenant of the League of Nations. At the time when this question was 'first raised by the Japanese delegates in (Paris, the Covenant of the League of Nations was under discussion by the Commission on the League of Nations. President Wilson was chairman of this Commission, and the representatives of the British Empire were Lord Robert Cecil and General Smuts. Before bringing their amendment before the Commission, the Japanese representativeswho, as the result showed, were very skilful diplomats-endeavoure d to enlist support and to remove obstacles in as many quarters as possible. They interviewed all the representatives of other nations on the Commission of the League of Nations. When the amendment was put to the Commission of the Leaguei t was carriedby 11 votes to 7. made in the press.) the responsibility of ruling that it was not carried, declaring that any amendment of the draft of the Covenant then before the Commission could only be made by a unanimous vote. But there was still another stage. It was open to Japan to move the amendment at the Peace Conference itself. done, the position would have been very serious. It was not done. Baron Makino confined himself to a protest,, delivered in dignified and weighty language. Howi t came about that the Japanese representatives adopted bhis course, instead of moving the amendment in a Conference which they had reason to believe would have supported their claim, is one of the interesting stories of the Conference which higher authorities have not yet told, and upon which I cannot, therefore, speak. The terms of that protest should be read by every Australian, in order . that they may understand the point of view from which the Japanese public criticises our policy. The principle of White Australia is almost a religion in Australia. Upon it depends the possibility of the continuance of white Democracy-indeed , of any Democracy, in a real sense-in this continent. Any surrender of the policy is inconceivable-it rests upon the right of every self-governing community to determine the ingredients of its own population. If that right is surrendered, the essence of self-government disappears. But it must be remembered that there are various methods of expressing a policy, and various means of applying a principle. also s'hould not be forgotten that the principle underlying a policy ie frequently misunderstood in foreign countries. It is vitally important for Australia to understand her White [190]2 Australia policy herself-to get at the root of it, and view it in all its aspects. When the policy is so considered, it will be found that it contains nothing that can justly be regarded as offensive by any foreign nation. For the reasons which Mr Latham has set out I am very anxious to incorporate in this B ill sub-section 10 of section 41 of the PapuaA ct 1905, which prevents the Lieutenant-Governorf r o m giving his assent to any Ordinance relating to the introduction or immigration of aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, A f r i c a , or Asia. I contend that what we did in 1905 we ought to be able to do in 1920, instead of taking a retrograde step and going back on the principles of a White Australia, which, as Mr Latham says, is a religion with the great bulk of the people of this country. If we have done anything that w ill permit of the nations of the earth coming into German New Guinea freely, we have taken a step that (.This announcement has been the people of Australia w ill ever regret. President Wilson took We should adopt a definite policy at the inception of our administration, otherwise we shall have to retrace our steps very soon.

It is, in effect, there. Certain Ordinances made by the Legislative Council under the Papua Act are reserved expressly for the assent of the Governor General, who, of course, acts on the advice of the Government of the day. The Ordinances under this B ill have to be made by the Governor General through the Government of the day^so that in reality the same author it y makes or gives assent to the Ordinances in both cases. Therefore, the honourable member is urging the inclusion of something that is, in effect, in the B ill .

Treasurer) [6.25] -In the extract which the Leader of the Opposition quoted from the writings of Commander Latham, a gentleman with whom I was intimately associated at the Peace Conference, and who did excellent work, there is a phrase which does not quite represent the Japanese attitude as expressed at the Conference. The Japanese were particular in stressing their claim to racial equality. I think the phrase was "" the just rights oi all nationals signatory to the Treaty"" , although there were several variants, a l l having the same meaning. Buti t is only f a i r to say that the Japanese delegation insisted time and again that in the rights which Japan wished to establish for herself and other Eastern nations under the Peace Treaty, she did not claim to take advantage of the open door, so f a r as immigration was concerned. now and again they were pressed to make that statement good and to declare that they excluded immigration from the term "" just rights of all nationals."" upon that question they would not yield.

Sometimes it was our unhappy privilege to notice these regulations included amongst our papers, and on more than one occasion a member of this House has given notice of his intention to move that a particular regulation be disallowed. notice of motion has duly appeared upon the paper; but, partly by accident and mainly by design, its discussion has never -been reached. taken good care of that; and then, in due time-or , rather, in undue time-it has disappeared from the notice-paper.

If no outside body has a right to interfere in matters of this sort we may discuss them here, and see to it that tbe principles we stand for in Australia are applied to any Territories that have to be administered as an integral part of the Commonwealth. It is with that object in view that we have been advocating the vesting of the power in Parliament, as distinct from the Executive Government. We have not been able to have our views accepted that Parliament shall have the supreme power as against the Executive, and the next best thing is to secure that the Ordinances shall only be operative for a certain period, unless during that period Parliament has said they may continue. That is an eminently reasonable position to take up, and I hope the Committee will carry the amendment. Sir [8.34] -As I understand the amendment, it is that the Ordinances are to come into operation immediately on their publication in the Government Gazette, and that within fifteen days after Parliament meets it will be necessary for Parliament to deBnitely affirm that they shall continue in operation. That, I think, is the general effect of the proposal. In addition to the difficulties expressed by the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook), the amendment is, to my mind, impracticable from a further stand-point. will be made, and some of them, no a few days after Parliament has prorogued, and others come into operation within a few days of Parliament meetI am not putting any ing.

If an Ordinance be of an enabling character, all sorts of vested interests may arise under them, only to be set aside immediately Parliament meets. member see that the B ill , as it stands, The righ t honourable provides for the possibility of an Ordinance being revoked by resolution of Parliament ? is that possibility; but I venture to say on the honourable member's own showing that that is vastly different from a condi-' tion of affairs which makes it the duty of Parliament to confirm an Ordinance. P The clause, as. it stands, gives greater stability, as experience has shown, than would be given did it become necessary for the approval of Parliament to be given within fifteen days. Of course, there is the furtherpractical difficulty that Parliament is engaged in work of a more urgent character, and it would be truly difficult at times to bring in the necessary affirmative motions to make the Ordinances valid: That would certainly have to be done in many instances at the sacrifice of far more important work. Prom that stand-point, and dealing with this solely as a practical, and not as a technical, matter, I say that greater stability is given by the clause in its present form. Furthermore, as a time-wasting device, it leaves nothing to be desurer pointed out that this B ill is really of a tentative character, or, as has been suggested, of a temporary nature. The mandate has not yet been issued, but is merely a provision in the Covenant of the League of Nations. That Covenant provides that the mandate shall issue; and when it is issued it will then be for us to enact the necessary legislation, having regard to the terms of the mandate.

When we know the terms of the mandate under the Covenanti t will be the duty and responsibility of the Government to introduce the necessary legislation of a more permanent character. Under the circumstances we are justified in the view that the greatest degree of stability, so far as that is necessary, should be given to the Ordinances during the period of the operation of the B ill itself. I am certain that the mandate, when it does issue, will call for a more permanent measure. called upon to say a few words in consequence of a few tentative remarks from' the tentative-permanent gentleman who has just resumed his seat ( Sir Robert Best). I understand from the statement of the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) that this is purely a tentative measure, having for its object the establishment of a tentative government for tentative purposes; and the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has moved an amendment to this tentative measure for a tentative government, which amendment is objected to because it is said to be a permanent interference with a tentative measure. should there be any objection to the amendment on the part of men who say that this is simply a tentative measurea measure of uo permanent character? amendment. orablo member for Kooyongi t is not a tentative amendment; he objects to it because it is permanent in its character, # aud w ill interfere with the operation of a B ill that has a tentative object-. -honourable member says that the amendAtkinson, L. ment w ill interfere with the capacity of Bamford, F.

We propose to deal with them in the same way as similar peoples are dealt with in all the Territories of the world, and certainly in the way that advanced civilization deals with them. drivers say to them. useless to address arguments to men who use silly phrases which they know to be untrue. ""forced"" labour. honourable member mean by that? himself mean? we may ask a native to pay his contribution to the taxation of the Territory in the form of useful labour. I have nothing else in my mind. I am laying down the principle that these natives, for the good government which we hope to give them, should themselves make some eontribution towards the cost of governing the Territory. I am suggesting that, perhaps, the most convenient form in which they can make that contribution will be by doing a little labour for the Government in the development of the Territory. Is that forced labour? Is that using the lash? Is that slavery? To so characterize it is pure claptrap and humbug. Notwithstanding the statement of the Treasurer in regard to asking the natives to perform a certain amount of useful labour in the Territory in lieu of paying taxation, this clause provides for something more than that. Its terms are very definiteNo forced labour shall be permitted in the Territory except for essential public works and lute slavery? It is a distinction without services, and then only for adequate remuneration. That means, if it means anything at all, that the Administrator will have the Tight to compel the natives to work whenever he thinks fit. use physical force to compel them to do . so. Administrator will be the sole judge of what is "" adequate remuneration."" It is evident, therefore, that there is something more in this Bill than the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) contemplates. to be looked after. When we have a civilized Government -there we cannot allow them to starve. If a native says, "" You must look after me, but I will do no work,"" how are we to deal with such a man? Scriptural quotation, "" He that will not work, neither shall he eat."" The natives are able to provide for themselves. The aborigines of Australia, before a white man set foot in the country, were able to live. They had to work to secure their living, and they did not know what starvation was. gument for leaving the natives to themselves, and for refusing to' take a mandate to try to train them to a higher degree of civilization. the claiise simply provided that natives could be employed on essential public works at a fair remuneration, without making any reference to forced labour, the position would be 'different. The natives, like every one else, if offered fair conditions, will accept employment. We must hold out to these natives the hand of friendship. We must let them see that we are kindly disposed to them, and desire to better their position. lif we do, they will quickly respond. The clause provides, however, that there shall be power to force natives to work on conditions laid down by the Administrator, and for what he considers to be adequate remuneration. What is the difference between forcing a man to work and absoa difference.

Sir able member may think it is nonsense; but my reading of the Conventions is that the League of Nations was created to secure improved conditions for mankind, to' do away w i th war; and it is only reasonable to assume that it w ill be opposed to forced laboxir or any forim of slavery. ""We cannot distinguish between forced labour and slavery. Sir JOSEPH distinction is set out in black and white in the B ill . clause 2. It is a blot on the B ill , and ought to be struck out. How can it be argued that the natives will be free to do what they like if the Administrator is given power to force them to labour on public works and services whenever he thinks fit? Practically, there will be only Government work to carry out. If that is so, and the Government offer the natives sufficient inducement, they will readily do that work. But it is altogether wrong to compel them to work under any conditions that may be imposed. The Treasurer would be well advised to accept the amendment. It will be possible to govern these Territories without any such provision as that which it is proposed to eliminate. The Administrator may be a humane man, but, on the other hand, he may be altogether too exacting. we could dispense with his services. is very difficult for us to ascertain what is happening in these far away places.

The Administrator will be able to impose his own conditions, and to compel the natives to observe them. The acceptance of the amendment will not interfere with the government of the islands. The revenue may not be sufficient to pay for their administration, but we do not want to minimize the loss by doing anything detrimental to the best interests of the natives. L e t ' us give them freedom to accept what they regard as a f a ir thing for the work they perform. Workmen, whether black or white, w ill respond to reasonable treatment, and give a f a i r return for their remuneration. Once people get into their heads the idea that they have to do what they are told* to do, and that their employers can pay them what they please, discontent arises. If that sort of thing is allowed, the time will come when it w ill be necessary to drive the natives to work, or practically to whip them. We do not want that sort of thing to occur, and, therefore, I repeat that this provision is quite unnecessary, and should be eliminated. rather surprised at the argument that has been advanced in opposition to this clause by honourable members of the Opposition. They are really making a mountain out of a molehill. We all know that they opposed, by every means in their power, the taking over of these islands. It was not the wish of the Labour party that we should have aiiyhing to do with them. Everyone admits that when these islands were governed by the Germans the natives were badly treated. Honourable members opposite, however, were opposed to the British controlling the islands, and were prepared to leave them in the hands of Germans who treated the natives badly. TJp to the present time, we have had in New Guinea a military administration, which, had it dared, could have done all these things which honourable members opposite suggest. But w ill any one say that either a military or a civil Administrator is prepared to use the lash ? military would. member knows more than I do.

According to their own words and actions, honourable members opposite were prepared to leave the natives under German rule, by which the Germans were able to exercise authority, and whip them as they desired. Jt has been argued that we have no righ t to force men to work, but it has also been said that a man who will not work for his living has no right to eat. An y man who will not work for his living in Australia is arrested for having no visible means of support. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) argues that we have no right to govern the islands. If so, we have no righ t to come to Australia, and we should hand this country back to the aborigines who were in possession of it originally. the aborigines of Australia ? labour, and no slavery. live in Australia unless he does his little bit, or unless he gets about in the back blocks. vide the aborigines with free living. for it. There is a bigger question to be considered than simply dealing with the natives of the islands at the present time. Coming down to bedrock, the continent of Australia is placed here for the benefit of mankind, and civilization should exploit its riches.

Papua, German New Guinea, and the islands have to be exploited for the benefit of civilization. that -we shall getall the labour we require, and, as the clause states, it will be amply remunerated for its services. honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) said these islands were previously under the control of the Germans. I am not responsible for what the Germans or anybody else did . I am not troubled about the control of the Philippines by the Americans or Japanese. The point is that these islands are coming under our control, and the question we have to answer is, "" What are we going to do with them ?"" We see now the reason for the previous clause on which we took a division. poses of this clause. We see now clearly and distinctly why the Government do not want the, Ordinances discussed by this Parliament. the rule is not tentative, but permanent, and that it is proposed to give to one individual in the new community, power to do things which are not done in any other part. The clause begins with the simple stipulation that no slave labour shall be permitted in the Territory. The Treasurer hammers his finger upon that phrase. finger on the other p a r t : "" No forced, labour shall be permitted in the Territory, except"". right honourable member to say, "" No forced labour shall be permitted, except.""

We can come to a divi put this sion upon, the question of whether we stand for forced labour, or slavery, or not, In case it is required. whenever the Government like. The Treasurer has only one argument for the proposal, whatever his real reasons may be, for in his heart of hearts he does not be-, I am satisfied lieve in this thing, and many others sitting behind the Government do not believei n slavery or forced labour. The Treasurer is going to support, at this juncture, a system of slave labour,, or forced labour., on the one ground that there is a right of taxation, and that the natives have the right to pay taxes as a contribution towards the upkeep of their country. I do not suppose they have any objection to paying taxation. As a matter of fact, they have in existence a perfect means of paying any contribution that is necessary for the upkeep of their country. A system of forced labour is not needed for the maintenance of their country, and this It was devised for the purproposal is not meant to make them pay their dues or obligations in that direction. The real purpose of it is to compel them to labour for other men for whatWe see now that ever may be given to them. One honourable member opposite said that the natives would not be ill treated. Is that so? I direct the attention of the -Ministerial party to the ton, the Methodist minister.

457,Mr Anstey,"In New Guinea. The Government say they are going to send white men up there, and this system of forced labour means that you can make them work for you as long as you like. If you offer the natives enough, they will work. Offer them the inoentive to sell their labour as free men,*and you will get their services. But why should they, any more than any one else, be compelled to give their labour? TheB ill provides for forced labour, but no penalties are provided. Honourable members opposite say that, of course, the lash will not be used, and that it is outrageous to suggest such a thing. How, then, is the clause to be enforced ? The penalty is to be provided by Ordinainjce', and not i h t h e B ill . man's contact, whether it be a trader or There is to be forced labour for all public works and services, however extensive they may be, and the man in charge there can stretch the interpretation of i "" public works and services"" as f a r as he likes. He can prescribe how f a r their meaning shall extend, and what the nature of the work shall be. declare how long the men shall work, and what amount of rice shall be handed to each of them for their services. The Government dare not say in this B ill what the penalty is to be, because they and their supporters dare not vote on such a proposal. They, therefore, carefully cover it up, and leave it to the Administrator. They empower him to impose forced labour on the in habitants, and, since they dare not put .they leave it to him to devise the penalty, whatever it may be, according to his mercy or ferocity. If he has been brutalized by contact with other races he regards as inferior, no doubt the punishment he will inflict will reflect his odiousness. It ought not to be l e f t to the individual himself to say what he proposes to do in this particular direction. I ask the Treasurer upon whom he proposes to enforce labour? orable member when he sits down. necessity for me to ask the question. Upon whom' is this forced labour to be imposed? Upon the natives, of course. But why is it not put in the Bill? As I do not know much about legal matters, I ask the honourable and learned member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) does he see anything in the B ill which specifies the persons to whom this forced labour w ill apply ? not. What is a native? Is he a purebred,or a half-caste, or an octoroon ? Where is the line of limitation to be drawn ? ferentiate ? the honourable member. Here we see a probably budding Administrator of New Guinea, with its bubbling humanity, asking why we should distinguish between the pure black and the product of the white an officer who has seized a native g i r l , used her in his office, and produced something which is possibly worse than black or white, but is the shame of either race, despised alike by that which produced it and that which bore it . The honourable member says, "" W h y should we distinH e can guish? That despised product shall also be a slave and entitled to be forced to labour."" But why stop at that which is a little black and a little white? W h y stop as long as there is one single streak of colour? So long as there is one streak of the native race in man or woman the honourable member would claim the r i g ht to impose his odious forced service. There is no mention of it in the B ill , but the honourable member would draw no distinction between those who have some admixture of black blood in their veins and it in an Act of Parliament, those who are pure natives. to stand over all of them with a big whip ! given is always power abused. Of course, honourable members say that they would never do these things, that reference to v the past is useless, that it is a waste of words to talk about what has occurred here, there, or elsewhere, and that we, of our race and under our flag, are noble, I shall tell the hongentle creatures who would not be guilty of any cruel or unkind deed. But that is a lie. Under every flag, good men and bad, cruel men as well as generous, are born.

But I do not stand very much for this subclause, and if the Committee really feeh that the Bill will be better without it, I do not mind whether it goes or not. do protest, however, against this attempt to twist, turn, and shape out of all recognition, a clause which is intended to be benevolent in its nature, and to limit the very abuses about which, we have heard so much to-night. Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) has rendered a very useful service to honourable members by showing that the very highly coloured pictures presented to us by the Anstey) have very little application to the clause. There is no doubt that the limitations are intended to remove many of the objections that have been associated with forced labour in any shape or form; but I point out to the Treasurer and to the Committee that forced labour, even as limited by this sub-clause, would, I think, be reprehended by ""the people of Australia with regard to these mandated Territories.

In Egypt, from time immemorial, the corvee has been a means by which urgent public works have been carried out on short notice; such works, for instance, as the repairing of damaged canal banks in order to preserve the country from an overwhelming calamity. Then, again, in South Africa, conditions similar to those allowed by this clause, have been permitted in regard to the natives there. But the utilization of this forced labour, even under safeguards like the protective provisions of this clause has caused a considerable amount of difficulty in dealing with the natives, especially in recent times. deal with them. there is a strong agitation against it, for it has been shown that a good deal of gest that. grave trouble has crept into the administration of forced labour, no matter how claimed that under this clause they well it is protected. I congratulate the should be compelled to contribute to the Treasurer on the suggestion that he and the Government are quite willing to withdraw the clause if honourable members regard it as more or less objectionable. I certainly do not like it. I do not think it ig necessary, and I can assure the Treasurer that he will be consulting the wishes of the people of Australia if it is I withdrawn and fair dealing conditions in regard to terms of labour are extended to the natives. I think the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) would be well advised to consent to the elimination of the sub-clause. Those who know and understand the Papuan people will not come to the conclusion that they are savages, as suggested by the Treasurer. them. nation as thieves because there are a few thieves among them? were thieves.

When we realize that under the guidance of missionaries and the Government of Papua, some of the natives are engaged in such work as running saw-mill plants, manipulating oil engines, motor boats, and even building motor boats in a manner that would do credit, to the boat builders of Australia, we must realize that they are not all the kind of people under that sub-clause to which objection MrG OOM -The clause does not sugR",67,Earle Page D O Any Of Our Would Not Be So Bad I F He Could Work

As one who knows something of the real position there, I think the Treasurer will be well advised to eliforward in sufficient numbers, it is only minate this proposal of compulsion from the Bill, because I am satisfied, from what I saw, that the Government will have no difficulty whatever in getting, by other means, all the labour that may be required from the native j>opulation. not in agreement with the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins). hope the Minister will retain the subclause. In fact, I congratulate the Government upon its inclusion, for unless the Government have this power, how will it be possible to bring about a manow. terial improvement in the condition of the islands? The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) said it was only, right that the natives should pay their share of taxation. them could pay in coin of the realm? The only way in which they can pay their share of taxation is by labour. Taxation which is imposed upon us, and whicli we must pay, whether we like it or not, is only another form of forced labour. We are compelled to work in order to earn suflicient money to pay our taxes. It is not intended that the natives shall be driven into forced labour, but. the clause provides that, if it becomes neceslowed to do nothing and learn nothing sary for certain works to be carried out and the labour is not forthcoming voluntarily, the natives may be forced to give their services in return for adequate remuneration. stated that if sufficient money were offered, the labour would be forthcoming. That has not been the experience in Papua. The daily wants of the natives are easily supplied, and after they have worked for a day or two they take a rest, and will not work again until they feel the pinch of necessity. That has been the experience amongst native races all over the world. In Papua, very few developmental works have 'been carried on. Why? Because we cannot secure the necessary native labour. If we are to advance the natives of New Guinea, we must construct roads, drain the swamps in order to get rid of malaria, and open up the country generally. That can be done only by the utilization of native labour. Honourable members may ask why we should not pay for the' la'bour. But, if we cannot get natives to eome right that the Administrator should be vested with power to order men to work so many days on a certain task. If a man can pay his quota in money, well and good; if he cannot, let him pay with his labour. I hope the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) will allow this provision to remain in the B ill ; for, if it is struck I out, the time may come when it will be necessary for us to re-insert it, and it will be a more unpleasant task to bring about compulsory labour two or three years hence than to make provision for it I have listened with a good deal of surprise to the sudden access of fury in regard to this elause. It seems to me that But how many of a wrong view has been placed before the Committee. In dealing with these islands, the Commonwealth has two alternatives-(1 ) Leave them in a savage state, or (2) attempt to civilize them. There is no middle course. The native, particularly the savage, is mentally and in many other ways a child. I take it that no member of the Opposition will say that there should be no compulsory education, that the child should be aluntil he had reached manhood, when he might become a menace to society. for any one to ill-treat a child in a civiOne honourable member lized community. incentive for a paternal Government, which will have to pay out of its own coffers thousands of pounds per annum to maintain the Territory, as the report of the Commission indicates, to ill-treat its subjects.

He lays great stress upon the fact that the sub-clause is in the nature of prohibition, and chat it clearly states that no forced labour shall be permitted in the Territory except Sir JOSEPH Coox -That is very plain. plain ; and up to that stage the sub-clause is prohibitive. In that prohibition there is something vetoed which is absolutely distasteful to the Australian sense of jus-, tice, and absolutely distasteful, I believe, to this Committee. There come the exceptions set out in the sub-clause, and it is the exceptions to that golden rule that members on this side are taking, in turn, very great exception. M a y I ask the Treasurer to consider for a moment how this sub-clause may be read affirmatively? It may be so read, and i m mediately one does that one drives out of it the virtue to which the right honourable gentleman has attached so much importance. It may be read in this wayThat forced labour shall be permitted in the Territory for essential public works and services, and adequate remuneration. There is no doubt at all that the mere prohibition does not alter the plain meaning that forced labour may he permitted under certain circumstances. I ask the Treasurer to remember that, whether this sub-clause is. intended to apply only to the coloured or white races, to the members of a recently conquered race, or to whomsoever it is to apply, these persons are deserving of the protection of the law. L e t us ask ourselves how f a r they will be able to invoke the protection of the law, and by that means we shall be able to p u t this sub-clause to the test. L e t us assume that a native is taken from his home, his hut, or his humpy, wherever it may be, and from his occupation. He is bound hand and foot, and is brought to the place where a particular class of work is to be performed. enter upon a particular task, and he replies, "" I cannot do it . I will not do it , "" or "" I refuse to accept the remuneration offered."" there comes that crucial moment that honourable members opposite wish to evade. What measures are to be adopted to compel a man to work ? If the language means anything. it means what it says, and that, in the event of a refusal to obey orders, physical violence may be employed, including all kinds of torture. I suggest to the Committee that if the Administrator, or any superior or inferior officer who is in charge, adopts brutal measures to compel a man to work, he would be able successf u l l y to rejoin that he relies on the It is absolutely security of this Act of Parliament. He would be able to say, "" I required labour for a particular purpose; I offered this man what I considered to be adequate remuneration, and he refused to work. "" Because he refuses to work, and the work is deemed to be of essential public importance, he is compellable to do so in the way sanctioned by law. If the most brutal Administrator that one .could imagine were indicted for misusing any person in the Territory, under these circumstances he would have an irrefragable defence, according to the laws of this country, and he could not be convicted. on the regulations. regulation which unsays what this B ill says-and no regulation can do that flogging; this B ill does not provide for flogging, or any corporal punishment. that neither the Minister, nor any speaker on the other side, w ill face the question of what is meant by compulsion; and I p ut the view strongly that, according to the dictionary, it can mean only the use of violence in any measure necessary to secure the object in view. say that there shall be forced labour. course, does not say that, b ut I p u t the matter in the affirmative form , and that is what the clause means.
