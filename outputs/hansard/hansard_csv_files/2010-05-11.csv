(2) What was the average cost of the rebate paid in the period (a) from the commencement of the program to 1 November 2009, and (b) between 1 November and 23 November 2009. (3) What are the monthly totals of (a) the number of rebates, and (b) total monies, paid from the commencement of the program to 23 November 2009. (1) I am advised that, as at 23 November 2009: (a) 718,513 households had received assistance under the Home Insulation Program, including the Low Emission Assistance Plan for Renters (LEAPR). (b) Due to the significant number of claims for assistance that were received under the Program, the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency (DCCEE) has provided the data requested in a weekly breakdown (Attachment A). The Program’s objectives were measured in terms of the number of houses insulated and not categorised into electorates automatically.

The Low Emission Assistance Plan for Renters, and from 1 September 2009, the Home Insulation Program, provided assistance to landlords for rental and other properties they own, including dwellings where they do not receive rental payments and untenanted properties, for example holiday homes. I am advised that: (a) as at 31 August 2009, 17,048 properties received assistance under the Low Emission Assistance Plan for Renters for installations that occurred during the period 3 February 2009 to 31 August 2009, totalling $15,889,876.40.

Broadcasting Services (Question No. 1173) Mr Windsor asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 2 February 2010: In light of digital technology advances, will the Government amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to deregulate radio and television broadcasting services to many diversified service providers, and when will consumers benefit from many digital free to air radio and television services in every market, especially in regional locations. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: Radio broadcasting During May and June of 2009 the radio industry switched on digital radio services in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. Consideration of the complex policy and planning issues involved in the regional rollout of digital radio is underway and engineering advice on spectrum requirements is being developed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). The Government will conduct a review, by 2011, into alternative terrestrial and satellite digital radio technologies that may be appropriate for regional areas. This review will address the fact that the digital radio technology being used in metropolitan areas (known as Digital Audio Broadcasting Plus, DAB+) is unlikely to be able to replicate the extensive broadcast coverage of some regional AM services. Digital television On5 January 2010, the Government announced that it would fund a new satellite service to provide digital television to viewers in remote licence areas and those in metropolitan and regional licence areas who are unable to receive the terrestrially-delivered digital television services provided by commercial broadcasters licensed for their area. In addition to the full range of ABC and SBS digital television services, the satellite service will feature a range of commercial services equivalent to those available in metropolitan areas-this includes three core channels feature content from the Seven, Nine and Ten Networks plus digital multi-channels such as GO!, 7TWO and ONE HD. The satellite service will also provide eligible viewers with access to the local news and information regional commercial broadcasters provide their terrestrial licence areas. On 18 March 2010, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010 (the Bill) was introduced into the House of Representatives. The Bill establishes the legislative framework for the commercial broadcasting digital television services that will be delivered as part of the new satellite service. The Bill also introduces measures to allow all commercial free-to-air digital television services, including digital multi-channels such as GO!, 7TWO and ONE HD, to be provided terrestrially to a small number of licence areas where historically there were fewer than two commercial broadcasters.",91,Questions In Writing
150,Mr Albanese,"The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital EconomyThe Bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to allow commercial broadcasters in regional South Australia, Griffith and Broken Hill to apply for a third, digital-only commercial licence giving them the opportunity to provide a full suite of digital television services in their licence area. Convergence Australians living in remote and rural areas are already able to access radio and television services on the Internet. Examples of such services could be online radio, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and video-on-demand services. These services are delivered by traditional broadcasters as well as new providers, and may be viewable on traditional platforms such as television sets as well as convergent devices such as smart phones and tablet PCs. The range of services available to consumers will increase consistent with improvements to broadband infrastructure from technology advancements and ongoing investment. A key trend in the broadcasting sector is convergence, which refers to the merging of different forms of technology to provide the same services. The Government has flagged its intention to consider in 2011 whether to look again at its overall approach to regulation in a convergent environment in the National Broadband Network: Regulatory Reform for 21st Century Broadband Discussion Paper and the Digital Economy: Future Directions paper. A key theme in these considerations will be the scope for winding back industry-specific regulation once the National Broadband Network is firmly established as an open access, wholesale-only, national network. The Government has also indicated that it will look at a range of issues in this review such as media diversity, ownership controls, audience reach rules and local content obligations. Prime Minister (Question No. 1180) Mr Briggs asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 3 February 2010: (1) How many nights did he and his family spend at Kirribilli House in (a) December 2009, and (b) January 2010. (2) Did he attend the Boxing Day Test Match in Melbourne in 2009; if so, did he use a Government VIP aircraft to travel to the match; if so, (a) from which airport did he depart, (b) how many guests, family or otherwise travelled with him, and (c) what was the total cost to the taxpayer. (1) (a) and (b) Detailed information on residency patterns of the Prime Minister and his family cannot be provided for security reasons. (2) (a) to (c) The Prime Minister did attend the Boxing Day Test Match in Melbourne in 2009. Detailed information on Special Purpose Aircraft flights is recorded by the Department of Defence and is tabled in parliament on a six-monthly basis. Australian Embassy United States of America: Purchases (Question No. 1183) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, in writing, on 3 February 2010: For the 2008 and 2009 calendar years, (a) how much equipment did the Australian Embassy in the United States of America purchase on behalf of the Australian Government, including all equipment and spare parts, items purchased and their price, and (b) what was the rationale for using the Embassy rather than competitive tender or buying from Australian companies?",93,Questions In Writing
151,Mr Rudd,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:An overview of the calendar years 2008 and 2009 Direct Commercial Sales purchases undertaken by the Embassy reflects that there were approximately 3000 individual purchases from several hundred vendors, with a total value of approximately US$400 Million over this period. I am not prepared to provide specific details on the grounds that the workload would be excessive and the accuracy of the detail may not be verifiable within the required timeframes. RAAF Base Williamtown: Defence Housing (Question No. 1188) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, in writing, on 4 February 2010: (1) How many Defence Housing Australia (DHA) properties are located within noise affected areas surrounding the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Base Williamtown and the Port Stephens Shire (PSSC) Council region according to the (a) 2012, and (b) 2025, Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF). (2) How many DHA property Development Applications for houses within (a) 2012, and (b) 2025, ANEF, noise affected areas surrounding RAAF Base Williamtown were approved in (a) 1, (b) 3, (c) 6, (d) 12, (e) 18, and (f) 24, months, prior to the public release of the 2025 ANEF. (3) How many DHA property Development Applications for noise affected areas surrounding RAAF Base Williamtown have been approved since the release of the 2025 ANEF, and on what dates were those approvals made. (4) Will DHA be required to retrofit DHA owned houses in areas identified in the 2025 ANEF as being noise affected. (1) (a) Under the 2012 ANEF, no DHA properties* are within noise affected areas. (b) Under the 2025 ANEF, 42 DHA properties* are between the 20 and 25 ANEF contours. *Note: Only DHA owned properties are encompassed by this response on the grounds that lease expiries will take many of the DHA leased properties out of the portfolio by the time the 2025 ANEF is effective. (2) (a) There have been no Development Applications for DHA houses within 2012 ANEF noise affected areas. (b) (i) and (vi)There have been 10 Development Applications for DHA houses within 2025 ANEF noise affected areas. Six of these were approved six months before the public release of the 2025 ANEF (October 2009) and four were approved 18 months before the public release of the 2025 ANEF. (3) None. (4) DHA is not required by legislation to retrofit noise attenuation measures to existing houses that might be affected under the 2025 ANEF. However, DHA on its own initiative may retrofit noise attenuation measures, but no decision will be made on such action until the 2025 noise contours are finalised by Defence.",94,Questions In Writing
152,Mr Combet,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,95,Questions In Writing
153,Mr Combet,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Livestock Exports (Question No. 1190) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 4 February 2010: How many livestock die annually as a result of the live export process, and what number of live stock deaths per annum is acceptable by Government standards. The six monthly report to parliament, which is tabled in both houses of parliament, contains details of the outcome of livestock exported by sea. The report to parliament is also publicly available on the department’s website at: http://www.daff.gov.au/animal-plant-health/welfare/export-trade/mortalities#reports I am advised that mortalities for livestock exported by air are negligible. It is the aim of both industry and the government to achieve the lowest possible mortalities for livestock exports. The Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock details reportable levels of livestock export mortalities. If these levels are exceeded, a mortality investigation is triggered. Healthy Community Initiative Pilot (Question No. 1195) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 4 February 2010: (1) What criteria are Local Government Areas (LGAs) required to meet to be eligible for the Healthy Community Initiative pilot phase commencing in April 2010. (2) What 42 LGAs were invited to apply for the funding under the pilot phase of this initiative. (3) Why were the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council, Kempsey Shire Council and the Greater Taree City Council not eligible to apply for funding under the pilot phase given they are in one of the specified Job Priority Areas. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) To be eligible for the Healthy Communities Initiative Local Government Area (LGA) Grants pilot phase, LGAs were required to meet a number of targeting criteria. These criteria included: socio economic status and rates of overweight and obesity. To help ensure pilot LGAs had the optimum chance of being successful, additional factors were taken into consideration including capacity to undertake the project. During the selection process the Department was also mindful of the Government’s Social Inclusion agenda and Priority Employment Regions. Where possible, the Department sought to align the invited LGAs with these regions whilst still having regard to the need to ensure the pilot phase had a diverse range of implementation models across a range of population sub groups and geographic locations. In addition, the selected LGAs incorporated the recommendations put forward by the states and territories. As only 12 grants are available in the pilot phase a small group of LGAs meeting the targeting and capacity criteria were invited to apply. (2) A list of the 42 LGAs invited to apply during the Healthy Communities LGA Grants pilot phase is at Attachment A. (3) The first phase of the Healthy Communities Initiative LGA Grants is a pilot and not all potentially eligible LGAs such as Port Macquarie-Hastings, Kempsey and Greater Taree, could have feasibly been invited. The Department of Health and Ageing is keen to ensure the pilot phase trials a diverse range of implementation models across a range of population sub groups and geographic locations.",95,Questions In Writing

(2) In respect of representations he has made on behalf of Securency International Pty Ltd: (a) how many times has he made them, and on whose instruction; (b) when and where did he make them; (c) who was present each time he made them; (d) what was the nature of his representations; and (e) how were his representations received. (3) When did he first become aware of allegations of impropriety by anyone associated with Securency International Pty Ltd, and has he made any representations on the company’s behalf thereafter. (4) What did he do to establish the bona fides of Securency International Pty Ltd before making representations on the company’s behalf. (5) What advice did he receive about the bona fides of Securency International Pty Ltd before and after becoming aware of allegations of impropriety, by whom was it given, on what date(s) and of what nature. (6) What Australian diplomatic assistance was provided to Securency International Pty Ltd, on what date(s), by whom and at what cost. (7) What Austrade assistance was provided to Securency International Pty Ltd, on what date(s) and at what cost. (8) Has he met with staff of Securency International Pty Ltd during his tenure as the Minister for Foreign Affairs; if so, what are their names, on what date(s) and where did he meet them, and what was the nature of the meetings. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (2) and (8) As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have had some engagement with representatives of Securency International Pty Ltd on the following occasions: Securency Managing Director Mr Myles Curtis attended a dinner hosted by me on 26 August 2008 during a visit to Canberra by Brazilian Foreign Minister Amorim. There were 21 attendees at the dinner including members of Minister Amorim’s party, Brazilian and Australian officials, and representatives of Australia’s business and other interests engaged with Brazil. Dinner guests were asked to speak briefly about their organisations’ engagement with Brazil and Mr Curtis spoke about Securency in that context. I raised Securency with Indian Finance Minister Mr Chidambaram in New Delhi on 12 September 2008. Also present at the meeting were Australian and Indian officials. During the meeting, I asked about a possible trial of Securency polymer notes by the Indian Government. Mr Chidambaram responded that the Indian Government was considering whether a trial would proceed. During a visit to Mexico, I attended a lunch hosted by the Australian Ambassador in Mexico City on 18 November 2008. At the lunch, I was introduced to a representative of Securency in Mexico, Dr Jaime Pacreu. There were some 25 people at the lunch, including Mexican Government officials, representatives of the private sector, including Australian companies active in Mexico, and members of the diplomatic corps. During a visit to Santiago de Chile, on 27 August 2009 I attended an Australian Business Club reception at which I was introduced to a representative of Securency in Chile, Mr Guillermo Montt. Present at the reception were some 40 to 50 guests, including representatives of Australian companies active in Chile, other private sector representatives and government officials. There may have been other occasions that I have attended business-related functions at which representatives of Securency have been present. I do not regard the attendance of business-related functions at which Securency representatives have been present as comprising the “making of representations” or “lobbying” on behalf of Securency. (3) I became aware of the allegations against Securency on 23 May 2009. I have made no representations on behalf of Securency since 23 May 2009. (4) and (5) Long-established portfolio procedure has been applied to establishing the bona fides of, and providing assistance to, Securency. For a business to receive the support of the Australian Government, the business must be an Australian business that contributes to the Australian economy; and/or have a reasonable proportion of its workforce employed in Australia. Heads of Mission or posts are asked to judge whether a company meets these criteria when assisting companies overseas. Advice from Austrade assists this assessment, including information Austrade may hold in respect of Australian business registration details, the proportion of Australian ownership, and an assessment of the significance of the net return to Australia from the proposed activity. Securency’s bona fides as an Australian company seeking support for its activities overseas had been established for some time. Ministers and officials of the Australian Government have been making representations on behalf of Securency since the mid-1990s. For example: during a visit to Pakistan from 6 to 10 February 1998, former Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr Downer raised Securency’s interest in selling polymer banknotes with the Pakistani Minister of Finance and the Governor of the State Bank; during a visit to Chile from 5 to 7 September 2001, former Minister for Trade Mr Vaile discussed Securency with Central Bank President Massad; during a visit to Mexico from 7 to 9 September 2002, former Treasurer Mr Costello participated in the media launch of Mexico’s 20 peso polymer note produced with Securency; and during a visit to India from 18 to 19 February 2003, former Minister for Trade Mr Vaile promoted Securency’s polymer banknote technology to then Indian Minister of Finance Singh. (6) and (7) Consistent with the portfolio’s long-established practices, Ministers and officials of the Australian Government, including officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Austrade, have provided advice and assistance to Securency since the mid-1990s. The advice and assistance has been provided in Canberra and at multiple posts. It is not possible to provide a list of every instance of contact between DFAT and Austrade officers and Securency dating back to the mid-1990s, or of the associated cost. The portfolio undertakes advocacy on behalf of Australian commercial interests overseas in a number of ways including: making government to government representations on behalf of the business or industry where: Australian interest is served; and/or barriers to trade exist; facilitating contact between Australian businesses and the host country government and business interests, including through functions, promotional activities and participating in trade missions. Austrade provides services to Securency in line with the agency’s role as the Government’s trade and investment development agency. Securency has contracted Austrade to arrange independent background checks on its network of agents. These checks are typically sourced through local third party service providers. Austrade also has a number of client service agreements to provide general information and marketing support in selected overseas markets, as requested by Securency. The services provided by Austrade to Securency have been in line with those available to all Australian exporters and the majority have been on a fee-for-service basis. Iran: Baha’i Detainees (Question No. 1203) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 8 February 2010: What representations has the Government made to the Iranian Embassy about imprisoned Baha’is in Iran. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Australian Government has raised concerns about the treatment of Baha’is with the Iranian Government on numerous occasions. I ( Mr Smith) raised these concerns with Iran’s Ambassador HE Mr Mahmoud Movahhedi on 11 February 2010. I also discussed the treatment of Baha’is with Iran’s Foreign Minister HE Mr Manuchehr Mottaki in Tokyo on 17 April 2009. Senior officers have raised Australia’s concerns with Ambassador Movahhedi on several occasions, most recently in a meeting on 11 February. Australia’s Ambassador in Tehran has also raised the issue with the Iranian Government at senior officials level on multiple occasions over the past two years. Australia co-sponsored a Canadian resolution on the human rights situation in Iran, which was adopted by a vote in the Third Committee of the United National General Assembly in November 2009, and which specifically addressed Iran’s treatment of Baha’is. Australia raised concerns about human rights in Iran, including treatment of Baha’is, in our National Statement on Human Rights delivered in the UN General Assembly in October 2009. Officials from the Australian Permanent Mission to the United Nations delivered a statement on the human rights situation in Iran during Iran’s appearance before the UN Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review Working Group in Geneva on 15 February 2010. In its statement, Australia recommended Iran ensure that the trials of seven Baha’i community leaders currently in detention were fair and transparent and conducted in accordance with international standards and that Iran amend all legislation that discriminated against minorities. Australia also raised the human rights situation in Iran in our ‘item 4’ statements on country-specific situations of serious concern at each of the three UN Human Rights Council sessions in 2009, referring to Iran’s treatment of Baha’is as a specific concern. Botswana Delegation (Question No. 1204) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 8 February 2010: In respect of the visit by the Botswana Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in June 2009: (1) What was the total number of delegates.

Burma (Question No. 1205) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 8 February 2010: In respect of Australia’s targeted autonomous sanctions against members of the Burmese regime and their associates and supporters, implemented from 24 October 2007: (a) is Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) on the sanction list; if not, why not; and has it been or will it be considered for inclusion; if so, when; (b) can he indicate whether MOGE is under the direct control of Burma’s military dictatorship and a part of the Ministry of Energy; (c) is it a fact that all oil and gas projects in Burma must be in partnership with MOGE; (d) when was the sanction list last reviewed; and (e) when will the sanction list next be reviewed.",96,Questions In Writing
155,Mr Rudd,"I am advised that the answer to the honourable member’s question is as folMr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) is under the direct control of the Burmese regime and is a part of the Ministry of Energy. Details of the arrangements for individual oil and gas projects in Burma are not readily available. Based on the information available, I am advised that in oil and gas projects initiated by foreign companies, MOGE plays a role in representing the Burmese authorities. Australia’s autonomous targeted financial sanctions list in relation to Burma is comprised of named individuals, not entities. I indicated in my Ministerial Statement of 8 February 2010 that the Burma sanctions list announced in October 2008 will remain in operation for the present. Consistent with past practice, any update to the sanctions list will take into account personnel movements in the regime and further information about members of the State Peace and Development Council, ministers, senior military officers, prominent business associates of the regime, and immediate family members of these individuals. Defence: Operational Employment Information Website (Question No. 1210) Mr Robert asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 9 February 2010: How many Army Reserve Officers have accessed the ‘Hot Ops Jobs’ website on the Defence Restricted Network and how many have been deployed as a result of accessing this website. able member’s question: The ‘Hot Ops Jobs’ website no longer exists on the Defence Restricted Network or the Army Internet website. A webpage titled ‘Operational Employment Information’ has replaced the ‘Hot Ops Jobs’ website. It provides guidance to Australian Regular Army members on operational deployments via the Defence Restricted Network. Although Army Reserve Officers are able to view the website, the number of Army Reserve Officers who have accessed the website cannot be determined, as the metrics in place do not provide this particular information. It is also not possible to determine how many Army Reserve members have been deployed as a result of accessing the ‘Operational Employment Information’ website, since the webpage directs members to their individual career managers to discuss their deployment interests. Army Reserve Forces: Audit Report (Question No. 1211) Mr Robert asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 9 February 2010: (1) What progress has been made on implementing the recommendations of Audit Report No. 31 2009-09 ‘Army Reserve Forces’ (The Auditor General, Australian National Audit Office, Canberra, 8 May 2009). (2) What barriers exist to ease movement between the Australian Regular Army and the Army Reserve (paragraphs 2.34 and 2.35 of the report in part (1)), and what is being done to remove them. able member’s question: (1) The Australian National Audit Office Audit Report No. 31 2008-09 Performance Audit Army Reserve Forces was released on 14 September 2009 and detailed the findings of an audit into Army",101,Questions In Writing

157,Mr Combet,"The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourReserve Forces. The audit’s four recommendations and Defence’s progress in responding to these are as follows: Considering the Army Reserve’s current role and the existing work being undertaken towards developing its 2016 Approved Future Force structure, the ANAO recommends the Army reviews its policies related to the location of Army Reserve units to take into account the cost of operating a dispersed organisation against the capability offered and the desire to maintain a public presence. Defence status: Army has completed the Army Reserve Approved Future Force and has grouped it under the ‘Rebalancing Army’ (RBA) initiative. The implementation plan for the RBA initiative is currently being developed and has not yet been provided to Government. Upon completion and approval of the RBA initiative, changes will be implemented supported by a comprehensive change management and communication strategy. The ANAO recommends that Defence uses a periodic assessment of costs to bring together appropriate cost information related to the Army Reserve, to inform longer term decision making. Defence status: Cadet, Reserve and Employer Support Division, in consultation with the Services and Chief Finance Officer Group, is currently developing a baseline data set to determine appropriate cost information of the Reserves to inform longer term decision making. This data set will be the standard for future assessments as a means of calculating the cost of Reserves. It is expected to be finalised by 31 December, 2010. The ANAO recommends that the Army: (a) request current Reservists to provide relevant information relating to their civilian qualifications and skills; (b) where this information is provided, record it on Defence’s existing personnel management database, PMKeyS; and (c) streamline the approval processes for the recognition of civilian skills and qualifications. Defence status: (a) This recommendation was included in the Defence Budget Audit and Defence White Paper 2009. VCDF Group (specifically Cadet, Reserve and Employer Support Division) is the lead agency and is developing a PMKeyS solution on behalf of Defence. Data entry is expected to occur in late 2010, and the project is expected to be complete by 31 December 2011. (b) As per (a) (c) This recommendation is being considered on a limited basis as part of the civil skills database project. However, the Army has commenced reviewing the most appropriate means for recognition and verification of civil skills. Due to the complexities and variations in skill sets, determination on the process for recognition of civilian skills is not expected to be complete before 31 December 2010. Recognising the increased reliance on technology for communication, and the importance of accurate records, the ANAO recommends that: (a) Defence ensures all Army Reservists have adequate access to the Defence Restricted Network; and (b) Defence considers developing an internet portal or similar facility for Army Reservists to facilitate individual’s update of their personnel data. Defence status: (a) Reserve access to the Defence Restricted Internet is currently subject to projects being coordinated by the Information Communication Technology Stream of the Strategic Reform Program. Reserve access to the Defence Restricted Internet will be significantly enhanced during the second half of 2010, with the procurement and release of additional Defence Remote Electronic Access and Mobility Services (DREAMS) tokens as an interim measure. (b) As per (a). (2) The barriers identified by the ANAO largely relate to the differences in conditions of service and entitlements between Australian Regular Army and Army Reserve members, which are reviewed periodically. The Army does not perceive these issues as impediments to movement between different categories of service for all members. However, it may influence the decisions of a small number of personnel. Australian Defence Force: Reserves (Question No. 1216) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, in writing, on 11 February 2010: What proportion of members of the (a) Australian Regular Army discharge and transfer to the Active Reserve, (b) Royal Australian Navy discharge and transfer to the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, and (c) Royal Australian Air Force discharge and transfer to the Air Force Reserve, and what measures has the Government taken to increase the proportions in parts (a) to (c). For transfer rates of permanent Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel to the Reserve component for the past three financial years please refer to the tables below. The honourable member’s question asks specifically of Australian Regular Army discharges and transfers to the ‘Active Reserve’, whereas for the other two Services the honourable members asks of the discharge and transfer to the two Services respective ‘Reserves’, for consistency, additional information has been provided concerning other ‘Reserve’ components of the Australian Army.

The extension of the Graded Officer Pay Scale (GOPS) and Graded Other Rank Pay Scale (GORPS) to Reservists has increased the attractiveness of Active Reserve service to members separating from permanent service. Reserve conditions of service and employment will be reviewed as part of the Strategic Reform Program ‘Reserves Reform Stream’. The intended outcome is to maximise the transfer of separating full time ADF members to Reserves, lengthen the tenure of already trained Reserve members, and attract fresh Reserve members with required core or niche skill sets. High Readiness Reserve (Question No. 1219) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, in writing, on 22 February 2010: In respect of the planned workforce allocation in the 2009-10 budget and forward estimates (Department of Defence, Defence Portfolio Budget Statements, Canberra, Table 18, page 33), (a) what budget has been allocated to achieve a High Readiness Reserve recruitment target of (i) 1080 for the Army, and (ii) 600 for the Air Force, and (b) as at 22 February 2010, how many HRR (i) Army, and (ii) Air Force, reservists have been recruited. (a) (i) and (ii) None, as High Readiness Reserve targets are filled using in-Service personnel only. (b) (i) Army does not directly recruit into the High Readiness Reserve. As at 22 February 2010, 1170 currently serving members of the Active Reserve were contracted to the High Readiness Reserve. (ii) Air Force does not directly recruit into the High Readiness Reserve. As at 22 February 2010, 596 currently serving members of the Active Reserve and 44 members of the Specialist Reservist were serving in the High Readiness Reserve.",104,Questions In Writing
159,Mr Combet,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Army Reserves (Question No. 1220) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, in writing, on 22 February 2010: In respect of the response to question on notice W15 ‘Restructure of the Army Reserves’ (Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, Budget supplementary estimates 2009-2010, 21 October 2009, page 23), has the implementation plan for the Review been completed and provided to the Government; if so, is it publicly available; if so, from where. The implementation plan has not been completed or provided to Government. Defence Indigenous Development Program (Question No. 1222) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Defence Personnel in writing, on 22 February 2010: (1) In respect of the Defence Indigenous Development Program in the 2009-10 budget and forward estimates (Department of Defence, Defence Portfolio Budget Statements, Canberra, page 96), (a) was the pilot course developed by the Army, through Norforce, and run in Katherine in 2009, (b) was the pilot course successfully completed; if so, what are the results of the assessment, (c) will the program be run by Norforce and commence in April 2010 in Katherine; if so, how many Indigenous people are enrolled; if not, by whom will it be run, and when and where will it commence, and (d) when and where will the 2011 program begin, and how many Indigenous people does he anticipate will enrol. (2) What is the breakdown of the $3.308 million budgeted for this program in 2009-10, including the total sum allocated to (a) Norforce, and (b) administration, and the balance remaining for (a) and (b) as at 22 February 2010. (1) In respect of the Defence Indigenous Development Program in the 2009-10 budget and forward estimates (Department of Defence, Defence Portfolio Budget Statements, Canberra, page 96): (a) Yes. (b) Yes, with the following results: (i) 20 trainees participated on the course and 10 trainees graduated on 16 December 2009. (ii) Five graduates achieved the Certificate II in General Education for Adults. The remaining five achieved Certificate I. (iii) All 10 graduates achieved the Certificate II in Rural Operations. (iv) Job placements were identified for the majority of the trainees prior to graduation. (c) The program will be delivered on behalf of Army by NORFORCE, in 2010. Currently 29 trainees are undergoing an orientation program at the Katherine Rural College. (d) It is intended that the 2011 programs will commence in April 2011 in Katherine and Cairns providing places for a similar number of trainees. (2) The $3.308 million budgeted for this program in 2009-10 was broken down by Defence’s Chief Financial Officer Group as follows: (a) The total sum budgeted by Army for NORFORCE to run the pilot course was $1.187 million.

161,Mr Griffin,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:cost of a range of support such as clothing and meals provided during the military training components of the course. (b) The balance of funds allocated to Defence Groups for the ongoing delivery of the Army and Navy components of the program is $1.576 million. As at 22 February 2010 the notional balance is $0.657 million. Defence does not routinely track the specific costs of administrative support across the Groups. Military Superannuation Pensions (Question No. 1223) Mr Windsor asked the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, in writing, on 23 February 2010: What measures will he take, and when, to address the ongoing concerns within the veteran community that (a) the indexation of military superannuation pensions against the Consumer Price Index is not an accurate measure of the cost of living, and (b) inequality exists between the indexing of military superannuation pensions and other pensions such as age and welfare; and will he consider introducing a fairer indexation method for military superannuation pensions in line with that used to calculate age and welfare pensions. (a) The Government recognises the concerns expressed by the veteran community regarding the indexation of military superannuation pensions. In acknowledgement of these concerns the Government commissioned an independent expert review-the Review of Pension Indexation Arrangements in Australian Government Civilian and Military Superannuation Schemes, conducted by Mr Trevor Matthews. The review considered whether the current Consumer Price Index (CPI) indexation methodology for pensions for Australian Government civilian and military defined benefit superannuation schemes should be changed. The report of the review, released on 21 August 2009, recommended no change to the indexation arrangements. Mr Matthews recommended that pensions from the Australian Government civilian and military superannuation schemes continue to be indexed by the CPI as it is the most suitable index to protect pensions against inflationary price increases. The Government fully supports the findings and recommendations of the report. (b) Mr Matthews did not consider it inequitable or unfair that civilian and military superannuation pensions are increased on a different basis to the Age or Service Pensions. He considered that they are different benefits provided for different purposes and therefore can be increased on a different basis. That is, Mr Matthews is drawing a distinction between the obligation of the State to provide an income support safety net to its more disadvantaged citizens and the obligation of the State (as an employer) to provide superannuation to its employees and former employees. Mr Matthews considered that the CPI should be retained as the basis for indexation of civilian and military superannuation pensions, unless a better measure of changes in the cost of living for superannuants becomes available.",106,Questions In Writing
162,Mr Tanner,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Defence Materiel Organisation: Mortimer Review (Question No. 1224) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, in writing, on 23 February 2010: Further to his answer to question No. 1063 (Hansard, 3 February 2010, page 135), in respect of the estimate of costs to implement the Mortimer Review recommendations: can he (a) detail the basis of the proposed expenditure of (i) $69 million over the decade, and (ii) $28 million over the forward estimates; (b) detail the outcomes to date of the expended $0.5 million; and (c) provide an estimate of any savings from the proposed expenditure of $69 million. (1) (a) (i) and (ii) The proposed expenditure of $28 million over the forward estimates and $69 million over the decade provide for the ongoing implementation of the Mortimer reforms. Examples of specific funding requirements include funding the General Manager Commercial position recommended by the Review, the recruitment of a specialist team to provide expert analysis of cost, schedule and risk implications of major project proposals and strengthening the customer supplier agreements between the Department of Defence and the Defence Materiel Organisation. (b) Salary and other personnel-related expenses have accounted for the majority of expenditure to date. For example, the specialist team providing the analysis of cost, schedule and risk implications of major project proposals has been established. (c) The Mortimer (Procurement and Sustainment) stream is one of the ‘non-savings streams’ of the Strategic Reform Program. While direct cost savings are not anticipated, the blueprint document entitled “Strategic Reform Program: Delivering Force 2030” released by Defence on 4 June 2009 notes that the non-savings streams “will help to keep costs down through better quality planning, cost estimation and control”. The Mortimer reforms are a critical enabler of efficiencies in major Defence capital equipment acquisitions and in the through-life support of that equipment. Defence Technical Scholarships (Question No. 1227) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, in writing, on 23 February 2010: (1) In respect of Defence Technical Scholarships, (a) have cadets been given priority access to the initiative (as agreed to by the former Minister in the Defence response to the recommendations of the cadet review, November 2008), if so, why; and (b) how many cadets have (i) applied for, and (ii) been awarded, a scholarship. (2) Do cadets have priority access to other Defence developed, nationally-accredited programs; if so, what are the names of these programs, and how many Australian cadets have (a) applied to enter, and (b) been accepted. (1) (a) No. While the cadet review 2008 recommended that Australian Defence Force Cadets receive priority access to Defence Technical Scholarships (DTS) and similar Defence programs, subsequent advice is that such preferential treatment would undermine the merit basis for the scheme and adversely impact upon the credibility of the scheme within the education sector.",107,Questions In Writing

(2) (a) and (b) Cadets do not have priority access to other Defence developed, nationally-accredited programs beyond those that may have been developed by a cadet organisation for application within that cadet organisation. Defence Materiel Organisation: Tender Process (Question No. 1228) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, in writing, on 24 February 2010: (1) In respect of the tender process within the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) for sourcing uniform material from overseas, can he explain (a) when (i) he, and (ii) the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of DMO, first knew that tenders had been accepted from outside Australia, and (b) why it appears that it took a newspaper article on the issue in the Daily Telegraph to prompt CEO and ministerial action. (2) Why were long-established principles and practices not adhered to during the tender process in part (1). (3) What action is (a) he, and (b) the CEO of DMO, taking to restore checks and balances within the departmental processes for material procurement in the future.

Protection Visas (Question No. 1269) Mr Morrison asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 25 February 2010: In respect of people smuggling, have any charges been laid against permanent protection visa holders concerning (a) the provision of false or misleading statements to Commonwealth officials, and/or (b) obstruction of Commonwealth officials in relation to their inquiries; if so, can he indicate the specific charges and associated outcomes, including penalties. Database records indicate that, up to 1 March 2010, seven permanent protection visa recipients and two humanitarian visa recipients were proven to have committed offences under section 234 Migration Act 1958 for providing forged, false or misleading documents or false or misleading information to Commonwealth officials in connection with immigration or visa application procedures. In each case, criminal penalties were applied but visas were not revoked. There is no offence in the Migration Act 1958 of obstructing a Commonwealth official in their duties. Database records relating to offences contained in other legislation for obstruction of a Commonwealth official do not always indicate whether the charge was related to immigration procedures or people smuggling. Identifying links between general charges for obstruction of a Commonwealth official and immigration or people smuggling is not feasible as it would require manual examination of a large number of prosecution files spanning a number of years.

173,Mr Combet,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Health and Ageing: Voice Over IP Project (Question No. 1274) Mr Dutton asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 25 February 2010: In respect of her department’s Voice Over IP project at the Sirius building at Woden, ACT: (1) What was the total cost of the contract for the project. (2) How many sites and how many handsets were included. (3) What purchasing process was used. (4) Was the project market tested; if not, why not. (5) Did the purchasing process for this contract comply with the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. (6) Which entities submitted tenders or quotations for the contract, and what was the monetary value of these tenders or quotations. (7) Was any verbal or written advice received by her department from any entities or individuals that the market value of the project differed from the contracted price; if so: (a) what was that advice, (b) when was it received, and (c) what response, verbal or written, was provided by the relevant Assistant Secretary and Chief Operating Officer, and on what dates. (8) Did any individual with an interest in the contracted provider for the project act on behalf of her department in the purchase of the contract; if so: (a) what was/is the nature of that interest, (b) when did her department first become aware of it, and (c) what action on this matter has been taken by her department. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The total cost of the contract for the project is $5,020,091. (2) 3 sites in the Woden precinct and 4,400 handsets were included. (3) The procurement was undertaken as a direct source arrangement in accordance with the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines. (4) The project was not market tested. Gartner, an independent information technology research and advisory company, advised that there are a very limited number of suppliers of Voice Over IP (VoIP) equipment and systems. These suppliers and other ICT service providers to the Department were approached to provide an indicative proposal which allowed the Department to assess the indicative market costs of a VoIP solution. (5) Yes. (6) IBM, NEC, AVAYA and Optus submitted proposals. IBM, whose offer was accepted, provided a quotation of $5,074,369. The quotations from NEC, AVAYA and Optus were provided on a Commercial-In-Confidence basis. (7) An additional proposal was received post contract signature from CDM Australia on 2 September 2009. The proposal was a broad solution and did not give sufficient technical detail to provide assurance to the Department that the solution offered would deliver the Department’s requirements. The value of the proposal was $3.911m in Capital, and did not provide costs for ongoing management support and operational costs. The solution provided connectivity for only 3200 staff, 1,100 handsets below the Department’s requirement. The Department did not respond to the vendor. (8) The Department sought appropriate advice in relation to the development of the technical requirements, with decisions around the procurement being undertaken on the basis of that advice by departmental officers. The departmental officers involved in the decision making process do not have any conflicting interests, real or perceived, in relation to the decision outcomes. Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme (Question No. 1276) Mr Dutton asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 25 February 2010: What does her department project the growth rate will be each year over the forward estimates for Medicare dental benefits paid under the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Growth of the previous government’s Chronic Disease Dental Scheme is not projected over the 4 years of the forward estimates. The Government’s policy is to close the scheme as soon as possible in order to implement the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. Private Health Insurance (Question No. 1279) Mr Dutton asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 25 February 2010: What assumptions are used to calculate private health insurance growth rates (a) over the forward estimates, (b) over the next 10 years, and (c) for the period to 2047. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) The Department of Health and Ageing does not project growth rates in private health insurance membership. (b) See (a). (c) See (a). Private Health Insurance (Question No. 1280) Mr Dutton asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 25 February 2010: What number and proportion of individuals are covered by private health insurance by Federal Electorate each quarter from December 2007 to 25 February 2010 for both (a) general, and (b) hospital, cover. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) and (b) The Department does not collect private health insurance data by electorate. The most recent publicly available data on private health insurance participation by electorate is as at 30 June 2001 and was tabled in Parliament in February 2003: www.aph.gov.au/senate/committee/clac_ctte/estimates/bud_0203/vol7doha_feb03.pdf The Private Health Insurance Administration Council (PHIAC) collects data at the state level, which cannot be used to derive electorate level information about private health insurance participation rates. Medicare Australia collects information at the postcode level, however the quality of the data produces unreliable statistics on private health insurance participation, as individuals do not always update their addresses with Medicare when they move. Hospitals (Question No. 1283) Mr Dutton asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 25 February 2010: What was the real and nominal expenditure on public hospitals by the Government each financial year from 1985-86 to 2008-09. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The information requested is publicly available on the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare website using the public hospital recurrent expenditure data cubes. Tables can be selected for Australian Government Public Hospital recurrent expenditure in real (constant) and nominal (current) terms. The information can be accessed using the URLs provided below. 1985-86 to 2002-03: http://d01.aihw.gov.au/cognos/cgi-bin/ppdscgi.exe?DC=Q&E=/expenditure/hex_aust1_2009. 2003-04 to 2007-08: http://d01.aihw.gov.au/cognos/cgi-bin/ppdscgi.exe?DC=Q&E=/expenditure/hex_aust2_2009. 2008-09 data is not available until later this year. Medical Students (Question No. 1285) Mr Dutton asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 25 February 2010: How many Commonwealth-supported medical school university places have been announced by the Government, excluding the additional places agreed at the Council of Australian Governments in April and July 2006. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Government has announced a total of 200 new commencing Commonwealth-supported medical places. This includes 30 new places allocated to the University of Notre Dame’s Fremantle medical school for commencement in 2009, and 160 replacement commencing Commonwealth-supported medical places in 2009 as part of the phase out of domestic fee paying students (rising to 170 commencing places in 2011). Allocation of commencing replacement Commonwealth supported medical places for the phase out of domestic fee paying students Provider 2009 Deakin University 10 Monash University* 60 The Flinders University of South Australia 11 The University of Melbourne 6 The University of New South Wales 12 The University of Newcastle 10 The University of Queensland 25 The University of Sydney 25 The University of Western Sydney1 Grand Total 160 These allocations of new places will grow to 834 medical places as students continue in their courses. In the 2009-10 Budget, the Government announced that from 2012, public universities (and the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education) will be funded on the basis of student demand. Transitional arrangements for 2010 and 2011 are preceding the introduction of the demand driven funding system, with over-enrolment that is funded being lifted from five to ten per cent. During this period the current control on the number of medical places that universities can offer will continue. It is likely that controls on Commonwealth-supported medical places will remain under the new funding system from 2012. However, the demand driven funding system will give the Government the ability to increase the number of medical places universities can offer without introducing new budget measures. The Government’s decisions about Commonwealth-supported medical places will be informed by Health Workforce Australia advice on workforce demand and the capacity for clinical and postgraduate training. Private Health Insurance (Question No. 1286) Mr Dutton asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 25 February 2010: What was the average annual increase in private health insurance premiums each calendar year from 1995 to 25 February 2010. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: 1995-6.00%. 1996-7.00%. 1997-7.00%. 1998-5.00%. 1999-5.00%. 2000-1.80%. 2001-0.01%. 2002-6.88%. 2003-7.40%. 2004-7.58%. 2005-7.96%. 2006-5.68%. 2007-4.52%. 2008-4.94%. 2009-6.02%. 2010-5.78% (note that this increase will generally take effect from 1 April 2010). Health and Ageing: Conferences, Seminars and Training (Question No. 1288) Mr Dutton asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 25 February 2010: Have any staff members or her department cancelled attendance at any conferences, seminars and training events on or after the 21 February 2010; if so, for each conference, seminar and training event cancellation, (a) what was the title, purpose and planned agenda, (b) how many staff were to attend and what was the position title of each staff member, (c) what were the costs to attend per staff member, (d) what were the estimated travel costs, (e) what were the estimated travel costs per staff member, (f) why was attendance cancelled, and (g) what is the itemisation of the total costs incurred by her department Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Department is unable to provide this level of detail as it is not in an aggregated format. Its compilation would involve a significant diversion of resources from other departmental operations, which I am not prepared to authorise. Xenotropic Murine Leukemia (Question No. 1289) Mr Dutton asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 25 February 2010: In respect of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV): (a) what information can her department provide on XMRV and any nexus to other health conditions, (b) are there any tests available in Australia for XMRV, and (c) has her department considered facilitating testing for XMRV in Australia; if so, what was the outcome. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is a human virus that has been found in tumour tissue of patients with prostate cancer and the blood of people with chronic fatigue syndrome. The medical research literature on the topic is equivocal as to whether the virus may play a causative role in these conditions. (b) The Department is not aware of any pathology laboratory that offers testing for this virus in Australia. (c) If such a test were generally considered by the medical profession as necessary to the appropriate treatment of patients then a Medicare benefit would be payable under item 69494 of the Medicare Benefits Schedule. Mr Gao Zhisheng (Question No. 1290) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 9 March 2010: In respect of the three year jail sentence, suspended for five years, of Chinese human rights lawyer Mr Gao Zhisheng who in 2006 was found guilty in a Chinese court of ‘inciting subversion’: (a) is he aware of reports that Mr Zhisheng was taken into custody in February 2008 and that his family has had no contact with him since; and (b) has he or the Australian Embassy in Beijing raised the issue of Mr Zhisheng’s detention with Chinese authorities, as the Embassy of the United States in Beijing has done; if so, what was the outcome; if not, will the Australian authorities raise the issue at the next AustraliaChina Human Rights Dialogue. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) The Government is aware of reports of Mr Gao Zhisheng’s situation. (b) The Australian Embassy in Beijing raised Mr Gao’s situation with Chinese authorities on 13 May 2009, 16 June 2009, 29 September 2009 and most recently on 3 March 2010. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not provided clear advice publicly or privately on Gao Zhisheng’s whereabouts. The Government will continue to raise Mr Gao’s situation directly with Chinese authorities, including in the context of the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue. Mr Dhondup Wangchen (Question No. 1291) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 9 March 2010: In respect of filmmaker Mr Dhondup Wangchen who was arrested in China in March 2008 and later charged with ‘inciting separatism’: (a) can he confirm a Radio Free Asia report of 6 January 2010, that on 28 December 2009, the Xining Intermediate People’s Court found Mr Wangchen guilty of ‘splitting the motherland’ and handed him a six year sentence; (b) will his department seek to clarify the status of Mr Wangchen with the Chinese Government; and (c) can he explain the Australian Government’s position on this issue, and indicate whether the Australian Government will raise the matter with the Chinese Government. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) The Government is aware of media reports that on 28 December 2009, the Xining Intermediate People’s Court found Mr Dhondup Wangchen guilty of “splitting the motherland” and sentenced him to six years in prison. However, the Government has not been able to confirm Mr Dhondup Wangchen’s situation with Chinese authorities. (b) On3 March 2010, the Australian Embassy in Beijing made representations to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on individual cases of concern, including Mr Dhondup Wangchen and sought information on his status, location and condition. (c) While recognising that China has made some progress in human rights over the last 30 years, the Government remains concerned about human rights issues in China, including freedom of speech, freedom of media, freedom of religious worship, open and transparent trials, and the use of the death penalty. The Australian Government raises its concerns with China, including raising individual cases of concern, through bilateral exchanges with senior political leaders and officials, diplomatic channels, and the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue. We will continue to raise Mr Dhondup Wangchen’s situation with the Chinese Government. Weather Watch Radar (Question No. 1296) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, in writing, on 11 March 2010: By what date does the Government propose to install a weather-watch radar to cover the BusseltonAlbany stretch of coastline in WA. Commissioning of the recently installed weather radar at Serpentine and refurbishment of the Albany radar in 2010/11 will improve coverage of the Busselton-Albany coastline. No additional radars are currently planned for that region.",114,Questions In Writing
174,Mr Garrett,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Burma (Question No. 1297) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 11 March 2010: In respect of Australia’s relationship with Burma, (a) since 1 January 2009, has the (i) Australian Navy participated in military exercises with the Burmese Government Navy, and (ii) Australian Government trained military personnel from Burma, if so, does the Minister recognise that such participation in military exercises could be interpreted as training exercises, and (b) does the Australian Government still support the call for a universal arms embargo against Burma. able member’s question: (a) Since1 January 2009: (i) the Royal Australian Navy has participated in two multilateral naval exercises to which Burma was also invited. From 4–8 February 2010, Burma and Australia, along with eleven other countries, participated in Exercise MILAN. This is an Indian-hosted biennial multinational activity that aims to foster cooperation between regional navies on counter piracy and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. In October 2009, the Royal Australian Navy participated in Exercise BERSAMA LIMA under the auspices of the Five Power Defence Arrangement (FPDA). This exercise focuses on the interoperability of the military forces of Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Malaysia and Singapore. Singapore invited all ASEAN members to observe, including Burma. Burmese officials were not permitted to visit ADF ships or aircraft. (ii) no training was provided to Burma by the Royal Australian Navy as part of these exercises. (b) Yes. Australian Wine Sales (Question No. 1298) Ms Marino asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 11 March 2010: What Government programs exist to promote the sale of Australian produced wine. The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation (AWBC) is an Australian government statutory authority established to provide strategic support to the Australian wine sector. Its responsibilities include international and domestic marketing of Australian wine; export regulation and compliance; and maintaining the integrity of Australia’s wine labels and winemaking practices. The AWBC takes the lead role in strategic marketing of Australian wine overseas including the implementation of strategies and activities in key markets and identification of new markets. It operates as Wine Australia in overseas markets and maintains offices in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, Ireland, Japan and China. In addition, the Austrade administered Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme provides financial assistance to aspiring and current exporters. The scheme supports small and medium sized business across a wide range of industry sectors by reimbursing up to 50 per cent of expenses incurred on eligible export promotion (above a $10,000 threshold). For the 2007-08 grant year (2008-09FY), EMDG grants totalling $10.3 million were paid to 249 wine companies that reported exports of $216.5 million.",120,Questions In Writing
175,Mr Combet,The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honour,121,Questions In Writing
176,Mr Burke,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The Winemakers’ Federation of Australia was awarded $77, 000 (GST exclusive) under round one of the Promoting Australian Produce program to implement the Australian Fortified Wines Strategy. The South Australian Wine Industry Association received $56, 896 (GST exclusive) under the Promoting Australian Produce (Major Events) program to stage the 5th Australian Wine Industry Environment Conference and Technical Tour held in Adelaide from 23-24 September 2009. Griffin Coal (Question No. 1299) Ms Marino asked the Minister for Resources and Energy, in writing, on 11 March 2010: As at 11 March 2010, what action has the Government taken with the WA Government, the administrators and unions in relation to the collapse of Griffin Coal; and how will the Government assist affected workers, contractors and business. Mr Martin Ferguson-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Government recognises that Griffin Coal is a significant regional employer in the South West of Western Australia and that any potential closure of its operations would have an adverse impact on not only the employees and their families but the region as well. The Government has been and will continue to closely monitor developments with Griffin Coal. It should be noted that Griffin Coal is in administration and its current operations continue until there is an outcome from the administration process. In the event that a company goes into liquidation, employees of Griffin Coal will be able to seek assistance from the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS). The GEERS assists employees who have lost their jobs and are owed certain employee entitlements when a liquidator or trustee in bankruptcy has been appointed to their employer. Entitlements under GEERS include up to three months unpaid wages for the period prior to the appointment of the insolvency practitioner, unpaid annual leave, unpaid long service leave, up to a maximum of five weeks unpaid payment in lieu of notice and up to a maximum of sixteen weeks unpaid redundancy entitlement. The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations administers GEERS. Healthcare Identifiers (Question No. 1301) Ms Marino asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 11 March 2010: Will the Government categorically guarantee the security of every patient’s information under the proposed e-health system? Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Commonwealth and State Territory Governments have worked with the National E-Health Transition Authority to put in place robust and rigorous security measures to limit as far as possible any potential security risks and to impose significant penalties for unauthorised or inappropriate use of healthcare identifiers held by the Healthcare Identifiers Service. These measures are being implemented through a number of strict security and privacy protectionsboth in the legislation and the technical design of the HI Service. These include: The Federal Privacy Commissioner’s role has been extended in the HI legislation so that she has the authority to conduct investigations into the inappropriate use of healthcare identifiers. The information maintained by the HI Service has been strictly limited to Name, Date of Birth, Sex, and Healthcare Identifier number in most instances, with other information such as Address and Birth Order only recorded when necessary to administrators and the Service. Individuals who wish to use anonymous healthcare will still be able to continue to do so and pseudonyms may be issued by the HI Service in special circumstances. The system design does not allow for an identified healthcare provider, that is, an individual provider that has been assigned a HPI-I or an organisation assigned a HPI-O to “browse” the records held by the Service Operator. A request by an identified healthcare provider for a patient’s identifier will only reveal an IHI when there is an exact match with patient information provided by the healthcare provider. Each time a record held by the Service Operator is accessed by an identified healthcare provider, the details of who has accessed the record and when, will be recorded in an audit log. Medicare Australia will be the initial operator of the HI Service. As a trusted government authority, Medicare has the national infrastructure, as well as the industry and community relationships needed to securely deliver and maintain the healthcare identifiers. As a statutory agency, Medicare Australia is governed by national legislation that sets out the scope of the functions it can perform and the privacy and security it must maintain for the personal information it holds. Medicare Australia has established additional preventative measures including education and training for all Medicare Australia staff members, a proactive audit program, and having a range of actions in place (including fines and dismissal) for handling privacy and security breaches. Defence Site: Maribyrnong (Question No. 1303) Mr Robert asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 11 March 2010: In respect of the former Maribyrnong Defence Site: (a) what chemicals were used in the making of Defence armaments at the site; (b) where will the contaminated soil from the site be disposed of; (c) what is the estimated cost of remedying the site; and (d) what future land development projects will be undertaken on the site after it has been decontaminated. able member’s question: (a) The following chemicals were used in the making of Defence armaments at the Maribyrnong site: Soda ash, Phenols, Sulphate, Sulphite, Hydrochloric acid, Ferrocyanides, Calcium chloride, Sodium fluoride, Methyl orange (acid-base indicator), Hydrogen peroxide, Sodium hydroxide, Nitric acid (weak), Iodine, Nitric acid (strong), Tetrachloromethane, Mercury, Sodium carbonate, Sulphuric acid (weak), Pyridine, Sulphuric acid (strong), Carbon tetrachloride, Thiocyanates, Glycerine/Glycerol, Ethyl alcohol, Ammonium carbonate, Sodium chlorate, Calcium carbonate, Calcium nitrate, Caustic soda, Hydroxylamine, Gun Cotton Mixed Acid, Acetic acid, Mixed acid, Ethanol, Acetaldehydes, cotton, paper, additives, Nitroglycerine, Nitrocellulose, Acetone, Candelilla wax, Potassium cryolite, Lead salicylate, Potassium nitrate, Carbamite, Benzene, Mononitrotoluene, Toluene, Mononitrobiuret, Sodium sulphite, Methylated spirit, Magnesium carbonate, sulphur, iron filings, Trinitrotoluene (TNT), Aluminium powder, Amatol, Baratol, “Research Department” explosive (RDX), Minol, Tetryl, beeswax, Ammonium nitrate, paint, Toluene diisocyanate, Trioctylphosphinic oxide, lubricants and corrosion preventatives, plastics and rubbers, varnishes and lacquers, insulants, Cellulose acetate, Lead salts, Polyurethane, Solventless cordite, Cast composite propellant, Cast double base propellant, Extruded double base propellant, Plastic propellant, explosives and explosive compositions, Polybutadiene, inhibitors, Ammonium styphnate, Ammonium perchlorate, alcohol, Wet fulminate, Mercury nitrate, Fulminate, Lead nitrate, Styphnic acid, Sodium azide, Lead acetate, Dextrin, 4:6 Dinitroresorcinol, Industrial methylated spirit, Sodium nitrate, Azide acid, Sodium carboxyl-methyl cellulose, Mercury fulminate, Lead azide, Lead 2:4 Dinitroresorcinol, Silver azide, Barium styphnate, Tetrazene, shellac, Magnesium styphnate, Lead",121,Questions In Writing

(d) The development of the land post-remediation will be the responsibility of the Victorian Government, which is the purchaser of the land. The Victorian Government has publicly indicated the land will be developed for a range of purposes, including housing, community facilities, and open space. Immigration: Health Assessments (Question No. 1306) Mr Morrison asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 15 March 2010: In respect of health tests for visa applicants, (a) what mandatory disease testing is undertaken for each class of visa granted, and (b) are tests undertaken for Hepatitis B and C; if so, for what visa classes; if not, why not. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: Background. The health assessments carried out for visa applicants are designed to support the purposes of the visa health requirement, which are to: protect the Australian community from public health and safety risks; contain public expenditure on health care and community services; and safeguard the access of Australian citizens to health care and community services that are in short supply. Active tuberculosis (TB) is the only condition that in itself will prevent the grant of a visa to Australia as it is specifically mentioned in the regulations and is also considered to be a “threat to public health”. The minimum health assessments required for each class of visa are set out below. The Department can request further formal health assessments for any individual visa applicant where there is also a good reason to do so. Persons seeking to come to Australia can apply for either a Permanent or a Temporary visa. Required tests: Permanent visas. All applicants for a Permanent visa (including those seeking a Humanitarian or refugee visa), are required to undertake as a minimum, a medical examination, a chest X-ray (if 11 years or older) and an HIV test (if 15 years or older). If there are clinical indications of other diseases or conditions or the applicant declares they have a condition or disease then a Medical Officer of the Commonwealth may request additional tests. This could include testing for Hepatitis B and/or C. For children under 11 years old or for pregnant applicants from low or medium risk countries a medical examination may be undertaken in place of the chest x-ray.",123,Questions In Writing
178,Mr Mcclelland,"The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has provided the followRequired tests: temporary visas The types of medical tests required for an applicant for a temporary visa depend on three factors: (1) Their country of Citizenship and the level of TB risk associated with that country. (2) The length of time they intend to stay in Australia. (3) The activities they intend to undertake while in Australia. The requirements can range from no testing, to only a chest X-ray, to a chest X-ray and medical examination. If there are clinical indications of other diseases or conditions or the applicant declares they have a condition or disease then a Medical Officer of the Commonwealth may request additional tests. Country of Citizenship. The Department uses a Health Assessment Matrix that places all countries into one of three risk categories for TB; lower, medium, higher. The placement of countries is determined by their TB prevalence rates as provided by the World Health Organisation and is reviewed annually. Length of Stay The longer the intended stay in Australia the more likely an applicant will need to do additional medical tests. For example an applicant from a higher risk country for a stay of less than 3 months generally will not require any health assessment. However, if the applicant wishes to stay more than 3 months a chest x-ray will be required Intended activities in Australia There are a number of activities that are deemed to be of ‘special significance’ in terms of the potential risk an applicant may pose. In general, unless there are clinical indications of other diseases or conditions or the applicant declares they have a condition or disease, applicants may undertake a chest X-ray, or chest X-ray and medical examination and/or blood testing. Those intending to study, work or train to be a doctor, dentist, paramedic or nurse must undergo HIV, Hepatitis B and C blood testing in addition to a medical and chest x-ray. This is regardless of their country of citizenship or intended period of stay. Pregnant applicants who are intending to give birth in Australia are required to undertake a Hepatitis B test. Pregnant applicants from medium or higher risk countries intending to give birth in Australia are required to undertake a chest x-ray. Pregnant visa applicants from lower risk countries would be required to undertake a chest x-ray if they intended to work in a health care facility or child care centre. However as the Australian Government does not recommend the taking of chest x-rays during pregnancy, applicants from lower or medium risk countries are able to undergo a medical examination in lieu of the chest x-ray. Higher risk pregnant visa applicants (both onshore and offshore) are generally required to defer the chest x-ray – and therefore finalisation of the visa – until after the child’s birth. Mandatory Hepatitis B and C Testing The Department does not routinely test all visa applicants for Hepatitis B or C as this would not be practical nor is it considered necessary to achieve the aims of the health requirement. The Department obtains advice from and works with the Department of Health and Ageing to determine which visa applicants require mandatory Hepatitis B and C testing. The table below lists visa applicants who are required to undertake Hepatitis B or C testing (or both). Type of Applicant Hepatitis B Hepatitis C surface antibody antigen test test Pregnant women Yes No Children for adoption Yes No Children who have been, or are to be, adopted by Australian residents. Unaccompanied minor refugee children Yes No High-risk applicants Yes Yes any person whom the panel doctor considers to be at high risk of hepatitis B or C infection. persons with a history of hepatitis, jaundice or blood transfusions, persons showing clinical evidence of hepatitis B or C infection, persons with tattoos if extensive or suspected as having been done in un-sterile conditions. Hospital and health care workers Yes Yes All temporary visa applicants intending to work as, or study to be a doctor, nurse, paramedic or dentist. Pregnant visa applicants intending to deliver in Australia are tested for Hepatitis B. This is because Hepatitis B is a potentially serious viral infection that a mother may transmit to her baby at, or around the time of birth. Infants who are infected during birth are at high risk of becoming chronic carriers of the disease. This significantly increases their risk of developing chronic liver disease, which may cause premature death. If the mother is diagnosed with Hepatitis B before the baby is born, the newly born infant can receive appropriate immunisation in the delivery room. Doctors, dentists, nurses and paramedics are required to be tested for Hepatitis B and C as well as HIV. All health care workers who have Hepatitis B or C or HIV are asked to confirm whether they will be performing certain procedures known as exposure prone procedures (EPPs). If their duties will include EPPs, the applicants will not meet health for the grant of a visa as they are considered a risk to public health.

(b) No. The Australian Government does not direct the AFP to investigate matters. The AFP is an independent statutory body of government and the decision on whether to investigate an allegation is a matter for the AFP. On 29 January 2010, Japanese authorities referred a number of incidents between SSCS marine vessels and Japanese whaling vessels to the AFP which allegedly occurred during the current whaling season. The AFP commenced preliminary inquiries into these allegations in accordance with Australia’s obligations under the SUA Convention. Australia was bound to undertake those inquiries when the MV Steve Irwin and the MV Bob Barker docked in Hobart on 6 March 2010. (c) AFP Manager Special Operations authorised the investigation. The execution of search warrants upon the MV Steve Irwin and MV Bob Barker on 6 March 2010 was an operational decision of the AFP. (2) No. As the Japanese whaling vessels have not entered Australia’s jurisdiction international obligations do not exist. Consequently, the AFP has no basis upon which it can undertake preliminary inquiries in accordance with our domestic responsibilities.

(2) When is the program scheduled for completion. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) As you are aware, a key element of the Government’s $2.2 billion investment in the Digital Education Revolution (DER) is $2.1 billion for the National Secondary School Computer Fund (the Fund). The Fund will assist schools to provide for new ICT for secondary students in Years9 to 12. The overall aim of the Fund is to achieve a 1:1 computer to student ratio for students in Years9 to 12 in Australian secondary schools by 2011. Of the schools you requested information about, 14 currently enrol students in Years9 to 12 and are eligible for assistance under the Fund. The table below provides information about the school, the number of computers approved through the application rounds of the Fund and the number of computers installed as at 15 March 2010.

In some instances schools were able to negotiate bulk purchasing arrangements with computer providers and were able to purchase more computers than the number for which they were allocated funding. Funding to reach a 1:1 ratio by December 2011 is now being provided on a per capita basis through a National Partnership with the Government sector and through Funding Agreements with the nongovernment sector.
