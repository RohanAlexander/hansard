House adjourned at 11.00 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Centrelink Offices: Queensland (Question No. 1433) Mr Bevis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 12 April 2000: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1071 (Hansard, 17 February 2000, page 13751), did the 16 redundancies at the Wynnum office occur at the same time. (2) What distinction is made between the 7 bona fide and 9 non-bona fide redundancies. (3) Who made the decision to offer either bona fide or non-bona fide redundancies. (4) On what basis were the 9 employees offered the non-bona fide redundancy. (5) Has the Wynnum office recruited new staff since May 1999; if so, have any of those new staff been employed to perform the same duties as those 9 non-bona fide redundant employees. (6) Was a decision made to make the 9 non-bona fide employees bona fide redundancies. (7) Was any ruling or advice sought from the Australian Taxation Office in relation to the manner in which the 9 non-bona fide redundancies were to be treated; if so, what was that ruling/advice. (8) When were the 9 non-bona fide redundancy employees advised that their redundancies would be treated as non-bona fide. following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) No. The voluntary redundancies took place over the period May 1998 to July 1999. (2) Redundancies in Centrelink are determined in accordance with the 1999-2002 Centrelink Development Agreement (page 88). Fourteen of the 16 were offered voluntary redundancies in accordance with the criteria: “The services of the employee cannot be effectively used because of technological or other changes in the work methods of Centrelink or changes in the nature, extent or organisation of the functions of Centrelink” (point 2, section 36). This criteria defines a ‘non-bona fide’ redundancy. A bona fide redundancy is where the officer’s position is excess to requirements or the officer’s position has been moved to another locality and the officer is unwilling to move. In the case of the Wynnum CSC, only two of the 16 redundancies met the latter criteria. The remainder were offered as non-bona fide redundancies. In preparing this further advice, investigations at the area level have indicated that there was an error in the original breakdown in the classification of bona and non-bona fide redundancies at Wynnum as advised in my response to question no 1071. However, all staff were provided with a correct written estimate of their final payments, including taxation liability, prior to their accepting the redundancy. (3) The Area Manager, Brisbane. (4) See answer to question 2. (5) Yes. In the period from 1 January 1998, 22 staff have been recruited to the Wynnum/Capalaba CSC, seven of these since May 1999. These staff are performing the work of those staff who accepted non-bona fide redundancies as well as of other staff who exited Centrelink during this period for other reasons. (6) It was the intention that the 14 redundancies offered to officers be non-bona fide redundancies and no decision was made to change them. (7) Advice was sought from the Australian Taxation Office which in part stated “In the situation covered by paragraph (b), the job is still there and the employee will be replaced by another employee to do the work. The situation therefore does not meet the criteria to qualify as a bona fide redundancy”. (8) All CSO’s were advised by the CSC Manager or Assistant Manager that the basis of the redundancy offer was paragraph (b) ‘not adapting well to change’ and therefore non-bona fide. In all cases these discussions took place before the officers accepted redundancy offers.",121,Atsic So He Is Confident That He Is Right Australians Are Simply Not Finding Their Way

(2) Has the briefing been cancelled or postponed; if so, why.

Petrol Prices: Competition (Question No. 1487) Mr Andren asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 9 May 2000: (1) In response to my question without notice (Hansard, 12 April 2000, page 15119) regarding transparency in wholesale petrol pricing, did he say that when the recommendation of the ACCC was put to the Australian Senate to deregulate the petroleum industry at the retail level, it was opposed by a political party which was more interested in keeping up differential rates for rural and regional people than in acting on that recommendation and bringing the differential down; if so, was the legislation to which he referred the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 1998. (2) If so, (a) did that legislation pass the House of Representatives on 11 March 1999, (b) was it introduced to the Senate on 22 March 1999 and (c) does it remain on the Senate Notice Paper under Government Business, undebated and not voted on; if so, does he stand by his statement in response to my question; if not, (d) to which legislation was he referring and (e) how was it opposed by the Senate. (1) Hansard (12 April 2000, page 15119) contains an accurate record of my response to your question without notice. The legislation to which I was referring was the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 1998. (2) (a) Yes. (b) Yes. (c) Yes: Following the return from the 1999 winter recess, the Government held extensive negotiations with the non-Government parties in the Senate on its reform package and associated Repeal Bill. The non-Government parties would not agree to the passage of the Repeal Bill at that time. At the same time the Government sought to implement part of the reform package through a temporary increase in BP’s quota under the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act by way of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.2). In September 1999 Labor and the Democrats combined to disallow these Regulations, making reference to their desire to retain the Sites Act for at least another two years. As a result of the non-Government parties’ decision to oppose the reform package and associated Repeal Bill and their vote to disallow regulations associated with the deregulation of the petroleum industry at the retail level, the Government has decided not to proceed with the Repeal Bill until the major participants in the industry agree on the petroleum reform package.

The sale of a mobile home or a manufactured home used for residential accommodation will not be subject to GST if it is sold by an individual who is not engaged in the enterprise of selling mobile homes or manufactured homes. This is how the majority of used mobile homes and established manufactured homes are expected to be sold. Established manufactured or demountable housing comes within the definition of residential premises and will be input taxed on sale if it is affixed to land. Supplies of demountable buildings that are not residential premises will not be subject to GST unless sold in the course of an enterprise that is carried on. Rivers: Water Flows (Question No. 1495) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 9 May 2000: (1) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to the Australian Conservation Foundation Report in Habitat Australia 2000 concerning the Snowy River. (2) Have water savings in the Murray-Darling generated by the expenditure of tens of millions of Natural Heritage Trust dollars been used to increase the flow of the Murray-Darling, or have they been used to allow expansion in irrigated agriculture. following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) Natural Heritage Trust projects with the potential to generate water savings are those funded through the Murray-Darling 2001 Program and the National Landcare Program. These projects aim at improving water use efficiency either on or off-farm. Eligible activities for Trust funding include: . improved on-farm irrigation management practices . installation of more efficient on-farm irrigation systems . refurbishment or upgrading of off-farm water delivery systems . recycling of drainage water . demonstration activities on farms and training and education courses. It is also relevant that any expansion of irrigated agriculture can only take place within the water allocations available under the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council ‘Cap’ on diversions. Most Natural Heritage Trust projects submitted for funding by the Basin community have been dominated by issues of water quality; control of water-tables to manage salinity and associated downstream impacts; riverine corridor restoration and protection; and improved aquatic habitat. The Murray-Darling 2001 Program has recently developed a new Irrigation and Water Use Efficiency component, which has as objectives: encouraging adoption of improved irrigation management practices; improving distribution system efficiency and security of water supply to irrigators; improving the management of water reuse systems; and providing additional water for environmental flows.

These 13 week outcomes are referred to as interim outcomes. From1 May 1998 to 19 May 2000, a total of 4648 interim outcomes payments were made for the placement of job seekers into education or training. (b) From1 May 1998 to 19 May 2000, a total of 68 287 interim outcomes payments were made for the placement of job seekers into employment. The placement into a job which ""4anchors"" such a 13 week outcome may be eligible for a payment under Job Matching arrangements. (3) Education and training placements are 6.4 percent of interim outcomes. (4) and (5) Accredited training is not a separate service within Job Network. Job Network members are not required to account for expenditure on various forms of assistance to clients. The department cannot, therefore, report on expenditure on accredited training within Job Network.

172,Mr Abbott,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,130,Sodprops And Other Over The Water 6 65
173,Mr Truss,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) The Dairy Regional Assistance Program (Dairy RAP) is but one component of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Package. Under Dairy RAP, there is no specific allocation on a state by state basis. Funding allocations will therefore be assessed nationally in the light of the numbers and types of funding requests received, the information provided by the proponents in their applications and the advice from their respective Area Consultative Committee(s). (2) Procedures for application and funding for the program are currently being developed between my department and the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. I understand that applications for the Dairy Regional Assistance Programme will take essentially the same form as those under the existing Regional Assistance Program, administered by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. (3) The Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business is developing, in consultation with my department, a process for consideration of applications. Initial applications will need to be lodged through Area Consultative Committees. Area Consultative Committees, which work in partnership with government, business and the community will put forward for consideration applications which demonstrate the capacity to create sustainable regional employment opportunities and/or services that lead to ongoing regional benefits. Centrelink: Contracts with IBM (Question No. 1566) Mr Tanner asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 29 May 2000: (1) Since1 July 1999, what contracts have been signed between Centrelink and IBM.

Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation: Research Facilities Closure (Question No. 1570) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 29 May 2000: (1) Does the Minister support the closure of the CSIRO research facility at Prospect. (2) When did the Minister first become aware of a report into the CSIRO’s Livestock Research Infrastructure. (3) When did the Minister first become aware of proposals to close the CSIRO research facility at Prospect. (4) Have there been discussions between the Minister’s Department and Boral Quarries at Prospect; if so, what was the (a) date and (h) nature of the discussions. (5) Have arrangements been made in regard to the future use of the site by Boral Quarries or any other company. (6) What plans have been made for the future usage of the site. (7) Was there a $12 million upgrade of the CSIRO Prospect facility in 1995; if so, what specific areas of the site were upgraded and what was the individual cost of each area upgraded. (8) What sum of Commonwealth funding was allocated to the CSIRO research facility at Prospect in (a) 1990-91, (b) 1991-92, (c) 1992-93, (d) 1993-94, (e) 1994-95, (f) 1995-96, (g) 1996-97, (h) 199798, (i) 1998-99 and (j) 1999-2000. (9) Did the Minister receive advice detailing the closure of the CSIRO’s research facility at Prospect; if so, (a) on what date was the advice received and (b) did the advice state that the closure of the facility would (i) involve the loss of highly skilled research staff currently stationed at Prospect and result in the closure of the several research programs owing to the loss of key scientific expertise, (ii) at the least, incur months of disruption to research programs of national importance to the $7 billion Livestock Industry that would affect producers across Australia and (iii) cut established links between the CSIRO’s Prospect facility and the animal nutrition, pig and dairy industries in the Greater Sydney region. (10) What sum of Commonwealth money has been appropriated to allow for relocation for staff and equipment, recruitment of new staff and redundancy packages for staff from the Prospect site. answer to the honourable member’s questions: (1) CSIRO’s decision to close the Prospect facility flows from recommendations by a committee of senior industry representatives in a Review of Livestock Research Infrastructure commissioned in",131,Sodprops And Other Over The Water 6 65
175,Mr Moore,"The Minister for Industry, Science and Resources has provided the followingDecember 1999 by the Organisation’s Chief Executive. CSIRO’s response to this report is a matter for CSIRO. (2) CSIRO advised the Minister about the deliberations of the Review of Livestock Research Infrastructure on 14 April 2000. (3) On 14 April 2000, CSIRO advised the Minister that the Review Team was considering recommending that CSIRO’s research facility at Prospect be closed. CSIRO’s decision to accept the Review recommendation that the Prospect research facility be closed was communicated to the Minister on 15 May 2000. (4)(a)(b) In 1998/99 Boral initiated a State Environment Planning Policy 59 proposal for redevelopment of its site for employment and residential uses. In 1998 CSIRO lodged a proposal with Holroyd Council for the rezoning of 18 hectares of the Prospect site which was surplus to requirements. This area, about one third of the total site area, has been designated for disposal once rezoning is approved. The Boral site is adjacent to CSIRO’s Prospect site and, as two adjoining owners with concurrent planning proposals, CSIRO and Boral were required to reach agreement on joint access and services to the development areas. CSIRO had a number of discussions with Boral in late 1999 and early 2000 on a possible Boral lease of a building in CSIRO’s Prospect site (Building 35). This lease did not proceed. (5) No. CSIRO does not have any arrangements or agreements with Boral or any other company about the future use of CSIRO’s Prospect site. (6) Other than the disposal of the 18 hectares of land surplus to requirements (see response to Q 4) CSIRO has not made any plans for the future use of the balance of the Prospect site. A property strategy is being developed by CSIRO and its equity partner, the Woolmark Company, on the future use of the balance of the site. (7) A total of $9.2 million was expended in 1994/95 on facilities at Prospect comprising: a new facility for the McMaster Laboratory at a cost of $4.5 million refurbishment of certain existing facilities including the library, theatrette, climate control building, post mortem facility and animal house at a total cost of $4.7 million. (8) Funding has not been specifically allocated to the Prospect site. In CSIRO funds are allocated to programs and not sites. CSIRO Animal Production has had staff located at up to nine different sites over the last decade and some programs are carried out on several of these sites. Commonwealth funding allocated to CSIRO’s Division of Animal Production as a whole, is: (a) 1990-91$11.5 million (b) 1991-92$12.6 million (c) 1992-93$15.8 million (d) 1993-94$14.2 million (e) 1994-95$13.8 million (f) 1995-96$17.8 million (g) 1996-97$16.6 million (h) 1997-98$15.6 million (i) 1998-99$14.8 million (j) 1999-2000$15.5 million (9) (a) CSIRO advised the Minister in writing on 15 May 2000 of its decision to accept the Review Committee’s recommendation that the Prospect site be closed. (b) (i) CSIRO advised the Minister that all staff at Prospect would be offered relocation with their jobs to other CSIRO sites and that it aims to maximise the number of staff that transfer to other locations by taking all practical measures to provide attractive relocation packages and minimise the stress of relocation. CSIRO also advised that, despite this, some staff might be unable to relocate and will instead opt for redundancy. (ii) Advice from CSIRO noted the possibility of short to medium term disruption to some research groups, possibly including the loss of work areas to CSIRO. (iii) An Implementation Team has been commissioned by CSIRO to ensure the orderly withdrawal from the Prospect site and to ensure the most appropriate relocation destinations for research groups into order to maintain and extend their industry links. (10) No additional Commonwealth money has been appropriated for this purpose. South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement: Garments from Fiji (Question No. 1574) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 29 May 2000: (1) Will proposed changes to the South Pacific regional trade and economic cooperation agreement allow garments made in Fiji from non-Australian woven fabric to be provided duty free into Australia. (2) Does this have the potential to adversely affect Australian manufacturers in the wool weaving and conversion industries. (3) What action will the Minister take to ensure manufacturers like ADA in Bendigo are not disadvantaged by the changes. answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The proposed new arrangements provide for preferential access for TCF goods produced in Forum Island Countries (including Fiji), and incorporates a change in the method for utilising local area content for TCF goods. The local area content of a product is the input from Australia, New Zealand or Forum Island Countries. This new approach broadens the range of products able to be produced economically in a Forum Island Country. (2) The Minister’s intention is that the proposed new scheme will not disadvantage Australian textile producers and he has instructed his Department accordingly. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources has had extensive and ongoing consultation with industry to discuss the nature of the scheme. (3) Representatives of ADA in Bendigo have been involved in the consultation process and their concerns will be taken into account in the finalisation of the new scheme. Visas: Visitors (Question No. 1584) Mr Sciacca asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 30 May 2000: (1) What are the official figures for the total number of visitor visa applications received and the number of applications refused during each year since 1994-95 by departmental posts in (a) Albania, (b) Bangladesh, (c) Bosnia, (d) Bulgaria, (e) Burma, (f) Cambodia, (g) Chile, (h) China, (i) Colombia, (j) Croatia, (k) Czech Republic, (l) Ecuador, (m) El Salvador, (n) Ethiopia, (o) Egypt, (p) Fiji, (q) Greece, (r) Hungary, (s) India, (t) Iran, (u) Iraq, (v) Israel, (w) Jordan, (x) Laos, (y) Lebanon, (z) Lithuania, (aa) FYR Macedonia, (ab) Nepal, (ac) Pakistan, (ad) Peru, (ae) The Philippines, (af) Poland, (ag) Romania, (ah) Russia, (ai) Sri Lanka, (aj) Syria, (ak) Tonga, (al) Turkey, (am) The Ukraine, (an) Uruguay, (ao) Vietnam, (ap) Western Samoa and (aq) Yugoslavia. (2) For each post referred to in part (1), how many visa applications were (a) received and (b) rejected from applicants aged (i) between 20 and 30 years of age, (ii) between 30 and 40 years of age, (iii) between 40 and 50 years of age, (iv) between 50 and 60 years of age and (v) 60 years of age and over.",132,Sodprops And Other Over The Water 6 65
176,Mr Moore,"The Minister for Industry, Science and Resources has provided the following(3) What are the official figures for the total number of visitor visa applications received and the number of applications refused during each year since 1994-95 by departmental posts in (a) United States and (b) United Kingdom. (4) For each post referred to in part (3), how many visa applications were (a) received and (b) rejected from applicants aged (i) between 20 and 30 years of age, (ii) between 30 and 40 years of age, (iii) between 40 and 50 years of age, (iv) between 50 and 60 years of age and (v) 60 years of age and over. (5) For each post referred to in parts (1) and (3), how many applications for visitor visas in each age group were refused on the grounds that the applicant fitted into one of the categories on the High Risk Factor List. (1) The honourable member will know that the Australian Government does not have posts in all of the countries listed in his question. However, all the data available at this time is included in TableA below. Until November 1998 the Department could only report on refusals by Post, and this was not always indicative of citizenship. From that time the Department has been able to report on refusals by citizenship and accordingly I have also included data, at TableB below, on applications and refusals by citizenship for calendar years 1999 and 2000 (to 31 May). (2) Data on the age and sex of visitor visa applicants is not readily available for reporting purposes at present however systems development work is currently underway to enable data to be easily extracted and reported upon. I have asked officers of my Department to continue to advance this work and provide these statistics to the honourable member when they become available. Given the current position of the systems development, it is not possible to estimate when this information might be available. (3) The honourable member will be aware of the difficulty in making comparisons between the countries discussed in question 1 and the USA and UK. US and UK citizens are eligible, along with the nationals of 31 low risk countries worldwide, to be granted an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) if they are not listed on the Movement Alert List. Visitor visas, including ETAs, granted to UK and USA nationals during the period requested are included in TablesA and B. (4) See (2) above. (5) Public Interest Criterion 4011 (the “risk factor”) requires any visitor visa applicant who falls within certain age and sex cohorts to demonstrate to the decision-maker that “there is very little likelihood that the applicant will remain after the expiry of any period during which the applicant might be authorised to remain after entry.” While I can state the number of visa applications rejected, the department does not record the reasons for those rejections in a way that can be accessed by the Department’s reporting systems. I can, however, state that the risk factor list is not used to automatically exclude applicants. It operates simply as an “alert” to decision-makers of the potential for continued stay in Australia and requires the applicant to provide a higher level of evidence to support their claim that they are only intending to visit Australia. An applicant will be rejected where they fail to satisfy a decision-maker that a genuine visit is intended.

Foreign Aid: Possible Fraud (Question No. 1586) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 31 May 2000: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the Vietnamese newspaper Lao Dong in November 1999, which alleged fraud by a Vietnamese Government official of $16 000 in Australian aid to the Vietnamese Education Department’s Industry and Education Centre for the production of an ecology text book. (2) Has he made representations to the Vietnamese Government regarding the alleged fraud; if so, what. (3) Has the $16 000 been recovered; if not, what is the status of the investigation. (1) Yes, I am aware that on 22 November 1999 an article appeared in the Lao Dong newspaper in which two allegations of mis-use of DAP funding were made against an individual in the National Centre for Education Technology (NCET). In 1994, the Australian Embassy in Hanoi allocated US$10 000 (AU$13 937) for an Environment Education in Primary Schools project to the NCET. The funds were to develop an environmental education curriculum for primary schools. The Embassy received a receipt from NCET on 12 May 1994 for US$10 000.
