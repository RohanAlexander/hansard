While I have no objection to my merits as a chorister being proclaimed, I hold that a paragraph like this should at least be correct. It may be very good propaganda to say that honourable members on this side of the House sing songs which some regard as objectionable, but the writer should be correct in his statements. It is true that we sang "" There'll be pie in the sky when we die,"" and even if the words of the song may be regarded as offensive, the melody is most enchanting.

MrA . GREEN repudiate the statement in the Sydney Sun. No one in the party room sang "" The Eed Flag.""

A t the same time honourable members in the party room sang "" The Song of Australia,"" ""Labour's H y m n "" and other songs. We did so because we are a party with inspiration. suggest to the honourable member that he should confine himself to the particular point upon which he°claims to have been misrepresented. MrA . GREEN Speaker, you recognize that a paragraph of this kind going abroad unchallenged is likely .to affect my party politically, although it w ill not affect me personally, electorate. I say, therefore, that I resent anything of this kind, because it w ill give an opportunity to some honourable members to utilize the episode as propaganda. That was done by the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) and others at a previous election. ber when making a personal explanation must, so f a r as possible, confine himself to a statement regarding the misrepresentation of which he complains, and must not enter into an argument upon debatable matter nor make a suggestion im plicating any one else. To do so might provoke an explanation in reply, and that might possibly lead to something in the nature of a debate. MrA .

Sent to England, in hospital there for six months, they could not find out what able member for Reid w ill recollect that was wrong with me or where I was wounded. some years ago I promised to review, I pointed out to the doctors where I thought personally, all cases presented to me by I was wounded, but they, used to only laugh any and say it was only a scratch. After a hard battle with the Medical Board, I was' invalided home to Australia as unfit, was kept brought .. cases under The honourable in the Military Hospital in Sydney for observation. I was discharged as unfit for further service. I was put on 50 per cent, pension, on my military discharge it stated I desire to ask the I was discharged through a crushed chest. I was kept on 50 per cent pension for about twelve months, then reduced to 5s. a week, and shortly after, my pension was cut right out as the Repatriation doctors said that I was quite all right, so I had to take their word, but all tlie time. I was in the same state of health as wlien I returned to Australia. I kept going as well as I could until October 1926, when I was taken to hospital I ask the Prime and x-rayed. The x-ray report was a steelcoated bullet to right of my spine. I had the bullet removed at the Military Hospital, Randwick. I put a claim in to the Repatriation Department for the arrears of pension, after waiting about six months, they granted me arrears at the rate of 10 per cent pension. My disability was worth 50 per cent when I was discharged, and I was suffering the same disability all the following year. The Repatriation Department thinks that ten per cent, pension was enough compensation for me for all those years of suffering I went through, caused through the mistake of the military doqtors and Repatriation doctors, I wish to know and in the finish I had to find out at my own expense to be x-rayed and that it was the bullet that was in me that caused all the trouble. 1 would like you to take up my case with the Repatriation Department and see .if they could not grant me the 50 per cent, pension for seven years that I had to suffer through their mistake. As there is only one person who has any idea what I suffered and that is myself.

Although many people subscribe to charitable and other institutions merely out of their goodness of heart, a great number of others make similar subscriptions purely for mercenary reasons, with the object of receiving cheap advertisements. Prior to entering parliament I conducted a business, and I know that it is the custom of business men to make donations to hospitals and other charities, merely to have their subscriptions advertised, and to have their names mentioned later in the annual reports of the institutions. There are many people who, in the aggregate, give £20 or ±'30 a year to charitable organizations, but each donation may be only £ 1 , that being the amount their means would permit. For that they receive no exemption when their income tax is assessed, while an individual who gives only one donation of £5 is permitted to deduct that amount, on his income return. I cannot appreciate the reason for the differentiation, and f a i l to see any justification for the retention of tbe . provision in its m present form .

If it is the desire of the honourable member, I shall put his amendment. I am not quite sure what the honourable meirfber for East Sydney( Mr West) w ill accomplish by the deletion of the whole paragraph. If that were done it would prevent the deduction of all donations made by taxpayers to charitable institutions, and I feel confident that is not what member indicated that many taxpayers make donations which, in the aggregate, total considerably more than £5, and receive no benefit under the act. 1 agree with the honourable member.

Last night the Treasurer stated that it would be difficult to prove that such small sums had been donated. I remind the honourable gentleman that the onus of proof is on the taxpayer.

That could apply similarly with smaller donations. to eliminate the word "" e a c h "" which appears after the words "" five pounds "" ? vantage should apply to donations of £ 1 and upwards, when evidence is submitted to the commissioner that the payments have actually been made.

Hitherto there has been a strict limitation as to the institutions in respect of which gifts were an allowable deduction from income. It is now proposed to alter that position, by including not only public universities, but also colleges affiliated therewith. objection to increasing still further the exemption by including gifts of £1 and upwards. That may mean additional work in checking the payments; but, as Theodore) pointed out, the onus of proving payment rests on the taxpayer. Honourable members may remember that the exemption from taxation of gifts exceeding £5 each was agreed to in 1918 after a long discussion, in which amounts varying from one guinea to £20 were suggested as a reasonable limitation of the exemption. Amendment agreed to. clause exempts from taxation certain gifts to public universities or to colleges affiliated therewith. I desire to extend its scope to cover donations made for the purpose of encouraging education and research. I have in mind a public-spirited movement in Western Australia some years ago when it was decided to start a new agricultural college. The response was so great that in a short time the sum of £10,000 was raised by public subscription. Later, the taxation authorities ruled that donations to the new college would be taxable. I do not know the later developments, but at one stage a number, of taxpayers withdrew their donations when that decision became known. Honourable members will agree that we should encourage in every way the donation of money for educational and research purposes. The Muresk College, although connected with a public university, was probably not affiliated with it. I suggest that the word "" affiliated"" is too restrictive. There are in Australia numbers of colleges not affiliated with universities, which have been established as a result of private benefactions. I instance the Peter Waite Institute in is the direct result of Mr Peter Waite's munificence. Persons who donate money to colleges to provide scholarships or bursaries to enable children to continue their education should be encouraged in every way. The donation to which I have referred was for the purpose of instituting research into animal and plant diseases. Provision has been made to exempt such donations, but there are other donations which should also be included The Government has no in the exemption. I therefore move That after the word "" therewith,"" proposed new sub-paragraph h(ii), the words ""or for encouraging education or research"" be inserted. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann).

In this connection I mention particularly Mr George Swinburne and Sir William McPherson. ference between gifts made out of capital and gifts from income. taxpayer makes a gift to an institution in respect of which gifts are deductible, the authorities would allow deduction. as that of Sir William McPherson, might not leave much income for the year in which it is made. rob the Treasury of any source of income. Generally, I believe that those who are able to contribute their share of taxation should do so. I have not brought this matter forward at the instigation of the gentlemen I have mentioned, but because of suggestions made by men and women engaged in technical education in Victoria who realize the benefit of technical schools in the education of ' our young people. No one will gainsay that these technical schools are doing a great work in equipping the youth of this country for the battle of life. Australia has already benefited considerably from these munificent gifts, and the students who pass through the institutions become most useful citizens. It has been suggested to me by the masters and others connected with technical schools that the exemption of such gifts from income tax seems to be a desirable way of recognizing the generosity of the donors. Dr; E^iSiiE PAGE (Cowper) [12.1 J The spirit that has prompted the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) in [80] submitting his amendment will be generally appreciated; but there is a limit to which the Government can go, drawn or else the administration of the act will be rendered impossible for the department, quite apart from any problematical loss of revenue. Legislative provision was made in 1924 to exempt practically out of assessable income all gifts for the purpose of encouraging scientific the principal act provides for the deduction of so much of the assessable income as the commissioner is satisfied has been donated by the taxpayer, for research into the causes, prevention or cure of disease in human beings, animals or plants, to any authority which the commissioner is satisfied is a publio authority engaged in such research. Gifts for scientific research are, therefore, included, and we are left to consider gifts for educational purposes. The Government carefully considered the extent to which it should go in this matter, and it came to the conclusion that, in view of the ^generosity with which the donors of !gifts to charitable institutions were treated, and the wide definition of public donations, which include those for all varieties of war memorials, it could go no further than exempt gifts to universities and affiliated colleges. For that reason I urge the honourable member not to press his amendment. was hoping that the Treasurer would make a clear line of demarcation between gifts from income and those that are obviously made from capital. made in the bill, since it exempts gifts made out"" of assessable income derived during the year. happened to have an income of £10,000 per annum, and made a capital gift to the extent of £10,000 for the establishment of an institution, he would have no assessable income for that year, and would pay no income tax.

I am inclined to test the feeling of the committee on the issue, not for the purpose of resisting the Treasurer, but to ascertain whether a substantial body of opinion in the committee is favorable to the amendment. I have no desire to make this in any sense a party question; but it is worthy of favorable consideration at the hands of the Government.

This is really a minor matter which will not affect anybody particularly, and the committee is spending much valuable time in discussing it. view of the Treasurer's statement regarding the meaning of the provision in the act relating to research, and the statement that reason that I have suggested that made by the honourable member for Perth that the Deputy Commissioner for Taxation has disallowed the exemption in the case of the institution to which reference has been made, I suggest that the Treasurer should inform us definitely what the policy of the Government is in the matter. Research has come into the forefront more, during the life of this Government, than in all the previous', .* years of our Australian 1 history. To-day we recognize more than ever the importance of research. Seeing that public-spirited men in the community are willing to provide money for it, we should allow their gifts to remain exempt from income taxation, for they are undoubtedly made for the benefit of the general public. ported the amendment by the honourable member for Perth. It appears to me that it is highly desirable that we should include in our list of exemptions all gifts made to universities or schools affiliated with universities, by which I mean secondary, technical, and grammar schools which in the past have done so much to assist the great cause of education. Scholarships which are provided from such gifts are of immense value to the children of persons with limited means. I have not heard the f u l l debate on this would at once realize that the Governsubject, but I cannot conceive of any sound reason for refusing to agree to the proposed exemption. I submit that gifts of this character encourage those engaged in the great work of secondary education, in the community. We should do everything we can to stimulate the generosity of the act, for it would be possible to bring people who are in the position to make these gifts. have no objection whatever to the amendment of the honourable member for Perth; I agree generally with it. If donors of some of the gifts that have been mentioned are entitled to relief from taxation on their donations, it appears to me that donors who will fall within the category mentioned by the honourable member should also share in the relief. My point is that in the years that are ahead of us the Treasurer-may find it necessary to conserve every penny of revenue which he can obtain from direct taxation. It is for some limit should be placed upon the amount for which relief may be given. Large benefactions have been made to many institutions in the various States, and I am of the opinion that the tendency to make gifts of this character will increase rather than decrease. If that should be so, a very large sum may be involved in these exemptions in the future. It is for that reason that I have suggested that a limit should be fixed to the amount of money that may be so exempted. I do not agree with the honourable member for Boothby that this is an inconsequential matter. I suggest that a limit of £1,000 might be fixed. sire to make the gifts, and it is already disappearing fast enough. view.

We have been forced to define the term. The honor. able member for Boothby has said that this is a small matter; but it -will become a very large matter if the amendment is agreed to. What honourable members should consider is whether, if relief from taxation is to be given to these different institutions, this is the right way to give it. I entirely agree that we should encourage our philanthropists to make gifts to promote education and research, but exemption of such gifts from taxation will never be the determining factor as to whether they will be made or not. If a generously-minded man makes a gift of £20,000 or £30,000 out of his capital to a public institution or to a school, he is not likely to be penalized, for the gift might lead to a very substantial cut being is not made from his assessable income. An important point arises in the case of a man who, out of an income of say £10,000 a year, makes a gift of £7,000 to a certain institution. He would obtain exemption not merely for the year in which he made his gift, but over all the years during which his income is averaged hi order to ascertain the amount of his taxation. Mr ScuxT.ur -Supposing that a man gave the whole of his income for one year and something over. would be considered to be made out of capital. The department deals with every case on its merits. If all gifts to institutions such as those under notice are to be exempt from taxation, the Commomvealth Government will be making a contribution to them to the degree in which it will lose taxation revenue in respect, of them, and the question arises whether it would not be better for us, if we desire to 'do something more than we are already doing to encourage education and research, to definitely subsidize institutions of which Ave approve. that way the public would have some idea of the value „of the contributions that the Government is making to these purposes;,but there is no way of determining the extent of our gifts when thej' are made by way of the exemption of gifts from taxation. The question is, can the Government afford to go further than it proposes? The provisions of the act are being very materially liberalized. This concession will embrace such charities as the Lord Mayor's fund and the bush fire relief fund in Melbourne, and universities that have not previously been allowed to claim the deduction. The point raised by the honourable member will probably be met by the definition of ""Affiliated college,"" which is "" a residential educational institution affiliated under statutory provisions with a public university."" not cover a technical college. Dr., EAELE PAGE I agree that it will not. To include technical colleges made in the revenue. I am quite satisfied that the Government cannot agree to the general exemption that has been suggested ; but I am prepared to discuss with the taxation officials the question of including technical colleges. On the general question I appeal to honourable .members to stand by the action that has been taken. The amendment is much too wide from the point of view of, first, the administration, and, secondly, the probable effect on the revenue. I accept the assurance of the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) that he will give consideration to the suggestion that technical colleges be brought within the ambit of this concession. I have received from Mr John Carroll, acting secretary of the Technical Schools' Association of Victoria, a letter in which he states. It is understood tliat the Council of Public Instruction of Victoria has approached the Federal Government in the matter., but I do not know what has been done. The Treasurer will thus see that my advocacy of the claims of technical schools has not been prompted by the donors of gifts. The teachers in those schools are In performing a very valuable work. The colleges associated with universities are limited in number.

I believe that the Government made a mistake when it decided to include universities and colleges connected therewith. Having agreed to their inclusion, an what grounds may they exclude any other educational institution? If a concession is to be given to the man who makes a donation to a university or Scotch College in a college affiliated with it, why should it be denied to the man who makes a donation to a technical school, a workingman's college, or even a primary school? Why exempt the man who assists the highest form of education and refuse the exemption to one who extends his patronage to the primary form? If it is inconvenient to avoid discrimination, no person should be given the concession. Public charitable institutions are fairly easily defined, but educational institutions are in a different category. Where is the line to be drawn? I do Dot favour the subsidizing of universities by the Commonwealth if other forms of education are to be denied assistance. This is indirectly a subsidy. I confess an inability to see how this amendment, if agreed to, will be administered. I should not care to be given the responsibility of interpreting the law. It is not right that we should place upon our administrators tasks that are practically impossible of fulfilment. In all conscience it the law exactly. The words "" charitable institutions"" were included in a previous amendment of the this provision is now inserted, we shall later he asked to state what is meant by "" encouraging education.""

Class distinctions are drawn when Ave assist universities and the colleges affiliated Avith them, but not other educational institutions. The great majority of our children never see the inside of a university. Why should donations which those institutions receive be singled out for exemption from taxation ? Generously-minded persons sometimes make donations to technical schools, working men's colleges, and certain forms of primary education, yet they are not allowed to claim a deduction. Instead of endeavouring to make the provision so Avide"" that it will be impossible to either interpret or administer it, we should confine the exemption to charitable donations.",27,Income Tax Assessment Bill

I am quite sure that ""if the Government gives due consideration to the matter, its decision will be satisfactory to all concerned. The question before the Chair is worthy of careful consideration. Are we prepared to extend our vision beyond our immediate surroundings and bring ourselves into line with the progressive thought of the present day-that is, to throw our universities open to the brainiest members of the industrial classes? Some of our greatest students, and those who have been in the forefront in improving the conditions of mankind, have had as parents men who followed manual occupations. If the Government wishes to give relief to our universities, let it take control of them. It would b'j for the nation's welfare. A few days ago the Melbourne University approached the Premier of Victoria, Mr Hogan, for assistance. His reply was, ""You are receiving £40,000 a year, and you want £121,000. I can give you no more.'' Are there in Victoria persons who are willing to make up the difference between £40,000 and £121,000? The Sydney University has been endeavouring for some time to raise £125,000, but so far it has received only £25,000, and that sum has been given by those who are anxious that it shall continue to be conducted along conservative lines, so that only a certain section of the community may derive a benefit from it. Few persons make big donations to public institutions. I find from an examination of the record of wills lodged for probate that during the last two years substantial sums have been left by wealthy land-owners to their widows and children, little or no consideration having been given to charitable institutions and public universities. We have recently had the sorry spectacle of the Sydney University promoting vaudeville shows and dances for raising funds, and that is certainly not in keeping with the dignity of our principal educational institution. . I ask honourable members not to oppose the clause, because if carried some incentive may be given the public to make* donations to public universities and affiliated colleges. The Government has accepted my amendment ' to strike out £5 and insert £1. Sitting suspended from 12.50 to 2.15 p.m. sight I was prepared to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth, but upon realizing how far-reaching would be its effects, I have decided to oppose it. I am satisfied that it could create all sorts of difficulties in the interpretation of the law, and would lead to an increase in the administrative costs of the department. I sympathize with every endeavour which has for its object the encouragement of education, but when we start giving exemption from taxation in respect of monetary gifts to educational institutions, where shall we stop ? Thousands of people are assisting in various ways education and research. For instance, the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) has been engaged in extensive research work on his farm for the last seven years; he is, ' in co-operation. with the Victorian Government, demonstrating to the people in the wheat belt what crops can be most profitably grown. His work means much to everybody in ' the community, but I doubt whether his expenditure in that way could justifiably be deducted from his taxable income. In the secondary industries also are many people who are paying considerable sums in promoting . research and experiment, and if a. taxation concession were granted to all these people I am afraid the department's revenue would be seriously reduced. Universities and their affiliated colleges are in a different category. The Geelong Grammar School, one of the finest public schools in Australia, has received several large endowments, including one amounting to over £100,000 from a former pupil, the late Hon. H . H . Whittingham. If a concession is made in respect of gifts to university colleges,",28,Income Tax Assessment Bill

I fail to see any reason for the insertion of the new wording. think that generosity of thought has carried many honourable members beyond what is the true function of this legislature. When I spoke previously it was with a desire to encourage gifts of the character indicated by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann). Yet, on reflexion, it is quite clear that if , in this chamber, we start to subsidize State institutions-and most of these bodies are State institutions-w e ourselves become contributory donors with every other donor in the Commonwealth of £1 and over. I am therefore glad that the Treasurer has called a halt. I am doubtf u l whether the honourable gentleman should not make a c-ndition governing bequests to universities, defining as gifts only those that are allocated for the advancement of research work, a field in which the Commonwealth has recently interested itself to a considerable extent. Universities are State institutions, and as such are endowed by the States, and by the denominational bodies which establish colleges and schools in association with them. The money should not be used to subsidize subsidiary institutions associated with the universities. good deal of time has been taken up in discussing what appears to me to be a very small matter. At a later stage we may be asked to sit long hours in order to put the measure through. After listening to a number of honourable members, I have arrived at the conclusion that the Treasurer has made a mistake in departing from his original proposal that the deduction should apply only to charitable donations. It never enters the mind of any man or woman in the community, desirous of making a-donation to any educational or similar institution, that he or she will escape tax by such an action. Yet here, in deliberative assembly, we are taking up the best part of a day-in discussing such a contingency. Almost every honourable member in this chamber gives regularly to different educational and charitable organizations, and he never bothers about recording those gifts in his income-tax return. This remark applies similarly to the community generally, and I fail to understand why we are wasting so much time over this discussion. If we gave the exemption to donations to schools the principle would go on extending and extending. extension into the State sphere at that. sorry that the Treasurer even extended the exemption to gifts to universities.

129,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper,"Treafreeholder is using another individual as a dummy lessee, because it is possible in such cases, not only to -checkmate the freeholder in his plans, but to punish him severely for his attempts to evade tax. Such a case would probably f a l l under 69 of the Principal Act, which readsAny person who, by any wilful act, default or neglect, or by any fraud, art or contrivance whatever, avoids or attempts to avoid assessment for taxation, shall be guilty of an offence. The penalty provided is not less than £50, nor more than £500 plus treble the amount of tax payment of which has been avoided or attempted to be avoided. The position is not the same when a company is formed by the freeholder to take a building lease of his land and erect a building for h i m out of money supplied by him. The proposed amendment w ill protect the revenue to a considerable extent against loss in such cases.

The amendment which I have had circulated is as followsCA. Section thirteen of tlie principal act is amended hy omitting sub-sections (2) to (8) inclusive and inserting in tlieir stead the following sub-sections:"" (2) In assessments of tax for the financial year beginning on the first day of July, 1927, and for each subsequent year:[it) the taxable income of the taxpayer shall he deemed to be the total taxable income of the taxpayer in the years (in this section called 'average year') beginning with the first-average year and ending with the year next preceding the financial year for which the tax is payable.

(4) Whenever the taxable income of a taxpayer has been assessed for a period of five average years the rate of income tax to be applied in the next financial year shall be the rate applicable in that year, under the act by which the rates of income tax are declared, to ii taxable income of that amount, and that year shall be the first average year in assessments of his tax for each financial year subsequent to. the last mentioned financial year for a further period of five financial years. (5) Any year in which the taxpayer was time. not carrying on business and was not in rethis Housei n 1920, was as follows:ceipt of a taxable income shall not be counted as an average year. Mr Prowse. However, as the Treasurer says, (6) Any year in which the deductions allowed in his assessment to a taxpayer engaged in business left no taxable income or produced a loss or in which the taxpayer incurred a loss shall be an average year and shall be taken into account in ascertaining the assessment of tax for any financial year. (7) Where the amount of tax calculated under sub-sections (2), (a) and (!>) of this section is less than the amount of tax levied against the taxpayer in the total of the average years comprised in the period from the financial year immediately succeeding the first average year to the financial year next preceding the financial year for which tlie tax is payable, he shall be entitled to a refund of the difference between the amount of the last mentioned tax and the amount of the tax so calculated. (S) Where there are not at Teast two average j'ears for tlie purpose of calculating the rate under the foregoing provisions of this section the rate of income tax to he applied in a year to the taxable income of a taxpayer shall be the rate applicable in that year under the act by which the rates of income tax are declared, ,to a taxable income of that amount."" Clause 14 provides for the carrying on of losses which may be deducted from subsequent profits, within a certain period, u n t i l they have been off-set. I introduced a discussion on this subject some years ago when there appeared to be a desire for the adoption of some system of averaging incomes over a five-year period in place of imposing taxation upon single-year The honourable member for Lilley( Mr. Mackay) moved a motion in this Parliament about that time, which caused the House to give very careful consideration to the adv-isableness of adopting an averaging system over five years, 'andultimately it was"" decided to approve of that principle in respect of the incomes of primary producers. I did not, at that time, agree to a limitation of the system to primary producers. JL was of the opinion that the principle should be applied to all incomes which were liable to variation. The history of this movement is interesting. It shows that we appear to be learning from our experience of the inaccuracies of the systems D that have been introduced from time to The motion that was carried by This House is of opinion that the fairest method of calculating for purposes of the federal income tax, as applied to primary producers, would be upon a basis of five years' operations. In December, 1921, the Royal Commission on Taxation, which was appointed by the Government to inquire into our taxation methods, recommended that the averaging stystem should be adopted, and the then Treasurer, Sir Joseph Cook, subsequently introduced a* bil l to give effect to the recommendation. The Country party, did not at that time, nor has it since, contended that the system should be entirely, confined to primary producers. In addressing myself to the provisions of that bill, I saidI know of no injustice in connection w it h our legislation that is greater or does more to retard tlie progress of the country. bill is an admission of the necessity for some remedy, and as such I accept it . It is clumsy and inadequate, but it is a step in the right direction, and I hope that the Government w ill offer an early opportunity to honourable members to consider a revised instrument for the assessment of taxation which will be equitable all round, and not continue the heartburning that is now caused to citizens by the unjust and cruel incidence of taxation. The fundamental base upon which the Royal Commission founded its recomIncome. Tax Under Year.

I submit that the present system does not determine the taxable capacity of the citizen, and consequently cruel injustice is still being inflicted upon certain taxpayers. It is for that reason that I intend to move the amendment which has been circulated. In 1922 the Treasurer of the day ( Mr Bruce), in order to discredit the system which I advocated, made use of a table which I have had reprinted for the information of honourable members. In the course of his speech on that occasion he saidThisI agree with him that he has adjusted the position over five years; but we shall be faced, if we accept his scheme, with exactly the same trouble that we have had to face with regard to taxing on the basis of a single year. That is a perfectly correct statement. The figures in the first of the ttibles that I have circulated are those that.jvere submitted by Mr Bruce, as Treasurer, in ' 1922.

Such a difference between the tax on a regular income and on one which cannot be regarded as very irregular is too great, considering that the taxable capacity is equal in each case. The method of averaging incomes that is provided for in my proposal would make the total tax paid over a period of five years exactly the same whether the income was received in five equal annual sums or in irregular amounts, either rising or falling. It would be a very simple matter to arrive at the tax payable in each year, and less time would be occupied in assessing than is necessary under the method proposed in the bill. No ready-reckoner can be compiled for the calculations that are necessary under either the act or the Treasurer's proposal. That is a very serious aspect of the matter. Eveni f it were possible to compile a ready-reckoner to calculate the assessments under the act this chamber would not provide sufficient space in which to house it. Considerable expense must thus be inmethods on a rising and a declining volved. I have submitted in the following income:tables figures showing the effect of both BIU Proposal. Declining.

He tried to set the royal commission against any for m of averaging on the ground of excessive cost. The figures that I have presented to honourable members this afternoon, show that over a period of five years the taxpayer would under the old system contribute £501 as against £239., It is only f a i r that any taxation imposed by the Government should f a l l equitably upon the people. This is not a class or party question, but one of collecting revenue from incomes according to the capacity of the taxpayers. The royal commission must have realized that, because it stated that Mr Ewing did not give it any assistance. commission included this statement in its reportIn view of tlie statement made by the Federal Commissioner of Taxation in his seventh annual report that "" The average of income for purposes of an income tax assessment would greatly increase the administrative difficulties and costs by introducing complexities from which the administration is now free, and it would considerably add to the difficulties oi taxpayers in understanding the assessments,"" your commissioners endeavoured to obtain an authoritative estimate of the cost of change, but the information received was so vague and unsubstantial that we have been unable to make any use of it . . In his evidence before the commission, the Federal Commissioner of Taxation declared:-"".When I tell you that the averaging of incomes will involve the doubling of our assessing staff, I am not exaggerating the position,"" but when specific requests were put to him to ascertain how his estimates of costs had been arrived at, he was forced to admit, "" It is all & guess, I am sorry to say, because we have not the figures.""

If the Treasurer receives revenue from the people of Australia according to their taxable capacity, and he finds that he has not sufficient money, it is for him, instead of making certain reductions, as he is now proposing to do, to lay the burden equally upon the citizens by a slight.inci'ease of the rate. In case this committee sliould carry the amendment, I wish to give him some comfort by saying that it w ill not affect his revenue for the first year because it w ill commence w i th the f u l l year. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr. Hunter) said that Ave should rely upon the advice of our taxation experts; but I The royal should like some other experts to examine the proposals, because I do not Avish this Parliament to submit itself to any sort of bureaucracy.

I would not say that it is absolutely the best that, within my knowledge, has even been placed before a Parliament. My business is that of a public accountant. I have been dealing largely with taxation matters for the last twelve years, and, speaking from experience, I think a scheme such as that proposed by the honourable member could be put into operation without very much inconvenience to the department concerned. At the same time, however, we know that as has been shown, tlieTreasurer must have a certain amount of money coming in by way of incometax returns.

Under that system the tax paid by persons in receipt of irregular incomes was substantially reduced. Illustrations quoted to the Royal Commission on Taxation showed that in one instance the income tax over the period of five years had been reduced from £120 to £83; in another instance from £139 to £105, and in a third from £146 to £124. Having had five years' experience of the working of that system, the Taxation Department has come to the conclusion that a considerable measure of justice can be given to those people who not merely have irregular incomes, but suffer losses, by introducing the reform contained in the clause now before the committee. The Government asks the committee to adopt its proposals, as a meed of justice that is come of the taxpayer at the rate applilong overdue. Undoubtedly it is a considerable concession, and will mean the loss of a large amount of revenue. The honourable member for Eorrest( Mr applicable to the higher income of that Prowse) proposes a different scheme, and it will be for the committee to decide between the two after reviewing the whole of the facts. In 1922, Parliament decided that income tax should be determined by averaging income over a period of five years in order to arrive at the rate, and then applying that rate to the income for . the taxable year. average income for the five-year period, losses were taken into account. Government now suggests that not merely shall the income rate be ascertained by averaging the income over a five-year period, but that losses shall be offset against the income for the year upon which tax is to be paid. Obviously this will mean a considerable amelioration to men who have sustained big losses. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) proposes that a taxpayer shall be required to pay in respect of each separate five-year period, for any subject year the amount represented by the excess of (a) the total amount of tax which year and the preceding years of that period if the tax for each of such years had been assessed on the average taxable income of such years at the rate applicable to sucb average taxable income, over (i>) the total amount of tax previously paid by the taxpayer inrespect of the preceding years of that period, and, conversely, entitling him to a refund of the amount represented by the excess of (&) over (a). Subject to the restriction of adjustments to fixed five-year periods, the aim of the honourable member's scheme is to require a taxpayer to pay exactly the same amount of tax in the aggregate as he would have been required to pay if his yearly incomehad been of the same fixed amount andequal to his average income. The method proposed has the effect of allowing deduction of losses-occurring within the particular five-year period from profits arising within the same period, as these reduce the aggregate taxable income of the years of the period, and also of taxing the average taxable incable to the average taxable income; that is, the taxpayer ultimately is not called upon to pay tax in a good year at the rate year, but is assessed on the average taxable income at the rate applicable to that average taxable income. If the scheme would give the result which the honourable member desires, there would be justification for giving it a trial, no matter what administrative difficulty it entailed.

Take even the rebate provided by section 30, in which private individuals are treated similarly to companies in certain circumstances and in respect of 15 per cent, of their business incomes. Again a tremendous amount of work would be involved, and in addition, there are all those rebates which are calculated in accordance with the act in order to avoid double or treble taxation in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, or in the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and a State or States of the Commonwealth, in which cases the higher rate is collected, and the lower rate rebated. amount one year, it is dealt with in a certain way. If it is lower in another year it is dealt with in another way, while if it is. higher in that year, it is again differently treated. The Commissioner for Taxation speaks in no uncertain way in respect to that aspect of the scheme. He says:Under Mr Prowse's scheme it would be necessary to recalculate the tax every year for each prev.ious year of the five-year period so as to make proper and almost endless adjustments in respect of those variations. Whilst as a matter of arithmetic the work could be done, it will readily be seen that the very great number of assessments which would require such adjustments would involve, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Taxation, -a doubling of the present assessing staffs of the department. We have the honourable member stating that there would be no additional work, and the commissioner assuring the Government that the work of his department would be doubled by the scheme. If it could be operated in such a way that justice would be done to all, there would be some excuse for taking action, but that must be proved beyond question. Until that is done the Government is justified in standing by the opinion of its officers, who contend that the present system, after being in operation for five years, provides a substantial measure of justice to taxpayers, and every effort w ill be made to remove existing inequalities. The views that I have placed before the committee are embodied in a prepared statement upon the ""Averaging System Plus Deduction of Lossesf r o m Profits,"" from which I have largely quoted. I now, with the permission of the comThat would mittee, add the complete statement for their informationBefore the proposals contained in the bill were adopted by the Government, it was examined in comparison with other schemes, viz.:(a) A suspense credit scheme mentioned in the First Report of the Royal Commission on Taxation, pages 17-18. (Z>) A scheme proposed by the honourable member for Forrest, MrJ . H . Prowse, M.P., If the income is a certain for calculating the tax for a fixed period of five years separated off from the next succeeding period of five years commencing w i th a sixth year and ending with the tenth year. The scheme of "" suspense credits "" may be described as one in which the department assesses the taxpayer according to the existing averaging system in a profit year, and contrariwise, the taxpayer, in effect, assesses the department to pay h i m tax according to the averaging system in a year in which he makes a loss. The royal commission reported that, for purposes of the scheme, a trading loss sustained by a taxpayer should be treated as if it were a profit so as to calculate the amount of tax which the department should pay or credit to t h "" taxpayer as if the department were the taxpayer and the taxpayer were the department collecting the tax. From fhe point of view of the requirements of the annual budget and economical administration by the Taxation Department, this scheme is considered impracticable. Criticism of Mr Prowse's Proposals. Mr Prowse's scheme, in effect, is to require a taxpayer to pay, in respect of each separate five-year period, for any subject year the amount represented by the excess of(a) the total amount of tax which would have been payable for the subject year and the preceding years of that period if the tax for each of such years had been assessed on the average taxable income of such years at the rate applicable to such average taxable income, over-(b) the total amount of tax previously paid by the taxpayer in respect of the preceding offered with regard to the scheme:years of that period, and conversely to entitle him to a refund relief to a taxpayer suffering consistent of the amount represented by the excess losses during any .particular five-year of (b) over (o). Subject to the restriction of adjustments to fixed five-year periods, the aim of Mr Prowse's scheme is to require a statement shows the tax which would taxpayer to pay exactly the same amount have been payable by a taxpayer who of tax in the aggregate as he would have derived a net aggregate taxable income been required to pay if his yearly income of £2,350 over a period of ten years if had been of the same fixed amount and such income were derived:equal to his average income. method proposed has the effect of allowing deduction.of losses occurring within the particular five-year period from profits arising within the same period (as these reduce the aggregate taxable in(a) Taxable Year. £ ] o 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2,350 (2) To attain the aim desired by Mr Demonstrating that this is so, let it Prowse it would be necessary, owing to the operation of a reducing statutory deduction, to average net assessable incomes and not taxable incomes.

Net Assessable Income. £ 1 2 3 4 o 4,500 As will be seen, both A. and B. receive over a period of five years the ""same net assesable income of £900 per annum. Assuming the rate of tax imposed by Parliament had not been varied during the five-year period concerned, the position would be as follows:Under Mr Prowse's scheme, i.e., if taxable incomes were averaged A. would pay in tax in the aggregate five times the tax on £800 (£4,000 divided by 5), while B. would pay five times the tax on £773 (£3,866 divided by 5). If net assessable incomes were averaged, A would pay five times the tax on£900 (£4,500 divided by 5) £100 Let it be assumed that over a period of (Statutory exemption) = £800. and B. would pay five times the tax on£900 (£4,500 divided by 5) £100 CStatutory exemption) = £800. i.e., precisely the same amount as A.

Adopting the 1925-26 rate for the first year the rates of tax on the taxable incomes shown would then be as follows:Years. 2nd. 3rd. 4th. 5th. 10-35 11-385 12-42 13-455 14-49 10-575 11-6325 12-69 137475 14805 108 118 8 ' 1296 1404 1512 11026 121275 1323 14-3325 15-436 11-25 12-375 13-5 14-625 15-76 The tax payable for each year in accordance with Mr Prowse's scheme would be arrived at as follows:Average Year.

(4) The work involved by the scheme is only partially exemplified by the foregoing illustrations. The last of the examples is a statement in its simplest form of the work which would be involved in a very large number of cases. Among other complexities connected with the scheme is the necessity to examine each particular dividend received by a taxpayer in each year in order to determine how much of it is rebateable under section 16 (&) ( i i i ) , and how much is rebateable under section 20 (4). The rebate under section 16 (b) (iii) is on the net amount of a dividend contained in the taxable income, that is the amount left after the dividend has borne its own peculiar deductions of the year, together with a proportion of the deductions which may be common to all classes of income in the assessment.

It ""will also be varied by the variations in the character of the funds used by companies for payment of dividends. Under Mr Prowse's scheme it would be necessary to recalculate the tax every year for each previous year of the five year period so as to make proper and almost endless adjustments in respect of those variations. Whilst as a matter of arithmetic the work could be done, it will readily be seen that the very great number of assessments which would require such adjustments would involve, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Taxation, a doubling of the present assessing staffs of the department. There are still further complexities which would, if taken aloue, render the scheme impracticable, but superimposed upon all the. others, as may very well happen in any case, they would make it impossible of application. These are:Rebates under section 30 of the act, The net where in the case of certain businesses, tax on 15 per cent, of the taxable income is reduced to Is. in the £ 1 ; and Rebates under section 18, which provides the machinery to eliminate double taxation as between the United Kingdom and Australia. The most difficult of application of all the complexities are those which would arise in the elimination of double taxation. They may be truly described as appalling. The complications already mentioned are those which are at present obvious to the departmental officials, and they are not necessarily all that would arise under the scheme if it were in force. It is very probable that other complications would be met with owing to the many differences of circumstances associated with returns and the great variety of bases upon which the assessable and taxable incomes of different classes of business are necessarily calculated. It may be stated that the scheme proposed by Mr Prowse would necessitate the complete revision of a large number of the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act because it would represent a fundamental alteration in the principles of those provisions. Finally, it is observed that the provisions of the present law are only reasonably applicable under a scheme which taxes the actual income of the year without adjustment in respect of payments of tax in previous years. In order to illustrate the difficulties which would be met with in the calculation and allowance of rebates of tax under sections 16 (b) ( i i i ) , 20 (4), 18 late to income derived from dividends and 30, let it be assumed that Mr from companies; section 18 to all inProwse's scheme had been enacted, and let us place ourselves in the position of the assessor who is about to assess the return of a taxpayer who is entitled to rebates under each of the sections named. For the information of members, it may here be stated briefly that the sections named provide for rebates of taxSections 16 (b) (iii)-A t Is. to shareholders whose rates of tax exceed Is. on that portion of the dividend received, paid out of profits derived by the company subsequent to 1st July, 1922 (on which profits the company has paid tax at the rate of Is.). Dividends paid out of such profits to shareholders whose rate of tax is less than Is. are not assessable income in the hands of such shareholders. Section 20 (4)-On dividends paid out of the profits of a company which have borne tax in the hands of the company at the rate or rates of tax appropriate to the year or years in which the profits were derived. The rate of rebate allowable to the shareholder is that particular company rate or the shareholders' rate in the year of receipt of the dividend, whichever is the lower. ""When a company draws a dividend for a year from present and past profits upon which it has paid varying rates of tax, the amount of the rebate of ' tax must be calculated by reference to each rate so paid and to the amounts drawn from the respective profits mentioned. Section 30 -To reduce the tax payable under certain circumstances on 15 per cent, of the income derived from a business to Is. (company rate of tax). Section 18-A t rates calculated in accordance with the act, in order to avoid double or treble taxation, i.e., in the United Kingdom, or in the United Kingdom the Commonwealth and a State or States of the Commonwealth. Sections 16 (6) ( i i i ) and 20 (4) recome liable to double or treble taxation, and section 30 to business income (assessable at personal exertion rates). The rates of rebates on dividends are ascertained in respect of each separate company from which the shareholder has received dividends, and the rate so ascertained applies only to the dividends paid by that particular company. Let it be assumed that the taxpayer was a shareholder in one company only. He therefore would normally receive dividendsy probably of varying amounts, each year and rebateable each year at varying rates according to the funds of the comassume that details of the taxpayer's inpany out of which paid.

It will be obvious that the average income and, therefore, the shareholders' rate of tax vary yearly, and as rebates of tax under sections 16 (6) ( i i i ) and 20 (4) are calculated having regard to the shareholders' rate of tax, rebates under these sections on each year's dividends from each separate company would have to be'reviewed each year for each of the preceding years of the period. In the first year we will assume that he receives a dividend of £3,000, which' is reduced to £2,750 after bearing its share of the deductions applicable to it and allowable in the assessment. £2,750 of this dividend is therefore included in the total taxable income of £6,200 and falls to be rebated at the appropriate rate.

In the second year taxpayer receives a net taxable dividend of £2,000 from the same company rebateable, let us ssume30 per cent, not exceeding 2s. 8d., section 20 (4). 60 per cent, at Is., section 16 (o) the remaining 10 per cent, again being taxable in full to the shareholders. His total taxable income was £4,500, thus making £10,700 for the two years. Mr Prowse's scheme requires the tax payable in the second year to be ascertained by calculating the tax which would have been paid on this £10,700 of net taxable income if it had been derived in two equal amounts of £5350, and deducting therefrom the tax paid in respect of the first year. The result is that the dividends included in the taxable incomefirst year £2,750, second year £2,000-ar e now to be taxed, subject to rebate, at the rate applicable to £5,350, i.e., 45.5146. The first year's dividends £2,750 have been rebated at 2s. 5d. and Is., and as the new rate is still in excess of 2s. 5d. and Is. the rebate remains unaltered. The rebates on the £2,000 derived in-the second year are calculated having reference to the rate of tax on the average income 45.5146 and this would be allowable at rates of 2s. 8d. and Is., these rates being less than the shareholder's rate. In the third year the rebates remain unaltered as the shareholder's rate on the average income is still in excess of the company rate. Of course, the rebates allowed would have to be examined to ascertain this fact. In the fourth year, however, the shareholder's rate falls to 25.5469 and, consequently, it is necessary to vary the rates of rebate hitherto allowed under section 20 (4). The dividends are now rebateable under this section at the shareholder's rate, which is less than the company rate at which the profits of the company (out of which this portion of the dividend was paid) had already been subjected to tax in the hands of the company. The rebate under section 16 (b) (iii) would still be at the rate of Is. In the fifth year a business loss is inyears, and not merely in the first two curred which not only wholly absorbs the business profits of the period, but reduces the taxable income of the period derived from rents and dividends. It becomes necessary, therefore, to re-^ no change during the five-year period in duce pro rata the dividends previously included in the taxable income of the period. This is done automatically in the average calculation, insofar as the actual reduction of the taxable income of the period is concerned, but in' order to adjust the rebates under section 20 (4) and 16 (o) ( i i i ) each dividend must be reviewed and the rebate recalculated on the reduced amount. The fifth year would conclude a five year period under Mr Prowse's scheme, and the sixth year would start a new period unaffected by the earlier assessments. It should be noted, however, that further complications might have been met with. Had the fifth year loss occurred earlier, the dividends would have been reduced pro rata, and the rebates under each section adjusted and allowed on the reduced amounts. If in a later year of the period the loss had been partially recouped, the amount of the dividends would have to he increased to the extent of the recovery of the loss and the rebates, under. each section, adjusted: and allowed on such increased amounts. If , also, the loss had been of such amount as to reduce the rate on property income to less than Is., the portion of the dividends rebateable under section 16 (b) ( i i i ) would have to be excised from the assessment entirely, as such dividends in such circumstances do not form part of the shareholder's assessable income. A new average calculation would then be made after excluding such portions of the dividends previously included in the taxable income, and as the rate of tax would be so altered, the rebates under section 20 (4) would have to be reviewed again. If later, subsequent profits raised the rate on the average income to Is. or over, such portion of the dividends would again become assessable income, and require to be included in the assessable income. Further complications would exist if a dividend were received in each of the five years as shown in the example set out. The practicability of the scheme has so far been discussed from the angles most favourable to it. It has been assumed, for this purpose, that there was the rates of tax or the amount and rate of diminution of the amount of the statutory exemption legislatively fixed, and that dividends were received from one company only. It has thus been possible to take a comprehensive view of the income of the period, and to show the tax each year adjusted so that the whole of the income of the period was taxed at the rate applicable to the average income of the period. But if(a) The rates of tax legislatively imposed varied as Between the years of a five-year period, or (6) The amount or rate of diminution of the statutory exemption were varied, thus producing a corresponding effect to that under (a) by causing a stated amount of assessable income to be taxed at different rates each year, the scheme would be impossible from a practical standpoint. Let-it be assumed that, instead of the rate remaining unaltered as above, there 1 £ 1 1 1 X II 3 s Dr. Earle Page. § 3,00 *H CM 2,00 eo o o IO 60 0 Loss 3,00 0 o IO o IO 3,00 0 § ! j! f' s Aggregat e Averag e Assessabl e Assessabl e Persona l t 3 8 a i Income.

Take the position as it arises when considering the assessment for the second year. The tax is first calculated on the aggregate taxable income for the two years, viz., £30,700, £5,350, at the rate operating in respect of the first year on £5,350, and £5,350 at the rate operating in respect of the second year on £5,350, i.e., in the second year a rate 5 per cent, lower than that of the first year. It is clear that as in the case where the rate of tax had not altered the whole of the dividends have been taxed, but not now at a uniform rate. Part (£2,375) of the first year's dividend is now assumed to be subject to tax at the first year's rate and part(£375)-a t the second year's rate. It will accordingly now be necessary to review and recalculate if necessary, the rebates under sections 16 (b) ( i i i ) and 20 (4) and for each portion of the dividends of the first year taxed at a different rate. Similarly, in the third year the first year's dividend must be assumed to be subject to tax partly (£1,583) at first year's rate and partly (£1,167) at tlie second year's rate and the second year's dividend partly (£416) at the second year's rate and partly (£1,583) at the third year's rate. Each rebate would then have to be reviewed in the iight of -the rate of tax assumed to have been paid in respect of each portion. Similarly in the fourth year. In the fifth year, each year's dividend would first bear its share of the fifth year business loss and thereafter the rebates would be reviewed in the light of the rate of tax assumed to have"" been paid on the different portions of each year's dividend as reduced by the loss. It is quite probable that parts of a dividend would thus become rebateable at the company rate and other parts of the same dividend at the shareholder's rate. The foregoing relates particularly to a taxpayer receiving a dividend from one company only each year. In practicemany taxpayers receive dividends from ten, twenty and probably even fifty companies each year. The prospect is somewhat appalling when one contemplates tbe. assessment of a taxpaying business man receiving dividends from, say, 50 companies with the possibility of his incurring losses reducing the amount of dividends included in his taxable income and of the fluctuation of his rate of tax under and over Is. thus necessitating the excision and restoration of dividends becoming respectively non-assessable, or, assessable and rebateable under section 16 (6) ( i i i ) . Rebates under Section 30 would require amendment each year having regard to the new rate of tax arrived at. Rebates under this section are allowable under certain circumstances on 15 per cent, of the business income (always assessable at personal exertion rates). The rebate is not always allowable on the f u l l personal exertion income of the taxpayer, and it is probable that where a Section 30 rebate is allowable there would be each year:"" Personal Exertion"" Income. rebateable under Section 30. "" Personal Exertion"" Inicomenot rebateable under Section 30. When a loss is incurred it would be necessary to charge the rebateable income with its share of the loss in order to ascertain the lesser amount of income subject to rebate. If subsequent profits recouped this loss either wholly or in part, the amount of income rebateable would be increased pro rata. If the rate of tax legislatively fixed varied each year it would be necessary each year to review each year's rebate separately. The adjustment under Mr Prowse's scheme of Section 30 rebates would involve most of the difficulties already pointed out in connection with Section 20 (4) rebates on dividends. Rebates under Section 18 would need to be readjusted each year and the amount of the rebate would alter with every alteration in the shareholder's rate of tax. The effect of a loss during the five-year period would be to reduce the income of the preceding years of that period, i.e., to reduce the income liable to tax under the federal act, and, consequently, the amount of income liable to double and treble taxation. year would need to be separately dealt Honourable the Prime Minister in 1922, with, as the rates of tax imposed in the when commenting, as Treasurer, upon several States and the United Kingdom Mr Prowse's proposal when first made would vary annually. When a loss is during the second reading speech on the incurred it would be necessary.to set off Income Tax Assessment .Bill 1922. that loss firstly against each preceding year of the five-year period, and then set off the proportionate amount of such Royal Commission on Taxation, paraa loss attributable to a particular year, graph 49, folio 14, is as follows:pro rata against the several items of assessable income of that year in order to show the particular income liable to taxation under the federal assessment, so that it could be compared with the amount of the same income liable to tax in the United Kingdom and in the States of the Commonwealth. The calculation of Section IS rebates at present involves considerable work and any amendment of the law which will require these to be reviewed and recalculated more than once cannot be recommended. So far as rebates of tax are concerned, Mr Prowse's scheme has been shown to be simplest in its application ( if it can be said to be simple at all in this respect) where there is an absence of losses, i.e. (a more or less steady income) and where there is no alteration in the rate of tax from year to year. The aim of the scheme, however, is apparently to give more equitable treatment to the taxpayer with a fluctuating income, i.e. one incurring occasional losses, but it has been shown that its practical application to such an income which is derived partly from personal exertion and partly from property is not reasonably possible. The proposed 10 per cent, reduction in the rate of tax this year and the fact that further reductions in future years might be possible, render the supposed variation in the rate of tax not an unreasonable assumption, and add strength STATEMENT showing the Income Tax (at to the objections to the scheme. There is also the great objection to Mr several methods explained hereunder, Prowse's scheme-ther e could not be any finality in any year's assessment until the expiration of the five-year period.

In the case of the latter the taxation depart ment suffers. The injustice in the cases submitted by the honourable member for Forrest of two men whose incomes averaged £1,000 per annum over a period For that reason of years, one income being regular and the other irregular, cannot be gainsaid. It is reasonable that a person should be taxed on the average income which he receives over a reasonable period. years in which a producer receives scarcely any income are periods of great trial and impecuniosity to him, and any taxation is a heavy burden. Under the scheme of the honourable member for Forrest such a man would probably be due for a refund, if we were to accept the.principle of refunds; but that is another issue.

I have had only a short time to consider the submitted by the Treasurer, and have been impressed by it; but I should like to know whether it was prepared under his direction or independently by the taxation officials themselves. It is of diswhich he would pay a tax of £1,179 16s. tinct disadvantage to us that that point has not been cleared up. I do not wish to say anything of an offensive nature, but I feel obliged to remark that the Treasurer is an adept at preparing a partizan case, and in this instance he has presented all the worse features of a difficult position. If a committee were appointed to investigate this subject, it could interrogate the Commissioner of Taxation and his officers to ascertain the extent to which this is; a fair and honest statement of the position. assured that it was such, I should accept it without question, hut it is hardly reasonable to ask us to accept it as an absolutely impartial statement from the commissioner when it may have been prepared to buttress a particular case which the Treasurer desires to make. .memorandum contrasts the treatment to which a man with a regular income of £235 per annum over a period of ten years, and a man with an irregular income amounting to the same aggregate sum over a similar period, would be sub jected under the scheme of the honourable member for Eorrest and that of the Government. the comparison has been fairly made. Eor the purpose of Mr Prowse's scheme two five-year periods have been taken instead of a complete ten-year period. Everybody knows that the shorter the period that is taken the farther away one gets from equity, while the longer the period the closer one gets to it. But it will be evident that although a five-year period might not be ideal, the results over it would be more equitable than the results over a single year.. The total in some of the man with an annual income of £235 per annum for ten years would Mr Scullin. be £2,350, and the tax to which he would be subjected would total.£45 12s. 6d. For he the purposes of ascertaining the effect of suffering from Mr Prowse's scheme, it is assumed that the taxpayer with a variable income los.t £5,000, £4,000, £3,000 and £2,000 in each of the first four years; in the succeeding four years he showed a profit of £500, memorandum £3,000, £5,000, £7,000 respectively; in the next year he showed a loss of £250, and in the tenth year a profit of £1,100. So that substracting his losses from his profits his total income was £2,350 upon 8d. with the steady income would not .vary. highly improbable that the income of a man with a variable income would vary' as greatly as in this hypothetical case. period the position of I the taxpayer under the scheme of the honourable member for Forrest would be all right, but in the next IfI were five-year period it would be all wrong. most unlikely that a man would lose £14,000 in four consecutive yearns, so that the case is not reasonable. The difficulties of the situation, which are recited The in the Treasurer's memorandum, are impressive, but not conclusive, for many of them would arise, and do arise, under our present system. I venture to say that if the Commissioner of Taxation and his officers had been asked to prepare a case to show merely the difficulties of the present situation, they could have submitted one which would have staggered us. We should not be asked to pass judgI am not satisfied that ment in a matter of this kind on the statement of either one side or the other.

In my opinion,' the wise course for the committee to pursue would be to affirm the equity of the principle of averaging incomes, without committing itself to a particular scheme. Personally I am not prepared to commit myself to any scheme at the moment. In the face of the criticism which the Treasurer levelled against the scheme outlined by the honourable member for Forrest, it would be unwise for us to adopt it-that",57,Section Is

155,Mr Scullin,"I submit that it isis, accepting the criticism of the Treasurer as coming from the officials of the department. We have not reached the point at which we can say the last word on this subject; nevertheless, I feel disposed to vote for the amendment when it it submitted to the committee as an expression of my view that the adoption of an averaging system is desirable. We do not get over our difficulties by merely averaging rates as we are doing, nor shall we overcome them by allowing losses to be carried forward. the Treasurer's memorandum which impressed me most was the table which showed the number of difficulties which varying conditions, rates, and exemptions would bring about. There would be innumerable difficulties in applying the system. But still they would have a ready reckoner to refer to, whereas under the present condition of averaging rates without averaging incomes we have no ready reckoner. It is all very well to average.the rate of tax on the income of a man which may vary from £1,000 this year to £2,500 next year; but we have no ready z^eckoner to show us what he would have paid at the average rate for £2,500. There would be a ready reckoner with which to calculate the amount of tax once the rate had been ascertained. A number of difficulties have arisen because of the existence of complexities in the law. Those complexities can be removed. The adoption of the company tax in the form in which it has been in operation since 1922 has led to complications. In one of his reports the Commissioner of Taxation said that the amendment of the law which made it applicable to all profits had added considerably to the work of the assessors in the taxation department. These complexities in our company law make possible an evasion of taxation and encourage a large number of people to form companies when in other circumstances they would not do so, because by that means they are able to evade taxation which as individuals they would be called upon to pay. overhaul of our income-tax law. If that were carried out, quite a number of these difficulties would'disappear, and it would be possible to put into operation a scheme such as that outlined by the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse). I do not claim to be a great authority in this matter; but I should not care to commit . myself or honourable members on this side to the definite statement that any particular scheme should be adopted. If the committee were to agree to the principle contained in the amendment, or to any other principle which confirmed the averaging of incomes, with the object of approaching as nearly as possible to justice, the probability is that when a further The part of amending bill was brought down next year the opinions and the advice of the departmental experts would be placed be-fore us, and it might be possible to evolve some practical scheme. There is no hope of inducing the department to submit a scheme embodying the averaging system, so long as the Government is opposed to that system. trol taxation. long as the Government makes .that a rigid policy, naturally the department will back it up and provide it with facts and figures which are not available to private members. It would be very much better if every honourable member had an opportunity to examine fully every statement that is submitted to the Government by its experts. First of all it should be ascertained whether this committee approves of the principle of averaging incomes. Personally I do, because I consider that it is a just system; but if it is impracticable, unworkable, and too costly, I am not prepared to vote for it. In the short time that I have had to study it, I have been impressed with this document that has been placed in my hands, although I do not admit that it is conclusive. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [4.20] -Without dealing at great length with this question, I think I ought to say a word or two about it, first because I was Treasurer at the time that the Royal Commission on TaxaWe require a complete tion reported to Parliament; and secondly, because 1 have had some experience of this particular scheme.

The first criticism I offer is that this scheme cannot claim to approach perfection. scheme can be perfect which does not cover the whole of the tax-paying life of an individual.

Tfhere are a number of points with which I could deal, but they have been referred to by the another scheme, which was adopted by the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page). I say, however, that the complexity in administration, and the difficulties which would have to be overcome if the scheme were adopted, are overwhelming. I do not base that statement upon what is contained in the memorandum that has been circulated among honourable members, although I understand that it gives the considered views of the taxation authorities. It was not prepared with the idea of advancing every argument that could he found against the honourable member's scheme. In 1922 I examined that scheme, and the conclusion at which I then arrived was that it was impossible to give effect to it without causing, such an enormous amount of labour and complexity as to defeat the object which the honourable member had in view. I wish now to deal with some of the points that have been raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Modifications of the British scheme, dealing Scullin) with respect to the general position in connection with the averaging of incomes. ""We are not, as some honourable members appear to think, attempting to grapple Avith a very difficult problem without the possession of the necessary information. The whole question was reviewed by the Taxation which presented a report to Parliament in 1922. It endeavoured to arrive at a basis that would be as near as possible to absolute equity. It considered the British scheme, with which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has suggested that he has a considerable measure of sympathy. Mr Bruce. that scheme the income of a taxpayer was averaged over a period to determine the amount upon which tax should be paid. None of the Commissioners made a recommendation in its favour. I venture to suggest that no I have very little doubt that their judgment was influenced to a great extent by evidence that was readily available to them at the time with respect to its disastrous effects on falling incomes. receives the benefit, but when it is downwards, he is handicapped by the higher amount he has earned in previous years. Britain began to drop, and the adverse effect of the system was then made manifest. The Commission recommended Commonwealth, and became law. That was to average incomes for the purpose of determining the rate of tax which should be paid. One of the arguments advanced in support of that system is that a man's capacity to pay is best judged by considering the income of the year in which he makes payment; and that if account is taken of incomes earned in previous years, when determining the rate to be paid, you arrive at a more just method of dealing with irregular incomes. A minority of the commission, consisting of Mr Warren Kerr, Mr Duffy, and Mr Mills, preferred the system of setting off or carrying forward losses. It must be remembered, too, that the scheme which we have before us to-day was considered by that commission. The following is an extract from its reportchiefly with minor phases, were submitted by several witnessesa full description of which would swell this report unnecessarily-and were fully discussed and considered, and after careful examination rejected. They included a proposal that a system of five-yearly averages be adopted for primary producers, each quinquennium to be treated as quarantined from all preceding and succeeding years, that tax be tentatively collected on the income of Commission each year as at present, but the whole of the period to be reveiwed at the end of the five years, the average income of the period ascertained, such average to be applied to each year as though the income of each year had been an unvarying sum. That is practically the scheme we are now considering, the only difference being that Under the honourable memberproposes that it shall have a general application and not be confined to primary producers. The report continuesAmended assessments were then to be made in respect of each of the years of the period and any balance shown when compared with the interim payments was to be paid to or refunded by the department in final adjustment. second quinquennium to be dealt with exactly like its predecessor and so on. neither in accordance with sound principles nor reasonably practicable in administration, was rejected by us. It ""will thus be seen that the royal commission made a thorough examination of all systems, and endeavoured to arrive at a greater measure of equity between regular and irregular incomes. had before it this particular scheme, and was able to consider also the principles of taxation that were in operation in other countries. gentleman would not contend that it was precisely the same principle. on the subject it is perfectly clear that alshould make provision for a taxation susthough there may be minor differences in detail, the essential principles are the same. The members of the royal commission examined the taxation systems of practically every country in the world, and they had clearly in their minds the principles that should govern a taxation system designed to bring about a greater measure of equity. That commission rejected the proposal of the honourable member for Forrest, and the system that it recommended was adopted by the Government. We have had experience of that system and we are now proposing to add to the recommendation of the majority of the commission that cf the minority by allowing for the carrying over of losses. On the evidence before us, we would be ill advised to pass the amendment moved by the honourable member for Forrest. There is one further factor, and I have no recollection whether the royal commission dealt with it. Possibly not, because it concerns the provision of the financial requirements of this country. The scheme proposed by the honourable member for Forrest, provides, in certain circumstances, for large refunds of taxation. .Let me give an example. If a severe drought occurred at the end of five years of prosperity, the consequent losses would more than absorb the heavy taxation collected during that period. In that event, what possibility would there be of the Government meeting the tremendous demand on the revenues of the country for refunds of taxation? I therefore suggest The sixth year was to commence a that from a practical and financial point of view the scheme proposed by the honThis, being orable member for Forrest would be exceedingly complicated and would involve serious financial danger in time oi stress. I hope that the committee will not include it in the bill. MT. THEODORE (Dalley) [4.341 -The difficulty that the Prime Minister sees It in meeting financial demands that may be made upon the consolidated revenue fund in consequence of one year of distress and the many refunds that may have to be made, I think could be met if it were the only difficulty.

The Prime Minister has endeavoured to show that the principle of averaging incomes is unsound. He quoted an early decision or recommendation of the Royal Commission on Taxation to the effect that the averaging scheme was not in accordance with sound ^principles nor was it reasonably practicable in demonstration. The commission certainly did not show that the averaging system was at variance with any sound principles of taxation. Indeed, all the arguments and facts put forward show the system to be demonstrably sound. I admit that there is considerable doubt about its practicability, and the memorandum prepared apparently by the Commonwealth taxation authorities shows how difficult it would he to operate such a system.

As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said, if the system is sound in principle, and if injustice is done in many cases, we should honestly face this problem even if it means the overhaul of the income taxation laws. An examination of the memorandum will show that there are great complexities and overwhelming difficulties arising out of rebates that vary according to the nature of the funds from which dividends are paid. There are difficulties because of the intricacies of primary exemption, and the varying rate of taxation in different years. difficulty, because so many taxpayers are concerned. It would certainly be of adadvantage to have our taxation laws more simple than they are to-day. I cannot see any necessity for discriminating between the rates on property income and personal exertion income. Whatever the class of income, whatever the source from what it is derived, it could be taxed at the one rate without doing any great injustice to the community or to the Commonwealth. The lack of a uniform rate is one of the fruitful causes of complexities in operating the system of averaging as proposed by the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse). The honourable member for Yarra Scullin) has advised the Committee to affirm the principle of averaging incomes, even if it necessitates a complete redrafting of the income tax laws of the Commonwealth to bring them into conformity. If only a few taxpayers were concerned there would not be much justification for the system; but it would apply probably to 90 per cent, of the taxpayers, whose incomes vary from year to year, or at any rate over a five years' period. We should adopt the most equitable system, because income taxation is an important source of revenue to the Commonwealth. That form of taxation will endure, as the Treasurer acknowledged when introducing the measure. We shall remain in the field of income taxation for a great many years, if not always. The law should be made workable, fair, Mr Theodore. I admit that under our and rational. Under the circumstances I am inclined to accept the advice of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) and to cast a vote in favour of the amendment moved by the honourable member for.Forrest( Mr Prowse). The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) referred to a statement that I made five or six years ago respecting his system of income taxation. I absolutely believed in that system at that time, and I still think it is one of the best schemes evolved. But since the Royal Commission on Taxation presented its report and accommodations, new systems, and methods of taxation have been adopted, and anomalies have been removed in consequence. It is a matter of progression These will result in great of ordinary thought. The honourable member for Forrest deserves credit for submitting his scheme to the Committee. He honestly believes that it is the best system of income taxation. If I disagree with him-and I do not say that I do-that does not prove that the system then advocated by me was wrong. The figures apparently show that the scheme proposed by the honourable member for Forrest would work out fairly evenly; but, after all, there are few people on so-called fixed incomes that would not at sometime or other have to come under the averaging system. A person who starts on wages knows that his income will gradually increase year by year. ( Mr Provided that he works hard, his income must increase, and on the averaging system at the end of five years he would really be paying less taxation under the averaging system proposed by the honourable member than he would under the proposal of the Treasurer. A vast number of people'suffer loss, not through unemployment, but through drought. Losses are sustained also through bad business methods. Pastoralists in Queensland average a loss every four years and in other States, at longer intervals. There is, however, a certain average income. A man about to invest in a sheep or cattle proposition does not buy on the basis of a £10,000 profit in a particular year, but on an average profit of £1,500 or £2,000 as the case may be. In days gone by he paid income tax on the £10,000 in the bountif u l year, and when he incurred losses he",61,Section Is

Under the conditions existing in Queensland to-day the scheme of the honourable member for Swan would fail. Pastoral conditions vary in each State and in different divisions of a State. If taxation computations are to be strictly confined within a five-year periodone-year period. heavy losses such as have occurred in Queensland were sustained in the fifth year there would be no means under the honourable member's proposal of giving redress to the taxpayer. In the sixth year a new five-year period would commence and the losses would not be carried forward. Under the Government's scheme if there had been an excess of losses over the five-years' period or a loss only in the fifth year, there would be a chance of the taxpayer recouping himself in the sixth, seventh or eighth year. Any one of the schemes mentioned in the report of the royal commission will show benefits on one set of figures and disadvantages on another set. Each and every one has some drawback. Apart from the experts in the Taxation Department, there are professional men throughout Australia whose business is the study of taxation schemes from the point of view of their clients. I received a letter recently from the United Graziers' Association in Queensland containing a recoinmendation by the Taxation Advisory Committee, the chairman of which is MrM . S. Herring, who was at one time a solicitor in New South Wales and later became a taxation expert and manager of one of the biggest financial concerns in Queensland. That comaging of rates, and this is the recommendation made to the United Graziers' AsThe proposed method of carrying forward of losses (in conjunction with the present system of averaging for rate purposes) is considered to be superior to the alternative proposal for the averaging of incomes over a period of five years for the following reasons(1) It w i ll be equally beneficial in its effects in the years following a drought. (2) It w ill generally result in graziers being called upon to pay their share of taxation at the time when they are best able to do so. (3) It w ill not, as in the case of the proposed averaging of incomes, result in /taxpayers in a time of drought being called upon to pay heavy taxes in respect of incomes derived some years previously. (4) It is more practicable than, the proposed averaging of incomes. The present system has not realized all that was expected of it, but the conjunction of the two-the carrying forward of losses and the averaging for rate purposes -seem s to be, in the opinion of experts who have investigated this matter for their clients, the best that can be devised, although other schemes might prove better in particular circumstances.

This amendment is considered to he very necessary because of the great difficulty experienced by the commissioner in satisfying himself that there has been avoidance of tax by fraud or an attempted evasion, as required by the present wording of the law. Very great delays have arisen in dealing with cases which, prima facie, should be subject to amendment of assessment, because of the necessity for the commissioner to satisfy himself, in order that he might subsequently satisfy the court if so required, that there is reason to believe that tax has been avoided by fraud or attempted evasion. In very many instances tax is avoided by the omission of income, and experience has shown that the omission has been due to intent in some cases, carelessness in others, and ignorance in the rest. It is'not possible for the department readily to discover cases of omitted income, and these frequently are not found out until an investigation is made of the taxpayer's books and accounts. work is considerable, however, and as the staff of investigating officers available for the work is not large, long delays often take place before underpayment of income tax is discovered. wealth department take advantage of the investigations made by the States? ern Australia, the State officers do all the collecting work for the Commonwealth. It may not be readily possible to discover evidence which would give reason to believe that avoidance of tax had happened through fraud or attempted evasion, and therefore the taxpayers who have escaped the payment of proper tax cannot be required to pay that which should have been paid, because of the expiration of the statutory time limit, before the discrepancies are discovered in their returns or before amendments of assessments can be made on information collected.

The board visits the various States, thereby expediting and cheapening the process of hearing appeals. In the course of its duties, the board must necessarily deal with what may be termed questions of law. Whether an assessment is rightly marie depends largely upon whether the act has heen properly interpreted. There are legal men on the board, and occasionally it has caused important decisions to he upset. I can recall at least four cases during the last few months in which the Commissioner appealed against decisions of the board, and the board was upheld by the High Court. The Government now proposes to alter that procedure, and practically to remove from the board the right to give decisions based on legal interpretations. The proposed amendment provides that. . . . The board shall, upon the request of the Commissioner or a taxpayer, refer to the High Court any question of law arising before the board, and the decision of the High Court thereon shall be final and conclusive. A case may be part heai'd by the board, but the Commissioner has power to step in and say, "" This matter involves a question of law, and we desire to refer it to the High Court."" That is done. The proceedings are held up until the High Court has heard the reference, and the applicant for relief is mulcted in heavy expenses in defending the case before the High Court. stances, he would surely have the right to withdraw his appeal? well be used as a strong lever to cause him to withdraw his application. The prospect of being involved in heavy expense might cause him to prefer such a course. That would deprive him of the relief that he had a right to expect from the board. If the board gives a decision against the commissioner, as was done in the cases to which I have referred, it is competent for the Government to take the case to the High Court. Then it is merely an appeal from the decision of the board, and the applicant for relief is not involved in any expense. That is a very different matter from taking an undecided matter from the Board of Appeal to the High Court, and throwing the onus of defence upon the taxpayer. The High Court may be sitting in one of the eastern States, and the taxpayer resident in Western Australia. He would then either have to bear the expense of proceeding to the eastern State, or wait until the High Court visited Western Australia.

But I direct the attention of the Attorney-General to the phrasing of the clause. The Commissioner may require the board to refer to the High Court any question of law that arises upon an appeal by a taxpayer. Any subsequent proceedings cannot alter the fact that the taxpayer is still the appellant. before the High Court the commissioner in a reference at his instigation is what is called in law the actor and is regarded as the person who has moved the court. In the event of his failure to secure the support of the court to the view that he puts forward he would normally be ordered to pay the costs of I agree that that is the reference. Success generally carries costs; it is in the discretion of the court to say by whom the costs shall he paid. I suggest that it is better not to disturb the general rule. am inclined to the view that has been put forward by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore). He has stated the case of a taxpayer who appeals against an assessment to the Board of Review, and because the commissioner decides to have tested any question of law that arises he is prevented from prosecuting the appeal until the decision of the High Court has been obtained. The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) argued from the opposite standpoint, and based his remarks on the supposition that the reference to the High Court was made at the instance of the taxpayer. Many taxwhen they lodge an appeal with the Board of Review they probably give no thought to the possibility of further proceedings before a higher tribunal. It is not fair that they should be involved in heavy costs. I hope that the Attorney-General will give further consideration to the matter. There is another point. The clause states that ""the decision of the High Court thereon shall be final and conwill not lie to the Privy Council? If so, it will be the first occasion on which Parliament has legislated in that way. I am fully in accord with the principle, but the members of the legal profession their earnings. I believe that the majority of the people of Australia hold the view that the High Court should be the final tribunal to interpret the laws that are made by this Parliament.

210,Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [5.42],"I point that has been raised. At the outset I wish to say that I resent the suggestion that I indicated that the Commissioner of .Taxation would be likely to display vindictiveness. I am the last person who would make such a suggestion. The administration of that gentleman has come under my observation. His fairness and that of his department is creditable, and has never been questioned by me. Honourable members are entitled to place before the committee the viewpoint of not only the Taxation Department but also the taxpayers. The taxpayers have as much right to express a corporate judgment as have followers of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) to make their views articulate through unions. Such a practice tends towards clarity rather than confusion. The point I wish to emphasize is that this board was designed to function as a Board of Beview in respect of assessments by the commissioner that were called in question by taxpayers, and on the whole it has functioned satisfactorily. Although its decisions have sometimes been tested that has not in any way detracted from its general usefulness. If the clause is agreed to the value of the board to the taxpayer will be largely discounted. I recognize that the right of appeal must rest with both parties. But under this proposal the matter may be taken out of the hands of the board and referred to the High Court before a decision upon the merits and facts has been given. that that will be done at an earlier stage than otherwise would be the.case. if either party should wish to obtain the opinion of the High Court. Thus a saving will be effected in both time and money. case before the board of review a point of law may arise and the proceedings be suspended until the decision of the High Court is given. In that way the usefulness of the board will be undermined, and rather than face litigation the taxpayer will accept what may be considered the arbitrary assessment of the Taxation Commissioner. A period of financial stringency may take place. The commissioner is high and dry above the head of torney-General has said that the amendthe Government, but there is sometimes ment has been inserted with a view to consultation between the Treasurer and the commissioner, especially when Treasury funds are running low, as to how much revenue is required and how quickly it may be collected. A suggestion to hurry up may be given to the commissioner, and the fine generosity which the Treasurer at other times has shown to the taxpayers of Australia may possibly cease. In times of stress I fear that the use of legislative machinery of this description may be resorted to, thus depriving the board of review of its effectiveness and the general taxpayers of a cheap and ready means of appeal. It costs the taxpayers nothing to have their cases dealt with by the board. After all, it is the man who provides the sinews of war for this country who should receive our consideration. -1 support the view of the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers). As I understand the position, the board of review was originally constituted to provide a ready means of redress to taxpayers, and to enable them to approach taxation experts or authorities for a decision. 2fb one will deny that the High Court should be the final arbiter on matters in dispute, and the point for decision by this committee now seems to me to be the time at which the board should intervene. Under the act, the board of review deals with a case and gives its decision; and that, I submit, is the preferable method. If I , as a taxpayer, approach the board of review, I may find myself suddenly confronted with an action in the High Court and compelled to brief counsel, involving the possibility of considerable expense if the decision is given against me. Of course, in any case, there is the possibility of litigation at a later stage; but I consider that it is preferable that the decision of the board should be given before any appeal is made to the High Court. I am now constrained to this view, as I understand a number of appeals by the commissioner from the decision of the board of review have been decided against him. I suggest that the provision in the act should be left as it stands.",68,Section Is

How can the proposed method of appeal he more expeditious, cheaper, or more convenient for the taxpayer than the present method? It seems to me that it must involve more trouble and expense. What was the object of the review at all? Before the Board of Beview was appointed a taxprayer could appeal to the High Court. appointed to lessen trouble and expense, by hearing cases and dealing with facts. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said, its proper function is to determine not the law but the facts. We know that decisions on facts frequently depend upon the interpretation of the law. When a taxpayer puts his case before the board, it gives its decision on the interpretation of the law and the facts connected with it. If its decision is questioned, then an appeal can be made to the High Court. Under the proposed procedure the High Court apparently has no jurisdiction on the facts, but can be referred to on law even before the board has come to any decision on the facts. An applicant may be dragged to the High Court on a point of law, and that court, having interpreted the law, the board must determine the facts. That procedure means delay and expense. The Attorney-General has said that it is of advantage to approach the High Court at an early stage, but the taxpayer regards these matters from a different point of view. The general desire is to keep away from the court as much as possible. The ordinary taxpayer has no idea of how much.his case depends upon facts or upon law until he is before the board, whose duty it is to assist the taxpayer by clearly separating the facts from the law, and giving its opinion accordingly.

The board as constituted at premember is wrong. sent is acceptable to both parties as far as I can gather, although either may lose its case at times.

That body may give its decision in favour of the taxpayer, and when the case again comes before the Board of Review, the taxpayer may lose on the facts, and probably have to pay some portion of the heavy costs involved in approaching the High Court.

It will certainly alter proceedings in hearing appeals. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) suggested that it would be possible for the taxpayer to win his case before the High Court on the law, and to return to the board only to lose his case on the facts.

Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. was almost impossible to follow so comprehensive an amendment as that put before us by the Attorney-General without seeing it on paper. I think it ought to have been circulated. However, I believe I understand the substance of it. This is a fundamental departure from a well established practice of law. The Crown has no more right than any other creditor at law to assume the position of assessor, taxing master, collector, sheriff, and bailiff in connection with a deceased person's estate. The proper procedure is that which has to be followed in law by every creditor of a deceased person's estate, and that is, where representation has not heen raised in the ordinary course of law, for the Curator of Intestate Estates to be moved to take out letters of administration of the estate. The taxing master has then some principal with whom to deal. It is far too wide a power for the Commissioner of Taxation to assume to levy taxation upon an estate, to follow that up with certain statutory notices or advertisements, and then, instead of raising representation to the estate, to proceed to distrain on the assets, dispose of them, and satisfy the tax, and possibly by enforced sale destroy the equity. He should be in the same position as every other creditor in law. The Crown should see that representation is raised to an estate hy an authority constituted for the purpose. When a deceased person has died intestate, or his estate has not been administered, or is not sufficient to meet liabilities, the ordinary practice is that representation should be made by the Curator of In testate Estates, who shall raise the proper representation within the State. The Crown then takes up the ordinary position of a creditor at law. When interested persons are absent from Australia, they may never see the prescribed notices; but if the course I suggest is adopted when there is no representation to an estate, the Crown, as represented by the Commonwealth, will move the authority in the State, and a trustee will be appointed who will guard the estate. The taxing master would not be likely to make the most effective realization possible of the assets by forced sale. His only concern would be to satisfy the tax. I hope the Attorney General will reconsider his amendment, and frame it in such a way as will safeguard the possible interest of relatives or beneficiaries of deceased persons, while, at the same time, safeguarding the rights of the Crown in respect of the tax. General [8.10] -This provision will apply only in very special cases. In all the States there are officials known as curators of intestate estates or persons who discharge the functions of such curators. They are generally paid by fees, and the fees depend on the value of the estates' administered. It is to their interest to see that there is representation to every estate.

Buti f this provision is not inserted, there will be no method by ""which the Crown can take any action where no representation is made to an estate. It is to the interest of a Curator of Intestate Estates to take out letters of administration. The Commonwealth is not a creditor until an assessment has been duly made and served. As the law now stands, however, there would not be any one to assess in the cases we have been considering. Therefore the Commonwealth would be quite helpless unless some special provision were made. The Commonwealth is not able to legislate on such matters as the taking out of probate or letters of adallowed before action is taken, but at the ministration. I think the dangers which the honourable member foresees are very recan make an order which is final and mote, and are most unlikely to occur. In the amendment, provision is made for the giving of due publicity; so that interested are debarred from raising any action parties shall have an opportunity to come forward and appeal in the ordinary way. This provision will apply only in exceptional circumstances, and I think its inclusion is justified. The Attorney-General's explanation does not alter the method of levying taxation. I would suggest to him that he insert in his amendment a provision to the effect that the Curator of Intestate Estates should receive notification in these cases. That would be an additional safeguard for any outstanding interests. It is possible on a ing of something nearer home than the realization of this description for any equity in an estate to be sacrificed. the advertisement. make it an obligation that the curator is an involved estate to administer. It is be notified. To levy on a property for quite a common thing not to have sale is to take extreme steps, and where gathered up the threads of the estate and there is any possibility of saving outstanding interests, I think the giving of obtained probate by that time even notice to the curator would be an addi-' where there is no litigation.

I think there is a good deal ( Mr Rodgers) has pointed out one in the contention also of the honourable difficulty which may arise out of this amendment.

The difiiculty applies equally to those cases in which there is no m i l , and those in which there is representation of an intestate estate. It is possible that there may be prolonged litigation over the granting of probate of a will or letters of administration of an estate. Nobody knows better than the Attorney-General how long and involved such litigation may be. A variety of interests may be involved, and these interests can be determined, perhaps, only after the conclusion of the litigation.

This matter was discussed on the second reading of the bill, and I do not propose again to traverse the same ground. This is the only portion of the bill, in addition to clause 11, which provides that absentee shareholders shall be fully exempted from paying income tax on profits earned in Australia. At present the company concerned is called upon to pay such tax, and it collects, if it can, from the absentee shareholders. It has been argued that companies not registered in Australia are unable to collect, and that, even when they are registered in Australia, they experience difficulty in collecting the tax from absentee shareholders. To date the onus has been placed upon the company I can assure the to pay the tax, and it must collect as best it can. If it'is unable to collect, that is a matter between itself and its shareholders. The important fact is that the income is earned in Australia, and it should be taxable here, and provide revenue for our Treasury. The only tax that we impose upon companies is a flat rate of Is. in the £1. That may be sufficient when applied to some shareholders, but it is totally inadequate when applied to a I would good many. The Treasurer has advanced a number of reasons in support of this provision, but his principal reason is that we must encourage capital to come to Australia. That is not a sound reason for the exemption of these profits from taxation.

Three classes of companies are operating in Australia. First there are the companies which are registered in Britain, and which have their directorate and head office there, and declare their dividends there; secondly there are the companies which are registered in Britain but have their directorate in Australia and declare their dividend here. Thirdly, there are the purely Australian companies, which are registered have their directorate here, and declare their dividends here. The bulk of the capital of companies of the first class is subscribed by absentees resident in Britain. ""We are unable to levy a tax upon those shareholders, and cannot impose one on the company itself, for it is beyond our jurisdiction. Companies of the second class are more desirable from the Australian point of view than those of the first class. The major part of their capital is also subscribed in Britain, hut they have come to the conclusion thai as their main operations are in Australia it is desirable that their directorate and control should be here. The position of these companies, from the taxation standpoint, is that their absentee shareholders are liable for Australian taxation; but Ave have no power to compel them to pay taxes. All that we can do is to compel the companies to pay it, although they may have no power to recover it from the persons concerned. their articles of association. in the least. If companies of these two classes are competitors, it is hardly fair to oblige the Australian-controlled companies to pay taxation in respect of their absentee shareholders while the Britishcontrolled companies cannot be compelled to pay it. The Government considers that it would be grossly unfair to tax one class of company and not the other, for those with Australian organization are doing something more than the others for Australia. Assuming that companies of both classes are relieved from taxation, I do not think any one would contend for a moment that it would be equitable to tax the purely Australian company which has to compete with the others. The Australian company is unquestionably the most desirable of all from our point of view, and Ave should encourage rather than discourage it. To make it pay income tax in respect of its absentee shareholders, when we know that it has no power to recover from them, would be most unjust. The Government is of the opinion that, as it is not possible to tax absentee shareholders in the first type of company, and not equitable to tax them in the second type of company, it would be a hardship on the Australian companies to compel them to pay taxation for Avhich their absentee shareholders are liable. It is for those reasons that this clause has been included in the bill. The Avider question of the desirableness of granting a statutory exemption to absentees does not arise under the clause, and Ave can deal Avith it when it is before us. The amendment of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) deserves earnest consideration. I can see no reason why Ave should exempt absentee shareholders in Australian companies from taxation because Ave cannot tax absentee shareholders in companies registered in Great Britain but operating here. There is no justification for exempting any absentees. The people who should receive first consideration Avhen exemptions are being proposed are those Avho live in Australia, and the last who deserve it are those who derive large incomes from investments here, and live abroad. From the point of view of equity, the absentee should certainly be taxed at least as heavily as the shareholder resident in Australia absentee shareholders, the Australian shareholders will be obliged to pay it. be obliged to pay a certain portion of it, for provision is made in clause 18, to adjust the incidence of the tax.

Such share-' holders derive their income from Australia, and should be prepared to pay taxation upon it. If this amendment is agreed to, the revenue of the country will be considerably increased. Persons who make large incomes from any project in which they have money invested in Australia should be prepared to pay taxation upon them, whether they live here or elsewhere. The Treasurer urged that the amendment should be rejected on quite different grounds from those advanced by the Prime Minister. said that if the amendment were approved it would be an inducement to outside people to put their capital in Australian investments. as ridiculous were I to say that if we permit these people to go free from taxation, while we tax Australian citizens, we induce our people to reside outside Australia, because they would not then be liable to taxation here. Assuming that the rate of tax was 2s. or 2s. 6d. in the £1, it might be better for those people to spend their time in the enjoyment of comfort and pleasure in the south of France, by means of the income ' they derive from Australia, secure in the knowledge that they will not be taxed. I can as well say that the amendment is an inducement to people to leave Australia as the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) to say that it is an inducement to people to invest here. taxed by Australia on the interest they collect from moneys they lend to her, no matter where they live. from deriving a direct income from an investment in this country. Surelyi f it is fair to tax the Australian citizen who derives an income from company investments in Australia, absentees who participate in the profits that are made by those same companies should be called upon to pay an' equal amount. There can be no warrant for exempting the individual who happens to live abroad. The tax can be collected from the company before its dividends are disbursed. In respect of an Australian citizen we provide that if the rate which he would be charged according to his income is less than that which is paid by the company, a rebate shall be made by the Commissioner of Taxation. Therefore, no injustice is done to him. A similar provision could be made applicable to absentees. Any person who gains a material advantage from investment in this country should not object to contribute towards its revenues These individuals invest their money in Australia because they believe it will confer upon them a greater advantage than would investment in other He countries.

If we continue this practice of relieving from taxation not only absentees, but also our own people, the loss of revenue will be considerable. Our financial position is such that we cannot afford these exemptions. I hope that we shall be able to foster our industries in such a way that our imports will be materially curtailed. If that should happen, and the customs revenue should drop, how are we going to finance our operations? We sometimes forget that the income-tax law was passed to enable us to meet the obligations that were placed upon us by the recent war. not The Commonwealth is now collecting from this source £7,000,000 per annum less than it did at one period, notwithstanding the fact that its interest bill is £2,500,000 greater than it was at the termination of the war. Nobody knows what the future holds in store. I have no desire to be pessimistic; but I assert that no honourable member can view the present trend of events with a feelingof confidence in the immediate future.

General) [8.53] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has addressed himself to the clause in a manner that suggests that it favours absentees against Australians. That is not the position. It must be recognized that there are limits to the legislative power of an Australian parliament. The difficulty with which the amending provision is designed to deal has arisen from certain decisions of the English courts which, shortly, are to the effect that where a contract which has been entered into between a shareholder and a company which is not an Australian contract, an Australian parliament cannot legislate is such a way as to affect or alter it. Turner was heard in the English courts. An English company which was carrying on business in Queensland had certain preference stock-holders who were entitled to interest at the rate of 6 per cent. Some of those stock-holders resided in England, others apparently in Queensland. The decision of the English courts referred to the English stockholders. The Queensland Parliament passed an act imposing a tax in the nature of an income tax on all dividends or interest paid out of assets in the colony, as it then was, to the members of companies carrying on business therein. That act declared that the tax collected in respect of any dividend or interest payable to a shareholder should be a debt due to him from the Crown. The company, in compliance with the act, deducted the tax from the dividend or interest payable to the English stockholders. They sued the company for the ful l amount, and obtained a judgment in their favour. to the practice? member will allow me, I shall deal first mittee hy the Leader of the Opposition. I do not object to the with the law. The result was that, although the company had to pay the tax, it could not recover it from the absentee shareholders. A similar decision was given last year by Mr Justice Tomlinreported in the Law Reports for 1927.in which it was expressly held that a Commonwealth income tax which was paid by a company under these provisions could not be recovered from the English shareholders. Therefore those shareholders receive their dividends in full, whatever may be the provision of the Australian law. That is a position which we are unable to affect by any alteration of our law, because it does not operate in Great Britain. The alteration that we now propose to make does not, therefore, improve the position of the absentee shareholder as against the Australian shareholder or anybody else. On the contrary, it leaves those shareholders where they stand to-day. What, then, will be its effect? It is designed to relieve a company that has absentee shareholders from the necessity to pay tax at the rate that is applicable to the absentee shareholder and to place on an In 1897 the case of Spiller and equal footing in this respect those who have absentee shareholders and those who have not. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) has dealt with that aspect of the matter, and I have .no wish to repeat what he has said. I rose merely to make it clear that the aim of this legislation is to deal with a situation that does not arise from and and cannot be affected by Australian law, and that the advantage proposed to be conferred is not in favour of absentees as against Australian citizens. I shall add only one further remark. If , without unfairness to our own citizens-and I have endeavoured to show that that is the position-w e can make this country attractive to the investor abroad, it is desirable to do so.

General cannot uphold that statement. The Prime Minister and the Attorney General have said that in the case of a company established and registered abroad, whose shareholders are absentees, and whose profits arise in Australia, and are distributed as dividends abroad, the Oommonwealth has no jurisdiction to collect any tax whatever. The Prime Minister said that .the tax could not be collected from either the company or the shareholder. not General is relying upon some technical point in respect of the company; but does he suggest that, in the case of such a company operating in Australia, whose income is derived in Australia and paid in dividends abroad, the Commonwealth would have no authority to tax that income in Australia? Take certain foreign insurance companies that are trading in Australia. The State Governments are to-day taxing them even though their rate of profit is not known, nor can it be calculated. They are taxed at a fixed rate, say at 7-J per cent., on riving all its profits from the Auspremium income.

If the bill is given effect, what is to prevent Anglo-Australian or The directorate, in Australia, and perhaps declare their dividends in Australia, from opening a share register in London, New York or Hong Kong, appointing a directorate there, taking their funds out of Australia, and declaring their dividends elsewhere? Every absentee shareholder of such companies would then be removed from the ambit of Australian taxation. What foolish companies they would be if they did not take advantage of this proposed law. Take the case of former Australian citizens now residing in England or America, and .deriving large dividends from Australia. A t present they are taxable in Australia.

What is to prevent any purely Australian company, if this provision is passed, from forming a company in Hongkong or elsewhere, registering it there, and providing that that company become a holding company, detralian company, paying its dividends in respect of the new company, and thus escaping taxation under the Commonwealth law?

In 1926 the amount of taxable profits in Australia under Commonwealth law was £59,000,000, according to the Income Tax Commissioner's report. A large proportion of that is payable to absentees. Most of the principal banks in Australia are Anglo-Australian institutions, and most of the large insurance companies have absentee shareholdersL Nearly all the large land, mortgage, and mercantile companies, the large pastoral companies, and large mining and trading corporations have oversea share registers, and the amount of the dividends that go out of Australia in the aggregate must be large indeed; and,-so far as I can see, this provision will been well known to the taxation authoriexempt them from taxation.

Recently fresh capital to the extent of £650,000 was raised in London. In addition, English shareholders have been buying shares and transferring them to the London register, so to the extent of over £1,000,000. This company will, therefore, he largely reprecomes will be exempt from taxation under this provision. Has the Government contemplated that aspect, and does it really intend to extend the exemptions so far? This concession is entirely unwarranted. There is not a tittle of justification for it , and the explanation given by the Treasurer in his second-reading speech was a confession of sheer helplessness. Because the Government foresaw some difficulty in collecting taxation from absentee shareholders, it decided to take them entirely out of the field of income taxation! The Attorney-General quoted a well-known Queensland case of 1897 as a justification for this law. Did he overlook the fact that that case must have ties and those advising the Commonwealth when the first income taxation law was propounded? Absentee shareholders have been subject to taxation for the last ten years, and for more than twenty years in the States. The Attorney-General also made a passing reference to a more recent case of 1926, but how that presented a further difficulty than the earlier case of 1897 he did not explain. I admit that there may be some hardship on companies that have to pay taxation in Australia and are unable to recoup themselves from shareholders residing in England or elsewhere, but I submit that there is a remedy. The members of the company control their own affairs and they can alter their articles and memorandum of association. If one class of shareholder gets an advantage over another, I think that the general body of shareholders can supply the remedy. If the shareholders in England will not consent to any change in the articles of association, the company may continue to suffer, but that is no justification for the Commonwealth authorities exempting absentee shareholders from taxation on Australian dividends.

One cannot ignore the significant sequence of events in the development of nationalist policy-first , the whittling away of the powers of the Commonwealth Bank, in order to prevent it from competing with private banking institutions; secondly, the determination to sell the Commonwealth ships and so remove a competitor of the private companies; thirdly, the reduction of direct currently, the increase of indirect taxation which falls upon the shoulders of the workers; and, lastly, this proposal to capitalists who have invested in Australian companies. Prime Minister and the Attorney General said that the provision now before the committee would place Australian companies on an equal footing with their competitors. I have in mind an Adelaide company which is peculiarly well circumstanced and has no competitors. When, as secretary of the Labour party in Adelaide, I applied to the Registrar of Companies for the share list of the Adelaide Electric Light Company, I was informed that I could .not get it as the company was registered in England. That company has a monopoly of electric lighting in Adelaide and suburbs. The municipal tramways generate much more electricity than they require, and could supply the people with cheap electric current, but the act under which the Adelaide Electric Light Company operates gives it exclusive rights in respect of the sale of this commodity. The Legislative Council, of which the Honourable George Brookman, one of the biggest shareholders, was a member, took good care of that. If the Government's proposal is agreed to, the English shareholders will pay no income taxation in respect of the profits derived from this South Australian company, and at the same time the Liberal Government in South Australia is reducing the general exemption under the State Income Assessment Act from £150 to £100.

I hope the committee will realize the significance of the Government's proposal. not yet convinced by the arguments advanced in support of the proposed amendment. British and American capital is invested in this country, and from the dividends derived from foreignowned, but locally operated, companies, the Commonwealth derives considerable revenue in the form of income taxation. ""Whoever pays the money, the Treasurer gets it. If this revenue is abandoned, it will have to be recovered from purely Australian sources. There is a saying that "" an old tax is a good tax;"" if it is a hardship, it is an accepted come taxation, but that the Australian one. Certainly this particular form of taxation has not stopped; the flow of money into Australia, and I am not disposed to see it removed. The Treasurer is deriving revenue from the silver, lead, pastoral and great insurance companies, amongst many others, and the British investors have apparently been perfectly satisfied for many years to pay this taxation. A t any rate, I have heard no clamour from them for its removal. The Attorney-General has explained to the committee the English law upon the subject. I would not presume to contest the honourable gentleman's legal knowledge, but I do know that if one of the BrokenH ill companies for instance, declares a quarterly dividend of 2s., tax free, the shareholders in Australia and Great Britain alike get it. It may be that the company pays the income tax on behalf of the British shareholder; but whatever the internal arrangement is, both classes of shareholders receive the same return for their investment. Can the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) give the committee an assurance that the law will operate in the same way in regard to American, Chinese, or other foreign shareholders in companies operating in Australia? If he cannot, on that ground alone I shall be reluctant to approve of this proposal. American investments in this country have increased in recent years, and are continually expanding, aud I shall strongly resist any effort to place the American investor upon a better footing than the Australian investor. any. income tax in respect of dividends paid to shareholders abroad in British or foreign companies operating in Australia. Millions of pounds of gentleman is referring to companies registered in and operated from Great Britain, but many great companieswith British and foreign shareholders are operated from within Australia, and their directorates are here. For instance, the Goodyear Company has recently been formed in Sydney, with a great deal of American capital and an Australian directorate. The Government proposal is that the American capital invested in that company shall escape inshareholders shall pay. I do not believe the Australian people will tolerate discrimination of that character. The Treasurer has stated in justification of the proposal that it will encourage the inflow of overseas capital to Australia to assist in the development of the country. That argument is sound so far as it goes, but although a decision not to tax dividends payable to overseas investors in Australian companies may prove an inducement to foreign capitalists to come here, it will also be an incentive to Australian investors to leave the country and draw their dividends abroad.

We are not getting income taxation from those individual citizens in Great Britain or the United States at the present time. the companies. are only getting the taxation which we can levy on companies in general; and that taxation we can vary as we desire, provided that it is within the bounds laid down by the Constitution. It is not proposed under this section to make a present to the citizens of the United States by saying to them, ""We.used to tax you, but we shall not do so any more."" I suggest that this proposal represents a step in the right direction, and one which is going to help us in regard to investments in Australia. It will tend to produce equality of conditions among the companies operating in Australia. Prime Minister has put forward some A'ery ingenious arguments, which no doubt seemed to him convincing, but actually were not. He said that we could not tax absentee shareholders of companies. We could, hoAvever tax the companies. The company is the whole body of shareholders. company on the same basis as other companies. existing act empowers the commissioner to levy on a company in respect of any taxation payable hy any shareholder He cannot be taxed; but the company holding his dividends can be compelled to pay taxation. The same remarks apply to interest on dividends. The Minister advanced the argument that if a tax is imposed on a company which cannot pass it on to the individual, the whole of the shareholders of the company must hear the burden, and the shareholders resident in Australia would have to bear their part of it, according to the proportion of shares that they held. That is true, but stress the fact that a wrong it is the business of the Australian shareholders, and not of the Commonwealth Prime Minister gave his case away by stating that the majority of the shareholders in those companies are British residents. If that is so, not many Australians will have to pay the absentee tax. If they do find it a burden, let them transfer their money to genuine Australian companies. Those absentee shareholders are a number of individuals, grouped together under the title of a company. If we tax their company we tax them. We can, not only tax their company at the company rate of taxation, but also compel them to pay to the commissioner the proportion of tax that their absentee shares should bear. That has been done for years, and now the Government proposes to withdraAV that provision. to any companies excepting those controlled in Australia. ing applied at least to such companies. Why should it not continue? I suggest that, instead of making the suggested concessions to these companies, we should extend the scope of the existing provisions. Surely Ave have some control of the people in our country. We have the right to say to those Avho are shareholders in Australian companies, but resident abroad, and who have their agents here, ""Before we grant you any charter to operate in this country Ave make it clear that we require income tax on the profits that you make.""

Then we could tax them. well in theory. into practice. I suggest that the remedy, in the meantime, is not to exempt people from taxation which we are in a position to collect, and I trust that the amendment will be carried. The question in issue is an interesting, though an involved one. Personally, I take this as an announcement to the world that British and foreign capital invested in Australian companies will be exempt from income taxation. principle of taxing British capital has been admitted, and finds legislative form in the very act that we are discussing. Section 18 provides a mode of arrangement between the United ""Kingdom and Australia with regardcato the. duality of taxation, and clearly sets out an acknowledgment of the right of Australia to levy taxation. I cannot see any difference in principle between an obligation that applies to individuals as individuals, and an obligation that disappears if they enter into a company. A principle must apply to every subject, whether he is operating in his individual rights or through company rights. I appreciate the difficulty of collecting the tax, but I do not admit that that difficulty is insuperable. I do not know why Australia should be made the happy hunting ground for, say, the American business people. ""Were this purely a concession to the British investor it would have some merits, for, after all, when we borrow from Great Britain our principle is to pay our bonds back in Great Britain free from taxation. ""We acknowledge her right so far as her bonds are concerned, that they /hall be paid in Great Britain free from taxation. If we go further and ask the British people to come here as investors and lend to us as individuals-for it amounts to that-that is an extension of the principle, and one to which I take less exception. tax-free conditions. object to the American business people first levying gigantic tolls upon the Australian people and then getting off scotfree from taxation.

Those companies have sent to them consignments at values far in excess of their real wholesale value, and distribute them throughout"" Australia by means of "" shadow"" companies, in order that they may avoid even the declaration of a profit in Australia. That narrows down our legitimate taxation, and makes it more severe upon our own people. I am at a loss to understand what is behind the mind of the GovernThe equity of the ment so far as countries other than Britain are concerned. I believe that the best person to police the collection of these taxes is the company that is resident here, and I am convinced that the policing can be done through the company, if we impose the obligation upon it.

That may not come about immediately, but our accumulated debt, and our lighter production, that the field of direct taxation will have to be entered later, and perhaps with great severity. I ask the Government to reconsider this matter. Let the provision remain as it is. If it rests where it is it does not place on us the moral obligation not to call upon these companies when necessary. It is a power to levy taxation upon profits earned in Australia that should not be surrendered. upon which we never know when we shall have to call, in order to raise the funds necessary for the requirements of Australia. I believe that there are many legitimate companies, and particularly British companies, which follow the spirit of section 18 of the principal act, and give from taxation. It has been said that Australia a fair deal. It is just the kind of action that one expects, and has always received, from the British. British investors recognize that they have entered a legitimate field of investment in Australia. They should be on at least an equal footing with the foreigner. This seems to me to be too important a question to be allowed to go through without full discussion. I regard it as one of the most important matters that we have considered this session. UnlessI am exaggregating the importance of it, the committee are not giving it due conconsideration. The Prime Minister twice referred to the case in which a company is registered overseas, and ' distributors its dividends there. The right honourable gentleman stated that in that case we cannot tax either the shareholder or the company. I suppose that, technically, he is right. We cannot tax a company that is registered and controlled in England and not in Australia, but we certainly could tax the Australian earnings of such a company, and we could tax them on a basis that would be the equivalent of the tax that the shareholders would pay if resident in Australia. There is every justification for taxing them on that basis, otherwise shareholders resident abroad have an advantage over those resident in Australia. ' The right honourable gentle[82] It is probable that, soon, our man stated that we do not tax the shareholderSj but that the company or somebody representing the company has to pay one can see by reason of the tax. Buti f a purely British corncompany, registered in England, with directors in England, and distributing dividends in England, has agents in Australia, those agents could be required to make returns to our taxation office, and the company could be taxed upon its local profits. There are quite a large number of insurance companies trading in Australia, whose register is overseas, and whose directors and whose principal It is a reserve shareholders are resident overseas. These pew-ons have heretofore been contributing a tax on a fair and equitable basis to both the Commonwealth and the States, and no reasons have been advanced why they should not continue to do so. Under this scheme, they will be exempt they do not pay a tax now; but the fact is that they do pay, at least indirectly. Some of the companies which have absentee shareholders pay their dividends, tax free, and retain certain money out of the profits to meet taxation charges; while others pay the tax directly out of their funds, so that in one way or another the shareholders are taxed. Absentee individuals who derive income from investments in Australia have to pay income tax through their attorneys or the person whose duty it is to submit returns to the taxation commissioner. have assets in the country. It would not apply to absentees who hold shares in British companies operating here, but have no assets here. have money invested in Australia, though not in shares, are required to pay taxation here just as though they were residents. It has been said that that practice will need to be .altered in consequence of the decision of a British court; but I have not been able to discover why. All that has been put before us is that it is not fair to tax absentee shareholders because of the inability of the companies concerned to deduct the tax from the dividends which the absentees receive, as",86,Section Is

If one class of absentee can be taxed to the ful l limit to which a resident in Aushas been suffered by either companies or tralia is taxable, I submit that it should be possible to amend our law to provide that other classes of absentees may be similarly dealt with. Australians who invest in England are taxable there though they are absentees from this country; and Australian residents who derive income from investments in the United States, of America, Canada, or any foreign country where income tax is imposed, are, to the best of my knowledge, obliged to pay income tax there; so I can see no reason why we should exempt persons abroad from taxation on income which they derive from Australia. It is of no use for us to attempt to avoid realities in discussing this subject.

The taxation authorities must have some information on this point, for companies have been obliged to make returns and to pay taxation in respect of their absentee shareholders for a number of years.

It is strange that we should now be asked to amend the law in the direction suggested. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) has adopted the attitude that it will be of some assistance to British investors. I am inclined to the view that we are travelling too far in that direction. In recent years the disposition seems to be to give concessions The Prime Minister, the Attorneyto Great Britain without receiving a quid pro quo. It is about .time that we put a stop to that practice. We are all desirous of helping the Mother Country, and are prepared to extend preferences to her; but we must realize that that policy cannot be carried on at the expense of our own development. We are paying to Great Britain for the debt which we incurred to finance our war operations a higher interest rate than she is paying to the United States of America for the money which she borrowed on our account. We should be actuated by the desire to have regard first to the develophas increased. We are not in a position ment of our own country. If there is then room for any preference, it can be given to the Mother Country. It is not an answer to say that, because certain companies in other countries are free from to the British investor here. . We can impose taxation upon investors here no matter in what country they may reside. If we had not possessed that power, our law would have been challenged long ago.

The absentee investors should pay taxation on a higher scale than the resident, to encourage them to reinforce their investment by their presence in the country and their active participation in its affairs. The Prime Minister has said that British investors are taxed on the principle of what they term "" the flag."" For many years I have heard Tory politicians emphasizing Australia's obligation to the Mother Country for the protection she affords us. I have been somewhat diffident about disputing that statement, although I have always recognized that it paid the British capitalists who have invested iu Australia to have their capital adequately protected. Australia by this remission of taxation will open up another and more complete avenue for the British Government to tax for revenue-producingpurposes, and in this way a considerable sum is directly taken from the wealth of Australia, for any assistance that she receives in that way. I hope that we shall hear less in future of this class obligation to the Old Country.

The preponderance of power in regard to companies remains with the State legislatures. taxation there are no limits. the excuse that might have heen offered [83] -that there is a conflict between the various company laws of the States-doe s not apply. There is, therefore, all the more reason why we should reject the Government's proposal to exempt from taxation the wealthier sections who, although absent, extract wealth from this country. It is remarkable that since this Government assumed office, not a session has passed without a bill being introduced to exempt from taxation the wealthy sections of the community. The Treasurer said that the result of the proposed exemption would be t5 encourage Australian development. In my opinion, the people who would benefit from this exemption are of little or no value to Australia. The exemption will benefit big companies registered in London, which are doing nothing to develop Australia. The big wholesale and retail houses in this country are not truly Australian. The goods in their establishments are, for the most part branded "" Made in Germany"" or "" Made in Japan."" It is true that some of them are companies registered in Australia, but their capital comes from Britain. They would be exempted under the proposal of the Government. The only time when the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the Attorney-General remain in the chamber to discuss the details of bills in committee is when measures which will benefit their wealthy friends are being discussed. The Labour party believes that absentees should be taxed more heavily than are persons resident in Australia. Instead of assisting in the are doing much to injure Australian industries, and to benefit foreign industries. Yet they are the people whom the Government's proposals -would benefit.

The question cannot really be decided, however,' except in conjunction with clause 11, to a consideration of which we must return at a later stage. May I suggest that possibly it would be more convenient if we now postponed the further consideration of this clause and proceeded with the other clauses of the bill?

General) [10.53] drew .attention to this matter, especially in regard to the retrospective effect of the bill if the amendment which stood in the name of the Treasurer had been moved. It is not now proposed to move that amendment so as to reverse the decision in what is known as the Weatherley case. The degree of retrospection now provided for in the clause is very slight, and is, I think, justifiable. The first part provides th .t the amendment effected by section 3 of the act, which confers on the assistant commissioner and second commissioner the powers of the commissioner, shall he deemed to have commenced on the 1st June, 1924, but in no case is the right of appeal to be effected. A taxpayer has taken the point that on one occasion a decision was wrongly given because the case was heard by the assistant commissioner and not by the commissioner. The rights of that taxpayer are being preserved to him; but the act is being altered so as to confirm the powers of the assistant commissioner and the deputy commissioner in all other cases as from the year 1924. The second alteration goes back only to 1926. That is effected by the averaging principle, and I suggest that we should postpone subclause 2 of this clause until clause 7 has been dealt with. Clause postponed. Postponed clause 7.
