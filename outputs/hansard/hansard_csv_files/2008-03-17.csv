House adjourned at 9.59 pm Monday, 17 March 2008 ----Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 March, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time. Australian government. It is important to Australia in a number of ways. Firstly, the introduction of this bill is evidence that the Rudd Labor government keeps its promises. Secondly, it demonstrates the government’s commitment to ensuring that there is an open and transparent process in place for infrastructure development. Finally, it is the continuation of the great Labor tradition of investing in nation building. At its first cabinet meeting in Karratha in January of this year, the government discussed the implementation of its election promise to introduce a bill creating Infrastructure Australia. It was decided that the legislation would be introduced into the parliament at the first session. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government then introduced the bill on 21 February 2008. This initiative is one part of the government’s five-point plan to fight inflation. This broad plan to deal with Australia’s inflation problem includes aiming for a target surplus of 1.5 per cent of GDP for the upcoming financial year, looking at options to boost national savings and encourage a national savings culture in Australia, acting decisively and effectively on the national skills crisis, dealing effectively with the challenge of public infrastructure bottlenecks and acting to boost employment participation. It is only by acting decisively that we can deal with our inflation challenge. It will not be easy, but without a clear strategy pointing the way to the future, nothing will be done. The introduction of Infrastructure Australia is a significant step towards solving some of our most critical infrastructure blockages. This was a promise of Labor during the election campaign and, as with our other promises, action is occurring to ensure its implementation. The minister in his second reading speech noted the Committee of Economic Development of Australia report Growth 54: infrastructure-getting on with the job. That report highlighted their finding: The backlog of needed infrastructure projects in Australia is estimated at $25 billion worth of projects. With this much-needed investment in place, Australia’s GDP would be 0.8 per cent higher each year. That translates to $6 billion a year-or an average of $300 per Australian. The report further noted that there are adequate funds available to fix the backlog of projects, but what was lacking was the political will to do so across Commonwealth and state governments. Australia has benefited economically from a sustained period of economic growth. What has been lacking is the infrastructure to support that growth and the opportunities emerging from developing countries. The CEDA report noted that there are large capital resources accumulating in the private sector. The minister stated in a media conference on 21 January 2008 that there is $1.1 trillion MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Independent Reviewer Of Our Citizens Entrust Us With The Task Of Protect Terrorism Laws Bill 2008 Ing Them Against Crime And Terrorist Attacks How
199,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke) Took The Chair At 4.01 Pm.,,156,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
200,Mr Melham (Banks) (4.01 Pm),"I rise today to support this significant initiative of the existing in superannuation funds, which people in the superannuation industry are saying is available for investment, preferably in Australia rather than overseas. The CEDA report also commented that there is evidence of a strong linkage between infrastructure investment and economic growth. The report further states: ... investment and infrastructure generates higher returns and investment in other sectors of the economy. Infrastructure requirements fall into broad categories across the spectrum and include roads, railways, seaports, telecommunications, electricity, water and airports, to name some of the critical needs. A report from the Productivity Commission was released in February 2005. That report was the Review of national competition policy reforms. In chapter 8, the Productivity Commission outlined what it identified as opportunities to improve the efficiency of economic infrastructure through further competition based reforms. The report stated: ... in identifying a reform agenda, the Commission has targeted areas that meet three tests: being inherently national in character; offering the prospect of significant gains; and likely to benefit from a nationally agreed reform framework under the stewardship of COAG or another national leadership body. The report then continues in chapter 8 to identify key areas where it believes reform could be targeted. These include: the energy sector; the water sector; two aspects of the transport sector, the national freight system and a review of national passenger transport; and reform in the communications sector. In broader terms, the role of Infrastructure Australia will be to develop a strategic blueprint for Australia’s infrastructure needs. This will include an ongoing cooperative process across the Commonwealth, the states and industry to identify and prioritise infrastructure projects. The first task for the new body will be to conduct an audit of the nation’s infrastructure needs based on that audit. An infrastructure priority list will be established within 12 months for consideration by COAG. The role of Infrastructure Australia will be to provide advice to government through COAG as well as investors and owners of infrastructure. This will include advice on infrastructure priorities, appropriate policy and regulatory reforms, options to address impediments, the needs of users and possible financing mechanisms. The geography and population of Australia require infrastructure solutions that are created from a national perspective. It is vital that infrastructure plans are aligned across the various jurisdictions. The greatest example of this was of course the Snowy Mountains scheme. The concept for the scheme was launched in 1949 through the cooperation of the Commonwealth, and the New South Wales and Victorian governments. Of course, the scheme was the brainchild of Prime Minister Ben Chifley and it was, apart from the historical nature of the concept, a most courageous decision. The project took 25 years to complete. Apart from the massive contribution to water flows and electricity in this country, the nature of the scheme itself changed the character of Australia. As I indicated earlier, the Labor Party has a proud history of leadership in the establishment of infrastructure projects in this country. Gough Whitlam has stated publicly on more than one occasion that one of his proudest achievements was the establishment of infrastructure projects across Australia, including sewerage. His initiatives made life so much more liveable for Australians in the newly developing suburbs around Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. Gough realised, as many did not, that, unless the federal government took the lead in these matters, MAIN COMMITTEE little would happen on the scale which was required nationally. Famously, Neville Wran said of Gough, who accepted the sentiment if not the comparison: It was said of Caesar Augustus that he found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble ... He found Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth unsewered, and left them fully flushed. It was the Whitlam government that established the first ministry of urban and regional development dedicated to providing the necessary direction to ensure infrastructure reform at the urban level. The minister Tom Uren established the Australian Heritage Commission and the subsequent compilation of the Register of the National Estate. He promoted the restoration and re-use of derelict inner city areas such as the Glebe estate and Woolloomooloo in Sydney, and the reclamation of Duck Creek and the creation of the Chipping Norton Lakes scheme. Tom Uren established the creation of the land commissions to ensure availability of reasonably priced housing blocks and the development of new planned communities. Later Labor governments under Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating opened up the economy, which made us more competitive as a nation. Under Prime Minister Keating the Better Cities Program was introduced by Brian Howe. This was a broad reform strategy that included innovative housing and it focused on urban consolidation. The genesis of the program was at a premier’s conference in 1991 where the Commonwealth, state and territory governments agreed to work together on urban consolidation and renewal through practical measures and coordination across governments. Better Cities forged strong, cooperative relationships with the states. Better Cities and even the former Department of Urban and Regional Development were well suited to their time, but that does not mean that they are suitable solutions for tackling today’s urban problems or the ones looming on the horizon. I cite this initiative as an example of how governments can and have taken the lead in resolving issues of national importance. As a nation, we are very highly urbanised. We need healthy, vibrant communities with appropriate levels of infrastructure to support those communities. Our capital and regional cities are suffering a complex set of stresses. Urban sprawl as people move further and further from city centres is causing increased travelling times, more pollution and greater reliance on the car. At the same time congestion has become more common in the older and inner suburbs as residential densities increase. Our capital cities have become sprawling residential corridors. Population growth from immigration has exacerbated this trend, particularly for Sydney. It is also evidenced in our coastal cities, and more and more Australians are seeking to escape the stresses of capital city living. The traditional design and development of cities around a CBD is no longer able to support the diverse needs of today’s community. Household size, work, education and recreation patterns have changed. In addition, much of the infrastructure in our cities was built for different levels of development and not in anticipation of the demands of today. Our increasing consumption of energy, water and telecommunications is placing new demands on our cities, but planning systems are not responding to these trends or showing any understanding of the impacts on people’s lives and communities. Over 87 per cent of Australians live in urban areas. This means that the shape of our urban environment is critical to the daily lives and well-being of most Australians. Urban development directly impacts on where we live, where we work and play, where our children go to school, university and TAFE, the transport systems we use, MAIN COMMITTEE how we access medical, dental and other services and the quality of our air, water and landscape. Cities that were designed to meet 19th century requirements do not meet the needs of the 21st century. We need roads and public transport to allow the community to easily access work, services and education while minimising our carbon footprint. Access to these facilities is an issue of equity. We must ensure that urban infrastructure will allow the community access to work or services that do not require travel two hours each way, each day. I note, for example, the new M7 in Sydney’s west. The M7 has cut out about 55 sets of traffic lights and does provide easier access for many people in Western Sydney. It also assists truck drivers who want to avoid driving into Sydney itself. They are now able to drive around Sydney and keep to their schedule. We need new, fresh ideas for infrastructure development in this country. In the same way that previous Labor governments introduced new ideas for infrastructure reform, this government is prepared to take the lead in the 21st century. I hear the negative comments made by the other side in response to the Prime Minister’s 2020 initiative. One of the differences of this government from the previous government is that we do not believe that we have a monopoly on ideas for the future. The Australia 2020 Summit is about the community coming up with ideas to take this country into the future. We require down-to-earth, practical proposals to implement a new vision for a sustainable future. The bill before the House does just that. It proposes realistic solutions to problems facing Australia. The vital role to be performed by Infrastructure Australia will be to provide a strategic blueprint, and this blueprint will allow us, as a nation, to prepare for future challenges like urban congestion, climate change and population demands. It will also drive reform on how to maximise the infrastructure we already have. I commend the bill to the House. issue not only close to my heart and close to the people that I represent in the beautiful region of Groom but also close to the hearts of all Australians. When we talk about infrastructure, we talk about issues in relation to not only motor vehicles but also transport of heavy goods and produce both to and from regional areas. My electorate has one of the busiest freight corridors in Australia. In fact, any truck travelling to western or central western Queensland, to the Northern Territory or to northern or north-western New South Wales travels through the main street of my city. That is an issue I will come back to later. It is essential to provide substantial funding for infrastructure projects. Whilst the Labor Party are currently dishonestly claiming that the Howard government failed to spend adequately on infrastructure, particularly on roads, they are themselves preparing to spend less than half of what we had planned to spend. My understanding is that during the election campaign the Labor Party promised a figure somewhere south of $15.5 billion for roads and infrastructure. Of course, they have already made an abominable decision in relation to Ipswich Road-a road which I travel on frequently. I suggest to the member for Banks that he takes the opportunity to travel on that road sometime between seven and nine o’clock in the morning. If he misses that time, due to the fact that he needs to travel up to Queensland, then he should travel on that road anytime after 3.30 in the afternoon until six o’clock. It is basically a car park. MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
201,Mr Ian Macfarlane (Groom) (4.12 Pm),"I rise today to talk about infrastructure, anThis highly political decision of the Rudd Labor government to circumvent what has been a detailed investigation of that road can only leave the problems that we see now as problems of the future. In fact, the Labor government’s decision to extend that road by only two lanes will see the people of Ipswich, people who have already faced major traffic delays during peak hours, continue to see delays. The six-lane proposal will be at capacity by the time it is completed. As part of our nearly $30 billion commitment to the people of Australia in AusLink 2, we would have solved that problem with, firstly, a four-lane highway bypassing Ipswich Road followed, in one order or another, by the expansion of Ipswich Road to six lanes and the further expansion of the bypass to eight lanes, thus giving the people of Ipswich, Darling Downs and Warwick a 14-lane alternative to what the Labor Party is currently proposing. These sorts of short-sighted infrastructure decisions heavily weighted by political expediency would be avoided were Infrastructure Australia to do its job. What we are seeing with this organisation in the first instance is, of course, another review. As we have seen from the Labor Party, anytime a decision needs to be made, the first thing they do is have a review. The second thing they do is review that review-and we assume that comes after the review-and decide as a government whether they accept the outcome of the review. It is essential for Australia’s future economic growth and for the curtailing of inflation, which we hear so much about from the Treasurer-he does not seem to understand completely what is going on-that there be no delay on infrastructure investment in Australia and that when we do see investment in infrastructure it does not become bogged down in layers of bureaucracy. Infrastructure needs to be built in Australia; no-one would argue with that. We do not want it to be a lucky dip of projects that may or may not proceed, as we have seen already with Ipswich Road. We need to see a process where state and federal governments and a combination of communities make soundly based decisions. I do not know how this infrastructure committee is going to work. I guess that highlights my trepidation. But what I do know is that already, before we have even seen the committee formed in its final format, we have seen political decisions made and people in regional Australia, in this case regional Queensland, being asked to pay the price of that. The Labor Party says that this legislation, the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008, is a significant step in moving forward with infrastructure development in Australia et cetera, ad nauseam while, as I said, trying to suggest, by using some dodgy figures put together before AusLink1 became fully operational, that we as a government underspent on infrastructure and they as a government are going to spend significantly more. In fact, as I have suggested already, we were planning to spend over $29 billion, taking into account the $22-and-a-bit billion that was announced in last year’s May budget and the further $7 billion in additional funding that we outlined during the election campaign-all fully costed by Treasury. So there you have nearly $30 billion in AusLink alone compared with Labor’s suggested promise of $15.5 billion. We need to have some rationale brought to this whole area. We need to see the sorts of things that we did with AusLink, where we systematically worked through infrastructure needs to ensure there was connection, in both an economic and a community sense, between those areas in Australia that needed better roads. I mentioned in my opening comments some of the issues that Toowoomba is facing with its second range crossing. The idea of this crossing has been around for a long time and it was one of my goals as the member for Groom, which includes Toowoomba and the Darling MAIN COMMITTEE Downs, to ensure that that crossing was built. Yet, after successfully ensuring that some $40 million was spent on both land acquisitions and some geological work, including the drilling of a pilot tunnel, and the promise by the then Howard government that it would spend $700 million during AusLink2 and complete the project in the following AusLink program, we have seen this project completely ignored by the Rudd Labor government. This is a second example of a poor decision-making process by a government which claims that it will ensure that infrastructure is built in Australia in a timely way. Both the people of Ipswich, now represented by Labor members, and the people of Toowoomba and the Darling Downs could well wonder what they are going to get out of this infrastructure proposal. In fact, they could also wonder whether or not there will be anything of any substance delivered to the regional areas. This case is in Queensland, but the same issue can be raised in virtually every part of Australia. We do not want to see the Labor government introduce a system which in some way relieves the state Labor governments, which have made a complete mess of infrastructure funding, of their responsibilities in this area. We do not want to see a ‘get out of jail free’ card given to state governments which have continually made abominable decisions in relation to infrastructure and which, unless they are brought into line, will continue to ignore the infrastructure needs, particularly in the resource sector. There is no better example of that than the problems in coal transportation in Queensland. A government owned corporation in the form of Queensland Rail is severely undercapitalised by the treasury of that state, unable to run trains effectively and handicapped, I know, by a historical decision to run a three feet six inch gauge. At the same time, it is much more handicapped by the fact that it is unable to make the investments to triplicate range crossings to get access and it is unable to make the proper investment in locos and carriages in one of the booming industries in Australia-the coal industry. It is an industry which I know the Labor Party has its reservations about, but it is one which the coalition supports absolutely. It is an industry which currently finds itself hogtied by a state Labor government unable to spend the sort of capital we need it to spend. In establishing this bill, we would hope that the Labor Party actually places some focus and sincerity on this issue and moves away from the political decision making which is such a hallmark of state Labor governments and, as we have seen already, of this Rudd Labor government. We need to see the infrastructure investment in Australia made on the basis that it is actually going to deliver outcomes. We do not need another review. We do not need governments to press the pause button and decide whether or not they are going to build things that have been plainly obvious in their requirement. We do not need to see the people of Toowoomba subjected to another 10-year wait to know whether or not they will get a range crossing which will take B-double vehicles out of the main street of Toowoomba and away from their homes, schools and shops and ensure that Toowoomba is treated in the same way as every other major city in Australia. What we want to see from this new body that is being established under this proposed act is a systematic program to ensure that people in Toowoomba, people in Ipswich, people in Sydney, people in western New South Wales and people in every part of Australia will in fact be able to have some certainty that they will get the infrastructure that they need while at the same time the companies that invest billions and billions of dollars in resource projects in Australia will have the opportunity and certainty that their product will be able to be exported. MAIN COMMITTEE If this is just another layer of bureaucracy, so there will be another layer of delay in the operation of the building of infrastructure in Australia, then Australia will pay an economic penalty that will last not for decades but in fact for tens of decades. I share the concerns expressed by the shadow minister for infrastructure, transport and local government when this bill was first admitted to the House. I have concerns that the Labor Party has no understanding of the needs of people in regional areas. I hope that, as we progress through this government’s actions, the sorts of dreadful decisions that we have seen made about Ipswich Road and the Toowoomba range crossing will not be replicated by this new body. 2008, which marks the delivery of another commitment of the Rudd government. This is the commitment to establish the Infrastructure Australia body, a central part of the government’s plan to combat inflation. It is an urgent task, and this government has wasted no time in getting on with it. Well-planned infrastructure provides the basis for economic activity in our nation. I am talking about transport infrastructure and about energy and water infrastructure, which is needed to meet the challenge of climate change and to meet the reality of our mostly dry and mostly brown land. I am talking about communications infrastructure, which the government is meeting the need for with the national broadband network. I am talking about social infrastructure in the form of schools and hospitals. We need to recognise that because of the scale of our country, the sheer size of Australia, we are particularly dependent on efficient infrastructure utilisation. Boosting productivity growth is vital to sustained economic prosperity. Infrastructure planning and development, which is what this legislation is concerned with, will facilitate increased productivity growth. Under the previous government Australia’s productivity growth has been allowed to dribble away to virtually nothing. We have gone from leading the industrialised nations of the world to trailing those industrialised nations. Reducing supply-side pressures in our economy by dealing with the lack of capacity will help bring down inflation and should apply downward pressure on interest rates. Infrastructure gaps are costing us 0.8 of a per cent of GDP in lost production every year. Infrastructure is not simply about the economic dividends to communities and the nation. It is also about the lifestyle and the standard of living which we enjoy. It is about things like the ability of schools to educate our children and the ability of hospitals to care for the ill. There is also a point to be made that infrastructure markets are not like other markets. They are often monopolistic or semimonopolistic in nature, subject to regulatory control of pricing, and they are often publicly funded, bringing with that competing demands on government financing. Determining access and exclusive rights to infrastructure often creates uncertainty about the returns that will be generated and thus about the financing and construction. Given the importance of infrastructure development to Australia, we require national leadership to make up for what have been decades of underinvestment. Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, the industry body, has recognised this, the current government has recognised this, and you might well ask why the previous government did not recognise this. In my electorate of Isaacs, both economic and social infrastructure will play important roles in the future economic well-being of local communities. There is a need for social infrastructure and a need, for local business in particular, for a highly skilled workforce, which is anMAIN COMMITTEE",159,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
202,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (4.26 Pm),"I rise in support of the Infrastructure Australia Billother key plank of Labor’s plan to fight inflation. There is a need in my electorate for physical infrastructure. The manufacturing sectors that operate in the two areas of Dandenong and Braeside need to be connected to fully functioning ports and airports and to other elements of their supply chain. With the skill shortage and heavy competition for skilled labour, there is also a need to ensure that skills are in fact being provided and skilled workers are becoming available. On the infrastructure of technology, it is no longer possible for businesses operating in a globalised economy to survive, let alone thrive, without being able to access broadband and other technologies which they need. So, too, for energy and water infrastructure: there is a need for businesses to have guaranteed supplies of energy and water with appropriate pricing. This government is responding to infrastructure shortfalls by taking proactive steps, by establishing Infrastructure Australia and by appointing the first ever minister for infrastructure. The bill is going to create Infrastructure Australia, an advisory council, along with the Office of Infrastructure Coordination to support their work. It will have 12 members: five from the private sector including the chair, three from the federal government, three from state government and one from local government. I should congratulate Sir Rod Eddington on his announced appointment, Sir Rod having had a distinguished career including five years as the CEO of British Airways. Most importantly, this legislation will charge Infrastructure Australia with the role of auditing our current infrastructure needs and making recommendations to all levels of government and to the private sector. Its first task will be to complete an audit by the end of the year and to deliver to COAG a national infrastructure priority list by March 2009. This national coordination will help to overcome problems in infrastructure development and thus boost productivity and national competitiveness. It will apply downward pressure on inflation. With Infrastructure Australia there will be a coordinated national approach to assessing and fixing national infrastructure gaps and bottlenecks in our productive capacity. Madam Deputy Speaker, the bill, as you have heard from other speakers, continues Labor’s tradition of nation building. It is well recognised that the Australian Labor Party has been the party that has genuinely believed in and has acted on the importance of the Commonwealth government and the use of its powers to build a unified nation. One can look at the examples of the Chifley government in relation to the Snowy Mountains scheme, the achievements of the Whitlam government in relation to urban and regional development and, more recently, the work of the Hawke and Keating governments on the standardisation of rail gauges or the Better Cities Program, which was focused on our urban infrastructure. By contrast, the Liberal Party has shifted from its long standing support for what you could only call a parochial federalism to more recently-in its last 12 years of government, which we have just endured-the use of Commonwealth powers for partisan political gain. Neither philosophy represents a vision for the future of our nation. The member for Shortland earlier commented on the report The great freight task delivered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services. That is a report in which the committee, to its credit, identified a range of projects that are needed to allow our ports to function at capacity. I draw the attention of members to this to make the point that such a task should not have been left to a parliamentary committee to perform on an ad hoc basis; it is something that should have been dealt with in a coordinated way on a national basis. That report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services alone serves as a stark reminder of the failure of the former MAIN COMMITTEE government in this area of infrastructure and nation building. This task of audit and of considering what projects are required will be a key role of Infrastructure Australia. Australia is now ranked 20th out of 25 OECD countries for investment in public infrastructure as a percentage of GDP, and the reason why Australia occupies that lowly ranking among the developed countries of the world is that the former government was simply not interested in providing leadership or the investment that infrastructure required. The former government believed that planning for Australia’s economic future involved an ideological war against trade unions, rather than thinking about the actual needs of our country as we go forward into the 21st century. The Auditor-General’s report, which we have heard quite a bit about in recent monthsthat is, the Auditor-General’s report on the Regional Partnerships program-showed that it was not merely neglect on the part of the former government in relation to infrastructure; there was a shameless, systematic rorting of infrastructure spending for short-term political gain. What we had were decisions about infrastructure that were based on the margin in particular seats rather than on national need. In future, decisions about infrastructure are going to be based on demonstrable need and not on pork-barrelling. The result of all thisMr Ciobo interjectingin a minute, thank you. shameful neglect of infrastructure planning, shameful neglect of infrastructure spending and rampant pork-barrelling where there was some infrastructure spendingthe member for Isaacs, who as a new member probably does not realise that in the Main Committee interventions are allowed and the member is allowed to either accept or reject the question. Will the member for Isaacs accept the question from the member for Tangney? result of all this was the coalition government’s farewell gift to our nation: its underinvestment in infrastructure and, just to remind honourable members, the highest inflation rate in 16 years. The approach of the former government to infrastructure planning and infrastructure investment is no longer good enough. By contrast, we in the Labor Party take seriously our tradition of nation building, and that is why the Rudd government has acted on the commitment to introduce Infrastructure Australia. This government is showing leadership. This government will help to clear the infrastructure bottlenecks that have been created by 12 years of neglect. It is an urgent task, one on which we require coordinated national leadership. That is what is now going to be provided. The Infrastructure Australia Bill, through its creation of Infrastructure Australia and the tasks that it sets for this new body, creates the structure for that national leadership. great enthusiasm to contribute to this debate, and I am very pleased to have the opportunity now to speak to the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008, because this bill is so symbolic of the MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008

208,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (4.39 Pm),"Madam Deputy Speaker, you keenly observed myAustralian Labor Party. In so many respects, this bill really is the epitome of the Australian Labor Party, because it is a bill that seems on the surface to present so much and to herald so much about what the Australian Labor Party has in store now that it is the government. Once you start to pierce through the spin, the lack of substance, the grand rhetorical statements and the various historical blurrings and inaccuracies that come from members opposite, you start to realise that this bill, like so much of the new Rudd Labor government’s agenda, is completely and utterly without substance. This bill is without substance because it sees the creation of Infrastructure Australia, a new bureaucracy that the Rudd Labor government says is going to deliver in spades. It begs the very question. Labor has been in power across every state and territory in Australia now for at least a decade and, in just about every respect, we have seen state Labor governments fail on all fronts. It is a big F for fail for the Queensland, New South Wales, South Australian, Western Australian, Victorian, Tasmanian, Northern Territory and ACT Labor governments. The reason they all fail is that every Labor government is big on spin but very poor when it comes to actual delivery of services. I will talk about a jurisdiction that I know well, Queensland, and the fact that the Australian Labor Party has been in power in Queensland for 18 of the last 20 years-years where we have seen next to nothing when it comes to infrastructure leadership by the state Labor government. So, when members opposite stand up in this chamber and wax lyrical about the importance of investing in infrastructure, you actually know that it is just spin, it is just rhetoric and there is no actual delivery. If there were delivery at a state level, there would not be 40 ships sitting off the port of Dalrymple waiting to be loaded. If there were delivery, the former coalition government would not have been required to invest a record amount of money to make up for state government inaction. The fact is that the Labor Party is big on talk but absolutely weak when it comes to doing anything. This bill, I predict, will be symbolic of the entire Rudd Labor government, where we will see all sorts of promises being heralded-the same sorts of promises that we saw prior to the election when the now Prime Minister stood up and said, ‘Under the Labor Party, fuel prices will go down.’ This is the same Prime Minister who said, ‘Under the Labor Party, grocery prices will go down.’ In the same way, the Rudd Labor government says, ‘Elect us, and we will make sure that we see investment in infrastructure and the creation of Infrastructure Australia’-the new body that is going to mastermind all of this. Let us consider what members of the government have said previously in this debate. In particular, we heard the speaker previous to me talk about how one of the key achievements of the Infrastructure Australia Bill will be the creation of an audit of infrastructure needs in Australia as if it is a new thing, as if in some way the audit of infrastructure needs in Australia will present a new change in Australia. I have news for the previous speaker: there has been an audit done at a state level already, and it has not heralded anything. Perhaps the previous speaker could explain to me why it is that in a city like the Gold Coast-the fastest-growing region in Australia and Australia’s sixth largest city-the Beattie Labor government, and now the Bligh Labor government, have done basically nothing for our city for a decade. Perhaps that could be explained by the previous Labor speaker. Perhaps the previous Labor speaker could explain why the Queensland government, like every other state Labor government with the exception of Western Australia, is now running budget deficits to the tune of $80 billiondebt at a state level brought on by the Labor Party putting upward pressure on inflation. I take MAIN COMMITTEE objection to members opposite lecturing the coalition on inflation when $80 billion of debt is driven by them at a state level. I take objection to the Labor Party lecturing the coalition about how hard it is to deal with Australia’s economy, referred to as the ‘miracle economy’ by the Economist magazine. When we lost office, we left the Labor Party with a $17 billion surplus and a 30-year low in unemployment. That is the record of the former government. The fact is that the former government invested $15.8 billion in infrastructure and a further $22.3 billion in infrastructure under the AusLink program. I noticed the previous Labor speaker never once mentioned AusLink. He probably does not even know about it and probably has not even heard of AusLink, even though it was the biggest item of expenditure on infrastructure by the coalition government. The new Labor government have to pull up their socks to match the track record of the former government when it comes to investment in infrastructure. The new Labor government should certainly not be copying their state Labor mates. If you are copying your state Labor mates, I can assure members opposite that what we will see is disinvestment in infrastructure, and we will see the Labor Party turn their back on muchneeded investment in roads, airports, ports and rail. That is the legacy of state Labor governments. I will pick up one other point that the previous speaker raised: the need for access to water infrastructure. Let me invite members opposite to come to the Gold Coast and south-east Queensland. Please come up, and I will explain the problems faced by a population of several million. The Labor Party has been in power for 18 of the last 20 years, and the Queensland population in south-east Queensland has nearly doubled, and they have not built one damnot one dam in south-east Queensland in nearly 20 years. The biggest single piece of infrastructure out of the last 20 years was done in the two years the coalition was in power-$1 billion for the M1 between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. I say to the Labor Party: no-one takes seriously their talk. No-one takes seriously Labor Party promises, Labor Party hot air and Labor Party rhetoric about all the virtues that will flow from the Infrastructure Australia Bill-how there will be an audit of Labor’s record when it comes to the need to invest in infrastructure and how the Labor Party is shackled with such a bad economy. No-one takes it seriously, because it is without substance, just like the Labor Party when it comes to actual infrastructure investment. If we had seen at a state level the Labor Party actually doing something then we might take seriously their desire to fix the Australian economy and to fix these infrastructure bottlenecks. I also noted the previous speakers talking about the skills shortage in Australia. How often do we hear that? A skills shortage actually should be referred to as a ‘labour force shortage’. It is what happens when unemployment gets down to four per cent. It is in stark contrast to having a million people unemployed and 11 per cent unemployment, which was the last record of the Labor Party. ‘Skills crisis’ is not the correct phrase. The correct phrase is ‘labour force shortage’, and that is what happens when you have four per cent unemployment. More importantly, if we want to take seriously for a moment the notion that perhaps the Labor Party are onto something when they say that there is a skills shortage, I would love to have an explanation as to why there has been next to no investment in the TAFE system by state Labor governments. In the primary area of responsibility for state Labor, vocational eduMAIN COMMITTEE cation and training, we have seen F for fail time and time again by every state and territory Labor government. That is the track record of the Labor Party. We heard them during the election when they stood up and said: ‘We’re not interested in the blame game. It’s time we stopped the blame game.’ I have got some news again for the new members of the Rudd Labor government. You are going to hear a lot about the blame game from this opposition, and you are going to hear a lot because at your feet lies a decade of inaction. At the feet of the Labor Party lies the fact that state Labor governments, that are meant to invest in infrastructure and in vocational education, have done nothing. The consequence of state Labor governments investing money, as they call it, has been bloated bureaucracies. That is the primary investment by state Labor governments. It was fascinating to see just recently that in Queensland the Bligh-Beattie Labor government has increased the bureaucracy by over 30 per cent. That is the track record-a 30 per cent increase in the bureaucracy. There is a proud boast for state Labor governments! There is much-needed infrastructure! Do not invest in new hospitals; make sure you put it into extra bureaucrats in George Street. That will make all the difference for my constituents in Moncrieff! I must give some credit to the state Labor government. They went out and announced that there would be a new hospital for the Gold Coast. That was great, because the Gold Coast is now nearing 600,000 people, and the last time we had a new hospital the population was probably sitting at around 70,000 people. So it is about time we got a new hospital from the Queensland state Labor government. They promised that the construction would commence in March 2007, so in March 2007 I went to the sign for this new, you-beaut hospital. There, proudly erected on the site, was the sign for the new Gold Coast hospital-some much needed infrastructure. I am sure it is the kind of infrastructure that the Infrastructure Australia Committee will be looking at and recommending. The Queensland health minister and the Queensland Premier spoke proudly about how they would be doing this. But it is with regret that I remind all my constituents that we are still waiting for a single sod to be turned. In fact, the Queensland Labor government is now saying to Gold Coasters, ‘Just put that on hold; we might actually change the site of the hospital.’ So here we are, 12 months-almost to the day-after the construction of the hospital was meant to have commenced, 12 months after they were meant to start knocking over trees and building the new hospital, and still nothing. I would have thought that there would be buildings in existence and perhaps the opportunity for Gold Coasters to get access to some first-class hospital service. Not a single tree has been knocked over, although there has been one development on the site-they took away the sign. That is the development by the Queensland Labor government-they took away the sign. That is the extent to which the Queensland Labor government believe in supporting infrastructure needs on the Gold Coast. SoI say to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, and I am hoping it occupies a lot of his time: let us get serious about putting a bit of pressure on your state Labor mates to get some action. Let us start to see some action when it comes to the words of the Labor Party on the need for new infrastructure. If there is a city that is crying out for investment and infrastructure, it is the Gold Coast. It is the fastestgrowing city in the country-it is Australia’s sixth biggest city now-and we need roads. We need investment in public transport, water, health and schools. If you believe the promises MAIN COMMITTEE made during the election campaign, each of these areas will be solved by the Australian Labor Party. I look forward to seeing what this 12-month audit is going to present. I predict it will not be a lot, because these audits already exist at a state level and they do not seem to mean anything. Apparently now at the federal level this new committee-we know the Rudd Labor government is very fond of committees-are going to do their audit, and all of a sudden these problems will be solved. I look forward to seeing announcements by the Rudd Labor government on the kinds of projects that will be rolled out in Moncrieff, McPherson, Forde and Fadden because that is what the Labor Party said would happen in Australia’s fastest-growing city. They can start by putting some pressure on the state Labor government. The final story I would like to talk about is my profound disappointment again with the Queensland Labor government. Let us give some history to this debate. The coalition announced $455 million to wind the M1 motorway between Nerang and Tugun-a vital arterial road for our region that connects Brisbane to Sydney. Unfortunately, at the moment it is also used by a lot of local commuter traffic on the Gold Coast-not by the interstate traffic that it was designed for. In part, the reason for this is that the Labor Party at the state level have not invested in the side arterial roads that local traffic is meant to use. Instead, they have been happy to see that traffic move onto the M1. So the coalition announced $455 million to expand the M1. This is an important announcement and a big win, dare I say it, for the member for McPherson, the newly elected member for Fadden and me. It was a big win because the Queensland government said that if the coalition provided $427 million they would commence the project immediately. So they asked for $427 million; the Howard government provided $455 million. But what I find extraordinary-and I remind the people in suburbs like Boonooroo Park, Nerang, Worongary, Robina and Mudgeeraba-is that we provided $455 million even though $427 million was the requested figure and now the Queensland Labor government says that the vast bulk of that money is going to be used on winding the M1 in Logan-not on the Gold Coast. That money is being misappropriated-and I use that word very deliberately-from an important project that we provided the funding for to be used up in Logan in the southern outskirts of Brisbane. Again, I say to the infrastructure minister, if you want to use some pressure let us see you apply some pressure to your state Labor mates and get this road built where we said the funding was meant to go, where constituents in my electorate expected the funding to go and where Gold Coasters rightfully have an expectation that this money will be used to fix this road. We can have the audits, we can have all sorts of claims from the state Labor government about the Infrastructure Australia Bill, but if you do not actually deliver local projects like this then it will be absolutely meaningless and not worth the paper it is written on. I will leave my remarks on the Infrastructure Australia Bill at that. I came into this debate wanting to accept the good intentions of the infrastructure minister, wanting to believe the claims that have been made by members opposite, wanting to believe that this bill will herald a new day in Australian infrastructure needs. For far too long-for nearly a decade-we have seen next to no action on infrastructure by state Labor governments. The Rudd Labor government now have the chance to demonstrate in a very material sense that they will actually improve the lot of ordinary Australians, that they will stand by their promises and ensure that there is investment in infrastructure to improve the lifestyle and the public amenity of all the MAIN COMMITTEE cities and regions in Australia. But if it is just hot air, if we just see that the track record is the same as it has been in every Labor state and territory, then this bill will not be worth the paper it is written on-and that is my fear. I hope to stand here in 12 months and be proven wrong by the new Rudd Labor government, but again I make a very conservative suggestion: I will not be. I suggest that in 12 months time the Rudd Labor government will be coming up with all sorts of excuses as to why nothing has happened, we will see this new spirit of federalism in existence and we will wonder why the Rudd Labor government has not been able to achieve much at all. There are a few key measures: let us see if the Gold Coast hospital is built, let us see if the M1 is widened and let us make sure that we have new water infrastructure, new education infrastructure and better roads on the Gold Coast. Those are the KPIs that will be asked of the infrastructure minister. That is the kind of investment I will be looking for. Anything less than that will be another F for fail by the Labor Party. contribution but remind him that this is a very small chamber and he already has a very loud voice. My hearing is very good-but I am not sure it is that good after that! For future reference: I do not think we need to shout in this chamber. ing animated up here can cause grievous bodily harm to the occupier of the chair. I call the member for Forde. crieff, because the seat of Moncrieff is very close to my seat of Forde, and I am just wondering whether we are actually reading the same messages or understanding the same concepts or issues. It is also interesting to note that the seat of Moncrieff is probably around 100 square kilometres in area. I am in a seat of 3,100 square kilometres in area, which was served very well by a former Liberal member, Kay Elson, but the realityMr Bruce Scott-It would only be a horse paddock out my way! Gold Coast members are very Gold Coast-centric, and I am not sure that in the time the previous speaker was in government he had much experience over the ridge from the Gold Coast hinterland, which is essentially the seat of Forde. Infrastructure-wise, we have nothing. The Gold Coast certainly is an area of huge growth. We know that. But to say the Gold Coast is the fastest growing city in Australia is not quite correct-and we will prove that on another day and with other figures. The reality is that, yes, infrastructure is poor in Queensland, but that is not essentially because of the Queensland government. In many areas of their delivery of services the Queensland government have been somewhat short-changed by the federal government, whether we are talking about health, roads, training or any area. I have not come to this chamber today to talk about what should have happened. Essentially, I think the opposition’s problem is that they have got themselves into that cycle of blame. They said that they were not going to blame; now they are going to blame-they are going to be here in 12 months time telling us what we have not done.

213,Mr Raguse,"That may be right. The reality is it could well be a horse paddock. Theis to realise that this is about working together. The whole idea of the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008 is to get all levels of government and all stakeholders working together. In my maiden speech on 19 FebruaryI spoke in some detail about the issues that affect the community in the electorate of Forde. My catch cry then was to ‘put Forde on the map’ in terms of ensuring that the government and the parliament knew more about the opportunities and the potential of the region I represent. The practical application of this intent can be well explained by the opportunities presented in this Infrastructure Australia Bill. In my first speech on 19 February, I highlighted issues related to local demand in Forde for development land for urban and associated industrial purposes. I also made the point that appropriate planning was necessary to ensure that desired environmental and social outcomes would have a positive effect on the region. Having gained experience in planning and regional development activities, I must say that one thing governments, both local and state, tend to do tirelessly is plan. That is something they do do: they plan well. But the success of any planning activity should be measured in a number of ways, and that is why I take point against the member for Moncrieff. It is not about just putting out the challenge to provide infrastructure, whoever is responsible; it is actually about finding solutions. My understanding, coming into this House-or in any house of parliament in this country-is that it is about helping and working with stakeholders to find solutions. While sustainability is often mentioned, it is not often explained. It includes the essential considerations of environmental, economic and social impact. Sustainability is also about the planning regime in which it is determined. At any given point in time the viability of managed growth is relative to the time frame in which it occurs, and the situation confronting both government and the private sector is the timeliness of planning processes and planning approvals. Stakeholders, both private sector and government, involved in regional development understand the increased costs incurred by any delays in the accepted time frames. And, of course, while we go on arguing about what we should or should not do, or what has happened in the past, it costs those developers-those who are holding land on the ground, those who are waiting for approvals, those who are waiting for commitments from all levels-money, and essentially that is carried on and passed on into those development costs. While the immediate effects of time delays are financial, the added costs incurred then impact on the ability to achieve the desired outcomes proposed by the sustainable aspects of the development. Tardy sequencing of land releases is due to many factors and quite often based around who or what authority is responsible for making the decision. It is not a criticism of state or local governments but the reality of development in this country, and that is why this bill in its intent will provide the features of facilitation-to not only prioritise the necessary infrastructure by that process but to ensure that there is a coordinated and definitive process to achieve preferred outcomes. As I said, it is about everyone working together. Within my electorate, there is major investment by the private sector in the industrial areas of Yatala and Bromelton, cited as being the largest future industrial centres in Australia, as well as in the planned lifestyle communities to house the tens of thousands of workers who will relocate to the region over the next 20 to 30 years, with the future residential communities of Greater Flagstone and Yarrabilba already planned, including the provision of affordable housing designs which would help ease our housing crisis in south-east Queensland. They MAIN COMMITTEE include the necessary infrastructure, not funded by the taxpayers but by an agreed commitment from the project proponents. This is a good example of private investment, but at this point in time it is delayed, not by the investors but simply because planning decisions will not be made by local and state authorities. These decisions will not be made because the agencies involved are fearful that they will be held responsible for infrastructure yet to be scoped. In other words, due to the uncertainty of local authorities and some planning authorities, they will not make a commitment for fear that they as a local or state authority might bear the costs of providing unknown infrastructure. The commitment I am talking about is a simple agreement to determine road and transport corridors or to allow the commencement of operational work. As I have said, this is not a criticism of local or state authorities but an understanding that there is no coordination of the necessary processes to ensure development occurs in a timely and efficient manner. This bill proposing the establishment of Infrastructure Australia provides relief to those authorities feeling the strain of making a commitment that they may deliver and then have a funding liability for the provision of some infrastructure not previously identified. As I said in my opening statement, putting my electorate of Forde on the map is in recognition of the need for government to be aware of the needs of a community so they can be better met. Through this bill, other high-priority electorates in this country can also have their infrastructure demands identified and prioritised. The electorate of Forde, which is at its northern boundary less than 20 minutes by the M1 to the CBD of Brisbane and at its southernmost point, at the border ranges, more than an hour and a half from the CBD, would still be considered by many of my regional parliamentary colleagues as almost a city; yet the townships of Logan Village, Jimboomba and Beaudesert to the south have poor road infrastructure, no rail or regular bus services and, in some of these areas, no provision of town water. In fact, these towns are among a few high-population towns in south-east Queensland, just outside of Brisbane, that do not have a four-lane highway, a train service or regular bus services. The member for Moncrieff stated that in his view the Gold Coast is underresourced. He needs to come over the range and travel only 50 kilometres to find what real lack of services is all about. Added to the lack of work opportunities in these communities, many of these townships are dormitory suburbs for the commercial and industrial areas of Logan and Brisbane. The requirement for mass travel by single drivers every day along an inadequate highway is just not tenable, safe or efficient. Infrastructure Australia can be seen as the apex of a triangle-a single agency capable of not only facilitating and prioritising the delivery of hard physical infrastructure but also influencing the other benefits that flow from this kind of investment. Again, in Forde the two major issues that affect our daily lifestyle are housing availability and affordability and then transport on top of that. Currently in the electorate we have groups meeting to discuss any type of solution to providing better options for those who need to traverse for work, for study or for access to the medical and other community services of the region. This can be better described simply as mobility. With adequate road and rail infrastructure, the efforts of community groups and organisations to garner state government support is all the more difficult, and I have committed to working with all agencies to try and secure future commitments. On that note, I would like to commend Sharon Redmond and Lyn BarMAIN COMMITTEE timote for their long standing and continuing efforts to find solutions for their communities of Jimboomba and Beaudesert, particularly in the areas of transport and mobility for the many residents who are denied these simple services. While local residents are simply trying to achieve services that most other electorates take for granted, there is a wider requirement to understand the strategic position my electorate has in relation to the whole region. In the House this week the member for Page spoke about the region of northern New South Wales and the lack of infrastructure for transport services. The seat of Page, just over the border in New South Wales, is strategically placed and has links to the electorate of Forde in the south west. We have a unique opportunity in this part of the country to link major potential transport corridors, yet there is not one government agency that fully understands the multiple parts of the puzzle and the linkages that could open up the corridor and could provide significant and efficient transport corridors feeding future intermodal facilities and the relative seaports. The benefit of well-planned and coordinated infrastructure has an aggregate effect. Using the Page and Forde electorates as an example would provide not only economic benefits to the region and develop strong cross-border linkages but also flow-on benefits in the provision of regional transport. The perception in south-east Queensland at the moment is that, other than on the coastal highways, Queensland stops at the border. The townships of Beaudesert and Rathdowney further to the south are considered the end of the road or, effectively, as the road to nowhere; yet just across the border we have significant communities with significant transport needs. A cross-border relationship supported by a non-parochial planning body like Infrastructure Australia would provide the synergies and the efficiencies of appropriate infrastructure investment. While the economic benefits of a coordinated approach are evident, it is the symbiotic nature of such investments with social benefits that have a greater positive effect on the regional communities. I have been talking to the member for Page and the member for Richmond about achieving these synergies. Having a body like Infrastructure Australia would certainly help with those deliberations. Regional communities are aware that public transport is based on the principle of economies of scale. The provision of passenger services comes down to density and to the numbers of potential passengers. Better resourcing for road transport corridors like the Summerland Way, which runs from northern New South Wales into Queensland, would create other linkages for possible rail connections for the future industrial hubs of Warwick and Toowoomba and feed into the planned intermodal site of Bromelton, which connects to the rest of Australia through the national rail network and Australia’s seaports. The wider benefits of these wide linkages and the subsequent economies of scale are that the area would have the ability to provide public transport services. All of this is possible-the private investors are there, the local and state authorities realise the need and the residents just want services. The only thing missing is the coordination of all these interests, and this, I believe, can be further progressed by the establishment of Infrastructure Australia. A coordinated approach through the establishment of Infrastructure Australia would give one agency the ability to bring together all the components and resolve all the inconsistencies that I have touched upon in this speech. The proposed Infrastructure Australia is the lynchpin which locks together all the stakeholders and their combined roles in planning, investment and construction. For these reasons, I commend the bill to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE Oxley, a great supporter of the Warrego Highway. Australia Bill 2008. Only time will tell whether this is just window dressing or whether in fact it will work and deliver real and tangible benefits in infrastructure across Australia. I want to firstly put the record of the coalition government. When we came to government in 1996 we were confronted with a massive debt that was left to us by the previous Labor government-a $96 billion debt that we had to start to pay off. Our international credit rating had been downgraded. We had to not only pay off the debt but get our credit rating restored. Then we could start to invest in real infrastructure. We started to do that in a very significant way. Had we as a coalition government inherited the economy that we have given to the Labor Party-no debt, money in the bank, a AAA credit rating-we would have been able to do a great deal more about infrastructure, but we had to deal with the legacy of 13 years of the mismanagement by Labor government, as well as mismanagement by Labor governments right across Australia. State Labor governments collectively have something like a $60 billion debt today. They are also impacting on the interest rate rises because they are in the financial markets out there having to source cash to meet those commitments caused by their own mismanagement. I say that at the outset to highlight the fact that the Labor Party have been given the golden goose in relation to the economy. Let us see if any golden eggs can be laid in this termprobably the only term that they will have in government-by Infrastructure Australia and this bill before the House, which is a commitment of the Labor Party. I represent an electorate of some 560,000 square kilometres, stretching from just west of Brisbane down to Benarkin and Blackbutt-not far from the member for Oxley’s boundary, in fact-all the way through to the Northern Territory border. Within the boundaries of the federal electorate of Maranoa we have important mining and agricultural industries which are great wealth creators for this nation. In fact, the coal industry-and I am sure that the member for Oxley would be interested in this-is the largest export earner for the state of Queensland of any industry. The Surat coal basin, virtually unexploited at this point and the largest coal reserve in Australia, will over the next five to 10 years have a significant number of mines opened up in it, underpinning the importance of the need for infrastructure investment in my electorate of Maranoa. The beef industry is another one. It is the second largest export earner by value-as the member for Barker would appreciate, I am sure-from the state of Queensland. Think of the number of jobs that both those industries create. All of them-the beef industry, the coal industry, the oil and gas industry-are not located in CBD Brisbane down in George Street. They are located out in the regions and in the rural and remote parts of Queensland. But every Queenslander and every Australian benefits from these two industries as well as from many other industries, from the wealth that they create and the jobs that they provide for families. We all benefit from these great resources. Since 2001 the coalition has invested some $102 million in road infrastructure in the seat of Maranoa. One of the most important road infrastructure investments that the coalition invested in, when we started to get the Labor debt under control, was Roads to Recovery. We are starting to hear whispers from the corridors out there on the blue carpet that this program MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008

215,Mr Ripoll,But you didn’t!,173,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
216,Mr Bruce Scott,"No, indeed. I rise with great pleasure to speak on the Infrastructureis going to be gutted. It is for the chop from the finance minister. Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson, I am sure you are alerted to this in your own constituency. Roads to Recovery is a program in which the coalition government doubled road funding, paying that money direct to local governments so that they could invest it in local roads of importance in their own community. One of the great benefits of that program was that it went to local government, and every dollar went on roads. Had we directed that money through state bureaucracies, five, 10, 15 or 20 per cent of it could have been used up in bureaucracies. Now, before a kilometre of bitumen or sealed road has been put down in any of those local government areas, we hear whispers-as we heard a week ago that the carer payment was to be axed. Next: ‘No, that’s not right.’ It took about five days to turn that one around, but we hear the whispers coming out. Roads to Recovery is in the finance minister’s and the Treasurer’s sights. They know that a large portion of that money goes out into coalition seats in rural and regional and remote parts of Australia, bringing great benefit to those communities. I know the minister has got his eye on Roads to Recovery, but I call on him to commit to the Roads to Recovery program in this year’s budget and subsequent budgets while ever they hold the Treasury benches because of the importance of that infrastructure spending that local governments invest in roads and because every dollar that comes from the Commonwealth goes into roads, not into state bureaucracies. The coalition committed some $128 million out of AusLink2 to an investment in the Warrego Highway on the western side of Groom and in my own electorate of Maranoa during the election campaign. I know that the then opposition, now government, committed some $50 million-and this was confirmed by the Prime Minister when he went to Roma unannounced to the local councils, when he went with the agriculture minister to a property near my own home town; in fact near my own home. But they confirmed that that $50 million would be spent on the Warrego Highway, upgrading the highway from Mitchell to Roma so that those type 2 roadtrains could come from Mitchell through to Roma. Many of those type 2 roadtrains come from Western Australia, carrying livestock, carrying cattle. Many of them of course are in the reverse-they couple-up in Roma to go to Darwin and to the other side of Australia with freight and goods into the mining communities and bringing much-needed infrastructure into those communities. But we will be watching with great interest to see when that first $50 million starts to roll out on the Warrego Highway between Mitchell and Roma. I am watching with great interest and, if that is part of Infrastructure Australia, I will welcome it. I will be surprised when the money comes but I will certainly welcome it because it is indeed long overdue. The other part of the Warrego Highway that is in urgent need of upgrading, which the coalition committed to prior to the election as part of the AusLink2 funding, is the section from Chinchilla to Dalby. That money would have started to roll out on 1 July this year-not next year or the year after in an election year; on 1 July 2008. That was our commitment. The road from Chinchilla, particularly between Warra and McAllister, is very dangerous-in fact we have had a very tragic death there in the last 18 months. The Warrego Highway is a national highway linking Brisbane and the southern states right through to Mount Isa and Darwin. It is one of the major arterial corridors of our nation. I say to the minister: please, start that money MAIN COMMITTEE for the Warrego Highway rolling out as of 1 July this year so that we will not see any more tragic accidents on this section of it. I heard the member for Groom talking earlier about the second range crossing at Toowoomba. That is another vital piece of infrastructure. The coalition committed some $700 million to it during the election campaign, but did we hear the same from the Labor Party? No, we did not. That second range crossing is a vital piece of infrastructure which would link the south-east corner of Queensland, the port of Brisbane, through to the resource areas of western Queensland, right up through to the Surat coal basin and up into Darwin, and all points in between. Around Dalby at the moment we are seeing large numbers of coal seam methane gas producers tap into the coal seam underneath the Darling Downs and right out to Wandoan and Chinchilla. But coming with that is the power generation infrastructure. Two gas-fired power stations are under construction right now to use coal seam methane, a very clean source of energy that is going to provide a much-needed boost to the capacity of electricity generation in Queensland. When the government are looking at Infrastructure Australia, they must relook at the second range crossing. Why is that? Because right now in Dalby they are setting up a thousand-person camp for the workers on the two new power stations. But what will happen with the construction of these power stations? All the steel, generators, boilers and any other infrastructure that goes with power stations will come from Brisbane, often having come from overseas to the port of Brisbane. The infrastructure will have to be transported across the Great Dividing Range and it will have to travel through Toowoomba to get through to the Surat coal basin where the coal seam methane gas-fired power stations are being established. We also committed to the Cunningham Highway upgrade, particularly at Cunningham’s Gap. So often the highway at Cunningham’s Gap suffers from rockfalls, particularly in winter when there has been some rainfall through that part of my electorate which joins onto the seat of Blair. We had a proposition to invest some $20 million into the highway at Cunningham’s Gap, not only for safety reasons but also for the continuity of transport so that that highway is not cut off because of a rockfall. That is the main arterial link alternative to the Pacific Highway to Sydney, Melbourne and down through the Newell Highway. The Cunningham Highway is a very important link from the south-east corner of Queensland to the New England Highway and down through New South Wales to Sydney. I know that we are still waiting on engineers to complete their reports on what is the best solution, but my suggestion to the engineers was that, where there is a danger of rocks falling on the road, perhaps we ought to put a form of ‘tunnel’ over the highway so that if rocks do fall in the future they fall straight over the tunnel-like roof and down into the valley. It will be a very expensive exercise to complete the stabilisation of the upside of that highway through Cunningham’s Gap but I do urge the minister to look at the infrastructure need through Infrastructure Australia to make sure that that is also a project that gets underway sooner rather than later. I hope it is identified as a priority by the minister. I want to touch very quickly on another important aspect of infrastructure, and that is airport infrastructure. In our term in government, we invested significant sums of money in safety upgrades for many of our airports in rural Australia. That helped many local councils complete the fencing of their airports, not only at the airport terminal side but also round the MAIN COMMITTEE perimeters. Why? Because so often in drought times there is a risk that landing aircraft could collide with kangaroos on the airstrips, particularly at night. These airstrips are vital not only for medical evacuations through the Royal Flying Doctor Service but also other passenger services that service the outback of my electorate. There is one particular airport I wanted to touch on in the limited time. I have left for me. I have been in touch with the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia only today on this issue. It concerns the remote community of Bedourie in the Diamantina shire, population 80-the shire with a greater geographic area than the state of Tasmania. It is the headquarters of the Diamantina shire. The state Labor government in Queensland, to their great credit, subsidise the air services out into the remote parts of Queensland. A new contract that has only just been let will see that air service-going right out through Windorah, Birdsville, Bedourie, Boulia and up to Mount Isa from Brisbane and return-upgraded from a Metroliner to the new Saab 42-seater. That will revolutionise, if I can put it that way, the opportunities for tourism in the outback of Queensland, because it is a 42-seater, it will have a flight attendant, a toilet on board and all of those other facilities that so often people just take for granted on the more coastal routes. One of the issues the Diamantina shire is confronting is the fact they have to upgrade the Bedourie airport. They have to lengthen the runway and upgrade the lighting for emergencies at night. The state government has provided the Diamantina Shire Council with some $900,000 but they are $900,000 short. I spoke to the parliamentary secretary this morning and I said: ‘I would hope that, under the remote area program that we had as a coalition government-the airport upgrade program-there would be some money made available to this very small remote community. They struggle to build these facilities on their own. They have a very small rate base, as you can imagine, with only 80 people in the whole town and community. I suggest that $300,000 to $400,000 would certainly ease the pain on their own ratepayers. While I acknowledge that the state government has provided some $900,000, they are still $900,000 short.’ In the interim, while this airstrip is upgraded, they will have to run some 160 kilometres down a dirt road to Birdsville to pick up passengers and health workers and freight twice a week. It is an urgent request. I appreciate the fact that the parliamentary secretary has already provided the department with a brief on that issue. I am hoping we will get a positive response from the government to assist this small rural community. Finally, regarding medical infrastructure, the coalition had the Rural Medical Infrastructure Fund, which was part of our Regional Partnerships program. That has been villainised by the government today, but it is a very important program. If there is something that we can do to assist in relation to medical facilities in rural and remote communities, it will be through the Rural Medical Infrastructure Program. In fact, in my own electorate the Birdsville medical clinic received some $900,000 from that infrastructure fund. At Aramac they received some $400,000 and Charleville-which is in my constituency as well-received some $400,000. The Rural Medical Infrastructure Fund allowed those communities to put a medical precinct in those communities. Doctors can come to the town and there are facilities for surgery and waiting rooms and the other associated infrastructure that comes with a medical centre. It is an important program and I once again urge the minister and the Labor government not to gut this program. It provides important financial support for these smaller communities, not for the big cities. We know that they are going to have 24-hour clinics in some of the cities. But I MAIN COMMITTEE ask members opposite to think of those communities in rural and remote Australia where the large resources of this nation are located-the oil, gas, beef, coal and hard-rock industriesand support those wealth-generating industries and the communities that support them. Medical infrastructure is one of those vital parts of any successful and healthy community. I look forward with great interest to watching the progress of this bill. I hope it is not just a piece of paper that sits around this place unacted on. I will support the bill. I look forward to the infrastructure rolling out across Australia, not just in selected Labor areas or in the high-population areas but also in the rural and remote communities of Australia. day for infrastructure. In the true tradition of the Labor Party as nation builders, we are actually doing something in our first 100 days in government to make a significant improvement to this nation’s infrastructure-and not just meeting the need for physical infrastructure but improving how the process is managed and how we bring it forward. That was our commitment to the electorate and we are going to keep that commitment. In the great tradition of the Labor Party which saw us, in the eighties and nineties, reform the financial markets and banking, today we are reforming infrastructure. Today we are taking the next great step forward in terms of the things that need to be done in this country. I have always said that if the last 20 years were about anything they were about financial reform, banking reform and the economic status of this country. The next 20 years are about infrastructure reform. That is what we are doing today in delivering on our promise. I have to just take note here of comments by the previous speaker, the member for Maranoa. What he talked about was a great long list of everything that the coalition, in nearly 12 years in government, did not do-everything they ignored, everything they set to the side, everything they underfunded, everything they were going to do, but nothing that they actually did apart from sticking a few fences in a few spots and maybe a couple of bits and pieces of roads, which were all very welcome but, funnily enough, mostly in National Party seats. That was the great irony in the previous speaker saying he hoped this measure would not be used as a rort. If he knew anything about the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008, if he understood anything about the process that has been put together in formulating this legislation, he would know that that is precisely the reason the Labor Party and the government have moved to set up Infrastructure Australia and the infrastructure coordinator. It is to take away the porkbarrelling and the rorting and to give this country a decent shot at the proper use of taxpayer funds to deliver infrastructure where it is needed most, and on a priority basis, not just where the National Party needs it most. So today is a very great day for all Australians because this legislation will make a huge difference and have a huge impact. This will set the scene for the next 20 years. In 20 years time, people will look back to this bill and say that it was the great regulatory change that brought in the framework that enabled the building of key infrastructure in this nation that would otherwise not have been possible because of the way, for more than a decade, that infrastructure had been misused, misrepresented, underfunded, pork-barrelled and completely botched by the previous government. I always lament all those missed opportunities, all the money that went to one project when it should not have gone there at all. Of course every project is important. However, some projects were not asked for or required by MAIN COMMITTEE",173,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
217,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (5.30 Pm),"What a great day today is for Australia. What a greatthe local area, but they got the money anyway. The great thing to be said about Infrastructure Australia is that it will be a framework for guiding and advising government. I intend to take only 10 minutes in this debate so that the Main Committee can work through the issues it has to handle this afternoon, but I want to run through a few points. With Infrastructure Australia we will have for the first time a national, coordinated approach to infrastructure reform. It is about economic performance. It is about raising national productivity. Those are all key things. I only heard one of the previous speakers from the opposition but I am sure they talked about the legacy they picked up in 1996 and the legacy we have picked up now. Well, let me tell you that the legacy we picked up is the highest inflation in 16 years. This country is under real pressure. Interest rates are going through the roof, with 12 interest rate rises in a row. Productivity is falling through the floor. Our national debt is going through the roof. We have significant problems to deal with. There is a skills crisis and there is an infrastructure crisis. And let us not think for one minute we do not have in this country an infrastructure crisis which will have a real economic impact on everything that takes place. Look at the infrastructure bottlenecks in terms of our coal, our exports, our agricultural exports, the congestion on our roads and the time it takes people to get to and from work, let alone the goods that travel around this country on our freight roads-there is a really important job to be done. It is not easily done. It takes (a) a lot of money (b) a lot of commitment and (c) a willingness to do it right for the first time in this country. We need a fully coordinated approach through COAG, through the three tiers of government-the federal government, the state governments and local government, in partnership. You might think it has just been us calling on this to happen, that this was just some sort of election promise. Let me go through a bit of history because I think that is really important here. This mob on the other side, the new opposition, back in 1996 actually had a very similar policy. For a brief moment in history they believed there should be a coordinated approach. But then, when they won power and got drunk on it, they thought: ‘Let’s put that to the side; we’d rather just dictate where the money goes. Let’s forget about coordination; let’s just send it to those seats we think are more important than other seats.’ In the end, if you look at the litany of infrastructure development in this country, it was based more on which seat you held than on what was the biggest priority. History tells us clearly that key industry groups like the Business Council of Australia, CEDA, Australian Industry Group, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia and Engineers Australia all called for a coordinated approach to infrastructure planning and development in this country. But those calls fell on deaf ears because the then Howard government ignored the calls of the community, of the Business Council, of all those independent voices, about what was the best way. They understood, like we understand today, the missing opportunities. I will give you one in my local area-there are hundreds right across the country. For 10 years I campaigned and lobbied on having the Ipswich Motorway, that vital piece of infrastructure, fully upgraded, not just in my electorate but in the electorate of Blair. Blair was held by a Liberal member who is no longer with us; instead, we now have the very fine member for Blair, Shayne Neumann. I congratulate him for being here for this very important bill. There were a whole heap of other road projects-the Bruce, the Cunningham, the Warrego and a whole range of roads across this country. But it was never important enough for the government, in more than a decade, to ever really do anything about those except when they MAIN COMMITTEE smelt a political opportunity, saving the backsides of either one of their National Party members or one of their Liberal Party members. When it came to real infrastructure development, real reform, doing something that could be acceptable to the whole community, based on a real outcome in the national interest, we got nothing. That is the outcome from the former government after more than a decade of being in the job. They talk about the great economy they left us. Let me remind them of the great surpluses they had. We appreciated those surpluses but they were not spent on infrastructure. Where are the great days we used to have when the Labor Party, nation builders, actually did courageous things like the Snowy Mountains scheme? being the greatest infrastructure project since the Snowy Mountains scheme. It beggars belief you could even compare the two in the same century, let alone one with the other. They are not even remotely similar in the sort of courage or commitment that was displayed. We supported AusLink1 and AusLink 2. We will keep those programs and we will improve them. But we will go a step further than the former government. We are going to approach this from a real sense of partnership with the state governments, whoever they may be, and local governments. Infrastructure in this country is far too important to leave up to individuals and parties who hack it in for themselves. That is exactly what we got. While we are going back to the last century in terms of records, let me remind the former government, the coalition, of this: we now have some of the highest inflation that this country has had in some 16 years. Ordinary people, working people, are under real pressure. There are a whole range of economic circumstances where, while the economy generally speaking is good, there is a lot of pressure. You cannot argue the economic data. You cannot argue just one side of it; you have to argue both sides. But the real way forward in this is not only good economic management, which we are doing right now-tackling inflation and taking the pressure off high interest rates-but infrastructure, actually getting the productive capacity of this country up to a reasonable level. The problem we are going to face in the next two to three to five years is that, while we will continue to dig up the same amount of, or more, coal, we are not going to be able to ship it out. If coal prices, steel prices or the prices of other natural resources come down, we are going to feel the real economic impact of that. The former government, the Howard government, had an absolute boom in terms of nearly $400 billion added to the bottom line of the economy. It is easy to be a good Treasurer in great economic times; it is much, much harder, as we see the former Treasurer sitting there smirking as he always has, realising that he did not leave the economy in quite as good a condition as he thinks he did. I remember very well in this place the lambasting we used to get from the former Treasurer, coming in here and saying that he was the driver of a Ferrari and that it was a finely tuned racing car, a fine motor vehicle, that could not be entrusted to anyone else. The problem is he drove the Ferrari straight into a brick wall, wrecked it, walked away and then expected everyone else to pick up the pieces. We are prepared to take on that challenge and we are going to start by doing it right here today in meeting our election commitment of delivering Infrastructure Australia. I highly recommend this legislation to everyone in the House and say to the community simply this: for MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008

The former member for Gwydir talked about AusLinkthe first time in Australian history, we will have a regulated, properly controlled body that will look after the infrastructure needs of all Australians, not just those who live in certain seats. That further proceedings on the bill be conducted in the House. Question agreed to. Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 February, on motion by Mr Tanner: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment Bill 2008 aims to improve accountability and transparency arrangements for Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies, and align the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 with equivalent provisions in the Corporations Act 2001. These changes are based on experience from 10 years of operation of the act, which was introduced by the coalition government in 1996 as part of a package of four bills and associated measures designed to modernise controls on Commonwealth finances and over businesses owned or operated by the Commonwealth. The act brought a greater degree of uniformity and clarity to financial reporting standards applying to Commonwealth authorities and established standards of conduct for those engaged in the management of those entities. These amendments build on the act and are aimed at improving governance and accountability arrangements for bodies within the Australian government. The coalition supports any move to improve governance and accountability; in fact, the coalition has a proven track record when it comes to improving governance, accountability and transparency across a range of areas. We introduced accrual accounting to provide details of the full cost of service delivery. For the first time we published a balance sheet for the general government sector and the whole of the public sector. When Labor were last in government they had no idea and certainly we had no idea of what the value of the government’s assets were or key liabilities like the unfunded superannuation liability. We introduced for the first time consolidated whole-of-government financial reports audited by the Auditor-General and we introduced the outputs-outcomes framework to place the focus on what was actually being delivered for the money spent. We introduced legislation to bring 2,800 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations up to date with modern corporate governance and accountability standards. In 2003 it was the coalition that established the Defence Materiel Organisation, the DMO, as a prescribed agency, giving Australia’s largest project management organisation greater responsibility and accountability in providing better procurement to ensure equipment was delivered on time and on budget. The coalition paid attention to making migration settlement programs outcome orientated, accountable and focused on delivering services that ensured migrants, refugees and humanitarian entrants become independent, active participants in Australian society as quickly as possible. Under Labor last time, when they were last in government, settlement grants were distributed on political grounds rather than community need, while poor management and lack of accountability jeopardised settlement program delivery. MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
220,Mr Neumann (Blair) (5.41 Pm),I move:,180,Commonwealth Authorities And Companies Amendment Bill 2008
221,Mr Dutton (Dickson) (5.42 Pm),"The Commonwealth Authorities and CompaniesAustralia is a model in relation to transparency and accountability to countries around the world. The OECD Economic Survey of Australia released in February 2005 said: In the last decade of the 20th century, Australia became a model for other OECD countries in two respects: first, the tenacity and thoroughness with which deep structural reforms were proposed, discussed, legislated, implemented and followed-up in virtually all markets, creating a deep-seated “competition culture”; and second, the adoption of fiscal and monetary frameworks that emphasised transparency and accountability and established stability-oriented macro policies as a constant largely protected from political debate. Together, these structural and macro policy anchors conferred an enviable degree of resilience and flexibility on the Australian economy. The combination resulted in a prolonged period of good economic performance that shrugged off crises in its main trading partners as well as a devastating drought at home. The short-term outlook is for continuing strong growth of productivity and output, low inflation and budget surpluses accompanied by tax cuts. The point that needs to be made here is that, unlike the government, the coalition stands for: government remaining transparent and accountable for its decisions; minimising government waste and inefficiency, so the government’s investment in services like health, education, defence, the environment and transport is weighted towards services on the ground rather than administration; and disciplined financial management, so the government lives within its means, without imposing the burden of higher taxes or placing pressure on interest rates with deficits and government debt. On that point, it is a little bit rich for the Labor Party at the moment to blame inflation on the former coalition government and claim it now needs to cut government spending. The coalition should be remembered as having a proud record in economic and particularly financial management. We inherited a $10 billion deficit when we came to government, which we converted into around $10 billion surpluses. We inherited $96 billion of debt when we came into government in 1996, which we completely eliminated. We inherited a ballooning unfunded superannuation liability, which we addressed by creating the Future Fund, a fund which Labor has now already started to flag as one that it will raid into the future. The Labor Party are in no position at all to question the coalition on our financial management. It is absurd for Labor now to blame the coalition for inflationary pressures when Mr Swan in opposition actually opposed virtually all our proposals to help contain inflation, including eliminating debt, producing surpluses and liberalising workplace relations. Labor criticised our surpluses as being too large and always demanded extra spending in almost every area of government responsibility. And now Labor are claiming to be economic conservatives. Labor were paralysed in opposition for 11½ years because they ruined the economy when they were last in power. Families and people in business, small and large, could not forget the interest rates-in some cases over 20 per cent-on overdrafts and bill facilities; unemployment hit 10.9 per cent and the economy was faltering. Quite rightly, the Australian people would not trust Labor with the economy again for a period of almost 12 years; that was until November 24 last year. By that time the political minds of the ALP, including the now Treasurer, had decided they would have to convince, to fool, the Australian people they were economic conservatives just like the coalition. To regain office, they would have to pretend there was not a sliver of difference between the capacity of the coalition to manage the economy and the ability of Wayne Swan and Kevin Rudd to do it. Essentially they needed to be able to argue to the Australian people that they could be trusted to manage a $1.1 trillion economy. MAIN COMMITTEE Politically-and this is the important point-they could not let the Australian people see their economic incompetence again, or it would be electoral suicide. When Australians ask themselves why our economic history is being rewritten at the moment by Kevin Rudd, Lindsay Tanner, Wayne Swan and othersother members by their titles. the Labor side, the reality is that they are talking down the Australian economy for political purposes. They are talking up the impact of inflation. They are talking up the prospect of market activity in terms of where they think rates will be. The Australian people should question the motives of people like the Treasurer and ask why he feels compelled at the moment to talk down the Australian economy, to shatter business and consumer confidence, in a fragile environment where internationally there are ramifications that will flow to our economy over the coming months and years. Labor aim to deliver a budget surplus of at least 1½ per cent of GDP in 2008-09. They claim that this will require discipline and an approach to spending which is hardline, particularly in relation to savings. But the truth of the matter is that 1½ per cent of GDP is not exceptional in the present circumstances, when the coalition left a strong, growing economy with low unemployment and zero net debt. When we came into government, $8 billion a year of government revenues flowed straight back out the door to service the interest bill that went with that $96 billion of debt. It is an absurdity for Labor to claim at the moment, with the fundamental strengths of the Australian economy, that they will not have the capacity to reach a surplus well beyond the 1½ per cent of GDP that is forecast. Labor say that future budget surpluses cannot be given back to taxpayers as they are inflationary but at the same time claim that the $31 billion in tax cuts promised in the election are not inflationary. The point needs to be made that one cannot have it both ways. Either tax cuts put pressure on inflation or they do not. The coalition turned around a budget deficit of over $10 billion in 1995-96 to deliver 10 surpluses in 12 budgets. In their last five budgets when they were last in government Labor produced cumulative deficits totalling $69 billion. Between 1990-91 and 1995-96, net government debt under Labor rose from $16.9 billion to a staggering $95.8 billion. As recently as 2004-05, if you want a better understanding of how Labor manages the economy, the state budgets were collectively in fiscal surplus by almost $4 billion. This year, the budgets of seven of the eight states and territories are forecast to be in fiscal deficit to the tune of nearly $6 billion. That represents a deterioration of around $10 billion in just three years, at the same time that the coalition repaid the $96 billion of debt which Labor had passed on to future generations. At the moment the Labor Party, particularly the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, is in a mode of running around suggesting that the so-called ‘razor gang’, which is nothing more than a political stunt, will guide the budget back into increased surplus and therefore bring downward pressure on interest rates. The reality is that there has been no transparency on the part of this government, and the most vulnerable have been given no guarantee that they will continue to receive the support they need. The minister for finance is saying that he is going to go out and solve government spending issues by slashing $15 million worth of Public Service travel and that somehow that is going to rectify the economic position-if it needs rectiMAIN COMMITTEE",180,Commonwealth Authorities And Companies Amendment Bill 2008
222,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Kj Thomson),Order! I ask that the member refer to,182,Commonwealth Authorities And Companies Amendment Bill 2008
223,Mr Dutton,"With pleasure, Mr Deputy Speaker. With all those members and more onfying. That really goes to what a political stunt mode the minister and the Treasurer are in at the moment. I think that, at the moment, the Australian people-and, in particular, economists-are seeing through the pretty shallow political path that these people are heading down. There is no substance to the argument they are putting forward. This is a $1.1 trillion economy and the finance minister of this country is going out and suggesting that if public servants’ travel expenses were cut by $15 million, out of a $1,100 billion budget, that would somehow bring downward pressure on interest rates-at the same time that state governments are running up debts at record levels right round the country. This is an issue that more political journalists need to investigate, because this really is a political stunt which, over the first few months of the Rudd government, has gone terribly, terribly wrong. People are paying for this pain at the moment, given this talking down of consumer sentiment and consumer and business confidence. It really has long-term ramifications. I think that at the moment this is way beyond the grasp of a Treasurer who is clearly completely out of his depth. This is a Treasurer who, at this present time, has no capacity to deal with the complexities that face this government in terms of not just the domestic pressures but also the international pressures on our economy. The point needs to be made that, over the course of 12 years of economic management under the Howard government in this country, we were able to deal with issues such as the US going into recession. We were able to deal with a significant drought. We were able to deal with the realities that faced our country in an international sense. When economies right through Asia and in parts of Europe were suffering significant downturns, we were able to deal with all of those pressures, including inflationary pressures, right through our period of government. The reality is that it took a long time for the Treasurer to switch from opposition mode to government mode. He made the transition very difficult for himself by going out and for political reasons talking down the economy so that, if in the future interest rates did go up, Labor would not be saddled with the issue and somehow the origin of inflationary pressures would lie with the former government. That is the political argument that the government have tried to make. It is a false argument that went to the lack of credibility of this Treasurer. It is why when you talk to economists and people in financial sectors right around the country they laugh at the performance thus far of Treasurer Swan. It really has been a politically based performance that has certainly not focused on the economy in the responsible way this person should. Before the election, Labor pledged to increase financial assistance to older Australians, people with disabilities and carers. But we have heard in recent days that the razor gang wants to cut funding to the most disadvantaged. Labor claimed $643 million in savings. That was, again, a political stunt. Many of the programs are not being cut at all; they are just being moved within the balance sheets and are a mere drop in the ocean relative to the size of the economy and in terms of having a downward pressure on inflation. The true test of the upcoming budget will be whether or not the Labor Party has cost-cutting measures which run into the billions of dollars for single programs. The payment to carers totals about $1.7 billion. If the Labor Party is to commit to that sort of expenditure over the forward estimates over four years, that is expenditure in excess of $6 billion that the Labor Party has now MAIN COMMITTEE walked away from, and no doubt its ERC process will be looking at ways by which it can slice government expenditure of that order. In my view, it is incumbent upon the Labor Party to come out and say ahead of the budget which of the sacred cows, if you like, they are going to slash. Are they going to slash childcare expenditure, which enjoyed a significant increase under the Howard government? Are they going to slash expenditure on health, which was an area where significant expenditure existed under the Howard government? Are they going to slash expenditure on defence, which again was an area which received significant support under the Howard government? Are they going to slash support to families through the family tax benefit part A or part B? I say to the member for Oxley: which of those policies would your constituents support slashing? Would they support abolition of the government’s support of the childcare tax rebate or the childcare benefit? With Amberley close to your electorate, would you support the Rudd government slashing the funding to defence? These are the sorts of areas that would need to be cut significantly by the Rudd government if they are to make significant inroads into the tens of billions of dollars that the Treasurer seems to be alluding to. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation has been talking about the necessity of cutting billions of dollars worth of Commonwealth expenditure. Unless he cuts into those sorts of programs, this will have once again been only political rhetoric and will have made a farce of some of the statements that the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Treasurer have made in relation to this debate so far. The reality for people such as the member for Oxley, who has been making false promises to his electorate for so many years, is that some programs of that nature will have to be cut if the Labor Party are to deliver on this promise of slashing government spending, because those are the main areas of expenditure. I see no evidence from the Labor Party as to how they are going to cut expenditure in those areas. Labor may talk about accountability, but this is not something that it practises in the area of financial management. Labor’s policy of giving state governments free rein over how they spend money from specific purpose payments means that federal Labor is effectively writing blank cheques for state Labor, despite their record of mismanagement and shocking service delivery. They have had terrible performance, particularly in Queensland. Peter Beattie and Anna Blighperhaps those in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia, the ACT and the Northern Territory, and many local government authorities as well where Labor governs. The reality is that we need to put on the record that Labor when in government are in an economic sense nothing more than B-graders. When you look at somebody like the current Treasurer, he is laughed at not just by the banks but by the economists and by the financial markets. Now he is being laughed at by Australian families and by small business. For some of them, that is now turning into stark horror and terror, because they really are worried about where this Australian economy is headed under Wayne Swan. The first three months have certainly been a bad sign of where Labor is intending to take us. MAIN COMMITTEE",182,Commonwealth Authorities And Companies Amendment Bill 2008

However, history shows us that Labor has at both a federal and a state level continually avoided appropriate levels of accountability and transparency. The practice appears to be continuing under Rudd Labor. This government must immediately stop the hypocrisy and start implementing its supposed program for accountability and transparency. Labor must stop the political ranting and raving and provide some underscoring to the confidence that was once there for businesses in particular so that they can continue to make investment decisions and decisions about employing staff and we can see continued growth in the Australian economy. Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan have at the moment no idea as to where the Australian economy is headed over the next 12 months. If we see in this country a slowing of growth similar to that which we are now seeing in the United States, the current Treasurer will have no capacity and no plan to deal with that. At the moment, he is clubbing the Australian economy to a slow death. It is a political path which is dangerous, not just for Australian business but also for Australian consumers. In conclusion, the opposition supports the bill for the reasons that I have outlined. thorities and Companies Amendment Bill 2008. One of my favourite TV shows was Yes, Minister, brilliantly written by Jonathon Lynn and Antony Jay. It tells the story of the often hapless yet crafty Jim Hacker, the minister for the fictitious Department of Administrative Affairs in the United Kingdom government in the 1980s, and the smooth-talking head of the department, Sir Humphrey Appleby. There are many famous episodes of Yes, Minister but perhaps my favourite is called A question of loyalty. The minister had to front a select committee looking into the affairs of the department. He is fully briefed-so he thinks-and he goes to the committee with a scrum of public servants. His nemesis, opposition MP Betty Oldham, the member for Derbyshire East and a member of the committee, had leaked to her a new book by a retired civil servant detailing government waste in the department. This causes the minister much embarrassment and frustration at the meeting. When it is Sir Humphrey’s turn to front the committee, he gives a vintage performance. I mention this because it highlights why the Rudd government’s amendment is so timely. I would just like to repeat a passage which humorously illustrates the point. Mrs Betty Oldham says: Isn’t this a fantastic waste of taxpayer’s money? Do you agree the money was wasted? Sir Humphrey Appleby replies: It is not for me to comment on government policy. You must ask the minister. Betty Oldham says: Look, Sir Humphrey, whatever we ask the Minister, he says is an administrative question for you, and whatever we ask you, you say is a policy question for the Minister. How do you suggest we find out what’s going on? Sir Humphrey then replies in his own way: Yes, I do think there is a real dilemma here, in that while we have government policy to regard policy as the policy of Ministers and administration has the responsibility of the officials, questions of administrative policy can cause confusion between the administration of policy and the policy of administration, especially when responsibility for the administration of the policy of administration conflicts or overlaps with the responsibility for the policy of administration of policy … MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Commonwealth Authorities And Companies Amendment Bill 2008
228,Mr Neumann (Blair) (6.02 Pm),"I rise to speak in support of the Commonwealth AuMrs Betty Oldham replies: That is a lot of meaningless drivel, isn’t it, Sir Humphrey? Sir Humphrey replies: It is not for me to comment on government policy. You must ask the minister. I speak in support of this bill because it talks about the policy of administration and the administration of policy. Its purpose is to amend the legislation that regulates the financial affairs of Commonwealth authorities and companies under section 7 of the relevant act. Under section 7, a Commonwealth authority is a body holding money on its own account as a body corporate incorporated for a public purpose by an act of parliament or regulation. Under section 34 of the act, a Commonwealth company remains a Corporations Act company in which the Commonwealth has a controlling interest. It is these definitions that are being repealed under the new bill. The test that determines whether the Commonwealth controls a company has been improved under the new bill; hence, we have a better definition of what Commonwealth companies are. The existing section 4 states that a Commonwealth company does not include a company in which the Commonwealth has a controlling interest through one or more of the interposed Commonwealth authorities or Commonwealth companies. This new definition is a vast improvement because it provides greater certainty as to when the Commonwealth controls a company. It controls it if, and only if, it controls the composition of the company’s board-that is, it can appoint or remove the majority of its directors-it controls greater than 50 per cent of the total votes at a general meeting; or it controls greater than 50 per cent of the issued share capital. Why does this esoteric legal definition matter at all? It matters because legislation that governs these issues talks about reporting and accountability of Commonwealth governments and it talks about the regulation of Commonwealth companies and Commonwealth authorities. Commonwealth companies have reporting obligations beyond mere companies operating under the Corporations Law. We are talking about taxpayers’ funds. We are talking about the need for informed transparency and accountability. Hitherto, there has been uncertainty and vagueness as to just what is a Commonwealth company and what is a Commonwealth authority. Henceforth, amendments will be put in plain English. The bill says quite clearly that a person’s appointment as a director of a company follows necessarily from the person being an agency head or a statutory office holder. Thereby, that person is accountable. That is important. We expect as much of company directors. This leads to another important reform in the bill. It aligns the act with the Corporations Law for offences, penalties and terminology. This is particularly so relating to the failure to prepare financial statements or have them properly audited. A further important reform is to section 27F(1) of the act. A director of a Commonwealth authority who has a material personal interest in a matter that relates to the affairs of the authority currently needs only to give notice to the other directors. Under the bill, that director must not be present when the matter is being considered at a meeting or vote on the matter. This is an admirable reform in the area of law relating to conflict of duty and interest, and it surprises me that it was not included in the first place when the original legislation was promulgated in 1997. Further, the new bill clarifies the use of credit cards by Commonwealth authorities and introduces penalties for their misuse. The existing act is silent on the issue. We currently live in a world of vagueness. The bill sets out that cash, goods and services can be obtained by a Commonwealth authority MAIN COMMITTEE by use of a credit card or a credit voucher. Regulations pursuant to the act will specify who is authorised to use that credit card or voucher on behalf of the authority and the circumstances in which it may be used, where it may be kept and the maximum amount that may be borrowed. There are tough penalties of up to seven years in prison for those who so misuse. The bill also simplifies the application of the general policies of the Commonwealth government, making those policies more efficient and transparent. Section 28 and section 43 will both be replaced. This is important: under those two sections a minister may notify the directors of a Commonwealth authority in writing of general policies of the Commonwealth government. The responsible minister must consult the directors before notifying them of government policies. This is an extraordinary reversal of what I think the relationship should be between elected government officials and the public service. This section in its original form could easily have been drafted by Sir Humphrey Appleby out of Yes, Minister. He would have loved the section, because poor old Jim Hacker, the minister, was always required to consult with Sir Humphrey before even the general policies of the fictitious Department of Administrative Affairs were applied. Under the existing act, directors must ensure as far as practicable that policies are carried out in relation to subsidiaries of the authority. It is hard to see how they can do it. It is full of vagueness and obscurity, and I am certain Sir Humphrey could have drafted it even better than that. Even then, under this existing legislation, the minister could in writing exempt the directors of a Commonwealth authority from carrying out the general policies of the Commonwealth government. Section 43 of the act applies the same appalling drafting and bad public policy to Commonwealth companies. Really, the previous Howard government should be ashamed of itself for this particular piece of legislation in those sections. I am pleased that the new sections in relation to Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies make it plain who is in charge: the government is here to set the policy, and the public servants are here to execute it. The new provisions state explicitly that directors of Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies must ensure those entities comply with the general policy orders to the extent to which those apply. Further, directors may even exclude their requirements to comply with that order in relation to the ABC, the SBS, the ANU and the AIDC-and rightly so. The new bill is important in this regard-it has consequences that the directors of a Commonwealth authority or Commonwealth company, and not the Auditor-General, must provide financial statements and audited reports to the responsible minister. Also, the new bill requires all Commonwealth companies to provide a base level of annual reporting to the responsible minister, whose duty it is to table the report in parliament. Since the late 1990s, we have seen a toughening of duties and obligations for company directors under the Corporations Law. When the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act was enacted in 1970, it was modelled on the Corporations Law which was then enacted. In those days, officers’ duties were far less onerous and the corporate veil of protection was stronger than it is today. I welcome the strict liability offences under section 27F(1A), a new provision which states that strict liability applies to the circumstance where the director of a Commonwealth authority has a material personal interest in a matter that relates to the affairs of that authority-and so it should. They should be found strictly liable. MAIN COMMITTEE I applaud the government in respect of the notification provision for general policies. General policies apply to Commonwealth companies, and Commonwealth authorities will now be identifiable. Those general policies will be published on a federal registry of legislative instruments pursuant to the Legislative Instruments Act, and the Australian public will then be better informed accordingly. These provisions show that the Rudd Labor government is serious about openness, good corporate governance and accountability. The amendments in the bill bring the bill and the legislation into line with the Corporations Law. The act when it was first enacted detailed rules about reporting and accountability, but we have had 10 years of corporate experience since that time. Much has changed in our society’s attitude towards corporations concerning corporate governance and accountability, and we expect more of companies and directors in the private sector. We expect them to follow the same rigorous rules that we expect also of Commonwealth companies and Commonwealth authorities and their directors. I listened with interest to the previous speaker, the member for Dickson, who seemed to be in denial when it came to so much of the previous Howard government’s performanceaccepting all of the credit but taking none of the responsibility. He was then both politician and prophet, prophesying that the Rudd Labor government would excise and not commit itself to the commitments it made in the last election. I have news for him: we will carry out all the commitments that we made in Dickson as well as in Blair. The Rudd Labor government is fair dinkum when it comes to promoting the public interest. It is fair dinkum about not giving legislative licence to the Public Service to frustrate the policies of the elected government of this nation. Genuine reform to improve transparency, efficiency controls and practice is needed. The Rudd Labor government is prepared to do it. This bill is yet another step in the government’s reformist agenda to restore trust and integrity in government. This government is determined to build a modern forward looking and thinking Australia. It is determined to improve Public Service efficiency and get value for taxpayers’ dollars. The government is determined to face the challenge of economic management and accountability. The Rudd Labor government will ensure those who run Commonwealth companies and Commonwealth authorities report properly, act with probity and engage in best practice. Australia needs an impartial, competent public service committed to securing the public interest. The Rudd Labor government is determined to see it happen and any Sir Humphreys in the Public Service should beware. ties and Companies Amendment Bill 2008, which is a bill to amend an important piece of Commonwealth legislation, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. This act is an act that governs reporting and management requirements that are imposed on a range of statutory authorities and a number of Commonwealth companies in which the Commonwealth has a controlling interest. By way of illustration, among the statutory authorities are important bodies such as the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, the Australian Government Solicitor, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Australian Industry Development Corporation, the land councils in the Northern Territory and a range of other bodiesthe Australian War Memorial too is an authority that is governed as to its reporting and management requirements by the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Commonwealth Authorities And Companies Amendment Bill 2008
229,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (6.15 Pm),"I rise also in support of the Commonwealth AuthoriEqually there is a range of companies in which the Commonwealth has a controlling interest that are governed by this act. By way of illustration, the National Australia Day Council, Film Australia Ltd, the Telstra Sale Company Ltd and the Australian Rail Track Corporation Ltd give the Committee some idea of the nature of the corporations which are governed by this legislation. This amending bill picks up a range of requirements that are long overdue. It simplifies the process for applying general policies of the Australian government to make it more efficient and transparent through the introduction of a procedure known as general policy orders, which will replace the current process that is provided for under sections 28 and 43 of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. It will require all Commonwealth companies to provide a base level of annual reporting to their responsible minister, who then tables the report in parliament. It will better align-this is one of the more important features of the legislation-the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act with the Corporations Act, particularly in relation to offences and in relation to penalties and terminology, so as to get a meshing between the Corporations Act 2001 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. Another purpose of this legislation is to clarify the use of credit cards by Commonwealth authorities and to introduce penalties for the misuse of those credit cards. It makes, I suppose, what could be described as a ‘machinery change’ in improving the test to determine whether the Commonwealth controls a company and thus better defines what a Commonwealth company is. It provides that directors of a Commonwealth authority or a Commonwealth company must provide financial statements and audit reports of subsidiaries to their responsible minister. It makes some quite important clarifications about compliance with statutory and other duties by amending the protection of directors and public servants in the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act to ensure there is protection given to the persons who are intended to be covered. All in all, this set of reforms is directed at achieving consistency, transparency, accountability and the reduction of red tape-all of which aims are touchstones for the Rudd Labor government, all of which you will hear much more about in the years to come. I will start first with the general policy orders change which is proposed by this bill. That is a measure which is very directly aimed at improving transparency. The Rudd government is committed to transparency. This change will enable the making of general policy orders which will be publicly available. They will be listed on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments and be more readily identifiable therefore to parliament, to the public and of course to Commonwealth authorities and wholly Commonwealth owned companies. It will not change the way in which a general policy is developed. What it will change is the way in which such policies will be notified in a transparent way to be issued by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation through a general policy order and listed on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments. It will also improve consistency of the application of policy and reduce red tape, again those being themes of the Rudd Labor government. There are some important changes proposed by this bill to reporting requirements to be imposed on Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies. Again, the aim of these changes is to improve consistency. The bill does so by ensuring there will be consistent reporting requirements imposed by treating henceforth all of the Commonwealth companies as MAIN COMMITTEE public companies, notwithstanding that some of them are technically proprietary companies and have been, since changes were made to the Corporations Act, theoretically exempt from the requirement to prepare annual reports. That is not seen as appropriate. It is seen as appropriate that all Commonwealth companies should report in a consistent way. This bill will achieve consistency in that area. There will also be increases in reporting by wholly owned Commonwealth companies that are outlined in the bill. There are important alignments to be made by this bill with present provisions of the Corporations Act. I digress to make the comment that, while it is desirable that there be alignment of the provisions that apply to Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies with the provisions of the Corporations Act, the Corporations Act itself is probably sadly in need of some reform. A former Chief Justice, Sir Anthony Mason, was moved to describe the Corporations Law-that is, the predecessor law of the Corporations Act 2001-in 1992, some 15 years ago, in these terms: Oscar Wilde would have regarded our modern Corporations Law not only as uneatable, but also indigestible and incomprehensible. Nothing much has changed in the 15 years since Sir Anthony Mason spoke. I regret to say that the Corporations Act has, if anything, only got more indigestible and incomprehensible since. It is to be hoped that in the short term rather than in the long term we will be able to pay attention to the whole of the provisions of the Corporations Act in order to try to eliminate some of the immense complexity of that piece of legislation. I speak partly as a former practitioner, as someone who has had to work with the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 and its predecessor legislation. It is very much a project that I hope the Rudd government will be able to pick up. While it is desirable that there be alignment, for present purposes, of the requirements that apply to officers of Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies with the reporting requirements that apply to companies generally under the Corporations Act, it is a matter of regret that in one sense we are imposing the same level of complexity that one can find in the Corporations Act on those Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies. The particular alignments-which I do say are appropriate, notwithstanding the complexity of the provisions of the Corporations Act that they are being brought into line with-deal with, first of all, including a definition of ‘senior manager’ to make the bill consistent with the provisions of the Corporations Act. As the member for Blair explained, we are going to see increased consistency with Corporations Act offences and penalties so as to bring the provisions that apply to Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies into line with the ‘officers’ duties’ provisions that are found in the Corporations Act. There are also going to be matching provisions to impose a criminal penalty where there is a contravention of a reporting rule, similar to the Corporations Act. There are going to be some matching provisions to bring accounting records requirements into line with the Corporations Act. Importantly, again in order to achieve consistency with the Corporations Act, there are going to be provisions in relation to a failure to disclose material personal interests. Also relating to alignment with the Corporations Act there is presently a very important provision in section 27N of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act which prohibits a Commonwealth authority from insuring its officers against wilful breach of duty, misuse of position or misuse of information. That gives effect to a very important principle relating to MAIN COMMITTEE corporations, which is that it is wholly inappropriate and improper for a corporation to seek to insure its officers against wilful breaches of duty and wilful misuse of position. This bill will introduce a strict liability element in the same fashion as there is a strict liability element applied to this particular offence in the matching provision in the present corporations legislation. I will mention one other alignment where consistency is being achieved with the Corporations Act provisions, and that is the provisions of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act thatA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 6.28 pm to 6.40 pm accordance with standing order 192.

The country is Cuba, and the citizens are the 177 members of a Cuban medical team which returned to Cuba last week after two years of service to the people of East Timor. As members would know, the past two years have been marked by outbreaks of conflict in East Timor, requiring Australia to send additional military and police personnel. During this time the Cuban doctors were the only foreign medical team to remain in place. The team provided over two million consultations, often in the midst of violent situations. The team achieved a remarkable reduction in the infant mortality rate in East Timor. The benefits will be ongoing, as the Cuban team assisted in the creation of a medical facility which is training 148 East Timorese doctors to continue that much-needed work. The Cuban assistance to East Timor is only part of Cuba’s contribution. They are providing and training medical professionals to Latin America, Africa and the Asia-Pacific regions. While Australia can be proud of its military involvement in East Timor, the humanitarian contribution of Cuba and its people is worthy of our thanks-congratulations on a job well done.

(Time expired) Mary Mildred ‘Molly’ Heffernan Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (6.44 pm)-I would like to acknowledge the passing of one of Labor’s true believers and stalwarts, Mary Mildred Heffernan, otherwise known to most people as Molly. Molly was a stalwart of the labour movement-a one-eyed Labor supporter. Molly was born in Clarendon and, after marrying her husband, Luke, she moved to a house in Christies Beach, where she remained until her passing. For many years, Molly took a back seat in politics, leaving it to her husband, who was state secretary of the AMWU. It was after his passing, and after being doorknocked by the local state member, John Hill, that she became an active member. Molly would help out in any way she could. One example of this is when she used her 90th birthday celebration to help me, as the candidate for Kingston, meet the electors. Her enthusiasm for the Labor Party was matched only by her enthusiasm for her beloved football team, the Adelaide Crows. Her dedication to volunteering in our community, though, went well beyond the Labor Party. She spent many years involved as a volunteer in Little Athletics. Later, when her husband went blind, she fought very hard to establish, and was successful in establishing, the southern outreach office of the Royal Society for the Blind. Molly passed away peacefully at 90 years of age and will be very much missed. I take this opportunity to pass on my sincere condolences to her family. Mitchell Electorate: Annual Heritage Park Fair in Castle Hill, which this year commemorated the 204th anniversary of the Castle Hill convict rebellion. This was the first ever convict rebellion on Australian soil and took place on the site of the modern-day Heritage Park. It was from this site that Governor King gave the suburb of Castle Hill its name, back in 1802, and declared the area the third convict settlement after Sydney and Parramatta. On4 March 1804, 250 convicts broke out of the barracks at the government farm in Castle Hill, overpowered the guards and set fire to farms throughout Baulkham Hills and Winston Hills. The Castle Hill Heritage Park is a site of national importance and one of the nation’s most significant landmarks. The Castle Hill Heritage Park remains one of the least known government farms, dating back to 1801. However, with the enthusiasm of those involved in the commemoration on Sunday, I am sure the recognition of this important heritage site will only strengthen. I will work in this House to see greater state and federal funding given to, and recognition of, such an important and valuable resource for future generations.

Very recently, there was an important meeting on the Mornington Peninsula of police from throughout that area and the community. The message from these very brave police was: ‘We believe in our community, we support our community but we need the support of additional resources.’ They do a fantastic job, but what is most important is that they were faced with a policing crisis. They dealt with that issue: they stood up in public, they declared the need for support and they did so at the risk of losing their careers. In particular, District Inspector Gordon Charteris stood up and laid out the case for more policing on the peninsula. He is correct, he is courageous and he needs to be supported. There is a very real chance that he will be subject to retribution from the Victorian government. This cannot stand and it will not be allowed to happen. We will fight it and work with the local police on every front to ensure that somebody as courageous as Gordon Charteris is protected, that his message is listened to and that additional police resources for Hastings, Mornington and Rosebud are provided. Above all else, if our democracy means anything at a local level it means that courageous people such as Gordon Charteris should be supported and protected.

I am a great admirer of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and I am deputy chairman of the all-party group for Tibet in this place. I have to say that the Dalai Lama is one of the people I most admire. No-one in this world has had to put up with more than he has, yet he does not seem to bear any particular grudges. When the people of Tibet express their quite reasonable concerns, the Chinese authorities clamp down on them in a way that is completely unacceptable for a country which is hosting the Olympics this year. I support the continuation of the Beijing Olympics, as does His Holiness the Dalai Lama, but I want to express my concern and I hope that the Chinese back off. Australia does not recognise the independence of Tibet. This is a country which was occupied by force by the Chinese authorities, yet the world recognises Chinese authority over Tibet. One cannot possibly support the actions against innocent Tibetan citizens carried out by the aggressive Chinese forces. I ask China to reconsider. If it wants to take its place in the world as a major power then it must respect human rights. It must respect the rights of individual Tibetan citizens.

238,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ja Saffin),"Order! In accordance with standing orderEpilepsy Debate resumed, on motion by Ms Hall: That the House: (1) recognises that epilepsy is the most common serious brain disorder and is the most universal of all medical disorders; (2) acknowledges that 200,000 people live with epilepsy at any one time in Australia and that up to three times as many Australians will have epilepsy at some time in their lives; (3) that people living with epilepsy are disadvantaged by lack of research into the disorder and by the lack of a national plan for epilepsy or deeming it a disorder that is a national priority; (4) acknowledges the impact that epilepsy has on the lives of people living with it; (5) calls on the Australian Government to fund greater research into epilepsy; and (6) calls on the Australian Government to establish a nationwide educational strategy on epilepsy modelled on the World Health Organisation’s global campaign. Ms HALL (Shortland) (6.55 pm)-The World Health Organisation has identified that epilepsy is arguably the most misunderstood, most stigmatised and most underresourced health condition in the world today. There are an estimated 60-plus million people with epilepsy in the world, including at any one time around 200,000 Australian citizens. While Australia has a great deal to be proud about in its medical treatment of people with epilepsy, there are many for whom current medical treatments are woefully inadequate. As many as 10 per cent of Australians with epilepsy have poor control of their seizures, and for a smaller percentage there is so little control that life is almost unbearable for them and for those who love and care for them. I have experienced this at a personal level. My sister-in-law has suffered from uncontrollable epilepsy since she was 10 years of age, and I know the impact that it has had on her and her family’s lives. In countries such as the Netherlands and England, for people with uncontrollable or refractory seizures, programs exist that enable them to spend the time needed to be safely taken off all their medications and then reassessed and remedicated in light of the new diagnostic assessments. In conjunction with medical makeover and some social and employment support, help with developing independent living skills and whatever else is needed to get the person back on their feet with a chance of a better life. It is a more comprehensive approach than is offered anywhere in Australia. Once again, I can speak from experience, having worked with people with disabilities and epilepsy prior to coming into parliament. Even where seizures are fairly well controlled, the truth is there is often an accompanying sense of shame and fear attached to this condition. There are many burdens borne by people who live with epilepsy which make it particularly difficult to diagnose and to deal with. Epilepsy is a very complex condition and manifests itself in many ways. People living with uncontrolled or refractory epilepsy suffer enormous and unnecessary pain and hardship. It is time for us in Australia to accept the challenge and take steps to make the lasting changes to the lives of people with epilepsy and their carers, whose lives are impacted on in various ways. The recent mental health initiatives are a good example of what governments MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Statements By Members
239,The Deputy Speaker,"The question is that the motion be agreed to.can achieve. Despite significant medical research and treatment initiatives, there has been a failure to address many of the issues facing people living with epilepsy. The Joint Epilepsy Council of Australia, which is the Australian chapter of the International Bureau for Epilepsy, is a key player in the World Health Organisation’s global campaign. The JECA has asked that a national epilepsy working group be established and resourced to oversee a national public education program, in tandem with an applied social research program to ensure that the right messages are being targeted to the right people, and to develop strategies to address many of the issues faced by people with epilepsy based upon credible, rigorous applied social research. Areas requiring urgent attention include looking at the impact of epilepsy in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities; developing a better informed and more workable national response to the transport and driving difficulties faced by people living with epilepsy; ensuring appropriate, timely diagnosis and assessment is possible for all Australians who experience seizures, not just those living in selected capital cities; and making it possible for people whose seizures are totally uncontrollable to access longer term, up to nine months, reassessment and treatment centres. The critical role of trained epilepsy counsellors working throughout Australia with state and territory epilepsy associations needs to be recognised and given consistent support by the states, led by the Commonwealth. We need to listen to expert groups such as the Epilepsy Society of Australia and the American Academy for Neuroscience and put an immediate end to prescribing and dispensing practices that are high risk to people with epilepsy. The Joint Epilepsy Council has asked the parliament to form a parliamentary friends of epilepsy group. I am pleased to advise that this will take place. In conjunction with Senator Humphries, I will convene this group. We hope to launch it on 27 May this year. I hope that those people who are speaking in the debate will become members of this group because I believe it is a way by which we can make real changes. We will work to ensure that people living with epilepsy are able to be included in the mainstream life of Australia and, as the World Health Organisation global campaign puts it, ‘come out of the shadows’. young child in primary school was when another child suffered an epileptic fit. As I had not heard of epilepsy, I was quite shocked by this particular fit and how this girl reacted. Therefore, I am ashamed to say, I and other students moved some distance from this person because we simply did not understand what epilepsy was. We did not understand then that so many Australians suffered from epilepsy. Today 200,000 Australians suffer from epilepsy on a regular basis. It is very clear that this is a disease that really needs more research. Obviously, it is a disease about which most people in the community have insufficient knowledge. While I and others in primary school saw what occurred to this particular child, I suspect that in 2008, were a similar event to occur in a school anywhere in Australia, students would react in much the same way as we did at that time. That means that, during the ensuing years, we as a country simply have not done enough to improve our community store of knowledge of this insidious disease. We simply have not spent the money we need to spend to ensure that research is undertaken to try to do whatever we can to both find a cure for this disease and make sure that those living with this disease are able to do so in the best possible manner. MAIN COMMITTEE",195,Private Members Business
240,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (7.00 Pm),"One of the more memorable experiences I had as aThirty per cent of epilepsy cases have an identifiable cause ranging from head trauma, viral infection and substance abuse to brain tumours or stroke. But 70 per cent of epilepsy cases have no known cause. I imagine that when an epileptic situation occurs in a family, particularly a family which has not had any prior history of epilepsy, there must be a great lack of understanding and, I suppose, a failure of a willingness to accept the particular diagnosis. While the types of seizures experienced by sufferers vary quite dramatically, from simple moments of inattention lasting only seconds to complete loss of muscular control for several minutes, it is not difficult to understand that, regardless of the degree of severity of an epileptic seizure, one ought to sympathise with those who suffer from this disease given the obvious concern they must harbour as they go through their daily lives. As we all know, significant injuries can arise as a result of a seizure. They range from head injuries as a result of falls, through to those injuries from other accidents that occur as a result of a sudden epileptic seizure. For those diagnosed with epilepsy and their families, such a concern is never far away. The unease such people carry as a result of not knowing when or where an episode could occur is clearly a matter that must be a constant worry. It is also a real concern for sufferers that their seizure might impact on others, and it is true to say that those who have been unable to satisfactorily manage their condition have been forced to give up pursuits such as swimming or driving a car, which of course puts further demands on their loved ones. I suspect that those people who suffer from epilepsy, were a seizure to occur in the workplace, would be concerned about the impact on their job prospects. Even though the person concerned could well have the same capacity as anyone else to carry out a particular role, if there were a collapse at work, particularly a dramatic collapse, that would work to their disadvantage. It would seem that in such cases many sufferers would sustain a loss of job opportunity and prospects. They would certainly suffer a loss of promotion and in some cases a loss of job. It is, I understand, possible for anyone under certain circumstances to succumb to an epileptic seizure and it is only when someone suffers a series of those seizures that epilepsy is ultimately diagnosed. I could talk at length about epilepsy and go into many more details but regrettably time is short. I believe, while we have made enormous medical advances in so many areas and while, as a country, we have much to be proud of with our health system, that does not mean we ought to be complacent. There is a group of people who suffer from epilepsy in their families and who do warrant, in my view, additional research to make sure that we are able to get more positive outcomes to let those living with epilepsy have a very much higher quality of life. across the globe. It accounts for one per cent of the burden of disease worldwide. Nearly 80 per cent of the burden of epilepsy is in the developing world. More than 80 per cent of the people in some developing countries receive no treatment at all. Epilepsy is a very common but serious disorder of the brain. It is up there with depression, Alzheimer’s, dementia and other brain disorders in commonality. According to the World Health Organisation’s Global Campaign against Epilepsy report in 2005, it ranks with breast cancer in women and lung cancer in men in terms of commonality. This report makes it very clear that those people suffering from epilepsy are ‘forced into the shadows’. They suffer far MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Private Members Business
241,Mr Neumann (Blair) (7.05 Pm),"Epilepsy affects approximately 50 million peoplemore than seizures; they suffer from ‘fear, misunderstanding and the resulting social stigma and discrimination’. The seizures are unpredictable but still many people do not understand that the disorder is noncommunicable. In ancient times those suffering from this disorder were considered to be suffering from demonic influence or possession and treated as outcasts-lepers, indeed. Many myths and superstitions abounded. One wonders whether reports in the Bible were really of epileptic fits rather than the casting out of demons et cetera. Fortunately, we have moved on since then, but not far enough. In 1997 the Global Campaign against Epilepsy was launched by the World Health Organisation, in consultation with other bodies, ‘to improve acceptability, treatment, services and prevention of epilepsy worldwide’. In Australia, we need to acknowledge that one in 120 people suffer from epilepsy and that up to five per cent of people in our society may have a seizure at some time in their lives. Unfortunately, it is usually only when seizures are recurrent that diagnosis occurs. Often epileptic seizures are put down to febrile convulsions or some other cause. Many people outgrow epilepsy or go into long-term remission, suffering no further seizures. In other words, epilepsy is not always a lifetime condition. That is a fact not always understood. In my family we have had our own experience. In Maryborough on 26 December 1990, my eldest daughter, Alex, had seizures. After fitting for some time she lay motionless in my arms, lifeless, as I took her to the Maryborough Base Hospital. She was hospitalised for many days. My wife was pregnant with our second daughter. I did the night shifts and Carolyn, my wife, did the day shifts. Subsequently, Alex had further seizures in Ipswich, our home town, and was hospitalised yet again. I worked out then that medical diagnosis was problematic, confused and often difficult. Alex was put on Epilim and she was on it for a long time. Her prognosis was uncertain, and we lived with the memory and with fear and anxiety about what might happen in the future. Fortunately for Carolyn and me, Alex has become seizure free and she no longer requires medication. She is now a very happy, healthy and opinionated young woman of nearly 19 years of age. But the experience for me is seared into my brain and, as a parent, I will not forget it as long as I live. It is one of those memories I will take to my grave. I can barely imagine what life must be like for those parents and children who suffer and for sufferers generally. I only suffered it vicariously. We must help. We must do more. We must lift the veil of ignorance. We must fund more research. We must engage in education programs to improve community awareness. We must encourage philanthropic donations and support families and individuals better with confidence-building assistance and practical help. High-profile sufferers such as Wally Lewis, the Australian test rugby league great, have brought home the message that epilepsy can strike anyone. It is not just specialist surgical cases which must be the focus. We need programs in Australia to enable us to spend time getting people off medication and then reassessing them and remedicating them when necessary after a new diagnosis has been undertaken. They have these programs in western Europe but not here. I urge the federal government to heed the voice of the Joint Epilepsy Council of Australia in this regard. Community health centres are an ideal way to assist people. I think that the government’s super GP clinics can play a role in MAIN COMMITTEE promotion, education and medical service delivery and I call on the government to place a greater emphasis on dealing with this very important issue accordingly. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (7.10 pm)-I rise to speak on the motion moved by the member for Shortland. Approximately one in 120 people have epilepsy and approximately 17,000 people in Western Australia suffer from epilepsy. Anyone can be affected by seizures at any age but epilepsy is most frequently diagnosed in infancy, childhood, adolescence and old age. Epilepsy is more than three times as common as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and cerebral palsy. Epilepsy is a condition of the brain and is not a mental illness. It is commonly thought that epilepsy always involves convulsions or grand mal seizures. In fact, there are around 40 different types of seizures. Many people outgrow or have a long-term remission from seizures. Epilepsy is not necessarily a lifelong disorder, but it can have profound social, physical and psychological consequences. People who have epilepsy continually face social stigma and exclusion. A fundamental part of reducing the stigma is raising public and professional awareness. There is the Epilepsy Association of Western Australia, which has been in operation since 1963 and is run by a committee of volunteers. It aims to raise the profile of epilepsy in the community, act as an advocate for persons with epilepsy and their families, provide education to those living with epilepsy, provide education to the community, provide support services to those touched by epilepsy and improve the quality of life of persons with epilepsy to enable them to integrate successfully in the community and enjoy a full and productive lifestyle. The Epilepsy Association of Western Australia is able to provide support services to people living with epilepsy due to the generous continued support of many donors. Whether it is through donations, regular giving, support by the WA Lotteries Commission, people leaving a bequest in their will, workplace giving or marathon running, the public support assists the Epilepsy Association to continue to provide these much-needed services. Of course, the Epilepsy Association has had to be continually creative and innovative in thinking up ways to make it easy for the public to donate, and it has partnered with projects such as Everyday Hero and ‘action partner’ to make donating more convenient for loyal supporters to ensure continued health for people living with epilepsy and their families. Even though there have been significant dollars contributed to this in the past, there is always a need for more. In fact, the Australian government, through the National Health and Medical Research Council, provided $8.3 million in funding. Professor Peter Gage and his team from Canberra’s Australian National University received $400,000 to undertake research that aimed to better understand the function of anti-epileptic drugs, anaesthetics and tranquillisers, which act by modulating specific protein receptors in the brain. Building on his earlier research, Professor Gage’s project studied mutations in receptors found to be associated with some forms of epilepsy. Professor Gage and his team believe that, if the properties and actions of anaesthetics, tranquillisers and anti-epileptic drugs are better understood, it is possible that new, more selective drugs could be discovered. There is a strong need for these types of drugs, with the potential annual market estimated to be worth over $2.7 billion. This seriously equates to a genuine need in the community for all forms of resources to be devoted to this particular condition. Anybody who has lived with, worked with or been affected by those who have epilepsy could only support a greater level of MAIN COMMITTEE funding for all forms of research and for that which assists people to integrate with their local communities and families. tion brought to the House by the member for Shortland. The electorate of Shortland borders my electorate of Dobell, and I thank the member for Shortland for once again bringing a motion to the House that advocates fairness and justice. As the motion states, epilepsy is the most common serious brain disorder. Everyone in this room and everyone in this parliament will know someone who has suffered from epilepsy. Prior to the late 19th century, epilepsy was generally seen as a form of insanity or possession. It has always been a condition that has caused alarm to many people and it can still disturb people who witness convulsions. There are around 200,000 people diagnosed with epilepsy at any one time in Australia, with possibly another half a million family members involved in their care. There are somewhere between 360,000 and 540,000 Australians who will be diagnosed with epilepsy during their lifetimes, and over two million Australians will have a single non-epileptic seizure at some stage in their life. There are many burdens placed on the men and women of Australia who live with epilepsy. The Joint Epilepsy Council lists some of the problems as: a lack of acceptance by people in many sporting clubs and other significant social activities; reduced opportunities for education; difficulties gaining employment and sometimes in keeping it; a host of safety concerns, both in the home and in the community; having to learn how to deal with rejection by peer groups, exclusion, marginalisation and loneliness; living with the fear of never really knowing when the next seizure event will take place or how bad it will be; being unable to drive for mandatory periods of time unless you have fully controlled seizures; knowing that most people are afraid of seizures when they see them happening and are ill-prepared to deal with them. The new government, the Rudd government, has a vision for a more inclusive Australia. As ANZ’s Saul Eslake and the Business Council of Australia’s Michael Chaney have recently told us, reducing disadvantage is now both a moral and economic imperative for Australia. As people who suffer from epilepsy have reduced opportunities for education, difficulties in gaining employment and increased difficulty in retaining employment, it is essential that our government look to fund greater research into epilepsy. In my electorate of Dobell there are tens of thousands of men and women who drive to Sydney every day for employment. Epilepsy can stop someone from being able to drive, and thus some epilepsy sufferers on the Central Coast would be given an added burden of not being able to gain meaningful employment in Sydney, where many of the people who live in the electorate find employment. This is an opportunity for the government to bring in policies of compassion that will make our community and our economy stronger. The Joint Epilepsy Council of Australia, which is the Australian chapter of the International Bureau for Epilepsy, a key player in the World Health Organisation’s global campaign, has asked parliament to work with it to develop a national strategy for epilepsy. A national epilepsy working party should be established-and the member for Shortland has already spoken on that. It would include representation from the Joint Epilepsy Council of Australia, which could act as a key advisory body.

242,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (7.15 Pm),"I rise tonight to speak in support of the mopublic education program in tandem with an applied social research program to ensure the right messages are being targeted to the right people. Research reports that were sent to members of the last parliament by the Joint Epilepsy Council of Australia demonstrated how important it is to look beneath the surface when investigating issues like stigma, isolation, depression and any of the other burdens associated with epilepsy. Why does one football club allow a player with epilepsy to participate in the team when in another town a player with epilepsy may be left out of the team-and to all intents and purposes left out of the life of his peer group? Why do people who have seizures take the risks they do? Why do they keep standing up, going out in public, driving to the supermarket, taking part in sport, attempting to study and all the rest of it, when a seizure could put an end to what they are doing with unexpected and unpredicted ferocity? What are the relative risks for people living with epilepsy compared to those for people with other health conditions? Social inclusion is at the very heart of this government. The motion moved by the member for Shortland is congruent with the values and spirit of social inclusion. I commend this motion to the House. believe that greater research into epilepsy should be a priority for the federal government. I would like to commend the member for Shortland for bringing this motion into the House. As the motion states, at any given time there are 200,000 people living with epilepsy in Australia and up to three times that many will suffer from epilepsy at some stage in their lives. It is estimated that around 50 million people, or one in 120, have epilepsy at any given time around the world. It is the most common serious brain disorder and one that needs further research. Epilepsy is an illness which greatly affects the lives of those dealing with the disease and their friends and families. Epilepsy sufferers usually rely on regular medication to help control their illness. Other treatments include controlled diets, alternative therapies and, in some cases, surgery. These treatments are not only costly but can have a big impact on the lifestyles of epilepsy sufferers. Other lifestyle issues associated with epilepsy can include the loss of a driver’s licence, the effect that the disease can have on relationships and the effect that it can have on finding and maintaining a job. Dealing with epilepsy can also be that much harder for those living in rural areas such as my electorate. In country areas, it becomes much harder to access medical services. The lack of public transport makes it a lot more difficult for those epilepsy sufferers who can no longer drive. Also, a lack of support groups in rural areas can make it very much harder to cope. As an MP representing a large rural electorate, I support this motion, as it addresses some of the major issues faced by epilepsy sufferers within my electorate of Parkes. Epilepsy can be a very frightening disease and there are over 40 types of seizures. Some seizures can often hit without any warning. My first personal experience with epilepsy came as a schoolboy footballer. One of the players in my team had a seizure in the middle of a game. He was the biggest, strongest, toughest and meanest player we had, and the seizure rendered him completely defenceless. At that stage I realised how absolutely debilitating this disease could be. It also frightened me and, I suspect, my team mates as well, because we did not know what to do. We did not know how to help him. There was talk-‘Be careful that he doesn’t swallow his tongue,’ and other such things that I now believe may or may not happen. MAIN COMMITTEE",200,Private Members Business

From my personal experience, I fully support the motion that the Australian government establish a nationwide educational strategy. People need to understand what epilepsy is and how to deal with the situation if someone you know has a seizure. An educational campaign would also go a long way in addressing some of the social stigma attached to the disease.

It might make you empathise with the words of Martin Luther. ‘IfI was God, I’d kick this world to pieces,’ he said. Fortunately, God doesn’t do that. The purpose of this motion is to draw attention to the desperate situation in Sudan’s Darfur region and to consider what Australia can do to help alleviate the situation. More than four years of armed conflict involving rebel groups, armed militia and government forces has resulted in an estimated 200,000 civilian deaths. Millions have fled their destroyed villages, many of them fleeing across the border into neighbouring Chad. More than 240,000 refugees from Darfur are being cared for by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other agencies in camps along Sudan’s western border with Chad. The UNHCR is at present in the process of transferring another 13,000 refugees who crossed the border in recent weeks to escape an upsurge in fighting. These camps are located in arid and remote areas which the UNHCR says would normally support no more than 20,000 people.

The treacherous roads become inaccessible during the annual rainy season, which is rapidly approaching. If these natural hazards were not enough, armed rebel groups have taken to attacking the vehicles of the relief organisations. The UN’s World Food Program says that, as a result, it is transporting only half the food relief it normally would at this time of the year. Truck drivers are unwilling to risk making deliveries on the dangerous roads. Since the beginning of this year 45 trucks have been hijacked and 23 drivers are unaccounted for. This places greater reliance on the delivery of food aid by air. The World Food Program announced last week that this operation was also at risk because of lack of funds. Operations could not be guaranteed beyond the end of March. The operation has been temporarily reprieved by a contribution from Hollywood celebrities, led by actor George Clooney, but the World Food Program remains in urgent need of confirmed contributions from donor countries. It has become abundantly clear that the only way of addressing this humanitarian tragedy is by an end to the fighting, but there appears to be little prospect of this given the recent upsurge of rebel activity. The situation is complicated by the unrest in Chad, where armed rebels have also tried to overthrow the government. There are also tensions between the Sudanese and Chadian governments, which have each accused the other of allowing rebel bases on their territory. There was a glimmer of hope last week when the two governments signed a peace agreement, but this has been dismissed by rebel factions and there is now a real concern that fighting in Darfur has entered a new and more deadly phase. When African rebels launched their uprising against the Arab central government four years ago, there were two main rebel groups. The government responded by arming and supporting the Arab militia. Both the African rebel groups and the militia have since splintered and there are now as many as 16 competing factions involved in the violence. Agreement has been reached on the deployment of a combined United Nations African Union peacekeeping force of 26,000 in Darfur, but to date just over 9,000 have been deployed. In just over three months 800,000 members of the ethnic Tutsi community were slaughtered by rival Hutus. Already, 200,000 people have died in Darfur. We must act as part of the international community now to see that the bloodbath that was Rwanda is not repeated. raising this important issue of Darfur, about which I have spoken a number of times in the House. The murder of 200,000 African Muslims in Darfur, principally by their own government, is attested to by the United Nations and that is the central cause of the problem in that area. The Australian government voted in the Security Council on Resolution 1591 in March 2005. We voted to strengthen restrictions on the supply of arms and materials to Darfur in Resolution 1566, we demanded that the Sudanese government cease offensive military flights over Darfur and we imposed travel bans and asset freezes on individuals who impede the peace process. Australia also supported the United Nations Security Council’s adoption of Resolution 1593 of 2004, which referred crimes committed in Darfur to the International Criminal Court. One of the aspects of this conflict in Darfur that are most distressing is that these mass killings see the government in Khartoum continuing to prosecute this war against its own people. Sudan is principally an Islamic state. The people of Darfur in the west of Sudan are African Muslims and they have been killed in tens of thousands by the Janjaweed militia backed by MAIN COMMITTEE",202,Private Members Business
249,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (7.29 Pm),"I congratulate the member for McMillan ontheir own government in Khartoum. One of the people who was referred to the International Criminal Court, like the people in Serbia who undertook the terrible massacres in Kosovo, was a Janjaweed who has been appointed as the Minister for Humanitarian Affairs by Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir-Ahmad Muhammad Harun. When the government of Sudan acts with such insolence, when it fails to take into consideration the humanitarian requirements as outlined by the United Nations and when it consistently refuses to deploy or allow the deployment of the UNAMID force of 20,000-plus people in Darfur, it is clear that the government of Sudan is involved in activities that many in the international community regard as genocide. It is not just Mia Farrow, George Clooney and Kevin Rudd who have been over there to western Sudan to see what is happening in Darfur. It is clear to the international community that the Janjaweed militia are armed and financed by the government in Sudan and, whatever the proclivities of the rebel groups, the central problem is the intolerance of the government in Sudan for its own people. The world has to stand up and say, ‘Enough is enough.’ One Western country has to step up to the plate and provide the transport assets that will allow the United Nations force, UNAMID, to be deployed all over Darfur. I do not think the people in the Janjaweed militia will take on the principally African troops once they know that the UN can arrive in a village somewhere in Darfur within a few minutes by helicopter. This is one occasion, just as in Kosovo, where military action of a peacekeeping type can be the most important humanitarian assistance that we can give. The Australian governmentas was the previous government-are being generous in the amount of aid that we are giving Darfur. In fact, we even have a number of soldiers, 15 ADF people and 10 AFP people, with the UN mission in Sudan. But one Western country has to step up to the plate and help the United Nations deploy the well-intentioned UNAMID force in Darfur. We must call on the government in Khartoum to cease the persecution of its own people. Even as recently as a couple of weeks ago, 150 people were killed in a village and mass rapes were undertaken to ethnically breed out the African Muslim population. These kinds of events are disgraceful in a modern world. We should not tolerate them after what happened in Cambodia and Rwanda, in Ukraine in the eighties or under Nazism in the forties. I commend the member for McMillan for raising this crucial issue. The Western world, which has the resources to provide transport for the United Nations, in particular ought to step up and ensure that the United Nations has the wherewithal to do what is necessary to protect the people in Darfur. I conclude with a specific point: the Australian government should consider processing refugees in Cairo who are Darfurian refugees from Sudan. Currently the dan. We should go around that bureaucratic blockage and bring Darfurians to Australia after processing them ourselves. colleague the member for McMillan for bringing this motion to the House and for the opportunity to speak to it. His concern for humanitarian work, both domestically and internationally, is well known and respected in this place and beyond. In his opening remarks he gave some very sobering statistics on the impact of war, particularly on children, and it is indeed sobering to reflect on that. MAIN COMMITTEE",203,Private Members Business
250,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (7.34 Pm),"May I first take the opportunity to thank my goodIt is a matter of record that an immense tragedy has been unfolding in the Darfur region since 2003. As the member for Melbourne Ports has just indicated, this is a civil conflict, largely driven by a government against its own people. They put a British king, Charles I, to death for waging war on his own people. It is a pretty terrible situation when you have to kill thousands of your own to make some kind of political statement. This conflict has taken a terrible toll on human life and it has caused untold misery to thousands of citizens of Darfur. The conflict began in Sudan’s western region but has now spread to Chad and will undoubtedly lead to continuing conflict on a wider front. It has been estimated that between 200,000 and 400,000 people have died from war, malnutrition and disease. This makes the delivery of aid perhaps more crucial and critical than it otherwise would be. Three million people have been displaced and four million are now entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance. This conflict has been said to be the site of the world’s worse humanitarian disaster-and that is really saying something, because we have seen some appalling tragedies unfold, in this last decade in particular. Any escalation in the conflict will make it increasingly difficult to support the vast number of people so desperately needing humanitarian care. It will also increase the risk to those courageous and generous people endeavouring to deliver the aid. My colleague the member for McMillan has pointed out the incredible risk to the convoys of trucks taking aid into the region. There have been increasing attacks on humanitarian aid workers and there have been many abductions. This has understandably led to agencies winding down the delivery of humanitarian aid. Most of the 20,000 peacekeepers who form the United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur force have been pledged by African states. The United Nations has expressed concern at the lack of key military capability, particularly air assets, to deliver aid and medical supplies. If peace is to be restored in Darfur and if there is to be an easing of human suffering and misery, Darfur will need a much more rigorous peacekeeping operation than currently exists. It will require skilled, high-level intervention to negotiate a political settlement between the various militia groups that is lasting. We know that our Australian peacekeepers have the skills, and they have already made a significant contribution to resolving conflicts in many parts of the globe. We are proud of those efforts. While the Australian government has made a significant contribution of $20 million and limited personnel to the peacekeeping operation in Darfur, there has not been a commitment to provide the much-needed air support and additional personnel. Somebody once told me, ‘If it has got to be, it has got to be me.’ I think that if we want to see peace restored in the region-and it is in everyone’s interest that that happens-we need to consider providing more peacekeeping support. A recent report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute concluded that, while the Australian Defence Force is busy, it is not overstretched. Given the real risk of escalating violence, further destabilisation in the region and the level of human suffering, it would be a positive move for the Australian government to consider the request, for air support in particular. This would be a commitment that I am pretty sure that everyone here would welcome. today on your second maiden speech in the House, and I hope it is the last time we have to hear one of those!

251,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (7.38 Pm),"Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, I commend youfamine, disease, environmental crisis and war. As we have already heard in such graphic detail from the previous speakers, the country is experiencing rapid and unsustainable population growth, which is further straining already depleted resources. Along with the other reasons mentioned by the previous speakers, the effects of climate change and overpopulation have pushed the country to the brink and led to the conflict that has crippled Darfur. There is no doubt that the civil war has impacted on millions of lives. I have seen the results of this in the suburb where I live, where there is a significant refugee population from Sudan. Concentrated in the western region of Sudan, the war is predominantly an ethnic and tribal struggle for useful pastoral land and scarce natural resources-land and resources that are being impacted on by climate change. On one side you have the Sudanese military and a militia group known as the Janjaweed, which, I think, literally means ‘devils on horseback’. On the other side are rebel groups like the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. As a result of the civil war, many hundreds of thousands have been killed. Millions of families have been forced from their homes and scattered all over the world and all over Africa. It is one of those occasions in history where humanity must stand up for humanity. The plight of the people of Darfur is neither forgotten nor ignored by Australia. Australia has strongly supported the actions taken by the UN Security Council to address the conflict. Through resolution 1591, the Australian government helped to ensure that the UN Security Council strengthened binding restrictions on the supply of arms to Darfur, demanded the government of Sudan cease offensive military flights over Darfur and imposed travel bans and asset freezes on individuals who oppose peace. Australia continues to urge all parties to the conflict in Darfur to facilitate the deployment of the United Nations African Union Mission and work towards a comprehensive peace settlement. We are directing funds towards alleviating the humanitarian crisis. Australia has provided more than $71 million in humanitarian aid to Sudan since May 2004, including $57 million for Darfur and $13 million for southern Sudan. A further $11 million has been provided to help neighbouring countries deal with many of the spillover effects. I commend the initiative put forward by the member for Melbourne Ports to process visa applications outside the region. These financial contributions have funded water and sanitation projects, mine clearance and road maintenance, food aid, logistics and communications. Australia has also provided 15 Australian Defence Force personnel and 10 Federal Police. Australia has also opened its doors to more than 23,000 Sudanese refugees who have resettled in Australia since 2001. As I said, many hundreds of them now call the suburbs in my electorate of Moreton-such as Moorooka, Annerley, Yeronga and Salisbury-home. I have heard first hand from many residents in my electorate of the crisis that is facing humanity and the individual struggles to survive in Darfur. That is why I was particularly disgusted with the remarks of the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship late last year slandering these Sudanese refugees. He made an accusation that Sudanese people are not integrating into the Australian way of life. That is certainly not my experience in Moreton at all. These kinds of divisive statements are unhelpful. Instead, as the member for McMillan, who moved this motion, said, we should be directing our attention towards lasting peace and humanitarian aid in Sudan. MAIN COMMITTEE The biggest diaspora in my electorate is not the Sudanese community; it is actually the Chinese community. As China is a major trading partner with Sudan, we would all recognise that China must step up to its responsibility to aid the war-torn country. I have been informed that China is already engaged in some diplomatic efforts and providing aid to Darfur. The Chinese President met the Sudanese President twice in 2007 and appointed a special envoy to attempt to ameliorate the dreadful circumstances in Sudan. China has taken an active part but more can be done to help with practical humanitarian aid. All countries must step up to help relieve human suffering in the Darfur region. another saga in the African tragedy which, increasingly, the Australian community is becoming aware of. In my own electorate of Cook, recently an issue regarding the reuniting of a Sudanese family in the Sutherland shire attracted great local interest and a great deal of local sympathy. As these issues continue, I hope that the Australian community more generally will become more aware of what is taking place and what has been taking place on the African continent literally for centuries. There has been a 20-year civil war between the rebel Sudan People’s Liberation Army and the government-backed militia, the Janjaweed: the human cost of this is 200,000 dead at present-what many would describe as yet another genocide-and more than two million people displaced and who knows how many more raped, mutilated and brutalised. John Prendergast and Don Cheadle, in their book Not on our watch, summarised it well when they said: Sudan is where all the world’s worse atrocities come together like a perfect storm of horrors. War, slavery. Genocide-you name it. But particularly genocide. Beyond the Sudanese Government and other perpetrators of mass atrocities, however, the bad guys in this story are apathy, ignorance, indifference and inertia. This is another significant example of the humanitarian tragedy that is Africa. In 2001, the United States committee for refugees estimated there were 9.5 million refugees in Africa. More than a million people have been slaughtered in conflicts and civil wars. In Rwanda, we know there was a conflict between the rival ethnic groups the Tutsi and Hutus. Civil war culminated in April 1994 with the genocide of roughly 900,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus in just 100 days. More than two million Hutus fled to neighbouring countries to escape retribution. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as Zaire, since August 1998, there have been 3.3 million people killed-mostly women, children and the elderly. In Northern Uganda there was a 20-year civil war involving the Lords Republican Army and the government. There were 1.6 million Ugandans displaced and more than 30,000 children were forced into servitude as child soldiers, which was so effectively highlighted by Sir Bob Geldof. No less than 28 Sub-Saharan African states have been at war since 1980. The root causes of these problems are: political exclusion; dysfunctional governance; and greed, where there is a lack of preparedness to share national wealth. As Geldof also noted, it is in countries where the resources are greatest that often the conflicts and the human tragedy are most significant. Those with the most tend to have the most grief, and the scourge of corruption that feeds off this greed is equal. There is an impunity for unspeakable crimes, plus no accountability, no rule of law, no penalties, no sanction. And we must acknowledge that there is a legacy of MAIN COMMITTEE",205,Unhcr Does Not Permit People To Be Processed There Because Egypt Is Sympathetic To Su
252,Mr Morrison (Cook) (7.43 Pm),"Darfur in the Sudan is another African tragedy. It isEuropean colonisation and arbitrary nation states; however, we should stress that no way of drawing borders could ever justify people walking around with machetes and hacking off people’s limbs as some sort of colonial legacy. These are acts of evil and should be called as such. The motion that we are debating talks about what we should be doing here in Australia. I think it is important to note that the United Nations, in handling this issue, significantly dragged their feet in allowing the African Union to deal with the problem for so long and dawdled in making a decision to go in and ensure that there was a proper peacekeeping force in place. This delay cost literally hundreds of thousands of lives and should never have been able to take place. There is a strong view in the United States, from both sides of politics, that we dawdled in Darfur and, as a result, we encountered a tragedy that never had to be as great as it was. Australia has been doing its bit in relation to Darfur but can do a lot more. As we look at this issue as we go forward, yes, we need to increase aid to Africa. It accounts for 2.9 per cent of our global aid budget. This increase in aid should not be done at the expense of problems closer to home, but the government has indicated they are about to increase aid-so did the previous government indicate they were going to increase aid. So as we increase aid, Africa should be more in our minds, but the thing I would stress above all is the rule of law on issues, in particular relating to corruption and good governance. If we want to make poverty history in Africa then we first have to make corruption history in Africa. To that end, I commend the report From corruption to good governance, released today by the Uniting Church in Australia. Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (7.49 pm)-The situation in Darfur is and has been appalling since 2003, when the government of Sudan began its counterinsurgency campaign against the newly active rebel groups in Darfur. Hundreds of thousands have been killed, more than a million people have been displaced and the atrocities, the indiscriminate slaughter, the gruesome injuries and the sexual violence perpetrated, in many cases against women and children, are from the very deepest sump of human behaviour. Sadly, the Darfur peace agreement signed in May 2006 by the Sudanese government and one of the main rebel groups has long since broken down. The African Union Mission in Sudan, AMIS, which performed quite effectively in the early days of its operation, has proved unable to deal with the scale of the disaster and was supplanted late last year by the United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur, UNAMID, effectively a hybrid UN-AU force under UN control. This is a new development and it goes without saying that the success of the UNAU operation cannot be judged now. In fact, it is critical at this point that member states, including Australia, renew their financial and practical support for the UN efforts in Darfur. The UN Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Jean-Marie Guehenno, visited the new operation in January this year and reported to the UN Security Council on 8 February. He noted that the number of troops and police and their enabling capabilities currently in the mission area were simply not sufficient to provide protection for Darfur’s civilians in the current hostile environment. He also noted that continuing hostilities were evidence that parties to the conflict on all sides were simply not prepared to put aside violence in favour of dialogue. The tensions that work to resist a political process upon which a lasting ceasefire could be based are numerous, but they certainly include insufficient commitment by the Sudanese govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment to such a process and a similar lack of commitment by some rebel groups, in addition to the splintering of those groups into subgroups whose political objectives often present new obstacles or demands as conditions precedent to negotiation. While the focus in Darfur is understandably on bringing the armed groups to the table, it is important to remember that the armed groups themselves, whether it be the government and the Janjaweed militias on the one side or the rebel armies on the other, are not natural or complete representatives of the people in Sudan. For there to be effective peacekeeping there needs to be, firstly, a basis for that peace even if it is limited to a program of negotiations. Otherwise, in the absence of that political foundation for peace, or its imminent prospect, the only way to stop the violence in Darfur would be through the military imposition of that oxymoron, the ‘enforced peace’. History shows that an enforced peace is often just a pause in the carnage, especially when the enforcement is supplied from the outside. The situation in Darfur has been given many names. It is without doubt a humanitarian crisis or tragedy, as the member for McMillan has described it in his notice of motion. It has also been described variously as a civil war, a conflict between insurgents and counterinsurgents, a case of ethnic cleansing or even as genocide. These descriptions involve a degree of simplification. Several commentators have chosen to characterise Darfur as a conflict between Arab perpetrators and African victims, partly at least because this fits into a larger geopolitical template and its related agenda. The UN Security Council’s Commission of Inquiry on Darfur report, released in February 2005, declared that violence perpetrated by the Sudanese government against civilians, either directly or through the Janjaweed militias, amounted to crimes against humanity. But it also found that sections of the Sudan Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement were responsible for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law which may amount to war crimes. I do not make that point in order to move from a position in which Darfur is seen in the black-and-white terms of a perpetrator and a victim to a position in which Darfur is hopelessly complex and everyone or else no-one is to blame. I make the point in order to reiterate the essence of the problem: that without acknowledging that the violence in Darfur arises from underlying political and material conditions there can be no progress towards a stable peace. The issue that the member for McMillan puts quite plainly in his notice of motion is about what action should be taken by the Australian government. It needs to be recognised that Australia has been directly and significantly involved in supporting international efforts in Darfur. The Australian government has strongly supported the action taken by the UN Security Council and has fully implemented all operative sanctions into domestic law. Furthermore, the previous and current governments are to be commended for practical contributions which include more than $71 million in humanitarian aid to Sudan since 2004; approximately $11 million to cope with the spillover effects in neighbouring countries; contributions to the World Food Program that made Australia the fourth largest bilateral donor to the WFP’s emergency operation in Sudan in 2006; and the provision of 15 ADF personnel and 10 AFP personnel to the UN mission in Sudan. (Time expired) has expired. I thank all those members who made a contribution to it, and I thank the member for McMillan for moving the motion. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

253,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Sidebottom),"Order! The time allotted for this debateDisability Support and Care Debate resumed, on motion by Mrs Gash: That the House: (1) calls on the Australian Parliament to adopt a bipartisan approach to improving the provision and delivery of disability support and care to Australians living with severe and permanent disability, their families and/or their carers; (2) considers that for too long the ball of responsibility for the funding and delivery of disability support and care has been kicked between Federal and State governments and that game has to end; and (3) considers that the Federal Parliament must address the need for improved disability funding, support and services to see progress is continued beyond the individual terms of governments and is coordinated at such a level that inter-governmental disability service provision is clear, concise and indisputable. those living with severe and permanent disabilities and their families or carers is offensive and discriminatory. In a society as advanced as ours, as wealthy as ours and as mature as ours, it is a failure of morality that we are not doing more. This is a group that crosses every culture within our community but remains significantly marginalised from participating in community life. There is so much that needs to be done. It is bigger than one minister, bigger than one government and requires us to recognise the need for bipartisan support. I first spoke on this subject in 1999 when speaking to the Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill. I said at the time, and it still holds true: I cannot begin to imagine how difficult life as a parent could become while looking after the needs of three children with disabilities … There is no holiday pay, no sick pay, no workers compensation or superannuation. The job that carers take on is a lifetime one. The carers in this country, ranging from a young child looking after a parent to the elderly parents of a severely disabled adult child, are treated as second-class citizens. These are people who should, in no uncertain terms, be revered and recognised as our heroes, but we have let them down. We have been able to get away with it because they are all too tired and too busy to fight us. The huge surplus this government has been left provides an ideal opportunity for us to show we are bigger than the blame game. The Prime Minister has to be taken at his wordthat he and his government will put a stop to the blame game. We need to ensure that choice is the key. Just as the Prime Minister has identified with the Indigenous housing problems, there is no such thing as a ‘one size fits all solution’. For too long disability services have been chopped and changed depending on the minister in control. A joint policy commission to end the handballing of responsibility needs to be established as a matter of urgency. A joint commission must understand that organised advocacy groups are not the only voice for those living with disabilities. They are a voice, but to date they have often had too much say and control, with sometimes dire consequences for those affected but not consulted. This politicisation takes on a life of its own and eventually superimposes its needs over the primary goals of the group. The member for Maribyrnong, Bill Shorten, got it right when he said: MAIN COMMITTEE",209,Unhcr Does Not Permit People To Be Processed There Because Egypt Is Sympathetic To Su

255,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (7.55 Pm),"Let me make no bones about it: Australia’s treatment ofIn this great country, if I were another skin colour or if I were a woman and could not enter a shop, ride a bus, catch an aeroplane or get a job, there would be a hue and cry-and deservedly so-but if I am in a wheelchair or have a mental illness or an intellectual disability then somehow the same treatment is accepted. Why should I be told to be grateful to receive charity rather than equality? The Wikispace WhatCarersNeed is the perfect space for all carers to have their say and for governments to use as a resource. One contributor said: I am a mother, a nurse, a therapist, a playmate, a teacher, a friend, a babysitter, a cleaner, a nutritionist, a psychologist, a secretary and other things. The person I am caring for would prefer I was just a mum and that others would enter his world and share some of these roles. There really needs to be a shakeup, as there is too much bureaucracy-too much ticking and flicking and updating databases with our personal information and no hands-on support. We need help at home, we need somewhere safe to take our kids when it is just too difficult. We want some tax relief for the special equipment we have to purchase, and extra activities that gives our children more opportunity in life. Closer to home is the story of Gloria and Keith Masson and their daughter, Jenny. Mr and Mrs Masson have written to me imploring that something be done to help them because they were in desperate straits, highly stressed and with little prospect, if any, of finding respite. After detailing in their letter to me just their expenses for sending their 31-year-old daughter to a respite service in Canberra, they justifiably asked, ‘How can that be fair?’ It was a huge cost to them, $631 per night, which for a 10-day stay cost them $6,310. There are myriad stories out there, all pointing to the fact that not enough is being done. The Labor Party is in government at both state and federal levels, so what better opportunity to enter into a pact and to actually get something done? In the end, any initiative must endure beyond the term of any one government and must be coordinated in such a way as not to be compromised by multiple levels of bureaucracy. In this matter, it must be a one-stop shop and must take away unnecessary pressures from the very people it purports to assist. This has to be a bipartisan approach, above and beyond the temptation to score brownie points. We are a prosperous nation; we can afford to do this. We are also a nation with high ideals and morals; we must do this. We are also a highly compassionate nation; how can we not do this? I commend this motion to the government in the strongest possible terms. Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (7.59 pm)-I congratulate and thank the member for Gilmore for bringing this motion to the House. As she and other members know, this has been an area of enormous interest to me ever since I have been here, which is 11½ or 12 years. I have had many an opportunity to stand up in this place and speak about the needs of people with disability. In 2003-there may be more recent figures, but these are the most recent ones I have-the ABS estimated there were approximately 700,000 Australians under the age of 65 across Australia who were living with severe and profound disabilities. That included almost 250,000 children. During the Senate inquiry into the funding and operation of the CSTDA, which was completed last year, people with disabilities and their families and carers made a compelling case for disability reform. Amongst other things, they spoke-as did the member for Gilmore-of the blame game between governments. One of the witnesses to that inquiry could not have put it better when they said: The States say they are doing their bit, but the Commonwealth is falling short. The Commonwealth says just the opposite. Frankly, I don’t care about playing the ‘blame game’, I just want the system to work. MAIN COMMITTEE Nearly all witnesses told the inquiry that disability must be the responsibility of all levels of government working together. The job cannot be done by one government alone, nor by each government working in isolation. I am really pleased that we have a motion talking about a bipartisan approach and bipartisan support. I join with all of my colleagues on both sides of the House in supporting, together with the state and territory governments, the idea that we work to reform and improve the disability system in this country. On1 February Jenny Macklin, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, and Bill Shorten, the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services, met with state and territory disability ministers to progress negotiations on the fourth Commonwealth state/territory disability agreement. The meeting proved successful, with all representatives from each level of government agreeing to implement eight priorities and to the development of an overarching national disability strategy. It is an acknowledgement of the valuable work taking place across the jurisdictions that that sort of approach is there. But, as you have asked, Member for Gilmore, it is now about ending the blame game and working cooperatively together. I believe that we are on the right track to improving the lives of the over 3.9 million Australians-that is one in five of the population-with a disability, if we take the measure as a whole. The eight priorities that were listed through that meeting include disability reform relating to: better measurement of current and future needs for disability services; moving towards national population benchmarks for key disability service types; making older carers a priority for all disabilities services under the CSTDA; quality improvement systems based on the National Disability Services Standards for all CSTDA services; focusing-and I am so pleased about this-on early intervention, lifelong planning and increasing the independence and social participation of people with disabilities; workforce planning; and access to disability services by Indigenous Australians. I know that most of us in this House who have been here for a while have had the opportunity to work, through committees and in other ways, where disability is concerned and have had wonderful opportunities to see what we do really badly and to understand what needs to be done to improve the services across the board. We could all stand and cite example after example of individuals and communities-all sorts of people and all sorts of places around our society-where we see such a terrible distinction between how people with a disability or chronic illness are treated and how people without those circumstances are treated. I am just so pleased that we are now on a path, hopefully, that will take us right through to the fruition of lifelong planning. If a child with a disability comes along, why do they continue to fall off that pathway as they go through their lives? There needs to be seamless planning. There needs to be underpinning of resources. There needs to be a commitment-and we already have it, it seems to me-that across jurisdictions and across all different socioeconomic and other areas of the community we will see definite forward planning and services to improve the lives of people with disability, their families and their carers and allow them to participate in our communities and our society in a very full, wholesome and proper way. I do not think any of us could wish for anything better than that. motion to the House today and say that her advocacy for carers, the disabled, the aged and the chronically ill has been consistent, strident and heartfelt since she was first elected to this MAIN COMMITTEE",210,Unhcr Does Not Permit People To Be Processed There Because Egypt Is Sympathetic To Su
256,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (8.05),"I first thank the member for Gilmore for bringing this House. I also acknowledge the staunch advocacy that has come from the member for Canberra since her election. I am pleased to support this motion and have the chance to speak to it. How shameful it is that, despite being a wealthy nation and blessed beyond belief, we continue to treat those with a disability like second-class citizens. As a minister in the first Howard government with the responsibility for the disability sector, I have to say I was proud that for the first time a Prime Minister took serious notice of carers and, indeed, during that term of office funding for carers grew by 440 per cent. They had previously not been recognised at all. They had trouble, even as an advocacy group, making their voices heard in this place. I was also in awe and many times inspired by those with a disability, by their determination and their stoicism, and by the dedication of the few who devote themselves to caring for people with a disability. People with a disability come from all walks of life and, within our community, the range of disability varies both in type and in terms of the impact on people’s lives. As the member for Gilmore has said, the challenges for these people remain significant and it will take genuine bipartisan support for us to be able to meet those challenges in any meaningful way. Like my colleagues, I have encountered parents of children with profound disability whose lives are inexorably changed and who take on the caring role with love, with determination to minimise the impact on the quality of life of their children and with cheerful dispositions but, on a practical, day-to-day basis, carry on that caring role 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year. Over these past few days since the debacle over the threats to do away with the one-off payment for carers-which we are reassured will continue now-one mother wrote to me saying that she and her husband had spent three years trying to get an electric wheelchair for a severely disabled daughter and had to take desperate steps to get noticed before support was forthcoming. This really and truly is a shameful situation and again highlights-and it has been highlighted by the comments both my colleagues have made-the need for there to be greater coordination between the state, territory and Commonwealth governments and less ticking of boxes and more action on the ground. Ageing parents who continue to care for grown sons and daughters long after their physical, if not mental, health has been severely strained, live day to day with the stress of worrying about the future of their children after they, the ageing parents, pass away. One of the worse cases that I ever had to intervene in was an octogenarian whose adult son moved into the hospital with his mother when she fell ill. He was in his 50s. Sadly, when she passed away he continued to live in the hospital ward until I was contacted by a member of the community and, with the help of the local shire president, we made arrangements for his admittance into an aged-care facility. I must say it was long before he really needed that level of care, but that was the only place that could be found for him to go to-such a disgrace. As minister, I frequently met youngish couples who had both given up jobs in the paid workforce to take care of ageing parents so they did not have to be admitted into aged-care facilities. With much reduced incomes and increasing costs, they struggled to balance the budget. They had given up work in the paid workforce, which had implications beyond budgeting for the many additional costs and medications of caring for ageing parents; it meant sacrificing superannuation. MAIN COMMITTEE I fully concur with the sentiments expressed in this motion and I give the call for genuine bipartisan support for a comprehensive approach to meeting the needs of those with a disability and their carers. They have my full and totally unqualified support. campaign, I had 71 street-corner meetings and invariably at these meetings either people with disabilities or their carers would tell stories that would make your heart melt. There were stories from mothers with autistic children and parents with adult disabled children who were terribly worried about what would happen when they as carers passed away or were unable to care for their children. I visited many schools-such as Elizabeth Special School, which has far more demand than it has space for. This is obviously an issue which affects the whole community and it is bipartisan in nature because one cannot help but be moved by some of these experiences. My observations are that families are the greatest resource in this area, but they need services close to where they live. That is a big problem in Adelaide, where all the services tend to get put right in the middle of Adelaide rather than in the suburbs. Respite is a problem. I think that families often need to share their experiences with others in a similar situation. I think those networks are important. Schools, GPs and community groups do a good job, but I think that, in particular, awareness, empathy and understanding could be improved. The government has a big role in that. Many of the parents I talked to had to discuss things over and over again with GPs, schools or other institutions just to get their needs heard. There are some very interesting figures on this issue. In terms of education, 29.6 per cent of people with disabilities aged 15 to 64 who are living in households completed year 12 compared to 49 per cent of people without a disability. In terms of labour force participation, 53.2 per cent of people with a disability in the age group of 15 to 64 are in the labour force compared to some 80 per cent of people without a disability. So there are life-changing incidents caused by a disability and I think the government and the community need to continually look at what they are doing to improve that. As my colleague the member for Canberra said, there have been some meetings. Jenny Macklin met with her state counterparts on 1 February, and we have eight priorities. We also have a national disability strategy, which is basically the same as this motion in its policy effect. We will be working cooperatively with the states and territories to implement that strategy. It will canvass the full range of issues that impact on disability policy. It will set the direction for future disability legislation policy and standards. It provides the opportunity for innovative approaches, including support for social inclusion and participation. It provides an opportunity for people to work together across sectors and jurisdictions to ensure that there is coordinated and comprehensive policy planning, and the strategy will build on the good work of the disability policy reform that has been undertaken so far. I think that a national disability strategy will provide a foundation for leadership in this area and that will continue for more than one government term. Bipartisanship requires some responsibility to be taken on the part of all the parties, and I think that some of the opposition’s rhetoric about bonuses-and its seizing on media storieshas been both irresponsible and desperate. It has worried a great many of my constituents. I think that the Prime Minister’s commitments in these areas have been welcome news to those people, but they should never have been concerned in the first place.

257,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (8.09 Pm),"I am happy to support the motion. During theability sector, along with the member for Gilmore. I would like to bring to the House’s attention the almost 24,000 Australians who are in need of disability accommodation and respite services. This fact alone demonstrates the need for governments to substantially increase their funding. This must be a joint effort. In the electorate of Riverina is an industry group, Kurrajong Waratah, of which I am the patron. Kurrajong Waratah has a growing waiting list of parent-carers who are ageing and still looking after a son or daughter with a severe and permanent disability at home who needs accommodation support. There are over 40 families known to Kurrajong Waratah who are literally a heartbeat away from a care crisis. The oldest is a 92year-old mother still looking after her 65-year-old daughter at home. The carers are too busy with their care role to have the energy to advocate for their clients’ needs. Many have simply given up on Commonwealth and state governments ever helping them. Last year’s important bipartisan Senate report into the Commonwealth state/territory disability agreement made 29 recommendations. All of the recommendations are worthy of support. The primary recommendation of the report was that funding for disability services from both levels of government be substantially increased. Prime Minister Rudd has promised to end the blame game between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments, and I really do welcome that. There is no policy area more urgently in need of this commitment than disability services. The challenge for the new government is to turn its rhetoric into reality; older parent-carers have heard the talk before. I have advocated this in this House before, as a member of the former government. It is time for governments of all persuasions to stop using one of the most vulnerable groups in the Australian community for populist rhetoric, and to walk the walk and provide the hope and the security that these families need. They deserve greater certainty. To achieve that, governments need to commit to multiyear budgetary planning based on realistic estimates of the current and future need for services. Aged care has a planning ratio of around 113 places per 1,000 Australians aged 70 years and over. Unfortunately, in disability services there is no equivalent. There definitely should be. We know that only 50 in every 1,000 Australians with severe or profound disability receive any form of accommodation support funded through the CSTDA. The chronic lack of funding underpins the culture of crisis management that dominates the administration of disability services. Victoria’s Auditor-General has recently reported that the lack of planning in Victorian disability accommodation has created a ‘crisis driven system’. That criticism could be justly made of all disability accommodation systems around this country. No wonder that our ageing family-carers are very apprehensive about what the future holds for their sons and daughters who have disabilities. Kurrajong Waratah and the disability industry in general are facing an additional crisis that will affect both the quality and availability of care, particularly in regional and rural areas: labour shortages-a shortage of those who are willing to work in the disability sector. It is granted that there are workforce shortages-they are common in many industries-but the shortages in the disability sector are exacerbated by the low public recognition and low valuing of disability services as a career option; the lack of national workforce data to inform planning for disability services; and indexation of disability service grants at a level that does not keep pace with wage costs-and we all have that in all of our facilities in all of our electorates. Nationally, general wages in the year to March 2007 increased by 4.1 per cent, yet the MAIN COMMITTEE",214,Unhcr Does Not Permit People To Be Processed There Because Egypt Is Sympathetic To Su
258,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (8.14 Pm),"I have long been an advocate in this House for the disCommonwealth government indexed disability grants at only 1.8 per cent. The inadequacy of that indexation was highlighted in evidence provided to the Senate inquiry into the operation of the CSTDA. Whilst in July 2007 both state and federal disability ministers agreed to add workforce issues to their priorities for the next CSTDA, no nationally coordinated effort is yet evident. I thank the member for Gilmore for raising this issue in the House and giving me the opportunity to state the facts as to what the disability sector is experiencing in the electorate of Riverina and right across Australia. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (8.19 pm)-I thank the member for Gilmore for moving a motion calling for a bipartisan approach to improving the provision and delivery of services to Australians living with severe and permanent disability and their families and carers. This is exactly what is needed in so many areas and it has been for such a long time-a comprehensive look at the way state and federal governments work together to deliver services and a clear recognition that this most vulnerable group in our community is more in need of being put first, above politics, than perhaps any other group. I am pleased that the Rudd government moved very quickly on this. In fact, in the government’s first 100 days, the federal and state ministers for disabilities got together to progress negotiations on the fourth Commonwealth state/territory disability agreement and the development of an overarching national disability strategy. The national disability strategy will provide a foundation for national disability policy leadership which will continue beyond any individual government’s term. It is absolutely time to end the blame game and work cooperatively together for the benefit of the over 3.9 million Australians-that is, one in five Australians-who live with a disability. In my first weeks as the representative for Parramatta-about three and a bit years ago-I was well and truly put in my place by one of my constituents about my responsibilities when it came to federal-state relationships. Her name was Elizabeth-she knows her last name and so do I. She wrote to me about a state matter and I responded by saying that it was a state matter. She wrote back to me in the strongest terms pointing out that that was my problem-that politicians make choices about what is or is not in their area of responsibility and that I should not impose my choices on her. She said state-federal divisions were my problem, not hers. I have to say that she had a point. It is not a perfect point and it is not always a practical point but, when it comes to people living with disabilities, it is the only practical approach. Families of people with disabilities already live with extraordinary barriers due to their disabilities. The rules, the extraordinary routines of care, the unpredictable nature of their needs and difficulties travelling or even moving about are obstacles to overcome just in moving through a normal day. These people do not need additional bureaucratic obstacles or governments creating divisions of responsibility based on anything other than how best to make it possible for people with disabilities and their families who care for them to do the things they need to do just to get through the day, let alone flourish. There are many examples in my electorate of people trying to find services but being stuck in funding or service boxes that do not quite fit them or stuck between boxes and trying to find ways to live their lives within funding models that are rigid or inadequate for them. They are unclear of which level of government is responsible for what or, worse still, they do not know who is responsible. But they live somewhere in the gaps that are left after responsibilities have been allocated to one level of government or department. One of the most compelMAIN COMMITTEE ling of these is the families with children at Kingsdene School. It is a school with about 20 children. It is funded on a three-way agreement between the New South Wales Department of Ageing, Disability and Home Care, the then Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training, and Anglicare. Kingsdene is part of the lives of families with children with profound disabilities. Most of the students are non-verbal, and they cover the full range from preschool to age 17. They go to school to do things like learn to use a modified spoon or make friends without pulling their hair out. Kingsdene is unusual because it is a combined residential school facility, with the children staying overnight at the school during the week and going home on the weekends. While the state funding is recurrent, the school has had to apply to the federal government each year without really fitting within the funding guidelines. The strain of not knowing each year whether the school will be able to offer a place for their child has had families at breaking point. Kingsdene is an example of an extraordinary service for people living with a profound disability but, because it provides a different kind of service from most other schools, it does not fit neatly into the funding boxes. If Elizabeth who wrote to me about state-federal responsibilities is listening, she will write me a letter tomorrow saying that I am in the government and the funding categories are my problem and should not be the problem of the parents of Kingsdene-and she would of course, once again, be absolutely right. In government we have to have rules because we are responsible for taxpayers’ money. But it is worth reminding ourselves today and every day that, in a perfect world, services would be delivered as needed, particularly to those in most need. We are unlikely to reach the perfect world, but we can start towards it by removing the politics and the artificial divisions of responsibility that make life easy for governments and bureaucrats but harder for those who need help. We on this side have started it with the beginning of the development of the National Disability Strategy. We have a long way to go. I have met the parents of Kingsdene. They are good parents. I will no doubt face them again in a few months and they will want to know how we are going. (Time expired) am grateful to the member for Gilmore for raising this important matter before the House today. I am very pleased to note the warm response to and bipartisan support for this important motion. So urgent is the need in my electorate for supported accommodation that a group of parents concerned about the lack of services available in the Sutherland Shire formed a group called the Sutherland Shire Disability Accommodation Action Group back in 2005. One of the issues most raised on the occasion that the group was formed was the lack of supported accommodation for their adult children with intellectual disabilities. Sadly, we are now into the third month of 2008 and the issue still exists unresolved and untouched in the electorate of Hughes-and, I assume, in many other electorates across the nation. In December 2006, this group became an incorporated association, with Mrs Judy Foord appointed as president and Mrs Kate Tye as secretary. Both these women are mothers of children with intellectual disabilities. The association has three main objectives: to obtain supported accommodation for family members located in their own area, to obtain accommodation that offers tiered layers of continuous care and to create a register of need. Alarmingly, the Sutherland Shire Disability Accommodation Action Group found that there was no planning for future accommodation needs. The group then facilitated a public meeting on 6 FebruMAIN COMMITTEE",215,Unhcr Does Not Permit People To Be Processed There Because Egypt Is Sympathetic To Su
259,Mrs Vale (Hughes) (8.25 Pm),"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue and Iary 2007, which was attended by 95 parents and carers. The objectives of the group were published and a register of need was commenced, with 71 registrations received that day. Another 47 names have been added since, and there are more added on a weekly basis. Perhaps the most important way of explaining the situation of people who have a serious disability within their family is to tell a personal story. I would like to recount one from a lady known as A.M. She writes: WheneverI read about another mother killing her disabled child, I wonder whether it will come to that for me, and would I be able to do it? People do become desperate and overwhelmed. My disabled daughter ‘S’ has become my world and I, hers. And therein lies the problem. She was born in 1978-induced for the doctor’s convenience as he was going on holidays. She turned blue and stopped breathing. She had streptococcal pneumonia and was found to be 4-6 weeks premature. She spent a month in special care. From about six months of age I knew there was something wrong. Then followed years of doctors and therapies until I finally had to admit you can’t mend a broken brain. Eventually, she attended a special school. Transport was provided but I needed to be there before and after school so full-time work was out of the question. One problem with going to school out of the local area was that she had no friends to play with and so all her time was spent with me. Eventually I found a job with a small company run by a couple with children of their own. They were very flexible with hours and emergencies and phone calls. I brought ‘S’ to work with me on schools holidays. In 1996 my marriage, like so many others involving disabled children, had come to the point where I took ‘S’ and left. I had calculated all eventualities before taking such a big step-or so I thought ... I was working for the small company and ‘S’ was travelling by train to her day-program and managing alone with a few phone calls, until I got home. Six weeks later the small company collapsed. I quickly found a job with a big company-no flexibility, longer hours and NO phone calls. ‘S’ went on a 4-night ... camp for a break. When she returned, something was terribly wrong. She didn’t sleep, muttered all night to someone, cried all day, got lost following ‘voices’ and didn’t remember to eat or drink. Eventually she was diagnosed with schizophrenia brought on by her absolute terror in being apart from me. Even with hospitalisation and treatment the situation was horrendous. She was drugged, terrified, and either constantly crying or staring at the wall for hours. In the 30 minutes it took me to get to work each day there would be 10-12 phone message awaiting for me with her just crying. She could not travel alone or stay at home alone. Finally, the company gave up; I was fired, and thus became her carer. People sometimes think that carer equals no full time job, equals what a life. Well, imagine all you’d for very young children-dressing them, washing them, cleaning them after ‘accidents’ and then imagine doing it for a 28 year old woman, who won’t learn to do more than she does now. Imagine never being able to go anywhere alone-not even to see a friend for a chat or a cup of coffee without your ‘child’ with you. Imagine listening to her cry all night because you have a cough and she fears you might die and leave her. Imagine lying awake every night worrying about what WILL happen to her. We do have respite, but only one day a month. And now, four years ago, I was diagnosed as having Parkinson’s disease. My caring time is infinite. It will be the most difficult task to settle ‘S’ into a group home or similar accommodation. It must be done while I am here and able to help her cope. I commend this important motion to the House. rupted in accordance with standing order 41. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. MAIN COMMITTEE",217,Unhcr Does Not Permit People To Be Processed There Because Egypt Is Sympathetic To Su
260,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"Order! It being 8.30 pm, the debate is interQuestion proposed: That grievances be noted. Trade Practices: Franchises ment a situation regarding my constituents who had purchased Lenard’s chicken franchisesRochelle Bailey, a former franchisee of Lenard’s Mirrabooka, and Leanne McCullagh, who had the Lenard’s franchise in Livingston. This franchise issue is something that I wish to make sure this parliament understands will not go away, and I intend to take it up until we get some help in a number of areas. I take the opportunity to update the House on the circumstances of my constituents’ situation and the continued and long saga and sad, financially destroying issue that the parties are involved in. The stories of franchisees going broke and losing all their assets are becoming more frequent. In the case of Lenard’s, my constituents have lost their homes and all of their financial resources. As I advised the chamber last year, the problem is where unscrupulous franchisors are often deliberately taking the opportunity to send these people to the wall because there is far more profit in sending a business to the wall, reselling it and starting it up again. It is a quick turnover. In an ideal world legitimate franchisors operate by charging the franchisees a fee-let us say in the case of Lenard’s a fee of about $300,000. This is payable by all franchisees no matter how big or small the franchise is. These fees are invested in training, marketing and advertising-services that provide the franchisor with a profit to their core business. However, this is where the rub occurs. There are franchisors who take advantage of their franchisees. They recycle or churn their franchise, forcing people against the wall through a lack of business support. They provide little or inadequate advertising and poor management. They use physical and financial intimidation and serious bullying, as my constituents experienced first hand. By the time these franchisees seek help with what is going on, they are already nearly losing their homes and assets and cannot afford litigation, as has happened to my constituents. Churning, as it is called, has become a common word in the franchising industry. The practice is becoming more frequent with franchisors intentionally targeting a percentage of their franchisees for destruction, simply to make more money out of them. With the way the franchisors operate, the failure of the business is easy to pin on the franchisee, many of whom have left solid careers to operate their businesses. This is the easy way out: to blame the lack of business acumen of the franchisee. In many cases and in fact in most cases, it is wrong. Once the franchisees are in financial difficulty, the franchisor uses the contract default provisions that have been deliberately put into the agreement to get rid of these franchisees. They then acquire the franchise for resale at something like 20 times less the nominal fee-offered to the desperate franchisee to leave. Excuse my French, but it is often called P-off money. The fact that there are rogue franchisors operating is something that the ACCC chief has finally admitted to on Radio National. It is real, so Mr Samuel does understand that this is a real situation. This is something that the ACCC had turned a blind eye to for some time but in October last year they could not ignore it any more. My colleague, the member for Gilmore, Joanna Gash, has referred to this process as orchestrated robbery, and I hold to the attention of MAIN COMMITTEE",218,Unhcr Does Not Permit People To Be Processed There Because Egypt Is Sympathetic To Su
261,Mr Randall (Canning) (8.30 Pm),"Last year I brought to the attention of this parliathis House the case of her constituent, a Ms Deleeuw, who is continuing to go through a very expensive and financially ruining situation with Bakers Delight, another franchise organisation that has been named in this place previously. I am sure the member for Gilmore will see that one through as well. I am informed by the National Federation of Independent and Small Businesses that the profit margin of this unconscionable behaviour is many times that of the legitimate businesses and goes straight to profit before tax. The government takes 30 per cent of this in company tax and perhaps unwittingly becomes an accessory to white-collar crime. This is a serious issue in itself and I have raised this, as I have mentioned in the House before, with Mr Martin, the ACCC small business commissioner. I am seeking a meeting with him again to make sure that the ACCC uses its powers to do something about this issue before it goes any further. In fact, we know that some people have actually harmed themselves and, I am told, taken their lives because of the desperate situation they were in. SoI appeal to the ACCC to use their powers as they were intended. I do not intend to go into the intricacies of the Trade Practices Act or the Franchising Code of Conduct, which is codified in legislation; suffice it to say that section 51AC of the Trades Practices Act, relating to unconscionable conduct in relation to business transactions, codifies the law in this area. Most of the interested parties agree that the law is sufficient, as I have said. However, the big problem is enforcement by the ACCC, and I encourage them to use their powers. This was borne out in a letter to Mr Samuels from Mr Ray Borradale of Queensland, but I will not have time to go through that letter. In the case of Lenard’s, many will be aware of the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of the Lenard’s master franchisee in WA, Mr Frank Cianciosi. His business partner, Gerritt Heijne, has been charged with his murder, so I will not go any further into that because it is before the courts. I am not aware of all the facts of this case and I am not intending to dwell on the tragedy. However, I raise it in the context of what it now means in terms of seeking a resolution-that is, compensation-for my constituents, one of whom will shortly be made bankrupt as a result of this horrific franchise experience. Should my constituents wish to pursue their claims, it becomes unclear who or what entity they would claim against, given the fact that one is dead and one is in court. In any case, any compensation payable could be tied up in the estate of the deceased, and battles over the estates, as we know, can take many years. It would seem appropriate in the circumstances that Lenard’s executive management take some responsibility and at least recognise that their WA master franchisees played a significant role in the demise of the Lenard’s businesses of my constituents. My constituents should not have to wait any longer for compensation. Such actions by Lenard’s executives in Queensland would send a strong message that they do not condone the practices emerging from these franchising arrangements. My constituents have advised me that Lenard’s have told the WA franchisees that they now recognise that there were problems. I have also been informed that there are a number of outstanding debts owed by the master franchise company, which adds to the uncertainty as to my constituents receiving any compensation for their significant losses. I am pleased that the Western Australian government has launched an inquiry into the operations of franchises in that state. I know that my constituents have made submissions to that inquiry. The purpose of the inquiry is to enhance the franchising business environment and it MAIN COMMITTEE will examine the issues of fairness in franchising operations. I trust that some positive action will come from that local inquiry. John Farrell, the president of the NFIB, has worked tirelessly on these cases and continues to fight for stronger enforcement against rogue operators and better rights for franchisees. His assistance to people in the direst circumstances is greatly appreciated. Finally, since I first raised this issue in the parliament I have been approached by dozens of disgruntled franchisees and former franchisees throughout the country seeking my assistance. However, I have not gone on a national crusade on this issue, as I probably should, because it is so widespread. I have confined my efforts to those constituents in the electorate of Canning but I continually get representations from people who have suffered at the hands of Lenard’s, of Midas and of Bakers Delight on the same issues of churning. I ask the ACCC once again to use their powers to deal with these issues before they get out of hand. The people I have mentioned want some action. They have horrific stories. It is time that action were taken to redress this situation as it is becoming all too frequent. As I have said, there are already others that have been outlined to me, and I have received tin, from the ACCC, should he have the meeting with me that I have been seeking for some time. Families are going broke and losing their homes all because the big guys want to make more money using whatever means they can in this franchising malaise. Government Policies Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (8.40 pm)-The state of the economy has been the subject of much discussion of late, and we know that we are facing serious inflationary pressures which will definitely be putting and have put pressure on interest rates. In turn, the effect this will have on working families is of high concern to all of us. BeforeI go further into that, though, I would like to take the opportunity to reflect on some of the promises that federal Labor took to the election and Prime Minister Rudd’s and our absolute determination that we will deliver on all of our commitments. Amongst those commitments that we promised were-and this list is not exclusive, but it is a fairly long one: funding to address elective surgery waiting lists; increasing financial support to help older Australians and people affected by disability; increasing the childcare rebate to 50 per cent and paying it to parents quarterly; funding for investment in renewable energy and funding to assist businesses become cleaner and greener; funding for schools to invest in solar energy; funding for loans and rebates to assist families in making their homes more energy efficient; the provision of an improved broadband network to this nation-and I was pleased to speak on a bill earlier this evening on that issue; funding for new investigative mechanisms to look at the prices of petrol and groceries; $44 million for trades training centres in ACT schools; funding for a computer for every student in years 9 to 12; funding to ensure every eligible child has access to early childhood education; funding to increase efficiency and effectiveness in our hospitals; funding to re-establish the Commonwealth dental scheme; funding to build more homes for homeless people; funding for a national rental affordability scheme; investing in a housing affordability fund; initiatives to reform federal FOI laws, journalist privilege and whistleblower protection; initiatives to reduce red tape for small businesses and to strengthen the Trade Practices Act; initiatives to develop low-tax home saver accounts; and initiatives to cut government expenditure for MPs’ printing allowances, MAIN COMMITTEE",219,Grievance Debate
262,"Many Emails, Of Which I Now Have A Very Thick File. I Will Be Happy To Hand It Over To Mr Mar","cut ministerial staff numbers, abolish the Government Communications Unit, cut back on media monitoring and reduce the level of taxpayer funded government advertising. Those are just a few of the promises that federal Labor took to the election. These commitments are not divided into core and non-core commitments. They are in fact what we will be delivering on now that we are in government. It has only been four months, and already this government is delivering or beginning to deliver on the promises that we made. Some of the things that we have already done or begun include: ratifying the Kyoto protocol; offering an apology to the stolen generation; increasing the powers of the ACCC to investigate the price of petrol; the appointment of a petrol price commissioner; the introduction of legislation to prohibit Australian workplace agreements; the introduction of legislation to make the National Film and Sound Archive an independent statutory authority-and, I have to say, that is something very dear to the hearts of anybody in Canberra who has anything to do with the National Film and Sound Archive, and we are very pleased about it; negotiating the next Commonwealth state/territory disability agreement; beginning the process to implement the National Secondary School Computer Fund; investing significant funds in new health and medical research projects; working to establish the First Home Saver Account; delivering a $643 million cut in government expenditure through the first round of saving measures announced earlier this month; the introduction of legislation to establish Skills Australia, the Rudd Labor government’s first step in addressing the skills crisis; initiating a Productivity Commission investigation into paid maternity leave; establishing a formal ACCC inquiry into grocery prices; initiating a process to boost nursing numbers in our hospitals; and, more locally, the funding of $2.5 for elective surgery in the ACT. Delivery of all of the commitments that I have mentioned will benefit this great city of Canberra. The inflationary pressures this country faces are well documented. Many external commentators have expressed their concern at the current economic situation. The Reserve Bank has projected that inflation will likely run ahead of its tolerance margin for the near future, and Mr Chris Richardson, from Access Economics, in a recent interview on the 7.30 Report, stated that he believed interest rates will be high throughout 2008. There is a significant need to eliminate wasteful government spending and inefficiency. In an answer to a question without notice, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation said: The government inherited challenging economic circumstances: underlying inflation running at 3.6 per cent, five interest rate increases over the past 18 months-with another one well and truly in the pipeline-and government spending growing by 4½ per cent in real terms. We made no secret of the fact that this government, if elected, would be looking at ways to make very serious expenditure cuts. My particular favourite is the overwhelming overexpenditure of the previous government on itself. Well before the election, we announced that we would seek an efficiency dividend from government departments. That is underway. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation reiterated this commitment during the February sittings, saying in question time: The Rudd government is committed to cutting into government spending to get it back in line with appropriate fiscal settings to ensure that the budget is putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. That involves taking tough, challenging decisions. The reason that I went laboriously through those two lists was to make a point. The point is that we as an opposition going into government made commitments that we believed needed MAIN COMMITTEE to be made for the benefit of the community that we live in and the country generally. We cannot keep them without being tough and looking very hard at how to do it. There is no doubt that there are going to be some difficulties faced by some people in understanding how our priorities are different to those of the former government. Within the Public Service, for example, there are some programs that we have already announced we will close because we do not believe in them and we do not want them, and there will be other programs which we will start which will help to initiate the very programs that we have said we want to implement. So there is no doubt that there is going to be movement. There is going to be a little bit of angst out there, understandably so, about how it will all wash through and how we will implement these commitments. I am very pleased to be part of a government that is going to make these decisions for the benefit of the Australian community. There is no doubt about that. We have to make them to be able to initiate the plans that we have in mind. I am also very mindful of the fact that, in my electorate and in the ACT more widely, we have a high number of public servants. They are not all here, but we do have a number of them. I want to assure them that every effort is being made to ensure that there is a smooth transition-and there has been to date, I have to say-from the previous government’s programs to ours. I am really looking forward to seeing those programs that are still to come on begin. I listed the things that I did because I think it is worth reminding ourselves that we have a program of reform in many areas of government and we are determined to carry it out. I am looking forward to seeing those things happen and I am looking forward to continuing to work as hard as I possibly can to represent the concerns of my community through that process. I will be doing that with great gusto. Mind you, I think that the things that I have already mentioned have been very welcome in my community. WhereverI go out in the Canberra community, people are still very pleased that we now have a government with new energy, new initiatives and new programs that they are happy to see us implement, and I am looking forward to being part of that process as well. Liberal Party of Australia form program, member for Canberra! They want to drive up unemployment, interest rates, petrol prices and grocery prices-and that is happening now. Congratulations on your first 100 days. Grocery prices and petrol prices have spiralled up. The Prime Minister went to the electorate saying that he would do something about this and of course it has gone in the other direction. TonightI want to recognise 22 February as an important day to reflect on the contribution of the federal Liberal Party to the advancement of Australia. That date, as the member for Bowman knows, was the Friday when the parliament first sat and when it last sat. I was to give this speech on that particular Friday but, unfortunately, with all of the problems in the parliament, I was unable to give the speech. Twenty-two February was the day in 1950 that the Liberal Party of Australia, having won the December 1949 federal election, first took their places on the government benches in the Parliament of Australia. It was also the start of a long and distinguished period of political leadership, a day that laid the foundation for a collective period of over 40 years of Liberal leadership in government in Australia. In this light, it is important to reflect on the deeply held MAIN COMMITTEE",221,Grievance Debate
263,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (8.49 Pm),"Of course the Australian Labor Party have a great reprinciples and unfettered commitment to improving Australia that has underpinned the Liberal Party from 1944 to this day. Young, spirited idealists were drawn to the newly formed Liberal Party of 1944, unified in their desire to make Australia a better place. When in 1949 the Liberal Party took government, 38 new Liberals were elected. Their average age was 43, and 12 were under 40. Twelve had university qualifications and 29 were returned servicemen. First and foremost, the Liberal Party is a broad church. As Ian Hancock pointed out in his paper on the party’s early history: One article of faith drew all the early Liberals together. They believed that their party was national and not sectional, inclusive and not exclusive. It was a party for all Australians, irrespective of class, region or religion. And that is true today. The pejorative ‘born to rule’ tag that members of the Labor Party are quick to hang upon us could not be further from the truth. Just look down the list of hard working Liberal members of the parliament and you will find people from all walks of lifefrom the country, from our cities-men and women dedicated to the principles of liberty of the individual, opportunity for all, freedom of choice and reward for effort. Our members are locals in their community, unlike the Labor Party, which often parachutes in ring-ins with no local connections, in safe electorates. Women too have flocked to the Liberal Party since its formation in 1945. Liberal women can take great credit for breaking down many of the barriers to political equality in Australia. The first woman entered the Commonwealth parliament on 28 August 1943. She was Dame Enid Lyons, widow of former Prime Minister Joseph Lyons, representing the United Australia Party and later the Liberal Party. Dame Enid was elected to the House of Representatives and in the new Liberal Country Party ministry, under Menzies, she was appointed vice-president of the executive council. In 1947 federal Liberal Senator Annabelle Rankin became the highest placed woman in the parliament through her appointment as Opposition Whip. In 1951, following a change of government, Senator Rankin was elevated to Government Whip. She also broke new ground as the first woman to have responsibility for a Commonwealth portfolio when she was made Minister for Housing in 1966. Liberal Senator Margaret Guilfoyle entered cabinet as Minister for Education in 1975, and in 1976 she was made Minister for Social Security. Guilfoyle stayed in cabinet for over seven years. She was overtaken as the longest serving woman in cabinet by another Liberal, Senator Amanda Vanstone. The Liberal Party and its supporters have much to be proud of, and today we pay tribute to our founding fathers and hope to continue their fine traditions of leadership and representation. The coalition’s economic credentials are unchallenged. Over the last 11½ years the coalition has put the budget back in the black, eliminated Labor debt, started saving for the future, restored Australia’s AAA credit rating and delivered more jobs, lower inflation, lower interest rates, lower taxes, higher wages, more productive workplaces, higher pensions, better living standards, more funding for important priorities like health, education, defence, transport and environment, and more funds to state governments for them to provide services. However, tonight in the main chamber the Labor Party are undermining what we have done. They are stealing $2 billion worth of communications funds. Remember Whitlam in MAIN COMMITTEE 1972 to 1975? Remember when Whitlam stole the superannuation of our Defence Force members? It was a fully funded fund at that stage. To Labor members opposite it must be embarrassing to know that your party stole the funds of our Defence Force members meant to pay for their superannuation and has never returned them. Now tonight the Labor Party government are trying to steal the Communications Fund-$2 billion worth of money-by taking money out of rural and regional Australia to put into metropolitan Australia, when the current providers of infrastructure in telecommunications would have funded it anyway. We have a proud record on financial management. We did inherit a $10 billion deficit. Remember back in 1995-96 Keating saying that we were not in deficit but were in surplus? Of course we were in deficit. We inherited $96 billion in debt, which we completely eliminated. We inherited levels of government spending equal to 25 per cent of GDP. We inherited a ballooning unfunded superannuation liability. We introduced accrual accounting to provide details of the full cost of service delivery. For the first time, we published a balance sheet for the general government sector and for the whole of the public sector. We introduced for the first time consolidated whole-of-government financial reports audited by the Auditor-General. We introduced the outputs-outcomes framework to place the focus on what was actually being delivered for the money spent. We increased the efficiency dividend on government departments to ensure money was being spent on services at the sharp end rather than on administration. We completely reformed property management and procurement practices to ensure best value for taxpayers’ money. We instituted the Uhrig review of governance in the public sector. A strong economy is not something that happens by chance. Managing Australia’s $1.1 trillion economy requires discipline, focus and experience. It requires an ability to put aside short-term politics and media spin and take hard decisions in the national interest. The coalition took those difficult but necessary decisions. We established the Future Fund. We reformed the tax system, which, by the way, was opposed by the Labor Party. We gave further encouragement to enterprise initiatives and savings. We created a simple and more flexible workplace relations system. We reformed the waterfront. Remember the Labor Party opposing the waterfront reforms? Mrs Irwin interjectingwaterfront. The employees on the waterfront actually ended up with better conditions, and Australia ended up with a better waterfront. We invested in key infrastructure, including AusLink. We promoted competition in airlines, energy and telecommunications. We boosted the worth ethic in Work for the Dole and Welfare to Work reforms. We pursued free trade agreements to help boost exports. We took a more strategic approach to immigration, with a greater emphasis on skills. We boosted apprenticeships and restored the status of technical education-but now you want to close the Australian technical college in Townsville, the best performing technical college in the nation. That is extraordinary. To reach our potential as a country, we solved problems that arose so as to ensure that the next generation would have the opportunity they deserve. So the anniversary on 22 February of the Liberal Party should not go unmarked. (Time expired) Workplace Relations get over the fact that those opposite lost the election.

On both occasions the central issuecies which stripped away the fair and reasonable guarantees of the Australian industrial relations system. Mr Lindsay interjectinglence. on this issue. Clearly the second of those, John Howard, did not learn from history and suffered the fate of all those who do not learn from history or, as in his case, rely on their own false version of history. What John Howard-and I might include all members opposite who were part of his government-failed to understand was that fairness in the workplace is one of the most fundamental of all Australian values. Here was a government that spoke often about Australian values. We had an education minister, who is now the Leader of the Opposition, who would have had his version of Australian values inscribed above the chalkboard of every Australian classroom. And we had an immigration minister who devised a test of Australian values to be passed before you could become an Australian citizen. But nowhere on that list and nowhere in that test was included the fundamental Australian value of fairness in the workplace. Is it any wonder that the member for North Sydney made the shocking confession on Four Corners that some cabinet ministers did not realise that Work Choices stripped away conditions from working people? That just about sums up the value system of those in the Liberal and National parties. When it comes to any understanding of Australian values, they have not got a clue. The former government thought they knew it all. They thought workers across Australia were too stupid to realise that they were being ripped off. They thought that, if they spent hundreds of millions of dollars advertising the benefits of Work Choices, they could sell Work Choices to the Australian people. When the trade union movement in this country embarked on a sophisticated campaign to tell the truth about Work Choices, the former government spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising campaigns of its own. In the end it was money down the drain. It could not save the Howard government and it could not save Work Choices. They tried to change the name. They tried a mickey mouse fairness test. But in the end the good ship Work Choices went down and-absolutely fantastic-the skipper went down with it. The union movement’s television campaign drove home the issue to working families and forced the government onto the back foot. We all saw the wasted efforts of the former government’s $100 million advertising campaign. They even trotted out Barbara Bennett, the public servant responsible for the program. But like all ‘I’m from the government; I’m here to help you’ campaigns it was doomed to fail. MAIN COMMITTEE",225,Grievance Debate

269,Mrs Irwin,"How easily they forget. It is no coincidence that both prime ministers fellOf course, the employers threw in their lot with the government as well. The result is history and so are the careers of so many members of the former government, including the former member for Deakin-the former government’s backbench cheerleader for Work Choices-who raised the issue of Work Choices more than 100 times in this House. We now have a different member for Deakin, an excellent member for Deakin, and he sits on the Labor side of the House. Still the members of the former government do not know where they stand on workplace relations. They have learned nothing in the past three years and they show no sign of learning anything in the next three years either. They thought they knew it all. They thought they could give us an American-style industrial relations system which would hold down wages, as has been happening in the United States. They thought they could knock over the trade union movement in this country and the Labor Party would be the next domino to fall. Well, they lost and they lost very badly. What they must now realise is that it would be a very brave conservative government that would try to break the Australian model of workplace relations fairness. There was a gap of 80 years between Stanley Melbourne Bruce and John Winston Howard. Perhaps it will be 80 years before another conservative leader tries to do it again. But whenever it is tried it will fail again and again. I would like to place on record my congratulations and thanks to the trade union movement-a movement that I have been a member of since the age of 16-for their efforts in the campaign. One thing was obvious from the time the Howard government introduced its Work Choices legislation: it was aimed at killing off the trade union movement in this country. The whole of the labour movement knew that we had our backs to the wall and that, unless Labor was successful in the 2007 election, the unfair workplace laws would become entrenched in this country and trade unions would find it harder to organise and campaign on behalf of working families. The future of the labour movement was at stake. This factor united the labour movement as never before. It was great to see unions with different factional leadership pitching in to work for the election of Labor candidates. But behind the campaigns was a determined leadership and a conviction to overturn the Howard government’s unfair workplace laws. As I said, the campaign was sophisticated and, I am sure, took many government ministers by surprise. In New South Wales, the Your Rights at Work campaign was possibly the largest and most effective political campaign ever devised. If the government thought that the unions would rely on industrial action in their campaign, they were wrong. Instead of giving up wages in industrial action, union members contributed to the cost of the media, an on-the-ground campaign that made workplace relations the focus of the election in many marginal seats. I might mention just one person in particular who played a key role in the campaign: a dedicated and talented young woman, Emma Brindley, who worked for the Unions New South Wales Your Rights at Work campaign. Emma devised the merchandising and other on the-ground strategies for the campaign and travelled from one end of the state to the other, rallying local union members and presenting the union case to the voting public, especially the young public. With other union members, Emma did a great job. They all deserve the wholehearted thanks of Labor members for their efforts. What we are seeing is a new strategy being employed on behalf of working people. Judging by its recent successes in both the New MAIN COMMITTEE South Wales and federal elections, we can expect to see many more campaigns just like Your Rights at Work. What members opposite failed to understand throughout the whole sorry history of Work Choices was that sooner or later workers would realise that they were much worse off under arrangements that cashed out entitlements. Usually that realisation came at the end of the financial year, when they found that their annual income had fallen or had not increased, even though they were working more hours. When it came to increased flexibility, which was supposed to be one of the great advantages of Work Choices, workers soon found that the only flexibility was in the hands of the employer. Rather than it being the favoured system for high-paid jobs in the mining industry, the greatest increase in the number of AWAs was in the hospitality and retail industries. In those industries, flexibility was almost always to the benefit of the employer alone. There never was any flexibility, there never was any negotiation and there certainly never was any fairness. That is the system that this Labor government is tossing into the rubbish bin, where it definitely belongs. In its place will come a new system, one which has input from all sides of workplace relations, not like Work Choices, which was drafted by employers’ legal representatives and passed into law without any input from workers’ representatives. The new system will be put together by a government that definitely understands the great Australian value of fairness in the workplace. Greenway Electorate: Education Funding commitment by the Rudd Labor government to ensure that local schools in the electorate of Greenway have access to funding assistance for basic school infrastructure. We have now learnt the Rudd Labor government has no intention of continuing a very successful infrastructure assistance program known as the Investing in Our Schools Program. The government has misled the House with the claim that the coalition had not committed to continuing the Investing in Our Schools Program. I would suggest those in the government, including Senator Carr, look beyond a press release from 19 February 2007 by the then Prime Minister when trying to accuse the coalition of scrapping the Investing in Our Schools Program. I would suggest they refer to a more recent release, on 28 August 2007, which was located on the DEST website, where the then Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Julie Bishop, said that there was ‘continued support for the Investing in Our Schools Program’ from the then government. The decisions on education funding and policy are now with a Labor government. The question is now about the future. The Investing in Our Schools Program was very successful. Schools in my electorate, as in every other electorate in this country, appreciated the opportunity to set their own priorities for their school communities. The challenge for many school communities across Australia was lack of state government investment in repairs, maintenance and equipment. Whether it was for a new school without library books, a well established school with toilet blocks at Third World standard, shade structures for outdoor activities or musical instruments, the Investing in Our Schools Program enabled school P&Cs, together with principals, to identify the needs of their school and their children. Schools applied for funding based on what they needed and in the majority of cases received the money that they required. MAIN COMMITTEE",226,Grievance Debate
270,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (9.08 Pm),"I wish to raise my concerns over the lack ofWhen the Prime Minister asked all his MPs to visit local schools, surely those MPs would have reported back that schools wanted this funding to continue. I put this question to every MP in this House: is there any member who could honestly say that if they had a choice between putting computers in secondary schools only or providing funding to all schools for what those schools identified that they needed, the choice would be the computers-only option? I think not. This is going to disadvantage school communities. On 20 February, in an article in the Daily Telegraph, Bruce McDougall said: Angry ... principals are seeking an urgent meeting with new Federal Education Minister Julia Gillard at which they are expected to voice a strong complaint about the decisionto cancel or not continue with such funding. On 20 February this year during question time the Prime Minister said, ‘This government believes in investing in our schools.’ I believe this statement too could be regarded as misleading. While most members in this House would support computers being supplied to secondary schools, what about our primary school students? There are some significant flaws in Labor’s plan. Across Western Sydney, I have come across incidences of the electricity supply not being sufficient at the local school level to cope with additional equipment such as air conditioning and computers. In this instance, what if the electricity supply is insufficient to cope? What if the rooms where the computers will be held are in such a poor state that safety will be at risk? On 29 April 2007 at the ALP national conference Stephen Smith said: We’ve made it clear that we are not interested in taking one dollar off any school. We want to invest more in all our schools, but have that investment made on the basis of need and on the basis of fairness. So let us begin with ‘we want to invest more in all our schools’. That is a little hypocritical when you consider that primary schools are excluded from the digital revolution. Does the Rudd Labor government consider that children aged between five and 12 do not need or use computers? Secondly, let us talk about investments being ‘made on the basis of need’. The dictionary defines need as being ‘a lack of something useful, desired or required’. So if we have a school that does not need more computers but desperately needs to replace worn and mouldy carpet, does that mean that the school will get the carpet rather than the computers because investments are being made on the basis of need? That seems appropriate. This is what the Investing in Our Schools Program did. The President of the Australian Council of State Schools Organisations has stated that the Investing in Our Schools Program was their ‘No. 1 priority’, and country schools talked about the extra challenge now being placed on rural communities already affected by drought to raise funds for basic school equipment-equipment and projects they could fund through the Investing in Our Schools Program. The Deputy Prime Minister, when talking about investment in schools, only referred to the digital revolution and trade centres, which have absolutely nothing to do with primary schools. It appears that the government does not care about primary school age children. Primary schools in my electorate such as Windsor Park Public, Vineyard Public and Quakers Hill Public will all have a choice: raise the funds themselves or join an exhaustive list of government run schools in New South Wales waiting for the Iemma Labor government to support their requests. I suspect the wait will be long. Last year, the coalition government increased funding to schools by over 11 per cent, but the state and territory governments only increased funding by an average of 4.9 per cent. While the state and territory governments MAIN COMMITTEE continue to short-change their own schools, school communities such as those in my electorate may be waiting a very long time. During Senate question time, Senator Carr was asked whether the Labor government intends to scrap the Investing in Our Schools Program, to which he replied: The Rudd Labor government is committed to a more targeted approach to infrastructure funding through the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program and the Digital Education Revolution. Again, this is based in secondary schools-which no-one would deny would be a good ideawith no benefit whatsoever to primary schools. I call on the Prime Minister to be fair dinkum as he travels around this great nation of ours listening to the people, to stop what he calls the blame game, to accept instead that the coalition government introduced a program that benefits all schools across this nation and to reintroduce Investing in Our Schools so that schools such as those in my electorate can move forward rather than lie idle waiting for state Labor governments to do something. Australian Defence Force: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Ms KING (Ballarat) (9.16 pm)-TodayI wish to grieve for the men and women who have served in defence of this country and are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or other mental health conditions. In particular, I wish to grieve for the loss of Geffrey Phillip Gregg, a young man we lost too soon and of whom I and the previous member for Cowan and Vietnam veteran Graham Edwards have spoken in this place before. The case of Geff Gregg first came to my attention some 12 months ago, when I received an email from Geff’s sister Bec asking for assistance for her parents, Chris and Phil, in the struggle that they were having in getting an investigation launched to find out just what happened to their son through his time in the ADF and his interactions with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. When their son was 19, Chris and Phil entrusted him to the Australian Defence Force. He enlisted in the Army and, like many young men who have enlisted, had a dream of becoming one of our elite soldiers. He was described as confident and fit, an outgoing young man and perhaps a little overconfident and sure of himself-but what young man at the age of 19 is not? His family were enormously proud of him as he made his way through his basic training. He eventually became attached to 152 Signals, the signalling corps for the SAS. By the age of 25, Geff was dead, having taken his own life. He had been discharged from the Army suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. Here started a litany of attempts by Chris Gregg in particular to recover any information that would shed light on how the son who they so willingly entrusted to the Army had come to end his own life. Geff’s mother in particular was hitting brick wall after brick wall as she attempted, on her own, to make her way through the maze of ADF and DVA sections in pursuit of medical and other reports that might help them understand what went wrong and why they were not informed as to just how unwell their son actually was. At the instigation of the family, I wrote to the then Minister for Defence, asking for an investigation into the circumstances of Geff’s death. This letter was then referred to the then Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. Very little happened. There were a couple of media stories by a few journalists who had taken a specific interest in post-traumatic stress disorder amongst service personnel, but no formal response came from the minister. The family then took the trip here, to Canberra, during Senate estimates hearings to see whether any answers would be forthcoming in a far more public forum. The family met with the then minister and, despite MAIN COMMITTEE assurances that lessons were being learnt, very little appeared to have been done by way of progressing any formal independent inquiry. It took some courage for the Gregg family to come to Canberra, but their persistence eventually paid off. At their instigation, three separate inquiries commenced last year. General Leahy, who I commend for acting so quickly once he became aware of the circumstances of this case, referred the matter to the Inspector-General of the ADF. This sparked the then Minister for Veterans’ Affairs to agree to have an inquiry into Geff’s interactions with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and other government departments. What happened to Geff, the way in which his enlistment progressed through the ADF, his deployment to Afghanistan, his and his patrol’s now reported engagement through the Redback Kilo Three patrol, his subsequent decline in mental health, his litany of medical appointments and struggle to be treated, his interactions with DVA and military compensation have all been the subject of these investigations. Reports have now been prepared, and the family is in the process of receiving a briefing on them. The contents are of course confidential, but it is my hope that at some point some of the contents of these reports will be made public, as there are many things that the ADF, DVA, military super and the wider community can learn about what we owe to these service personnel and how we need to better treat and support those suffering post-traumatic stress disorder and also their families. I commend the new Minister for Defence Science and Personnel’s announcement that there is to be a review of mental health services in the ADF. It is long overdue, and I hope that Geff’s case informs the review. I want to pay tribute to the strength of the Gregg family. They have been severely traumatised by the death of their son, brother and brother-in-law. They have my utmost admiration for their determination to try and find out where the system failed them and their son, and to make sure lessons are learned and that no other mother’s son or daughter suffers this experience. The case has been somewhat complicated by a dispute between the family and Geff’s former girlfriend over her status. Having spent a great deal of time with this family and been part of their lives as they go through the terrible pain of losing their son, I have no doubt that they are firmly of the belief that the relationship between their son and his former partner was over at the time of Geff’s death. These sorts of disputes are never easy, but I ask particularly those veterans who are supporting Geff’s former partner and to some extent see this case as a way of seeking change, as we all do, to respect that every time a story about Geff and his family appears which they have no knowledge about or in which their status in his life is unacknowledged, it is a fresh wound to them. For his father and for his mother-who bore him-who watched him grow; for the sister who loved him like a twin; for his other family members to whom he forever remains a hero, I ask that you respect that this family has been and continues to be torn apart by this experience. The Gregg family loved their son. When they first came to see me, they attached to the file of papers that they brought with them this photo of Geff that I am holding. They said, ‘We want you to see our boy as we saw him to know that it is a real person that this happened to to know who it is you are fighting for.’ I never met Geff. He was gone just under six months when I started on this case, but I see him in the faces of all our armed service personnel when they return from deployment and are MAIN COMMITTEE embraced by their families. Geff Gregg could be any one of them, and that is why we must as a parliament grieve for Geff not only for his own and his family’s sake but so that we in this place absolutely do all in our power to make sure that the mental health services and the follow-up that we provide for our veterans and their families is second to none. expired.
