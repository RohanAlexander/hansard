That Australia has the capacity to play a more significant part in enabling the developing countries to achieve improved social conditions for all their people. Your petitioners most humbly pray that . . . Australia's Official Development Assistance in 1972-73 be increased to at least $240 million. Australia's aid policies be reviewed so that aid Governments for education services and (ii) carry given provides maximum benefit to the peoples of developing countries.

Education To the Honourable the Speaker and Members cf the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully sheweth: (a) that the Australian Education Council's Report on the Survey into Educational Needs has established serious deficiencies in the State's education services. (b) That these ean be summarised as a lack of suitable classroom accommodation, teacher shortage, oversized classes, inadequate equipment and facilities. (c) That the additional sum of one thousand four hundred and forty three million dollars is required over the next five years by the States for these needs. (d) That without massive additional Federal finance the State School system will face disintegration and with it the Nation. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will lake immediate sleps to ensure that finance from the Commonwealth will be given to the States for their public education services which provide schooling for seventy-eight per cent of Australia's children. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Beazley, Mr Bennett and Mr Berinson. Petitions received. Education: National Survey To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned electors in the State of New South Wales respectfully sheweth: 1. The nation-wide Survey of Educational Needs undertaken by the Australian Education Council has provided clear evidence that government education in the various States is failing children on a massive scale. 2. The following conditions at the Strathfield South State School give further evidence of the needs in the State education system: Internal and external painting of all woodwork. Lighting in school to be brought up to modern standards. Consolidation of buildings to include additional stairway, increased storage, sick room and staff amenities. Your petitioners therefore respectfully pray that your Honourable House will (i) make immediately a substantial Federai emergency grant to all State out a public national survey to determine needs of the States after 1975. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. Petition received.

3,By Mr Mcmahon.,"levels of Government responsible in Australia will take note of the wishes of we, the citizens, in so far as we request: That the Commonwealth Government give urgent consideration to granting taxation concessions to those mothers who are forced to pay fees to have their children retained in Day Care and Family Care Centres. That these mothers and children are being disadvantaged by the economic circumstances where no concession is made for the changes which must be paid to have their children so looked after. In fact it means that a single parent is working for a subsistence wage and receiving a lower income that many who are living on Social Service at a cost to the community. That these mothers' efforts to maintain themselves and their families should be rewarded by taxation concessions for fees paid in recognition to their initiative and diligence by not placing their burden upon the community and so allow them to retain their dignity and standing in the community. Tbat single and married mothers are contributing to the community by the establishment of their home, the cost of which has become affected by inflation and so must continue to work to make the future for the children who are so cared for. Therefore we ask that all these aspects be taken into urgent consideration and that taxation concesTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of sions for all child minding fees be granted to ease the House of Representatives of the Commonthe burden. We, the petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled would take immediate steps to ensure provision of this taxation concession and your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Bennett. Petition received. Australian Aircraft Industry To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned employees of the Australian Aircraft Industry in New South Wales and citizens of AustraUa respectfully showeth. That the government's policy of producing components in Australia for Aircraft purchased overseas for our Civil and Defence requirements, does not fulfill the needs of industry to ensure: (a) Full employment (b) The necessity to keep abreast of technological advancement and the appUcation of the latest techniques of Aeronautical Engineering. That the purchasing of aircraft from overseas does not entirely meet the AustraUan requireyour Honourable House will at once, in the public ments and conditions, but have to be accepted due interest, take steps to dedicate as a National Park to the lack of a long range plan for defence an area of at least 1,436 square miles as recomrequirements and associated specifications necesmended by the Northern Territory Reserves Board. sary for the Australian Industry to produce airAnd your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever craft to meet these requirements. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the by Mr Bryant. Federal Government in order to provide employment for the technical, design and manufacturing teams of the New South Wales section of the Australian Aircraft Industry, take immediate action to ensure the re-equipment of the armed forces with Australian designed and produced aircraft and assessories by: 1. Compiling long range planning of requirements. 2. Compiling detailed specifications of aircraft and equipment allowing sufficient time for industry to intelligently appraise requirements and submit proposals accordingly. Whilst fuftlment of the above would provide a solid foundation for the distant future, an immediate necessity exists to provide work in the factories now and to this end, offset manufacturing is the probable immediate answer, although from our experience the policy of producing parts against offset orders, does not provide work for technical and design teams, but only provides production work for the workshops of parts which are pre-designed and pre-tooled by the originating overseas manufacturers. And your petitioners, as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Lionel Bowen. Petition received. Northern Territory National Park wealth of Australia in Parliament assembled. This humble petition of interested citizens of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth: 1. That there is widespread public concern over the delay of the Commonwealth in promulgating a Top End (Kakuda) National Park in the Northern Territory in a region which a former Minister for the Interior has described as 'ranking with the Great Barrier Reef and Ayers Rock as a major tourist attraction'. 2. That in the seven years since the Northern Territory Reserves Board first notified its proposal the area, despite frequent representations and objections to the Minister, has not yet been reserved. 3. That over the intervening years the area concerned has been subjected to pastoral leases and mining prospecting authorities and it is now proposed to build a road into the region, which will further damage this magnificent possession. 4. That the proposed National Park is rich in Aboriginal paintings, unique fauna, unique flora and dramatic scenery; also there is an apparent meeting of plant life from the east coast with that of the west, a phenomenon found nowhere else in Australia. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that pray. Petition received. Advertising in Telephone Directories To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of citizens of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth: That we, the undersigned, protest against the action of the Commonwealth Government in letting the contract for the advertising rights for the Victorian Pink Pages Telephone Directories to an American company, General Telephone and Electronics Corp., USA., trading in Australia as Directories (Aust.) Pty Ltd. That this will mean that the American company now controls the telephone directory advertising in all but one state of the Commonwealth. We respectfully request that this contract be revoked in the national interest, and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Bryant. Petition received. Canberra: Development of Parkland To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of residents of the Division of the Australian Capital Territory respectfully showeth: That the National Capital Development Commission have advised us of their intention to develop the entire western side of Melrose Drive with flats and town houses. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the aforesaid strip of land on the whole western side of Melrose Drive be reserved for development as parkland. Your petitioners are concerned that such a development will place an excessive strain on the schools of the area, and will result in a diminution of the land available for recreational purposes, and will create traffic hazards. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Enderby. Petition received. Education: Pre-school and After-school Centres To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Pre-school and after-school education facilities are in urgent need within tlie Australian community. The shortage has become more acute as more mothers join the work force. In advanced countries pre-school and afterschool education are recognised as essential aspects synonymous'. of education for all children. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of 'Representatives in Parliament assembled will take immediate steps to provide the necessary finance to enable state education departments and local government authorities to establish: A. Pre-school centres. B. After-school centres. C. Facilities for training the staff for such centres. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Dr Klugman. Petition received. Education To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Farliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully sheweth: (a) that, to allow true religious freedom. Governments will make no law respecting religion, neither to prohibit the free exercise thereof nor to compel the individual citizen to support the religion of others. (b) that nearly all non-State schools are church schools which to a greater or lesser degree promote a specific creed. (c) that, about 80 per cent of church schools are Roman Catholic schools, which Roman Catholic spokesmen explicitly state to be extensions of their church. (d) that, the use of Commonwealth funds to aid church schools compels every taxpayer to finance tbe religion of others, whether be wishes to, or not. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will restore to the Australian people true religious freedom, which can exist only when Church and State are legally separated both in form and substance. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Dr Solomon. Petition received. Aboriginal Land Rights To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: We believe that we are beneficiaries of the expropriation without treaty or compensation of this continent from the Australian Aborigines. We believe that all possible steps must now be taken both to prevent any further erosion of remaining Aboriginal land and also to make adequate reparation for the grievous wrong suffered over 200 years by a cultural minority group in our community. We believe that the Aboriginal people are now rapidly reaching a crisis of their own identity. Fot them, as has been well said, 'land and identity are Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that this House urge the Government in consultation with the Aborigines themselves to grant land rights to Aborigines taking into account the following matters: 1. The introduction of legislation to provide for the corporate Aboriginal title lo all the Aboriginal Reserves in the Northern Territory, setting up, in preparation for such legislation, a strong legal commission to formulate, where necessary the structure for the corporate holding of land by Aborigines. 2. Tiie suspension of provisions of the Mining Acts to give effective priority in prospecting and mineral rights in Aboriginal Reserves to corporate Aboriginal groups. 3. The continuation and expansion of the commendable policy of purchasing of suitable pastoral properties on non-reserved lands with regular ownershiprightsin the hands of selected Aboriginal groups. 4. The use of powers granted to the Commonwealth under the Referendum of 1967 to ensure similar measures by all State Governments. 5. The establishment as an act of compensation for the loss of all other parts of the Continent, of a National Aboriginal Trust Fund of a large size for the benefit and advancement of Aborigines, to be under Aborigines' control and to delegates without regard to the cost or the be in addition to normal Government assistance to the Aborigines as Australian citizens. by Mr Uren. Petition received. WOOL MARKETING say recently on television that he made the important dedsions in his Government and that recently the Government had been faced with the question whether or not there should be an acquisition scheme for wool and that he made the decision on that? Did he take the decision that the Government's policy was against acquisition and a single national marketing authority for the entire wool clip? Has he noticed that the Minister for Primary Industry stated on the weekend that the Government already knows what the new Wool Corporation would recommend for its investigation of acquisition and is he aware that the Minister is now pledging the Government to a policy of acquisition?

May I also ask whether the Prime Minister has now decided to table the Commonwealth's evaluation analysis of the Eton water conservation project for which the Commonwealth has refused to provide funds and about which the honourable member for Dawson asked him early last week? tions involved in this matter but as they are is good to observe yet another primary insomewhat related I will permit them to be dustry seeing the future more optimistically answered. and tedious speech made by the Leader of the Opposition deserves some examination by me as I have not seen either report personally. I will discuss the matter with my relevant colleagues and see whether the reports are proper subjects for release in accordance with normal parliamentary practice. As to the first part of the honourable gentleman's question, 1 assure him that my colleague, the Minister for Shipping and Transport, has submitted to me several very valuable and informative statements with recommendations, relating to the urban transport systems of this country. I will be giving these very careful attention. Not only do I regard the papers as of great importance but I think my colleague has gone to considerable trouble to present papers to me that I think indicate a proper attitude by the Commonwealth Government to this difficult problem. RICE Trade and Industry give the House any information on recent trends in the rice industry and on the outlook for world trade in this commodity in the coming months? been fairly sluggish in recent years because of world overproduction and large stocks fact that the Commonwealth itself is to being held by many of the principal problame for the delay in the finalisation of the ducers, but this year there has been a reversal of circumstances in the rice industry as there has been in nearly every other primary industry. There have been poor seasons in two of the principal Asian producing countries. Stocks are now low and world prices have risen by about 25 per cent. The outlook for the next year or so is very optimistic. I am only sad that Australia is not able to take full advantage of the marketing situation because our crop last year was below average. But in the forthcoming season I think there will be some increase in Australian production. We have, of course, one of the most efficient rice producing industries in the world. It is highly mechanised. It has a reliable source of water and its yields are tban it has in the past. Prime Minister. I refer to an answer given by the Minister for Shipping' and Transport last week in which he blamed the South Australian Government for .the delay in the finalisation of the agreement for the Tarcoola-Alice Springs railway. Did the South Australian Premier write to the Prime Minister on 27th September 1972 in connection with the Alice Springs-Tarcoola railway, agreeing to a grant of Crown land for the railway without reservations concerning mineral rights and requesting the Commonwealth to keep the existing line from Port Augusta to Marree open whilst necessary for the general welfare of the State of South Australia, subject to arbitration if a dispute arose as to economic viability? Is it true that South Australia raised no objection to the removal of certain sections of the Northern Territory Acceptance Act 1910-1952 provided that South Australia was not disadvantaged by freight rates?

16,Mr Wallis,"As a consequence, is it aagreement on this railway and not the South Australian Premier as claimed by the Minister for Shipping and Transport? Shipping and Transport. remains true. The simple facts of life are that the Tarcoola-Alice Springs railway agreement could have been before this Parliament had the South Australian Premier not been difficult on minor issues. Let me recount the facts to the House. The Prime Minister forwarded a draft agreement to the South Australian Premier on 22nd May, and I think it was in the last week in September that the Premier responded to that agreement. He raised matters that had not been raised in all the discussions between the officials in the intervening period. They were matters of minor significance in the total terms, having regard to the importance to the nation of the whole project. They could have been easily discussed by ofncials separately from the signing of the agreement. That is the first point I make. Secondly, I draw attention to the 2 points of disagreement which the South Australian Premier has raised. He seeks a special arbitration arrangement between the Commonwealth and the State if the Commonwealth decides to close the line to Marree. The Commonwealth Government already has agreed to consult with the South Australian Government on this matter so the Premier really is raising red herrings. His approach assumes that the Commonwealth would arbitrarily close the railway line. I think it fair to say that in respect of South Australia of all States the Commonwealth Railways has been sympathetic and considerate in its handling of railway problems especially as the Commonwealth Railways operates throughout much of that State. This sort of request by the Premier apparently carries an implication against the Commonwealth Railways. As the responsible MinisterI do not like this. I regard it as an insult to the not read the reasons for the judgment but, employees of the Commonwealth Railways. The Premier claims that we would not continue to operate the line despite significant operating losses and would not recognise the value of community services. These are the very things we do recognise. The Premier also is concerned that the Commonwealth Railways does not charge higher freight rates for any commodity than does the South Australian Railways. What he is saying implicitly is that one transport authority is not able to set its own charges and that an outside authority-the Commonwealth Railwayswhich services South Australia must be guided by the South Australian Railways Commission. These are the 2 matters the Premier has raised at this late stage. They could have been discussed in the intervening period and were not discussed. The Premier's action has prevented the introduction of a Bill into this Parliament for ratification of the agreement. My charge remains true. attention of the Minister for Customs and Excise been drawn to a decision by the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal to reduce, a Hong Kong heroin pusher's gaol term from 5 to 3 years? Is the Minister aware that the Queensland Chief Justice considered that the quantity of heroin involved was one reason why the sentence should be reduced? Will the Minister tell the House how many doses can be made from 5 ounces of heroin? Finally, will the Minister seek the co-operation of all States in order to have a teach-in for some members of the so-called learned judiciary so that they, too, might learn of the destructive qualities of a narcotic such as heroin? report to which the honourable gentleman has referred. I cannot comment at length on it because I do not have the details at my fingertips. What the honourable gentleman suggests is truea person who was convicted for importing a quantity of heroin was sentenced to a 5-year gaol term but this was reduced to 3 years. As I understand it, if the quantity involved were mixed with other material and injected it would be approximately 2,000 doses of heroin. I have as I have said previously, every parliament in Australia, whether it is Liberal or Labor controlled, is unanimous that the maximum sentence for a drug pusher should be 10 years' gaol. I am not speaking now of user-pushers who are to be pitied in some",20,Railways Tarcoola Alice Springs

ETON WATER CONSERVATION Prime Minister is supplementary to the question asked of him by tbe Leader of the Opposition. The Prime Minister will recall that last Tuesday week in answer to a question by the honourable member for Dawson he informed the honourable member that although he would not make available to the Parliament the Commonwealth evaluation report on which he rejected the Queensland Government's request for assistance for the urgently required Eton water conservation project in North Queensland he would, however, consider giving the report to the honourable member for Dawson on a confidential basis. As this area is in the grip of a severe drought, has he made up his mind yet, after 9 days, whether he is prepared to let the honourable member for Dawson see the report and the reason for the rejection of this important project? member for Dawson should be well capable of looking after himself, without the help of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Should the honourable member for Dawson want to see that report he can get in touch with me. Dr PattersonJ have done so. Dr PattersonI have written a letter to to you. received it yet. Primary Industry advise tbe House of the present position regarding the setting up of facilities to provide long term loans for primary producers? Is the Government aware that many primary producers have not qualified for rural reconstruction finance only because of great personal sacrifice on their part and on the part of their families, and that they now need and deserve long term finance to enable them to take advantage of the present favourable prices for many rural products? Finally, is the Government aware that provision of long term finance could avert the need for greater rural reconstruction finance in the future and at the same time benefit rural towns and communities? recognise a need for long term rural finance. Indeed, as a result of a study undertaken by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics a specific allocation of $20m was included in the Budget to enable the creation of a facility for this purpose. The report of the BAE was published some weeks ago and is available to honourable members. I expect that the Government will be making a detailed statement on this matter shortly. addressed to the Minister for Social Services. Is it a fact that the Minister proposes an incursion into the Shortland electorate later this week where he is to be the guest of the Dudley pensioners? If so,' will he, when addressing the assembly, justify his Department's consistent refusal to feed certain categories of deserted wives and their children or, alternatively, explain' why he refuses to ascertain from the New South Wales Social Welfare Department why that Department refuses to succour deserted wives at least to the extent provided by law? Finally, when can I expect a reply in the Winkler representations? Will he also table the papers in the Duff case so that the Parliament may be in a position to judge the merits of what constitutes lawful desertion in the Government's view so far as hundreds of married women are concerned? ter part of the honourable member's question first, I have not in my mind details of the Duff case which he mentions. I will certainly examine the matter in accordance with his request and will give him an answer as soon as I have had an opportunity to look at the papers. In regard to the earlier part of his question, I am hoping to visit the Shortland area in the next day or so. It depends a little on the programme in this House. I hope very much",21,Narcotic Drugs

28,Mr Wentworth,"Answering the latto have an opportunity to address the pensioners in his electorate and to let them know the immense improvements which are in this year's Budget and the way in which the Government has provided a comprehensive programme for the help of the ailing aged which will make our system not merely a good one but the best in the world. I look forward very much to stating these facts to the pensioners at Dudley, or to pensioners in any part of Australia whom I may have an opportunity of addressing. In regard to the care of deserted wives, the honourable member may recall that this is a State and not a Commonwealth function. Some time ago I brought in a Bill in which the Commonwealth Government undertook to pay to the States one half of the costs that they incurred in this field. I do not know whether the Commonwealth should take over this function from the States or not. I know that honourable members opposite feel that the Commonwealth should take over all functions from the States and effectively abolish the States. I know that that is their policy. As I understand it, it is not the policy of the Liberal Party. This is one of the distinct differences between our parties. However, I have under consideration at the present time the possibility of reducing from 6 months to 3 months the period following desertion before a wife qualifies for a pension. This is a human problem which we are looking at with the benefit of experience which has been gained from New Zealand and other places. women and their babies are starving. cases of desertion, I am glad to say, the husband does return and until there is some clarification and crystallisation of the position it is in the interests of the families concerned that the administration be done at the grass roots level. The States have the machinery to do this; the Commonwealth has not. I do not want to set up a large organisation which duplicates the machinery of the States. recall that some time ago 1 asked him about supply, shipping, laying or rust proofing? the possibility of introducing an efficiency or long service decoration for members of the regular Services. I think the Minister promised to look into this matter. Has any progress been made in respect of this? tain of the situation at the present time. I know that quite an amount of work has been done on this matter but it is extremely difficult to standardise the number of awards that are available in this field. I will look this up as soon as question time is over and I will get in touch with the honourable member and see that he gets a reply. for Trade and Industry a question concerning the Moomba-Sydney gas pipline. Will the cost of rust proofing, coating and laying this pipeline greatly exceed the price for supply and delivery? As the Japanese are making the pipes and a West German shipping company was yesterday awarded the contract to transport them, can an assurance be given that Australia's interests will be recognised by requiring contracts for rust proofing, coating and laying be awarded to Australian firms? honourable member as to the facts because I am not aware of them. But I would like to say that negotiations are continuing between the Australian Gas Light Co. and Australian manufacturers of gas piping. I am hopeful that an agreement will be reached whereby part of the contract can go to Australian manufacturers. Mr Les Johnson-Oh! jection, I do not think there is any disagreement at all about part of the contract going to overseas firms because in view of its capacity it is impossible for Australian industry to fulfil the whole contract within a reasonable period of time. Nobody is arguing about that. The argument has revolved around whether part of the contract might be taken up by Australian manufacturers and I have stated on behalf of the GovernmentMr Les Johnson-Are you talking about",22,Pensioners Shortland Electorate

Caims-Can you not be more positive than hopeful? to hear the honourable member for Lalor interject and ask whether I can be more positive than hopeful. I certainly know how the Labor Party would handle the matter. It would intervene and say: 'This is what you have to have. This is the difference between the way in which we administer the private sector of the economy and the way in which the Labor Party would administer it. The Labor Party has no reservations about a massive bureaucracy intervening into business and telling it what it should produce and how much it should produce. (Opposition members interjecting) the last question time of this Parliament and I do not want to be forced to do something that might upset an honourable member. What has been happening this morning should not happen in the national Parliament. There have been far too many interjections and far too much laughter while the Minister has been seeking to answer a question. As I said yesterday, I think all honourable members believe in giving people a fair go. down its socialist beliefs, but it is not until point of order. The matter will be handled you get a positive example like this that it demonstrates that it is socialist at heart, that Australian industry will do what it says, and that economic factors wili not come into play. The people who will suffer most severely will be the consumers of Australia. Mr Les JohnsonI rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Minister is not getting anywhere near to answering the question I asked which was: Will Australian firms be allowed to lay the pipes? point of order. If the Minister had been given a fair go he could have answered the question more quickly. There have been many interjections and the Minister has exercised his discretion in answering some of them. If honourable members were not to interject when Ministers are anwering questions we would be able to deal with more questions at question time. hopeful that a satisfactory arrangement will be made with Australian industry to supply part of the pipeline, and I hope that Australian industry will play a very significant part in supplying the ancillary facilities that are necessary for this pipeline and, of course, that Australian labour will be used in laying the pipeline and in the construction of it, which will account for a major part of the cost of it. But the Labor Party would want to go in and bulldoze its way around and tell business what to do. I think that we in our soft approach, by co-operation and Opposition MembersA soft approach! It is an approach of co-operation between all the parties to come to a sensible agreement. I would hope that we can get a sensible agreement whereby Australian industry is given a chance to supply part of the contract. But we would not get any sensible agreement if politicians or bureaucrats were to start making the commercial judgments as to what is good for Australian business. Mr Clyde CameronI rise to a point of order, Mr Speaker. Will you take steps to see, as a matter of privilege, that the Minister does not alter the text of Hansard in reference to his soft approach? by Hansard in the usual manner! Prime Minister.

45,Mr Mcmahon,"Only yesterday thisETON WATER CONSERVATION the Leader of the Opposition I should now like to clarify an answer that I gave to the questions asked by him and by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I have been informed that my Department has received a letter from the honourable member for Dawson, but has not yet passed it to me. My Department is examining the matter with some degree of urgency and hopes to be able to let me have an answer to that letter today. I should mention also that the Minisler for National Development has just informed me that there was a question on notice from the honourable member for Dawson requesting that certain papers be given to him. Because of the nature of the documents-the y are as between governments-the Minister has decided that they should not be supplied to the honourable member for Dawson. Minister for Foreign Affairs. When he represented Australia at the United Nations this year, did he and the representatives of any other countries have discussions on agreements for reciprocal pension payments between Australia and those countries? How soon does he expect that any agreements will be concluded under the legislation passed 5 months ago? With which countries does he expect that the first agreements will be concluded? Mr N. H. BOWEN-This was not a topic discussed with other Foreign Ministers in New York. However, to some degree I have been concerned with the question of agreements between Australia and other countries. Under this highly beneficial legislation the Minister for Social Services has been negotiating the terms of agreement because there is an element of reciprocal rights. In a number of countries-the Minister for Social Services would have to supply the list of countries involved-agreement s in draft form have been arrived at. These are in process of being dealt with by the legal officials, as I understand the matter. the Minister for Labour and National Serone area and offered work in another area? vice. By way of brief preface I observe that I have been informed that an allowance is paid under a scheme to retrain housewives and to encourage them back into the workforce. I am further informed that the Queensland Government has increased the rents of housewives living in housing commission homes pursuant to the allowance granted. Will the Minister have inquiries made to see whether this information is well founded? If it is, will he seek to encourage the Queensland Government to moderate its policy? tion posed by the honourable gentleman is yes, I will make the inquiry. Social Services: With which countries have draft agreements been made for reciprocal pension payments? How soon does he expect that the agreements will be concluded? 37 countries have been approached in this regard. I hope that agreement will be concluded shortly at least with Malta, Greece and Italy, as I understand the situation. I think there may be one or 2 other countries, but certainly in the case of those countries the substantial points have been agreed and the matter*is, as my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs said, now in the hands of the legal draftmen for finalisation. the Minister for Social Services concerning the administration of the unemployment benefit. By way of preamble I advise the Minister that I have received submissions from people living in the Warburton area of Victoriaa semi-rural area. They are forest workers. Their unemployment benefit has been terminated because they bave not taken reasonable steps to obtain employment. The reasonable step not taken seems to have been a refusal to take work in the metropolitan area.

The view is generally taken that where a man has family commitments he should not be asked to take work in another area before a reasonable time has elapsed. This is generally regarded very liberally by my Department in accordance with the family circumstances. Regard is also had to the distance of travel required and similar circumstances. However, for a single man the criteria are imposed with much less flexibility. If the honourable member will be good enough to give me details of the Warburton Cases he has in mind I will certainly have a look at them to see whether I can help. whether the Government has considered enabling local government authorities to bave access to the Commonwealth Grants Commission. What would be the practicalities of such a proposal? consideration which would lead us to the conclusion that it would be a proper course of action. I think there are over 900.000 local government bodies in Australia. wrong about that? There are 900 local government bodies and 80 semi-government bodies. 900 I apologise. gise. My intention was to say that there are over 900 such bodies. millions, you know. ises are in millions and that is the sort of promise which is likely to come from the Opposition at any moment. The Grants Commission was set up to consider the claims of the claimant States. The proposal criteria that we equate local government bodies to the States can be seen to put upon the Grants Commission an extraordinarily heavy burden in going through the claims of all the local government bodies and semi-government authorities. The Grants Commission adopts a standard. It is that of 2 States-no t three or any other number. The Commission then sees what the claimant States ought to do to bring their services to approximately the level of the 2 standard States; in other words, to put an equality test. The sort of problems that would be involved in an equality test for 900 local government bodies in Australia, which would involve going into their finances-and, as I understand from what is proposed this would be an examination of capital issues as well as current account issues-woul d make the task of the Grants Commission difficult beyond comprehension. Not only would it be necessary to look at the equality issue but first it would be necessary to adopt the standard by which the equality could be tested. The criteria would have to be determined. Even if all of these tasks could be overcome, attractive as it may seem at first sight, such a proposal really brings one back to the basic fundamental requirement-that is, if one is to do something about it one needs to find the money to do it. There is little point in saying that we will do all of these grand things without explaining where the money will come from for the purpose.

I am sure that he trusts this country and this Government and has complete confidence in us, particularly in the fact that we can be trusted when information is confided to us by him. I can state, also in answer to the right honourable gentleman that I believe that the President and his emissary, Dr Kissinger, are making an enormous effort to achieve peace in Indo China on terms that can be regarded as satisfactory to the governments of those 3 countries and also to ensure that the people in those 3 countries will have the.right to self determination and the right to live in peace and freedom, free from aggression from outside. I believe that that answers in full, or very nearly in full, the question against Australian and seeks to confer on asked by the right honourable gentleman. I am very glad that he has asked this question as his last question because I know how much he has dedicated himself to the ideals of peace and the ideals of justice in this area. May I complete my answer on another note. I believe that the people of this country are becoming sick and tired of people who run around the country defaming others and engaging in campaigns of denigration of individuals. I congratulate such a flow-on would have disastrous effects the right honourable member on the award of $18,000 he received yesterday from the court.

As he well knows, we the President of the Australian Council of get the opportunity to ask only one quesTrade Unions as a sham and political tion every 3 weeks if we are lucky. nonsense. The simple fact is that the 35hour week is an issue in the Australian community simply because the unions have made it an issue by including it in their log of claims against certain industries. The second fact which is also undeniable is that the gallup polls which have been taken in the community on this question of substance indicate full well that the position which has been taken by the Government is supported by the overwhelming majority of Australians. But in terms of the concept, as alleged by the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, bf seeking division in the community, there is no doubt that the policy which is offered by the Australian Labor Party is, in fact, divisive because that policy seeks to set Australian some a benefit which at the same time it would deny to others. This policy is contrary to the egalitarian trend of industrial relations in this country, is discriminatory in the context in which I have mentioned before in this House and, finally, is totally naive because it ignores the whole concept of flow-on throughout the genera] community, about which concept, of course, the honourable gentleman who asked the question is vitally concerned because, as he indicated, on the rural community, the export industries and on those groups in the community least able to protect themselves, namely, the pensioners, the superannuitants, those on fixed incomes and, of course, the men and women on the land.

129,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Prime Minis( Mr N. H. Bowen) who initiated at least one part of this report, my appreciation, which I am sure will be shared by all who read the paper, of the comprehensiveness of the paper and of the very considerable amount of time, effort, skill and learning which has gone into its preparation. Ministerial Statement -by leave I am now able to inform the House of the outcome of the Government's consideration of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Legislation tabled in the House on 18th May 1972 by the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess). Honourable members will recall that the Committee was formed in September 1970. It quickly embarked on a wide-ranging inquiry in the course of which it received 459 written submissions from individuals, departments and organisations and heard evidence from 65 witnesses, in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. The main recommendation of the Committee was the introduction of a completely new scheme to replace the existing pre-1959 and post-1959 DFRB schemes. The DFRB scheme has now been in existence for 24 years. It commenced in 1948 after an inquiry by an interdepartmental committee under the chairmanship of the Honourable J. J. Dedman, then Minister for Defence. The original scheme, which had much in common with the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, proved to be very inflexible in operation and in 1957 a committee chaired by Sir John Allison was appointed to renew it. The result was the establishment in 1959 of a new and quite different type of scheme to apply to future members. This is the new scheme now known as the post-1959 scheme. Existing members were not transferred on to the new basis. Instead special arrangements were made that preserved for them their accrued rights and established a basis for them to contribute for additional benefits as they arose. These arrangements, which were significantly modified in 1965 to permit members to limit their contributions, are now known as the pre-1959 scheme. The pre-1959 scheme is most complex and has attracted a great deal of criticism. About 12,000 of the present DFRB membership of around 80,000 still contribute on this basis and the present majority of present pensioners were pre-1959 members, The pre-1959 element of the DFRB Fund is, however, in a most bouyant position. The report of the Commonwealth Actuary on his fourth quinquennial investigation, which the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) received from the DFRB Board earlier this week discloses that on the basis of the DFRB scheme continuing in its present form, and I emphasise that proviso, there was an available surplus of $14.9m as at 30th June 1969 in respect of around 19,000 pre-1959 contributors and pensioners. The post-1959 element of the fund, on the other hand, was approximately in balance, there being a small deficiency of little importance in actuarial terms. The Treasurer will table the reports of the Actuary and the DFRB Board on the fourth quinquennial investigation later today. The post-1959 scheme is simpler than the very complex pre-1959 scheme, but the Jess Committee concluded that it is still unnecessarily complex. It has two distinct parts, one covering other rank members, the other officer members. Each contributor pays throughout his service a fixed percentage rate of contribution which varies with his age and rank at entry. The percentage rates range from 4.75 per cent for entry at 15 or less to a maximum of 6 per cent for other rank members entering at age 30 or more. Only service from age 20 onwards counts for pension purposes but both officer and other rank members who enter before that age pay lower rates of contribution. The difference between the maximum contribution rates for other ranks and officers reflects the different basis on which other rank and officer pensions are assessed. The other rank pension is determined by length of service while the officer pension is determined by age at retirement, the maximum in both instances being a pension approximately 70 per cent of final pay, although the maximum tapers down to around 60 per cent for the most senior officers as in fhe superannuation scheme.",31,Parliamentary Committees
130,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Prime Minister)Both the pre-1959 and post-1959 schemes are actuarially based and members' contributions are retained in an invested fund. The earning rate of this fund has increased rapidly in recent years. The estimated earning rate for the year ended 30th June 1972 is 6.58 per cent, which would be an increase of 0.24 per cent over the rate for 1970-71. The Jess Committee recommended that the present fund be transferred to the Commonwealth, that members' contributions in future be paid to consolidated revenue and that the Commonwealth guarantee the benefits provided and meet all costs not covered by members' contributions. In the new scheme recommended by the Committee, the contribution rate would be a flat 5.5 per cent of pay for all members and the level of pensions would be determined for both officers and other ranks by length of service. All service, including service before age 20, would count for pension purposes and pensions would range from 35 per cent of final pay after 20 years' service to 76.5 per behalf of those pre-1959 contributors who cent of pay after 40 years. Officers, like other rank members, would be entitled to a pension on completion of 20 years' service, without increasing the level of their contribut a pension reduction penalty of 5 per cent butions further, the Commonwealth element would apply for each uncompleted year of service if an officer were retired at his own crucial point, therefore, is whether it is request before he reached his retiring age for rank or an other rank member before the end of his engagement. The Committee also recommended that, after retirement, the whole of a member's pension be adjusted annually to maintain relativity with average weekly earnings. The Committee said that a possible method of achieving this would be to maintain the relativity of benefits to current pay for the rank held on retirement. Other recommendations include desirable extensions and improvements to provisions that exist in the present scheme. Tbe Jess Committee was rightly concerned to seek to avoid complexions in the future operations of the DFRB scheme. For this reason the Committee concluded that all present contributors should be compulsorily transferred to the new scheme and that they should not be offered a choice of remaining in their present scheme. The Government is attracted to the concept of a simple, comprehensible scheme as outlined by the Jess Committee, but, in a letter to the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairbarn), the Committee expressed the strong opinion that if any of the Committee's recommendations were detrimental to any section of existing contributors, special short term arrangements should be made to ensure that no detriment occurred. The Government accepted this view and on 20th September last the Minister for Defence announced that no-one would be disadvantaged by participating in the new scheme, that everybody would have a right by election to ensure that by participating he would not be disadvantaged. This inevitably raised the question whether it would be possible to make this assurance effective without introducing a third DFRB scheme to supplement the pre-1959 and post-1959 scheme. The Government has no desire to do so. There have been strong representations on behalf of post-1959 late entrant officers. There have also been representations on have taken the opportunity available to them of limiting their contributions and receiving, of future accruing pension entitlements. The practicable to transfer in an equitable way the pre-1959 and post-1959 contributors to such a new scheme, without detriment to any one of them. We shall have an independent expert examination of this problem. One supplementary suggestion from the Jess Committee related to late entry officers. The number involved are significant. At 30th June 1972 there were 3,516 officer members who entered at age 23 or later, 773 officers entered at age 33 or later. Because of the change in the basis for officers' pension to length of service in the Jess Committee scheme, many of these late entrant officers would have a lower pension entitlement. The Jess Committee in a letter to the Minister for Defence recommended that these officers, in addition to receiving the surplus of their contributions above 5i per cent of salary, should be allowed to purchase back notional service to bring the pension they would be contributing for under the Jess scheme up to the level for which they were contributing under the post-1959 scheme. This proposal is being actively investigated now. The Government, like the Jess Committee, is attracted to the concept of a simple, comprehensible scheme provided it is possible to transfer the existing pre-1959 and post 1959 contributors to the new schema without detriment. This is strongly favoured by the Services. But if the Government's assurance of transfer without detriment should prove to be impracticable, the Government has decided that it would instead incorporate many of the recommendations of the Jess Committee in an improved version of the post-1959 scheme to which pre1959 contributors would be given the opportunity of transfer on an equitable basis. In any event, the following 7 specific recommendations of the Committee have been accepted by the Government: Marriages of pensioners before age 60 will be recognised for widows' pension purposes; A dependent spouse of a female member or pensioner will be entitled to pension on her death; Subject to conditions yet to be determined, de facto spouses and illegitimate children will be recognised for pension purposes; Children's benefits payable to students will be continued until age 25; There will be payable to the estate of a contributor or pensioner, who dies without leaving dependants entitled to pension, an amount equal to one and one half times his contributions less, in the case of a pensioner, any pension or other benefits received; The tapering of the entitlements of more senior officers will be eliminated; A retiring member will not be penalised by reason of his refusing to sign on to a reserve force. The Government has also adopted in a modified form 6 other recommendations of the Jess Committee: An officer will be able to retire on pension before reaching his designated retiring age on completion of 20 years service for DFRB purposes; The present category structure will be eliminated. Contribution rates will be expressed as a percentage of pay for DFRB purposes and pensions as a percentage of final pay; For members who enter at age 20, retirement pensions will range from 35 per cent of final page at age 40 to 70 per cent at age 57 or later; A retired member will have an unfettered right within a specified period of retirement, say, 12 months, to commute up to the existing one-third of his pension, other than an invalidity pension. The amount of the commuted sum will be determined on an appropriate annuity basis; Appropriate provision will be made for the purchase of past non-contributory service by present serving members including those members who in 1948 elected to remain on deferred pay rather than enter the DFRB scheme; The concept of an appeals tribunal has been accepted. As I have earlier explained, the Jess Committee recommended that DFRB pensions be adjusted annually after retirement to maintain relativity with average weekly earnings and mentioned a possible method of doing this. We have concluded that the issue of post-retirement pension adjustments cannot be dealt with in the DFRB context alone. In the past DFRB pensions have been adjusted at the same time and on the same basis as Commonwealth superannuation pensions and similar adjustment principles have been applied to other Commonwealth superannuation-type pensions. The House will recall that last year the Treasurer in his Budget Speech announced that the Government was investigating alternative methods of adjusting DFRB and superannuation pensions. We have now decided to refer this important issue to independent expert investigation. This investigation will be called upon to report on various methods of adjusting pensions for which the Commonwealth is responsible and the interrelationships of the various schemes and how they might be affected by the various adjustment methods. Additionally, the investigation will report on the economic and financial effects of the various methods considered. The personnel members of the Navy, Army and Air boards have all agreed that it is premature at this stage to press for an annual updating of DFRB pensions in the light of the other schemes needing similar consideration. Children's and orphans' pensions in both the DFRB and superannuation schemes are expressed as fixed amounts, although there is an alternative basis for assessing orphans' pensions. The manner of determining children's and orphans' pensions in the DFRB and superannuation schemes is at present under consideration and any decisions taken will be incorporated in whatevei scheme emerges. We have also given careful consideration better DFRB scheme. to the Committee's recommendation that the DFRB scheme be administered by the Department of Defence and that the House, may I refer in particular to the Mimster for Defence should be the respondedicated and excellent work that has been sible Minister. The Government is satisfied done by the honourable member for La that the present arrangement of the one Trobe( Mr Jess), the honourable member organisation-the office of the superannuafor Isaacs( Mr Hamer), and the honourtion and DFRB boards-servicin g both the able member for Herbert( Mr Bonnett).

I present tbe Jess Committee was that the present the following paper: invested fund of members' contributions, which stood at $154m at 30th June 1972, statement, 26th October 1972. be transferred to the Commonwealth and contributions of members in future be paid to Consolidated Revenue.

As already announced, the legislation will operate from lst October 1972. We believe that the improvements that will be effected by the legislation will simplify the present arrangements and result in a very much BeforeI commend this paper to the an immensely important job on behalf of the servicemen of this country.

132,Mr Barnard (Bass) (11.31),"Probablymy distinguished colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) was Deputy Chairman. But no-one would expect that the Prime Minister, having dealt with the Jess Committee's report in the way he did during the Cabinet deliberations, would be prepared to concede that there were other members on this Committee, that this Committee was constituted in such a way that it was representative of every Party in this Parliament and, indeed, that the Committee brought down a unanimous recommendation. As I said, after a remarkable chain of events which led to the complete rejection of the Jess Committee's report by the Cabinet, the Prime Minister has the temerity to single out 3 of the members of that Committee purely for political purposes. I believe he confirmed his own smallness in relation to these matters. Let the people of Australia and the 80,000 servicemen in this country judge whether the Prime Minister's attitude and whether the Cabinet's attitude in relation to the DFRB Committee was the correct approach. Honourable members on his own side of the House do not accept this proposition. I referred to the chain of events. The assumption may have been conveyed to some people in this country that the Prime Minister made a statement in this Parliament this morning as a result of attitudes expressed and actions taken by some members on his own side. Let me confirm for the servicemen of this country that that statement would not have been made this morning had I not directed 2 questions to the Benefits legislation (referred to hereafter as the Prime Minister yesterday, both of which he evaded. I knew that the day before Cabinet had rejected the Jess Committee's recommendations in relation to the DFRB scheme. The Prime Minister evaded the issue. One could almost say that he set out deliberately amd comprehensibility to servicemen and, thereto give a false impression as to what had happened in relation to that report. Subsequently I was forced to move in this House for the suspension of Standing Orders. That action brought this issue before the Parliacrucial issue because what the Government ment. I say quite frankly that had it not been for the attitude I adopted in this House this matter would have been stood over and servicemen in this country would not have been informed of the situation and no statement would have been made to this Parliament. There would have been a clear misunderstanding in relation to the attitude of the Government to the DFRB Committee. The Prime Minister's statement swaps the fruits of the Jess Committee's report for 2 new independent examinations. What this boils down to is a deliberately engineered delay in the introduction of a new pensions scheme for servicemen. The best that the Government members have been able to do is to stave off the complete scuttling of the scheme proposed by the Joint Committee. I do not make this comment in a critical sense. Obviously it takes considerable political courage to force a confrontation with Cabinet at such a crucial political time. But for the resistance of this small group of members, all but comparatively minor recommendations of the Committee would have been abandoned. At least the Prime Minister, the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) and the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairbairn) have caved in to a remarkable extent. The compromise reached is in every way a most unsatisfactory one but it has the cardinal virtue of leaving some room for manoeuvre. It may yet be possible to get the principal recommendations of the Jess Committee incorporated in. a new scheme, but such a course is hedged with difficulties. I would like to remind the House of the first and principal recommendation of the Committee, which reads as follows: That the present Defence Forces Retirement DFRB legislation) be repealed and a new scheme introduced without delay. The Committee has examined the post-1959 scheme clostfy to see whether this scheme, as it stands or with modifications, would be suitable as the sole future scheme, and is unanimous that it has many, defects, of which the most critical are its lack of simplicity fore, should be replaced by the scheme proposed in this report. This is the hard core of the Jess Corntee's report. Quite obviously this is the has tried to do is duck this recommendation. It wants to shore up the present unsatisfactory structure, incorporating some of the recommendations of the Committee into a scheme which is basically unchanged. This is completely contrary to the recommendations of the Committee which decided after very thorough examination that it just was not possible to prop up the existing unwieldy and much despised structure. There is no feature of Service life and administration so thoroughly unpopular as this scheme. Loathing and abhorrence of the present scheme transcend Service boundaries. I have never met a serving member of the forces prepared to say that he understands the scheme or that it has any worthwhile features. It has been the major gripe of servicemen overseas and in Service posts throughout Australia. This is the context in which the Jess Committee operated and rightly it decided that the DFRB scheme should be swept away and. replaced with a simpler and much more lucid scheme. This had been done in 1959 and the result was virtually the adoption of 2 schemes which have become known as the pre-1959 scheme and the post-1959 scheme. It would be tragic if the only result of this re-examination of the structure was the introduction of a third scheme, and the Prime Minister correctly pointed this out. We would wind up with the ridiculous model of .a pre-1959 scheme, a 1959-1972 scheme and a post1972 scheme. Obviously the only equitable solution was to dismantle the existing structure and start again with a new scheme in which all servicemen could participate without detriment. This is what the Jess Committee tried to do and I am satisfied that the draft proposal went a long way to achieve this objective. As I have said on many occasions, there Jess proposals tacked on to it. Yet when it were flaws and anomalies in the scheme came to the crunch, the Minister for but they were capable of elimination or Defence engaged in what can only be correction. Perhaps the main area of condescribed as a sell-out of Australia's cern was the treatment of late entrants in 80,000 servicemen. In the process it certain specific areas of the services. I appears that he ruthlessly dumped his colthink parts of the Royal Australian Air leagues, the 3 Service Ministers who, 1 Force posed important problems here. understand, strongly supported the scheme. Another contentious part of the scheme was the provision that a pension reduction own conclusions about the peculiar behavpenalty of 5 per cent a year would be iour of the Minister for Defence and assess imposed for each uncompleted year if a the genuineness of his commitment to participant finished his service early at his improving the conditions of service. This own request. There was a general feeling hybrid scheme would have been accepted that although some penalty was necessary by the Government and in all probability the loss of 5 per cent entitlement a year shoved quickly through the Parliament was a bit steep. In many cases it would before the Services realised they had been have obliterated most or even all of his deceived. The strong reaction of Commitpension entitlement. This was obviously an tee members has deferred this course of area where anomalies could occur and which needed careful exaniination and some degree of reassessment. It was possible to make this sort of criticism about the scheme, but in the main it was acceptable to servicemen and I am convinced it was a viable scheme. This was the scheme which the House was given to understand would be introduced with some modification along the lines I have indicated. There has never been any suggestion until this week that the existing legislation would not be repealed and replaced by a scheme based on the broad principles of the Jess recommendations. It is true that there were rumours of some rumblings in the Treasury about tlie scheme but the impression was conveyed that these had been overcome. Then it was revealed yesterday following a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that it was not intended to go ahead with the scheme but instead to patch up the existing structure. The most remarkable feature of this meeting appears to have been a monumental climb-down by the Minister for Defence. As I pointed out yesterday, the Minister for Defence gave a clear commitment in the Parliament on 20th September to introduce what he described as the Jess scheme and make it retrospective to lst October. The whole emphasis of this statement was on the introduction of the Jess scheme which can only be interpreted to mean the recommendations of the Jess Committee. By no stretch of the imagination can the Jess scheme be taken to mean the post-1959 scheme with a few of the Servicemen will be able to draw their action, although it is not certain how permanent this will be. The Prime Minister has emerged with a compromise which shows all the evidence of haste and strain. Apparently this is acceptable to the Committee members who jacked up on the Cabinet edict, and I accept their decision. However, I feel they must be warned that there are grave doubts about the future of the Jess scheme emerging from the Prime Minister's statement. The overwhelming impression of the statement is that the main recommendation-the repealing of the present legislation and the introduction of a completely new scheme-wil l not be adopted. The Prime Minister's remarks on the acceptance of the Committee's recommendations and the format to be adopted are very highly qualified. All that the Prime Minister has clearly committed the Government to is an obvious decision not to introduce a third DFRB scheme to supplement the pre-1959 and post-1959 schemes. The Prime Minister says that the crucial point is whether it is possible to transfer in an equitable way the pre-1959 and post-1959 contributors to a new scheme without detriment. Accordingly he has decided that an independent examination of this problem will be made. In effect, what the Prime Minister is saying but the measure of his success. musl inis that we will have an independent investievitably be a further delay-perhap s a gation to see whether the Jess scheme would work. The Select Committee spent 18 months of analysis to reach the conclusion that such ing at the DFRB in any depth is a daunting a scheme was feasible and that it should be introduced to replace the present structure The Jess Committee represents the 4 major political parties and a wide range of practical experience. The honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess) was chairman. His commitment to improving conditions of service and his knowledge of the Services are beyond question. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), who has a very extensive knowledge of pension and actuarial techniques, was deputy chairman. Apart from the wealth of experience of the Services possessed by members, the Committee also had the benefit of assistance from Mr Phil Stokes, an experienced politician and a man with an intimate knowledge of conditions of service. -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Suspension of Standing Orders agreed to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition concluding his speech without limitation of time. the Minister for Defence. I have referred to the fact that Mr Phil Stokes gave some assistance to the Committee during the whole period of its deliberations. It was the unanimous conclusion of this Committee that there should be a new scheme and that the present scheme should be wiped off the statute book. Now, after the wealth of evidence sifted and evaluated by the Jess Committee in reaching its unanimous conclusion, an independent investigator is to be appointed to see whether a new scheme is practicable. Whatever interpretation can be placed on this decision, it is a calculated insult to the Committee and in particular to its chairman. As I said earlier, the honourable member for La Trobe was in an invidious position. He had to get some measure of commitment to his scheme without rocking the boat too much in the last days before an election. To a degree he has succeeded, lengthy delay-in reforming the DFRB structure. On the evidence of both the Jess Committee and the Allison Committee lookand in many ways thankless task. I doubt whether even the most competent independent investigator could do an adequate job in less than 6 months. In the meantime, servicemen will just have to wait with the assurance that whatever emerges they will get its benefits back to lst October this year. This is hardly a satisfactory solution. There is a strong suspicion that a powerful section of the Government wants to do a hatchet job on the Jess recommendations and produce a watered-down version which will satisfy no one. If the independent investigator produces an unfavourable report on the Jess scheme, there is no doubt that this Government will scrub it and there will not be much the honourable member for La Trobe and his colleagues can do about it. In summary, the crux of this issue is the apparent rejection of the important",35,Defence Forces Retirement Benefits

This effectively demolishes the recommendations of the Committee even if some of its provisions are ultimately included in the existing scheme by amending legislation. I can assure the Government that this will not satisfy servicemen who have suffered from the complexity and often downright cussedness of the existing scheme. Many of these men have already been 2-time losers under the scheme; now there is every chance that the Government will make them 3-time losers. It is quite plain that an independent investigator will not come up with a better scheme. He can accept the feasability of the Jess proposals, which I submit is the reasonable course based on the exhaustive analysis conducted by the Select Committee. Alternatively, he can reject the scheme, most probably on strict actuarial grounds or on the basis of false economies. Without wishing to prejudge the issue or to reflect on the integrity from a great many servicemen throughout of the investigator, I have grave fears that the investigation is designed as a prelude to adoption of the decision reached by the Cabinet on Tuesday. I would like to refer to the history of the people who may have believed that they investigation of the Joint Select Committee were acting in the best interests of their of this Parliament into the Defence Forces departments and of this country. In the Retirement Benefits Fund. The Minister face of all this opposition the Committee for Defence and the Prime Minister may was determined that its final recommendalike to claim that they are responsible for tions were in the best interests of our sersolving the problem but there is a repetition vicemen. We have since awaited a decision of the crisis that developed in this Parliaby the Government. ment as far back as 1970. The honourable member for La Trobe and the honourable present Liberal-Country Party Government, member for Moreton( Mr Killen) will recall led by the present Prime Minister, should the Minister for Defence was not interested not be regarded as a government that acts in the proposal at that time-that in 1970 swiftly. I simply remind honourable memin reply to a statement on the Defence bers of what happened to the proposal of Forces Retirement Benefits FundI moved a the Opposition that there ought to be a motion in this House to set up a joint uniform legal code governing servicemen select committee of the Parliament to inin this country. We have waited 8 years vestigate the Fund. Why was this necessary? for it. I have reached the stage where I feel As the shadow Minister for Defence in this I can no longer put proposals on this issue Parliament I had accepted the responsibility to the Government because I know that of talking to servicemen throughout the nothing is likely to be done. In the light of length and breadth of the country. It was the speed with which the Government has clear to me that not only were there anomacted in that area it is understandable that alies in the scheme but there was also grave it has taken all this time to make a decision dissatisfaction. I had already submitted that in this decision? It is an ignominous decision of the country there ought to be an all-volunteer Cabinet to reject out of hand the Jess Army and all-volunteer defence forces. To achieve that end it was necessary to do something about the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund. When I moved my motion it was not accpted by the Government but some Government supporters had the courage to stand up and say that they agreed with the proposition being put forward by the Opposition. As a result, the Government brought in its own motion. Quite clearly it had the same intention to set up a joint select committee of this Parliament. It does the Prime Minister no credit that this morning he came into the chamber and by inference rubbished the members of the Committee who do not belong to the Government parties. I repeat that it does tbe Prime Minister no credit. I turn to the history of the matter. The Committee was established in September 1970. As the Prime Mimster admitted this morning, it deliberated for about 18 months. It received representations and submissions this country. It encountered problems in the way of expressed opposition. That opposition from the Commonwealth Actuary and the Department of the Treasury came from I would be the first to admit that the about the DFRB scheme. And what is the Committee's report. I repeat what I said a few moments ago. The decision is not only a great disservice to the servicemen of this country-abou t 80,000 of them-wh o have accepted the proposition, with some minor amendments to which I have referred, but it is also an insult to the Committee and particularly to its Chairman. This morning the Prime Minister made a statement which in my opinion confirms that while this Government remains in power the Jess Committee report will never be implemented. It will be watered down. The opposition that has been expressed to it by people unable to see its advantages for our servicemen was obviously maintained and directed towards exerting pressure on the Cabinet. But there is always a silver lining. I want to say now quite clearly and unequivocally to the servicemen of this country that I confidently believe that the Minister for Defence will not have an opportunity to introduce legislation on this matter into the Parliament. I give an unequivocal assurance to our servicemen and to the people of Australia that the Jess Committee's report will be given effect in this Parliament by a Labor government. I could conclude on no better note. We are not satisfied with the performance of this Government. I believe that it has done a disservice to our servicemen. It is the expressed opinion of servicemen as well as members of the Opposition. As an instruction to the Government that it should move immediately to accept the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Legislation I move: That all words after That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: this House is of the opinion that all the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Legislation should be adopted but that accrued rights should be preserved where they are more advantageous than the recommendations of the Committee. We of the Opposition agree with the Prime Minister's reference this morning to the people he believed had made a significant contribution to the Jess Committee report. We believe that every member of the Committee acted sincerely in arriving at a decision that would benefit our servicemen through a better scheme than the one which had been foisted on them by the present Government. The motion I have moved will give honourable members opposite an opportunity to acknowledge that situation. If they believe that the recommendations of the Jess Committee are correct they will support the motion which I have moved on behalf of the Opposition. Order! Is the amendment seconded? ment and reserve my right to speak to it. interesting to hear what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Barnard) has had to say in reply to the statement that was I want to start by saying that 1 am sure that the Prime Minister did not in any way intend to reflect on the members of the Joint Select Committee on Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Legislation whom he did not mention. I am sure that what he was referring to were the events of yesterday. Let me say that I concur with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in what he said about every member who served on that Committee from whatever Party or from whatever House he came. The Committee sat with one intention in mind-to obtain for the servicemen and ex-servicemen of this country benefits that we thought were their right, whatever else was propounded to us in respect of the situation of other people. I think all of us felt that the servicemen of this country and their dependants had rights that perhaps were not the same as the rights enjoyed by staff members of the Commonwealth Bank, members of the civil service and so on. Let me say this: It is not my intention, nor am I sure is it the intention of my colleagues, to take any credit or to say 'Look what I did' in respect to anything. I regret that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has to make out that if it was not for the Labor Party doing this, that and the other the 80,000 servicemen of this country would have got nothing. I point out to the honourable member that members of the Committee from both sides of tbe House have asked questions demanding that a statement be made before the House rises because we know that there could be pressures in certain areas to preclude a statement being made or that a statement might be made outside of the House after the",38,Defence Forces Retirement Benefits

But I accept that than has been done in the past where a perhaps, as the Treasury has not been able review has been carried out every 5 years to come up with a definite ruling as to after which the Government, if it's mood whether there will be detriment in regard to transferring these people, an independent is good, has decided to raise pensions.

141,Mr Jess,"Unde r pressure or not. I and everyone else. But the Committee was a board. 1 believe that DFRB matters should be in the hands of the Department of Defence. I think that Defence would handle it capably and to the benefit of the servicemen I would like to make some comment on other factors. The Committee suggested in Its scheme that those with A and B classifications of invalid benefit should not be subject to a means test. The Prime Minister said in his statement that in the broad and in principle the Government accepts most of the Committee's report. I hope that this recommendation also will be one that the Government will accept. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have said that this will be looked at. But in my opinion, if a man is invalided in his service to the Commonwealth in the defence forces and is in receipt of such a benefit, he should not be subjected to a means test. As Chairman of the Committee and as a Government supporter I am not impressed one iota with the support that this scheme has been given by the Department of Defence whose, job it is to stand and speak on behalf of the defence forces. In my opinion, in any Cabinet discussions or any meetings with Treasury officials, representatives of the Department of Defence, are there to represent the views of the services and of the soldiery from wherever they come. 1 have been amazed in respect to the negotiations in which I have been involved-and this is my opinion and I am subject to correction-as to what appeal's to be the little stand that they have made on many of these points. I should like to suggest that we should and will expect in the future a much stronger stand by the Defence Minister on behalf of the servicemen when it comes to a fight with the Department of the Treasury or whatever other factors may be involved. The Services themselves must and will demand this. In regard to the Treasury, all I can say is that when we introduced our interim report last December we stated that we could and wished to introduce our full report but that we had not been able to obtain the figures or the facts that were necessary for that report. When we introduced the final report in May we said that we had endeavoured to obtain costings and financial information from the Treasury but that we had been unable to obtain satisfactory material. Indeed, I question what 20193/72-R-1118 ] the Departments of Defence and Treasury have been doing in respect to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund over the period from May, when we introduced our final report until now, when it is almost November. It is my opinion that until the action of the last 2 or 3 weeks very little was done. I conclude my remarks by saying that I am grateful to the Prime Minister because when we approached the Prime Minister on this matter he agreed with us and took the whole matter into his hands. In my opinion, he finished up doing a very good job. 1 would like to see the Committee's recommendations accepted in their entirety. It would be the easy thing to do. It would be flattering. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said I should be insulted. I am not insulted because I think the Government has accepted the main factors and purposes of the Committee's report. An independent investigation will be conducted into the 2 matters that I have raised. 1 welcome this decision because I think that it is stupid in politics for us as laymen to say what can be done in a highly technical, actuarial field. I think that we are right but it is reasonable that there should be an actuarial check conducted on these figures to ascertain whether there could be any disadvantages in what we have proposed, and in this way I welcome the Prime Minister's decision. I will state-and 1 do not say this for political purposes because honestly, when 1 hear some of the things which are said in this HouseI wonder whether it is all worthwhile-that it is not too late for the Government to introduce legislation in a form acceptable to me and to other honourable members. The Government knows where we stand on this matter. I am grateful for what has been done. In my opinion, servicemen will not be disadvantaged. This means a great deal to servicemen and anybody who wants to make political capital out of it is kicking a rather weak ball at this time. I congratulate the members of the Committee from the Australian Labor Party, the Democratic Labor Party and the Australian Country Party. I think it was one of the best committees that I have seen. I think that the result of the Committee's deliberations was good and I congratulate and agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that at no time was politics played within the Committee. It was purely and solely for the benefit of servicemen and I am sure that all of us will continue with that outlook. the Opposition) (12.13)I wish to speak headway in his Party.

The Joint of existing and former members of the Select Committee on Defence Forces Forces and their benefits under the Defence Retirement Benefits Legislation was set up Forces Retirement Benefits Act. by a resolution of thc House on 2nd September 1970. The Committee's report was tabled on 18th May last. In all the subseCommittee seriously. We moved an amendquent 5 months there has never been any ment to the Defence Forces.

The fact is that a private ment, we find that it comes up for debate member-and every member of an opposior, in effect, for shelving because of a distion is a private member-ca n never bring pute within the Government Parties.

Without any dispute whatever in the Parliament by Ministers or private members since the Committee's report was tabled over 5 months ago, we find that there is another controversy in the Government ranks on this matter. Of course, the whole exercise of the midnight Cabinet meetings and so on have been devoted to trying to get the dissident Government supporters not to put their votes where their mouths have so often been. I represent more servicemen than anybody else in this Parliament. I represent the whole of the Holdsworthy and Ingleburn areas. There can be no doubt about the deep resentment of members of the forces at the DFRB scheme. It is an extraordinarily complex piece of legislation. Only the income tax legislation is more complicated than the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act. The Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act is usually amended right at the end of a session when it is impossible for honourable members to read the amendments and understand what differences they make to the legislation or to consult people outside the Parliament in the Services or in the Public Service. The excuse now accepted by the honourable member for La Trobe, and apparently by the honourable member for Isaacs( Mr which will encourage other ranks to reHamer) and the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bonnett), for going along with the Government's further deferment of this matter is that we now want a report from the Commonwealth Actuary. The Committee got a report from the Commonwealth Actuary. It was received in May last year. It takes up 13 pages in the Committee's report. It is an extraordinary afterand the armed forces themselves to a certhought to say that the Commonwealth Actuary must now be asked to provide another report. What has tbe Government done about getting this report in the 5 months that have elapsed since the Committee's report was tabled? If honourable members are worried about the expenditure of any amounts in the DFRB scheme let me put a couple of facts to them. On Tuesday the Minister for Defence gave me a reply to an annual question I have been putting on the notice paper about the number of resignations from the various armed forces. Last year there were 80 resignations of officers from the Army alone. It takes $66,500 to train an officer at Duntroon. Therefore if we are to get 80 officers from Duntroon to make up for the resignations during the last financial year we would be involved in an expenditure of $5,320,000. Last year 49 male officers in the Air Force and 24 male officers in the Navy resigned. The cost of training an officer in the Navy varies between $30,500 and $57,500. The cost of training an officer in the Air Force varies between $36,000 and $92,000. Millions of dollars are required to train replacements for officers whose resignations were accepted last financial year. Then there is the question of other ranks re-engaging after an initial term. I have been waiting for an answer to my annual question on this matter since 15th August. Therefore I can only give tbe answer that was given last year. In 1970-71 there were 917 re-engagements in the Army. Since it costs more than $4,000 to train a recruit in the Army to the stage where he can join his unit, one can see that a very considerable saving is achieved if soldiers re-engage. Only 40 per cent re-engage at this stage, but if there was a 100 per cent re-engagement it will be seen that we would in fact save more than $5m. So it is short sighted in the extreme to begrudge one of those things engage and which will deter officers from resigning. Improvements in the DFRB scheme would be a very good investment in financial terms. There are 2 inhibiting factors as regards the DFRB scheme. One is the old idea Which still pervades the repatriation system tain extent, and that is that the country should be generous only to those members of the forces who during a time of hostilities have engaged in overseas service for the duration. The whole of the schemes of war service homes and the Repatriation Department are geared to overseas active service for the duration of a war. Tliere are not likely to be any further wars in the lifetime of any members of the armed forces now. There is not likely to be any overseas active service for any members of the present armed forces in Australia. Therefore we can envisage that the Repatriation Departments activities-al l its skills-wil l gradually wither. Already the repatriation hospitals are substantially geriatric centres. What we ought to do is to see that all the health and welfare facilito be shelved once again. ties of the Repatriation Department and the facilities of the War Service Homes Division are made available for people who are already serving, and they should be made available at least to those who have received an honourable discharge. The other inhibiting factor is that the Public Service, particularly the Treasury, persists in equating the peacetime Army to the Commonwealth Public Service. The great difference is that public servants serve until they are 65 or, if they wish, they can get out without loss of benefits at 60. There are very few people indeed in the armed forces who can serve until they are 60. It is only 3 star men who can serve until then. Most men get out when they are in the 30s at the latest. Some stay on to the 40s, a very few senior men in the 50s. Therefore people in the armed forces serve for a very much shorter period than the period people will serve in the Public Service, If we are to get people to serve in an essential occupation like the armed Services during peacetime we must ensure that at the time they go back to civilian life and set up a new career they will not be disadvantaged compared with their contemporaries in age. One of the means by which we can ensure that they are not disadvantaged is by the DFRB scheme. If we equate the DFRB scheme to the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund or Provident Fund we are disadvantaging the armed forces as a whole; we are losing the investment that the country puts into the armed forces. I am putting it purely in material terms. We must consider also that we are unfair to the men and their families who choose to serve voluntarily during some of their prime years of life in this essential occupation. There are very great disadvantages for people in the armed forces, particularly for their families, and we should not be grudging in seeing that our Commonwealth institutions, schemes and funds are promptly adapted to encourage people to enlist and to re-engage and to serve in the armed forces. The DFRB scheme has been the subject of investigation by one of the most high powered joint committees that this Parliament has ever set up, and now on the last day of the Parliament we find that its unanimous report, which has never been criticised in the Parliament, is Motion (by Mr Giles) put: That the debate be now adjourned.

I ask him: Is this a clumsy attempt to ensure that this debate will not come on again and, secondly, is it a clumsy attempt to avoid a vote on pensions? Report and Ministerial Statement leave-Fo r the information of honourable members. I present a report on the fourth quinquennial investigation as at 30th June 1969 into the state of sufficiency of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund. As announced by the Prime Minister( Mr operate from lst October 1972 could McMahon) in his statement on defence forces retirement benefits, I have received from the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Board, in accordance with section 22(4) of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act, a report on the results of the fourth quinquirmial investigation of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund for the period lst July 1964 to 30th June 1969. The Board forwarded with its report the related report by the Commonwealth Actuary submitted to the Board in terms of section 22(3) of the Act. Briefly, the investigation disclosed that, ing me to make this statement. Yesterday in respect of pre-1959 entrants-that is, those members who commenced contributing on a unit of pension basis before Hth December 1959-ther e was an available surplus as at 30th June 1969 of approximately $14.9m of which $3.1m is attributable to pensioners and $ 11.8m attributable to contributors. It also discloses that the rates of contribution for additional benefits arising after 30th June 1969 could be reduced for this group of contributors. On the other hand, the investigation disclosed that, in respect of post-1959 entrants-that is, those members who commenced contributing on or after 14th December 1959there was at 30th June 1969 a small deficiency of $544,000. No change in contribution rates of post-1959 members has been recommended. In its report to me, the Board has emphasised that the results disclosed by the investigation, the availability of surplus assets and the order of any deficiency are only valid while the DFRB scheme continues in its present form. This is because the valuation is on the basis of the details of contributors and pensioners at 30th June 1969 and according to the rates of contribution and benefits which applied at the time of the investigation. Thus, the surplus of Si4.9m and the deficiency of $544,000 depend on the continuation into the future of the existing scheme. It follows, therefore, that if any of the conditions and assumptions taken into account by the Actuaiy are varied, the conclusions he has reached as to the liabilities and assets of the Fund would need to be revised. The changes in the DFRB scheme that the Prime Minister has announced will affect the outcome of the investigation. In the circumstances I am asking the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Board to take into account the changed situation and submit a further report. Ministerial Statement leave I thank the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) for the cooperation he has extended to me in allowI said that I was examining the question whether the Insurance Bill and its companion, the Insurance (Deposits) Bill, should be brought on for debate with a view to their passage during the present session. I have come to the conclusion that it would not be proper to rush these Bills through Parliament. I am satisfied that there has not been sufficient time since the Bills were introduced on 28th September for honourable members and the public to give them the mature consideration which they deserve. The Insurance Bill contains 119 tightly drafted clauses and 2 schedules, the second of which contains more than 6 pages of fine print.

146,Mr Snedden (Bruce,"Treasurer)-b yobligations to be placed on all general insurance companies. It is long-term legislation which will govern the conduct of general insurance companies for many years to come-indeed , as far into the future as one can see. In ordinary circumstances there would be no question that this legislation should lie on the Table at least for several months before it was put to debate. On the other hand, there are good reasons for wanting to have the legislation enacted as soon as possible. There is strong public and insurance industry support for bringing general insurance companies under supervision, and enactment of the Bills would allow the early appointment of an insurance commissioner who could get on with the task of setting up the organisation which will be needed to administer the legislation. Even that would take some period of time to be put into effect. It could not be done within a matter of weeks. It would take much longer than that. In order to form a view on the proper course to take, I invited senior representatives of the insurance industry to Canberra yesterday for discussions. My purpose in the discussions was to test the practicability of several courses which might be taken-for example, to pass the legislation now with the omission of one or two sections or to pass the legislation now on the understanding that some parts or sections of it would not be brought into force until there had been an opportunity to give full consideration to suggested amendments. The representatives who took part in the discussions explained that although they had not had time to consult all the members of their organisations they believed-and I accept that-that their views are shared by their members. The member companies are companies of all sizes, large, medium and small, belonging to the main insurance organisations in Australia. Most importantly from my point of view, the representatives who took part in the discussions are among the few people apart from my officers who, as yet, have been able to study and comprehend the contents of the Bill. There is a possible risk that, if some of analysis or a summary of what the insurthe suggested amendments were not adopted, the legislation would bear more heavily on the medium and small companies than on the large insurance companies. So far no comments have been received from those outside the insurance organisations who could have interests, such as legal bodies, accountants, insurers not members of the established organisations, and members of the public at large. Considering the length and complexity of the legislation, the number of questions raised so far is remarkably small. This may, however, be due to the expectation of many people that there would be more time in which to put forward their points than there would be if we went on with the Bill now. After talking to the insurance industry representatives I have concluded that there are several matters which should have further consideration and that this could not be done quickly. I am also satisfied that it would not be possible to overcome the problems by alternative methods such as those I have mentioned, of passing part only of the Bill, because it is so inextricably interrelated in its drafting. For those reasons, unfortunately, I cannot recommend to the House that we go on with the debate with a view to passing the legislation. This matter has caused me very great concern, but I believe that 2 public interests are involved. On balance, I have been forced to the conclusion that it would be better to defer this legislation. I present the following paper: General Insurance Legislation-Ministeria l Statement, 26 October 1972. Motion (by Mr Chipp) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. very grateful to the shadow Treasurer, the honourable senator for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), and to the Leader of the House( Mr Chipp), for givbg me the opportunity to reply briefly to the statement. I deplore the failure of the Government to give policy holders in particular and the industry generally the protection that they deserve. The failure of the Government to act is totally inexcusable. I raised this matter 2 i years ago. I have relentlessly pursued the issue ever since. Eighteen months ago the Government received a working paper from the Australian Insurance Association Which was an ance industry wanted in terms of regulations. As I understand it, the. analysis was based on surveys that were carried out throughout the world.",46,General Insurance Legislation
147,Mr Jacobi (Hawker) (12.45),"I amSeven months ago the Government seconded a Miss Rowena Armstrong from Melbourne as a parliamentary counsel. She is one of the best in Australia and the most competent person on company law legislation. That was 7 months ago. In the intervening period numerous discussions have taken place between officials of the Department of the Treasury and representatives of the ALA. In my view, there was no excuse at all for this delay. It is true, as the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) said, that we were given the opportunity of discussing the complexities of this Bill a week ago. My analysisI am not breaking any confidences at all-is that there were several provisions of this Bill about which the Australian Insurance Association was concerned. I raised one of these matters. I have come to the conclusion that, even with amendments, the Bill could have passed through this House. In my view, insurance companies are notorious for wanting to act free of any regulation at all. I will venture to suggest that, despite what any government does, they will continually try to ward off this legislation. Nobody will convince me that the woman seconded by this Parliament did not go through the ramifications of the Bill with representatives of either the Treasurer or the insurance industry. Let me give a classic example to the Minister of exactly what happens in the insurance field. I want to quote from the 'Sunday Times' of 7th March 1971. An article headed The Watchdogs that didn't Bark' read as follows: The Board of Trade's position It is now the Department of Trade and Industryhas been unhappy throughout. Basically, the department has been defeated 3 times: By the British Insurance Association, by the 1967 Companies Act, and by its own senior civil servants. As a regulatory body, the Board of Trade always left much to be desired. In July, 1966 for instance-a t Ihe time of Emil Savundra's great Fire, Auto and Marine crash-the relevant section of the Ministry, the Insurance and Companies Department, bad just 17 people, some of these part-time, to oversee the whole insurance industry Their powers, too were strictly limited. The 1967 Companies Act, with its special section on insurance, was presented as a partial remedy, ln fact, in the year's negotiations which led up to the Act, the civil servants were outmanoeuvred by the industry. The BIA, fighting the 1967 Act the whole way, rejected the compromise proposal put forward by the Board of Trade. The civil servants wanted spcial companies to be set up to handle all British consumer insurance. These alone would be subject torigorousinspections. The rest of the industry-mternationa l business, for example-coul d go scot free. The BIA, rejecting such tight control, shrewdly opted for looser sanctions over the whole industry. I venture to suggest that we will face exactly the same situation. If there is one thing which this Government has it is the constitutional power to act in this field. What the public wants and what I am equally interested in is protection of the policy holders and the public interest. If this Government fails to act decisively, as it ought to have done, more policy holders will suffer untold hardship and up to date tens of thousands have been involved. I just want to pass one more simple observation. I think the whole of the provisions of the legislation at the moment are built around the question of solvency, as they ought to be, and this is where the danger Jay in respect of the last 14 companies which went into liquidation. But there are several anomalies in this current legislation. Certainly this Government will not act but after the election, when there is a change in government, we certainly will. Despite what the insurance companies may think the following provisions, in my view, ought to go into the Bill: Firstly, there ought to be notifications to the Commissioner of changes in directors. There ought to be a tribunal set up to test the competence of directors, as is provided in the United Kingdom Act. There is no such provision in this Bill, and I believe it would be unacceptable to insurance companies. Let me quote an instance which points to the need for such a tribunal. The inquiry held in Melbourne by Mr Dawson, QC., into East Australian Insurance Co. Ltd proved beyond doubt, in my view, that the directors of that company should never ever be given the right to sit as a board of directors. Another provision of importance to the people of this country is inclusion in the Bill of pro forma schedules which would give basic minimum rights to policy holders. Another provision of importance would be to have some regulatory powers, which insurance brokers want, because recently in Sydney a large company dismissed over 20 insurance brokers on the grounds that they misled people who wanted to get insurance. As far as I personally am concerned, and I think as far as my Party is concerned, I can only condemn the Government for waiting 2 i years and until the last 23 hours of this Parliament to make a decision-whic h it will fail to act upon to give to the policy holders of this country, in the interests of the public and the insurance industry generally, the protection that they deserve and are entitled to under the Constitution. ritory) (12.52)I would like to say a few words on the subject of this legislation. Firstly, I would like to echo the expressions of concern that have been uttered by the honourable member for Hawker( Mr he has to go through arbitration. He is Jacobi) who has by his consistent efforts over many years tried to remind the Government of its duty to the Australian public in the field of insurance law. I think it is fair to say that Great Britain has had legislation of this kind since about 1877. Certainly there was a consolidated Act in about 1909. Britain had no more difficulties in producing that sort of legislation as a solution to the problems than we have. It is worth saying because it is a reminder to the Australian people of the. sloth, the inertia, the apathy and the couldn't care less attitude of this Government to issues of this sort. Insurance companies come and go. They fail and the policy holder is left high and dry to carry the burden. On the eve of the election the Government says: 'This is what we propose to do. We are a bit too busy to do it now. It is a bit too hard for us.' It brings legislation into the Parliament in the hope that it will fool the people and does not proceed with it. That is what it really boils down to; so I echo what the honourable member for Hawker said. But even within its limited framework, this legislation it does not go far enough. It is restricted to the solvency problem, the security problem of insurance companies. Surely it is time that the problem was taken further. It is a myth, a fiction, to say tyres had nothing to do with the cause of that there is freedom of contract between the person who fills out a proposal form for the purpose of taking out insurance and the insurance company. This has been stated by academics and by writers on the subject for many years but apparently this Government does not know about it. Even the insurance company representative who fills in the proposal form is deemed by fiction to be the person's representative and not the company's representative. From the use of this standard form which the companies employ and which does not give equality of bargaining power between the company and the individual all sorts of unfair situations result. Anyone who has had experience of the courts will know that if there is a dispute between an insurance company and a policy holder the policy holder is required virtually by what is called a Scot and Avery clause to submit the matter to arbitration first. He cannot get to the courts because required to do so and this is insisted upon by the company. This causes delay and puts him to expense. All too often, in fact frequently, he is denied this opportunity because he cannot really afford to go through the arbitration process. Surely it is time that we gave serious consideration to making the Scot and Avery clause invalid and not permissible to be put into insurance, policies. 1 also want to echo what the honourable member for Hawker touched on when he said that some minimum standard terms should be written into all policies to take account of the fact that at the moment they are unfair. There should be a schedule which ensures that in every policy there are minimum terms which ensure fairness between the policy holder and the company and neither can contract out of them. For example, if a person drives a vehicle that is so-called unroadworthy he can often be denied his right to insurance moneys as a result of an accident claim. I know of cases where a car said to have had smooth tyres was involved in an accident which took place during dry weather and although the existence, of the smooth tyres had nothing whatever to do with the accident the insurance company said: 'Ah, ha-smoot h tyres.' Although the smooth the accident because the vehicle had been run into by another car, the. company said: 'We will deny liability.' It paid nothing. That sort of situation should not be permitted. Another example that one could give is the case of a person involved in an accident and it may be said that although it was not his fault he was under the. influence of intoxicating liquor. I know it",47,General Insurance Legislation
148,Mr Enderby (Australian Capital Ter,"Is an emotional term but there are situations in which a driver under the influence of intoxicating liquor when driving a car can properly be the subject of action under the criminal law, even though he did not cause the accident the insurance company will repudiate liability. That sort of situation should not be permitted to exist. Cases involving unroadworthy vehicles and drivers under the influence of liquor should properly be a matter for the. criminal law. They should not be allowed to have a place so that insurance companies can repudiate liability when these things do not contribute to damage at all. One could go on and give plenty of excuses which are used by insurance companies. But the reality of it is this: If the Government suggests that there is a mutual meeting of minds between the person who fills in the proposal form and the insurance company, then J suggest that this theory went out virtually in the. 18th century.

Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. be a convenient time to suspend the sitting. I could make the statement when it is resumed. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) at question time this morning asked me a question regarding unemployment benefit for certain people at Warburton. Subsequently he was good enough to supply me with the names of the persons he had in mind. I looked into the matter and I now with me. I find that the action taken by my Department in this case was quite reasonable. The people concerned were living in a group of approximately 12 persons under the control of a married couple. I must say that the departmental note in regard to their living conditions is that the place was well run. There is no complaint in that regard. The members of the group were interviewed and the report of that interview reads: Each member of the group expressed the same ideals, i.e. communal living and assisting the group as a whole, together with a desire to escape our type of existence and establish cottage industries in a rural setting. A perusal of the benefit papers would seem to indicate that most of these people are either voluntarily unemployed or unemployed through misconduct. Hie report continues: Indeed, they could be accepted as having deliberately placed themselves in a situation where they would be unlikely to obtain work. It is felt that a group of people having no means of transport who move into a remote aTea where there is little chance of employment in order to set up their own community could hardly be accepted as having taken reasonable steps to obtain work. These people are not long term residents of the area. They are people who went into that isolated area voluntarily. I am not in any way trying to criticise their decision to do this. They have a perfect right to do this if they feel so inclined but, having done this, they do not have a right to claim the unemployment benefit. I think my Department is perfectly right in refusing them the unemployment benefit under these circumstances. They were not taking reasonable steps to obtain work. I am not trying to pass any judgment on their decision to retire from the normal life of the community and to try to set up on their own outside that normal life. That is their decision. They are perfectly entitled to make that decision. But having made that decision, they are not entitled to ask the remainder of the community to assist them with the unemployment benefit. In my view the honourable member for Melbourne PortsI was about to say that I am perfectly certain, but I am not-woul d not have taken up this case had he been aware of the circumstances, because I do not think he would irresponsibly want to have the departmental file advocate this kind of case Where the advocacy can only have the result of prejudicing people who are properly eligible for the unemployment benefit and who may need it.

152,Mr Wentworth,"The honourableflexible and humane in the administration of the Act, but when people endeavour to do things which are obviously outside the ambit of the Act and which make them ineligible for the benefit and then find members of the Opposition in this House can take up their cause, it prejudices the position of those who are genuinely entitled to the benefit and whom we want to help. Leaving that matter aside, I would like to make a remark or two about the case brought to my notice this morning by the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Melbourne where the metropolis merges or Griffiths). I would not do this if it were not the last sitting day of this House. When I resume my seat I will be very happy to show the honourable member the relevant file so that he may peruse it with me. I think that in this case also the decision of my Department was the correct one. I do not want to ventilate in this House more than necessary the private affairs of pensioners or applicants for a pension. I think all members of the House would agree with me that it would be wrong to do this. It is true that in the case to which the honourable member referred there was a divorce subsequent to a separation. When the divorce took place the lady in question became eligible for benefits, and benefits are being paid to her. From a perusal of the paper, which I would like to make available to the honourable member if he would like to see them with me, I am by no means certain that the desertion was without cause. In fact, I think rather the opposite is the case. I feel that in this case the decision of my Department was the correct one. I do stress that at the present moment the lady in question is receiving a widow's pension. I know that the honourable member for Shortland is a man of humane attitudes. I think all honourable members in this house regret that by his own decision he is shortly to leave us. I know that his attitude with which he has brought this matter to in regard to these matters stands out in advance of the attitudes of some of the other members of his Party who endeavour to use the pensioner issue purely for party political reasons. For example, I cannot help remembering the incident when the honourable member for Shortland had the courage to stand up in this House and say that his Leader had referred to kindness to pensioners as feather bedding. My Department and I do not talk about feather bedding pensioners. We try to give every pensioner what he is entitled to. I know that the honourable member for Shortland, who shortly, I regret, will be leaving us, by his attitude and his remarks in this House, has shown himself to be of a humane disposition. I acknowledge this and I will be very pleased to discuss with him the file in question at a later hour this day. leave I wish to make a short statement on the same matter. In the outer areas of submerges pretty easily into the countryside, there is the suggestion that people cannot find employment. I am not confining this remark only to those people whose names I gave to the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) but also to those who are given to understand that they could find work if they were to shift their place of residence into another area. I hope that that suggestion is not being made in any sense. It is always hard even to make social and moral judgments in relation to how people want to live, where they want to live, and whether their circumstances are different if they are single or married. People are glibly talking about decentralisation, job opportunities and so on, but the fact that a person may be able to get a job at Ringwood, let us say, but cannot get a job at Warburton seems to highlight the very real difficulty. One of these areas is rural and the other one really is metropolitan now. Whether a person can obtain a job depends on his talents and his capacities. If a person was a timber worker in one area he does not want to be a retail shop assistant in another. AllI hope is that at least sympathetic interpretation is given to the word 'reasonable'. I thank the Minister for the promptness the House. I sought the tabling of the papers in this case only because all through my parliamentary career I have met with the type of case which is under discussion. The fact that the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth), by his own statement, has confirmed the correctness of the attitude of his Department, highlights, I feel, the very question that I had raised.",50,Unemployment Benefit
153,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports),by,51,Unemployment Benefit
154,Mr Griffiths (Shortland),"by leave I am aware that Commonwealth legislation does not provide for the payment of pensions to a deserted wife with children before 6 months has elapsed from the time of desertion. I am also aware that the New South Wales Department of Child Welfare and Social Welfare relentlessly has opposed the granting of maintenance payments to widows who have received consent orders from a court. Barristers, solicitors and legal fraternity, say what one may, have the habit of adjourning cases to prolong the hearing of applications for maintenance and orders, especially for desertion. While all this goes on, women with their small babies are left to starve. The other case I mentioned in my question was that of a woman who had a 2 year old baby and was 8 months pregnant when she came to my office a fortnight ago and begged for something to be done. She now has a baby one week old as well as the other child 2 years old. She is receiving $42 a fortnight from the State Welfare Department because of the desertion. The States Grants (Deserted Wives) Act 1968, I thought, was designed to help this type of case. But New South Wales in particular stands adamantly opposed to helping this type of woman. There are literally hundreds of cases of this kind. I realise that until the Commonwealth Government accepts responsibility for this type of case and dismisses the States from interference nothing will be done. I am seeking the tabling of those papers in order to let the Parliament see the Government's attitude towards consent awards. The lady of whom the Minister spoke lived with her husband for 3 years and had one child. Her husband virtually would not go to work. He would not get out of bed. Somebody offered the excuse that he had lost his mother and it had affected him. Nevertheless, his wife is only 22. She has had a baby and has had to live on only what her own parents gave her. The State would not give her anything. The Minister and all of us in this Parliahandle this case in the first place, because ment are culpable in relation to this type of case because while we spend hundred of millions of dollars to bring migrants here we refuse to look after the babies born of our own women. I want this problem resolved. This woman received a consent order No. D270 for maintenance. It was granted? There being no objection, leave is confirmed in her divorce on the grounds of granted. cruelty. The case was decided by a magistrate at Newcastle. The terms of the order required her husband to pay SlO a week for her and $6 a week for the child. But he paid nothing then and is still not paying anything. It is true that a pension was awarded to her from September this year, but she had to live for more than 12 months before this without anything. I maintain that she was entitled to something. I do not want to weary or detain the House, but I should like to have incorporated in Hansard a letter to me from James Grahame and Mitchell, solicitors, dated 4th August 1972; a letter from those solicitors to the Registrar of the Department of Social Services in Newcastle, dated 17th July 1972, and 2 letters from Department of Social Services in Newcastle dated 6th July 1972 and 18th August 1972 refusing a pension to this lady who now has 2 babies. I asked the Minister's secretary about this matter 3 weeks ago. James Grahame and Mitchell are pressing me now for a further reply. The letter from James Grahame and Mitchell to the Registrar of the Department of Social Services in Newcastle reads in part: As to the aspect of desertion, it would have been alleged by Mrs X, had the matter been contested, that her husband's conduct was such that she was forced to leave the matrimonial home on 19th January 1972, he having assaulted her on several occasions and ill-treated during the course of the marriage. We are satisfied that the allegations that MrsX made if accepted by the court would have been sufficient to ground an Order. As it was, there was an admission by the defendant that he had given the complainant good cause to leave him. In those circumstances we invite yoc to reconsider Mrs X's application. But the Department of Sooial Services again refused it and the matter is now In the Minister's hands. I appeal to him to do something about the Act in general and to take away from the New South Wales Department of Social Welfare the handling of this type of case. It was an officer of the State Department who asked me to he was not getting anywhere with it from the point of view of the Department.

Dear Sir, re MrsX We act for MrsX and she had handed to us your communication dated 6th July in which you inform her that her application for pension has been considered, but approval for payment cannot be given because it has not been established that she was deserted without just cause. We appeared for MrsX before Mr Radford S.M. at Newcastle Court of Petty Sessions on the 2nd May 1972, when Mrs X's application for maintenance was disposed of by way of a Consent Order. Such Order was grounded on the admission by the husband that he had left his wife without adequate means of support. As to the aspect of desertion, it would have been alleged by Mrs X, had the matter been contested, that her husband's conduct was such that she was forced to leave the matrimonial home on the 19th January 1972, he having assaulted her on several occasions and ill-treated her during the course of the marriage. We are satisfied that the allegations that MrsX made if accepted by 'he Court would have been sumcient to ground an Order.

Yours faithfully, James Grahame& Mitchell. 4th August 1972 The Honourable C. Griffiths, Member for Shortland, Hunter Street, Newcastle 2300 Dear Sir, re: MrsX Application for Deserted Wife's Pension We act for MrsX and on her behalf we obtained a Consent Order against her husband for maintenance at Newcastle Children's Court on 2nd May 1972. The grounds upon which MrsX made her application for maintenance were that her husband's conduct was such that she was unable to continue to live with him and when the matter came on for hearing the Defendant admitted that this was so thus grounding an Order. We understand that the Department of Social Welfare refuses to accept that the husband's liability has been established and has asked MrsX to obtain independent evidence. MrsX is unable to do this and we are satisfied on the instructions given to us that although this is a case in which, in the nature of things, corroboration of the allegations made by MrsX would be veiy difficult to obtain the Court would nevertheless make the order in her favour. We enclose a statement made by MrsX at our request setting out in detail the allegations against her husband. The red underlining and the notations in black ink were made by us in the preparation of the case for hearing. We also enclose for your information a copy of a letter we wrote to the Registrar of Social Services on the 17th July in support of her apphcation for a pension. The Department has informed MrsX that it requires her to obtain evidence from three people corroborating her allegations against her husband. In other words, the Department now seeks to try an issue which has already been determined by a Court of Law in Mrs X's favour, and apart from the impropriety of such action MrsX is unable to obtain that evidence without resorting to fabrication and such evidence would in our view not be required by a Court of Law if such Court was called upon to determine the issue between MrsX and her husband. In other words, corroboration would not be fatal to a claim in the Courts for maintenance. Would you please make representations on behalf of MrsX for a reconsideration on her behalf having in mind tbe matters we have raised. Yours faithfully, leave tbe matter at that because I feel that the Minister will handle it in the way in which it should be handled. Mr Wentworth1 shall be very happy to do so. Tariff Board Report toms and Excise)I present the following report by the Tariff Board: Pyrethrum. Ordered that the report be printed. Ministerial Statement Minister for Education and Science)-by leave-Pursuant to sub-section (4.) of section 24 of the Metric Conversion Act 1970-1971, I present the second report of the Metric Conversion Board in respect of the operation of the Board from lst July 1971 to 30th June 1972. I also present a report by the Minister as required by the Act. I should like to take this opportunity to say something about a booklet which the Metric Conversion Board will distribute shortly to every household in Australia. I should also like to say something about the progress towards conversion which has been made so far. The House will doubtless recall that the aim of the Metric Conversion Act 1970 is 'to bring about progressively the use of the metric system of measurement in Australia as the sole system of measurement of physical quantities'. The Metric Conversion Board appointed under this Act was concerned initially with planning conversion of the various sectors of the community and creating a general awareness of conversion. This phase is largely complete and the implementation of the conversion programmes is beginning. As conversion begins to affect more and more aspects of everyday life, the Board believes that it is now opportune to provide key information about the change to the general public. The Board has prepared a 16 page booklet entitled 'Metric Conversion and You' which it will issue shortly. It will be delivered to every letter box in Australia. The booklet contains sections devoted to every facet of life such as Shopping, In the Kitchen, In the Nursery, etc. It also provides basic information about everyday units. It contains simple charts showing the conversion from imperial to metric units together with tables to allow easy comparisons between prices for goods sold in imperial or metric quantities. It is hoped that initial distribution of the 4.3 million copies will start within a few days. However, it may not be possible to complete deliveries before the Christmas rush taxes the mail services. I believe the booklet will do much to explain the reasons for the conversion. It should dispel any uncertainty and apprehension about the change.It is a. booklet to be read for present information and to be kept for future use. I have arranged that each honourable member receive an advance copy. The House will recall that the decision that Australia should convertto thc metric system was made in 1970 following a very thorough inquiry by a select committee of the Senate. That committee reported a world-wide move towards the adoption of the metric system and in particular to the streamlined system known as the International System of Units. This move has continued and the present situation is that less than 10 nations in the world remain uncommitted. In the United States, a government inquiry recently recommended conversion over a 10-year period. Bills to give effect to this have been introduced in both Houses. The United States Senate, without dissent, has approved a Bill to establish a National Metric Conversion Board charged with preparing a conversion programme. It seems that within this decade the whole world will be metric or committed to the change. The Metric Conversion Board started by establishing a committee structure which has now been in operation for about 1.8 months. The committees have made excellent progress in developing programmes for conversion. These committees comprise nominees by leading associations and organisations in the country. It is pleasing to see the vigour with which they have approached their task. I am sure this House",52,Unemployment Benefit

Their wholehearted support in this operation augurs well for its overall success. After closely examining what metric conversion implies for their sectors, the committees have concluded, almost without exception, that the optimum approach is to convert as soon as possible. In this way it is hoped to minimise costs and gain more quickly the benefits available from conversion. One of the most significant of these benefits is the opportuniiy obvious direct benefits, such as in the for increased efficiency through rationalisareplacement of mile posts, would leave Austion of products and procedures. Only in special cases, for instance, where obsolescence is the controlling factor, have the committees proposed changes extending beyond about 1976; in the main they provide for conversion in the period 1973 to 1975. Many programmes are now coming forward. When they have national significance or involve Commonwealth or State government departments these programmes are submitted to me by the Board for my approval before they are finally promulgated. When they are of direct relevance only to the sectors of industry or commerce by which and for which they have been prepared, the Board approves of them and notifies me to that effect. A typfcal conversion programme covers the building and construction industry. This industry is one of the largest in Australia. Its conleave-When dealing with the Tariff Bills version will add significant impetus to the whole programme by generating a demand for materials in metric sizes. In all some 30 the situation, in a sense, with the converprogrammes have been completed and promulgated. Other major programmes which have been approved and promulgated include land surveys and titles; transport and storage; electricity supply and distribution; grammes, yards to metres, or gallons to and education, primary and secondary. Members will have noted that a number of significant changes have occurred already. These include wool sales in August 1971; State packaging legislation from lst January 1972; tariff schedules on 1st July 1972; horse racing on lst August; and meteorological temperatures and pressures on lst September. These changes have been quickly accepted and assimilated. The Board's overall plan has been to create an awareness of metric conversion and then, step by step, to involve the whole comconversion work she was able to do she munity in it. By their impact on the public, several of the programmes have helped that plan. I believe it is important to recognise that metric conversion means, as the Act states, the use of the metric system as the sole system of measurement of physical quantities. It would be a mistake to convert only those areas yielding obvious economic benefits, as in many branches of engineering and the building industry. To retain imperial units in other areas where there are no tralia with an even more complex system of units than we have now. It would withhold from future generations the simplicity and efficiency of teaching and working wholly in the best system of measurement yet devised. The last session of Parliament saw the introduction of amendments to convert some existing legislation to metric units. I refer to the customs-excise tariff. Similar amendments to some 110 Acts are required and will be introduced in step with the conversion programmes during the next few years. The Metric Conversion Act provides for the making of regulations necessary to give effect to the Act. So far, there has been no necessity to make any such regulations. I table the reports. Ordered that the reports be printed. yesterday I referred to the difficulties associated with metric conversion. I compared sion from pounds, shillings and pence to decimal currency. In that instance at least the units of conversion were relatively simple, but in converting pounds to kilolitres there is no exact conversion. I hope that one matter which will receive more attention than it has received is consumer protection in respect of the packaging of liquids and solids. I have in mind what are said to be equivalent packages but which in a sense no longer can be such. A lady mentioned to me recently that she had paid a certain price for a pre-metric weight packet of goods. A fortnight later she made her next purchase of the goods and this time the weight of the packet was expressed metrically. When she did the",54,Metric Conversion Act 1970 71
159,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports),"b yfound that she was really paying 2c more for the same quantity of goods. How the public is to be protected against that kind of thing is a very serious matter. I suppose that we accept the inevitability of the change and realise how foolish we would be if we were to remain the only country in the world using the old system. I must confess that 35 degrees to 40 degrees Celsius does not sound very hot to me although it is in the range of 95 degrees to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Many of us, in the face of the new measures, for a long time will make calculations to convert to the old systems. Yesterday we rather faceiously referred to the Caulfield Cup being described in terms of thousands of metres, and kicks in a football final covering a certain number of metres instead of yards. What people who go to hotels and ask for a pint of beer will do, I do not know. But if there is no exact weight conversion or quantity conversion there is no exact monetary conversion either. The usual practice is to regard the nearest half cent as lc. I hope that these matters will be taken into account by people who have the interests of the consuming public at heart. Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation [ present the report of the Committee together with minutes of the proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed. short statement in connection with the report. being no objection, leave is granted. Conservation Committee which I have just tabled is the second presented by the Committee in the life of this Parliament and represents the culmination of over 2 years intensive work by the Committee. The Committee was established on Hth May 1970 following the presentation of a great number of petitions to the House calling for a halt to the commercial exploitation of kangaroos. Since the Committee's establishment it has met 130 times, held public hearings on 50 days and taken almost 7,000 pages of evidence. It has undertaken extensive on-site inspections in all States, the Northern Territory, Papua New Guinea and Norfolk Island, during which a great deal of unsworn evidence and information was provided to the Committee. During the inquiry the Committee met a certain amount of criticism of its terms of reference which, it was suggested, were not wide enough since they confined consideration to birds, mammals and reptiles. Suggestions were made that fish and invertebrates, for example, should be considered, or that rather than looking at individual species an overall ecological approach should have been adopted. The Committee accepted that these views have validity, but limited itself strictly to the terms of reference although it did recognise that wildlife conservation has to be discussed in the context of the habitat which supports it. The Committee was conscious that in the time available to it a number of areas relevant to the iuquiry could not be investigated. The Committee believed, however, that on balance it was desirable to report now on matters on which final views were held, rather than delay presentation of a report until the new Parliament. At this point I would like to express the appreciation of the Committee for the technical assistance given during the early part of the inquiry by the late Dr F. N. Ratcliffe, OBE., a former chief of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Division of Wildlife Research, and to Dr. J. G. Mosley, Assistant Director of the Australian Conservation Foundation, wbo has provided assistance on national park matters. 1 would also like to thank all those individuals and organisations who provided information, evidence, and other forms of assistance to the Committee. The Committee recognises the primacy of the States in many of the matters being inquired into and this fact is recognised either explicitly or implicitly in the Committee's conclusions and recommendations. I would, however, suggest that fauna and flora should be regarded as national assets rather than those of a particular area or State and consequently I am strongly in favour of closer co-operation between the Commonwealth, the State and local governments and the development of a national",55,Metric Conversion Act 1970 71

In relation to other aspects of the inquiry, the Commendations which it believes will, in combination, have a profound beneficial effect on wildlife conservation and hopefully on other aspects of environmental protection as well. I would like at this point to refer to the optimum means to conserve them. In this regard the Committee, throughout its Perhaps the Committee's most significant In co-operation with the States the",56,Select Committee On Wildlife Conservation
164,"Mr Barlin, Mr Gale And Mr Richmond","into major problems of conservation which are beyond State resources; establishing guidelines for a co-ordinated approach to conservation, bearing in mind the impact resulting from the usage of natural resources; developing uniform policies towards the commercial exploitation of wildlife; monitoring the status of endangered species; and collating nnancial requirements of the Commonwealth and the States, and making recommendations to the Commonwealth Government on the optimum levels of financial allocations for conservation. The Committee, recognising the importance ol setting aside adequate and secure national parks as a wildlife conservation measure, has recommended a national policy aimed at preservation of all habitat types and emphasised the need for the Commonwealth to take action in this regard in its own territories. The Committee believes that the provision of adequate parks and reserves would be assisted if each State and Territory had an overall land use authority. Such an authority would objectively consider the potential of land for competing, purposes. The Committee, therefore, has recommended the establishment of land use authorities where these are not in existence. During the inquiry particular concern was expressed at the loss of rainforest habitat through clearily incompatible with conservation but it is ing for primary production and of waterfowl habitat through swamp drainage and flood mitigation programmes. The Committee has recommended retention of the remaining areas. The Committee has recommended that the Great Barrier Reef be set aside as a marine national park and made secure against mineral exploration or exploitation. Restrictions have been suggested for development of tourist facilities in this area. inquire into and report on matters of conIn order to reduce the alienation of wildlife habitat for agricultural development the Committee has suggested that the Income Tax Assessment Act be amended. In relation to the contentious issue of the effects of pesticides on wildlife the Committee has accepted the view that there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to indicate that persistent and non-specific toxic pesticides may have adverse effects. It has therefore recommended the phasing out of persistent and non-specific pesticides and limitations on the use of DDT similar to those applying in the United States. In relation to commercial exploitation of fauna an outline of proposed measures relating to kangaroos has already been made. Other exploited species include the saltwater and freshwater crocodiles and a number of parrot and other bird species. The. Committee has recommended control measures for both these groups. To indicate Australia's international concern in conservation matters the Committee has recommended international agreements with Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Japan concerned with migratory birds, and has recommended the introduction of legislation prohibiting the importation into this country of any threatened wildlife species or products made from them: The Committee has recognised that wildlife conservation is only a part of a much larger issue of conservation, and the environment and that retention of our environment is essential to man's survival, not only that of wildlife. I believe, it essential that we preserve for future generations our unique flora and fauna and also that we must be prepared to pay for it. The greatest threat to wildlife conservation is undoubtedly the destruction of its habitat for development of all kinds. Population increase and development are not necessarclear that much greater care should be exercised in allocating land for particular uses than is the case at present. During its inquiry the Committee became: aware of the very great concern of a large number of individuals about a wide range of environmental and conservation matters, many of them outside the scope of this Committee. I therefore support the creation of a standing committee of this House to servation and the environment referred to ir by the House. I would see this committee as a valuable asset to both State and Federal governments to which conservation issues could be referred to for reports and recommendations. I commend the report to the House. Dr JENKINS (Scullin)-by leave-The honourable member for Henty( Mr Fox) has just given some account of the recommendations of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation. At the beginning of my remarks I should like to express the great deal of satisfaction that I , and, I am sure, the other members of the Conimittee have had in serving on the Committee. One of the highlights of my membership of the Victorian State Parliament was my membership of the Statute Law Revision Committee and certainly one of the highlights of my first term in this Parliament will be my membership of the Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation. I think it is fitting that, initially, I should for the Committee to tread very carefully join with the honourable member for Henty, who was the Chairman of the Committee, in thanking the other members of the Committee for the work that was put in and not always in comfortable circumstances because there were a number of problems which required on-site inspection for us to really know what the problems were. The good humour and the real interest that was shown in these matters made the Committee a very effective one. Mention was made of the Committee's expression of thanks to various members of the staff-to our 3 successive secretaries, our Hansard staff, our transport officer, our advisers and so on-wh o made our task much easier. The assistance given us by Commonwealth departments, State governments and Territories administrations in our investigations should also be noted. They were all most co-operative. The witnesses who appeared before the Committee, whether they were academically trained or visitors from overseas or from a number of voluntary bodies, all tried to express their views with clarity before the Committee. Many members of Parliament, both State and Federal, assisted the. Committee at on-site inspections and in explaining particular problems. One of the very valuable submissions to the Committee was made by Senator Mulvihill who put forward a substantial submission on the subject of kangaroos. However, I think it would be fair to say that most members of the Committee have an uneasy feeling of dissatisfaction with the report, not because of the work done or the recommendations made but because of a feeling that the report is as yet not complete. Originally, we had hoped that our report would give forceful guidelines for many years into the future but, due to a number of factors, we were not able to attain this objective in the report which has just been presented. I believe that we should mention a number of the factors that prevented us from attaining what we had sought so that the report can be read with this in view. One of the great difficulties confronting us was the complexity of Commonwealth-States-Territories relationships. I include the Territories advisedly because they were in our terms of reference. As a result of this, it was necessary in the investigations that it made and in the recommendations that were put forward, lest States or Territories, jealous of their own. powers and privileges, be offended. If this matter was to be effectively dealt with under the existing circumstances, a large degree of co-operation was necessary. For example, amongst the Territories we visited were Norfolk Island and Papua New Guinea. In Papua New, Guinea we found that wildlife conservation amongst the indigenous people was a very important requirement and that we, as the Commonwealth, may have to provide them with a great deal of aid in the future. There was also a lack of comprehensive expertise in this field of wildlife conservation. We had many experts before the Committee but of necessity they were experts in restricted fields, and in the overall field of ecology no-one could give us the comprehensive expertise that we sought. I feel that the. actual, name of the Committee was in some sense misleading in that a select committee on wildlife conservation allowed a number of our fellow members, departmental officials and a number of the general public to feel that many things would be pushed aside, when in fact what this committee was dealing with was the relationship of man to his natural environment. I think members of the Committee appreciated this and the recommendations they have made have been made in this sense. However, the recommendations require a great deal of expansion. The problem of land use will be found to be particularly emphasised in the report. This problem must be faced by both Commonwealth and State authorities. At the moment, land use authorities are. in an early stage of development from the point of view of conservation measures. I emphasise that this question of land use is one of the very important factors revealed in the report. As has been mentioned, there were some defects in our terms of reference. Witnesses pointed out to us that we were dealing with fauna and not flora and it might bave been as well if flora had been included in the terms of reference. The Committee, to the extent that it had to deal with the habitat of wildlife, was able to make some comment on this. But a number of submissions were made by witnesses dealing with the conservation of flora which, because they were specifically related to that, could experts in Australia on these matters. Unnot effectively become part of the report. 1 refer for example to a couple of submissions we received in Western Australia on the question of the unique wild flowers in that State. These were powerful submissions on wbicb we would have liked to be able to make some recommendations. But because of the restricted terms of reference, we were not able to do so. It has been mentioned that a recommendation of the Committee referred to the Great Barrier Reef and suggested that it should be declared a marine national park and remain inviolate. Of course, the terms of reference really restricted our comment on the question of the marine environment and marine national parks. This was another limiting factor in our discussions. We were precluded from going further down the chain into the question of invertebrates and so on, which are very important biologically. I feel that we suffered somewhat oy the inclusion of the term of reference with regard to pesticidesI think this is being wise with hindsight-becaus e the whole problem of pesticides, once opened, became an overwhelming one. Another factor, or course, was the lack of time for the Committee in having to cover this vast task in a period of just over 2 years between other parliamentary duties. There was some lack of opportunity in certain areas we should have investigated. We were informed, for example, that the type of mining on Christmas Island is endangering the survival of 2 species of birds. We were unable to make on site inspections of this. We believe that this should be of some concern to the Commonwealth and that further investigations should be made and action taken. National parks and their management was another problem that was put to us. We found that while the consciousness of the proper ecological management of national parks is improving in Australia and there is a great deal of pride growing in the men who are employed in the national parks services, there is still a lot to be learnt and a lot of training to be done. A number of witnesses recommended that the Committee should journey to other countries where national park management programmes are well established. It was unfortunate that we were unable to do this. We were informed that there were fortunately the names we were given were those of experts who had already been interviewed and who admitted their own limitations in this respect. I believe it is most important in matters of this nature that parliamentarians, who eventually have to assist in making the decisions and bear the responsibility, should be fully informed on these matters. Therefore I think a great deal of emphasis should be placed on the Committee's recommendation that a standing committee of the House of Representatives should be established in the new Farliament to inquire into matters of environmental and conservation concern referred to it by the House. In this way the members of the House will be kept continually informed on these problems. It may be that the members of the House, for example, would have been better informed of the problems of Lake Pedder if such a standing committee had existed and had been able to investigate the matter. There was also some lack of communication with government departments. It appeared that a number of departments were involved in conferences with other countries on matters of conservation which, while referred to in some reports of those departments, were never in fact referred to the Committee. I come specifically to the recommendation. I intend to deal with these only briefly. One of the recommendations is for a biological survey. With the present state of knowledge of the fauna of Australia, a biological survey is of the utmost urgency. Information that is obtainable about Australian wildlife is scattered throughout universities, museums, institutes, zoological gardens, libraries and so on, and there is no collation. There seems to be no system or attmept comprehensively to cover the field. We have had very strong recommendations that a biological survey should be earned out. It will take a number of years to cover the defects in knowledge. If this is on wildlife. Here again the knowledge of to be used effectively there must also be a central system of data storage and retrieval for use by these institutions. That is another recommendation that goes along with the biological survey. Of course with this must go a Commonwealth wildlife authority. When one speaks of a Commonwealth wildlife authority it is suggested that we will have a bureaucratic, centralised structure that will be of little use. Of try to look at the complete picture I am course such an authority which is able to co-operate with the States and the voluntary organisations and institutions that already exist will be able to help us know more about this country we live in and the wildlife that exists here. It is not a task that will take 12 months to perform. It is a task that will last for many decades. With regard to the kangaroo problem, I think the Chairman of the Committee has adequately summed up the Committee's feelings. I believe that tribute should be paid to those members of the public who agitated so strongly with regard to the kangaroo problem 1 believe they were alive to a developing problem. That the Committee in its decisions found that in fact the largest species of kangaroos were not at the present time in danger of extinction does not in any way underestimate the value of these people in calling public attention to the problem. I believe that the interim report of the Committee on kangaroos has served as a timely warning and has set down guidelines which can prevent a real problem occurring. What we wish to see is some action on that report. With regard to national parks, there is too much tendency to talk in percentages of land areas. The areas for our national parks should be selected because of the characteristics of the habitat and the wildlife that live there,' not just because of availability of land. We would reject the idea that land that was found to be useless for anything else should be set aside as national parks just for the sake of having large areas set aside. This sort of attitude to national parks would of course demand finance. It would demand co-operation between the Commonwealth and States. It will depend largely on the type of biological and ecological survey that is held. Another term of reference dealt with domestic animals gone wild and their effect their effect is minimal. Everyone has a subjective feeling that perhaps he is damaging our national wildlife. Here again is a great source for investigation. Not only are we dealing with land use and with man and his relationship to his natural environment but we are dealing also with some of the aesthetic values for tourism, recreation and enjoyment of life. So if we sure that the House will realise the urgency for action on the recommendations of the Committee. There is a real urgency that these recommendations be looked at and acted on as quickly as possible; that we decide that members of Parliament shall no longer be divorced from and kept ill-informed on such important matters as these but that' they are very much within the province of Parliament and that we can become involved by the type of standing committee that bas been recommended. I hope that the outcome of the report will be a better understanding by the Parliament and the country of the relations of man and the environment in which he lives. I believe it is'an effective report. I regret that the restrictions and so on that I mentioned did not enable our Committee, which was willing to do so, to present the guidelines which would have served for decades to come. But perhaps a standing committee in future years will be able to rectify that. FinallyI congratulate the honourable member for Henty for the part he played in initiating this Committee and for the effective chairmanship and leadership he gave to the members of that Committee. the Joint Committee on Publications I bring up the Committee's report relating to departmental publishing activities together with extracts from the minutes of the proceedings of the Committee.

There being no objection, leave is granted. of its inquiry into the distribution and prictricted audiences. The Committee noted ing of Parliamentary publications late last year, the Joint Committee on Publications, having power to initiate its own inquiries within its general terms of reference, decided to investigate the publishing operations of government departments. In undertaking this task the Joint Committee has been carrying out its important responsibility of conducting a continuing Parliamentary review of the Commonwealth's printing and publishing arrangements. Initially, the Committee requested written submissions from seven departments which were selected as being representative of a wide range of Commonwealth publishing operations. These departments were External Territories, Immigration, Interior, Labour and National Service, National Development, Trade and Industry and the Treasury. The departments were requested to supply information about their printing and publishing arrangements and to explain such matters as distribution and pricing. Later, the Committee requested and obtained similar information from certain statutory authorities responsible to the Ministers of several of these departments. Witnesses representing the seven departments, several statutory authorities and the Australian Government Publishing Service were called and examined. From the written submissions and the evidence heard the Committee built up a comprehensive knowledge and appreciation of departmental printing and publishing. A number of problems and issues emerged which were common gated. The Committee found that most departments experienced production problems, mainly delays, early in the establishment of the Australian Government Publishing Service in 1970. But the Committee is satisfied that these early problems, which some departments that the Treasury prewere mainly due to initial inadequate scribed rules for the letting of contracts to staffing and other developmental difficulprinters other than the Commonwealth and ties, now have largely been resolved. The Committee found a wide variation of distribution policies between the departments examined resulting from differing objectives of their publishing policies: Some departments issue purely promotional material which must be distributed free, whilst other departments produce publications for more specialised or resthat these latter publications whilst placed on sale also have free distribution lists, in some cases quite substantial ones. It appeared to the Committee that a uniform or rigid distribution policy applying to all departments would be impracticable. But the Committee has recommended that all departments conduct continuous research into their free distribution programmes with a view to ensuring that wastage is minimised. The Committee found that the AGPS pricing formula for publications did not appear to be applied in all cases. The Committee has recommended that the AGPS pricing formula of 3 times run-on cost be applied uniformly to all departmental publications, except in special cases, such as maps. The Committee found widely differing arrangements for the printing of material for overseas distribution. The Department of Immigration has centralised its overseas printing in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom; the Department of Trade and Industry arranges its overseas printing in all continents; while the Australian News and Information Bureau has its printing for overseas distribution done mainly in Australia. Whilst each department gave apparent good reasons for the particular publishing arrangements adopted, nonetheless, the Committee noted differences of opinion about the advantages and disadvantages of printing in Australia those publications intended for overseas distribution. The Committee has recommended that AGPS undertake an in-depth investigation of thc overall question of overseas to the departments investiprinting with a view to reaching a consistent Government policy on favouring printing in Australia except where special circumstances make it advantageous to Australia's interest to do otherwise.

The Committee has recommended that the Treasury contractual regulations be revised with a view to raising the cost barriers governing quotations and calling tenders. On behalf of the Committee, I thank those departments and statutory authorities who supplied submissions and information to the Committee, some of whom went to considerable effort to present very detailed and well-documented submissions. I also thank the witnesses who appeared before the Committee for their co-operation and assistance. The Committee is indebted partieularly to Mr P. A. Nott, Controller, AGPS, and Mr B. P. Shurman, Director of Publishing, AGPS, whose evidence was especially important and whose knowledge and assistance were invaluable to the Committee. As Chairman, I desire to thank the other members of the Committee for the work they have put into this inquiry, which has fulfilled the need for Parliamentary scrutiny and oversight of the Commonwealth's printing and publishing arrangements. leave I join in the tributes paid to the departmental officers especially for the manner in which they serviced the Joint Committee on Publications. The Committee has done what many people would regard as innocuous work. It is not the most demonstrative activity of the Parliament, nevertheless it is an essential service that the Committee has rendered. I regard the work that has been done in reviewing the lists of free publications as of significance. Regretlayout of the city of Canberra and its environs tably it has been necessary to recommend increased prices in some cases, particularly for the Hansard service. In my mind one matter stands out. During the year the Committee has been most diligent in its endeavours to ensure that parliamentary publications are made available freely to the educational institutions. I was especially pleased to note that the institutes of short statement in connection with the. technology and the colleges of advanced education were to receive treatment by way of supply of literature similar to the treatment universities enjoy. I entered the chamber during the presentation of the report by the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Ballaarat ( Mr Erwin). It is apparent, as the Committee has mentioned in its report, that it will be necessary to ensure that stronger efforts are made to print more material in Australia than has been the case up to the present, particularly by several departments which I need not enumerate. Occasionally the Australian printing industry experiences difficulties and it is inexcusable that so much work has been printed in other parts of the world. The Committee has recommended that those departments which have been responsible for having material printed overseas should make every possible effort to serve Australia's best interests;I think that was the terminology used in the report-by having this work done in Australia. At the last meeting of the Committee today I told the Chairman that he had found his right niche in his parliamentary life as Chairman of the Committee. If he returns after the election it is quite likely that he will not be able to occupy tbe position as Chairman, that position usually being occupied by a member of the Government, but I have no doubt that in the event of his being returned to the Parliament he will continue as an effective member of the Committee making a worthwhile contribution to its work. the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory I bring up the following reports: Reporton proposals for variations of the plan of (Slst series).

The report I have just tabled, which is the 51st series of variations to Burley-Griffin's original plan as gazetted in 1925, deals with 12 proposals for variation or modification emanating from the National Capital Development Commission and the Department of the Interior. The Committee has examined each of these proposals which are described in the report and recommends lo the House that it agree to the variations proprogress sbould be completed and, in order posed. I should point out that the plan which accompanies the report refers to a 13th variation. This relates to an earlier proposal already agreed to by the Committee which was inadvertently omitted from the plan accompanying the 50th series of variations already approved by the Committee. It would be appropriate at this stage to pay tribute to the officers of the National Capital Development Commission and the Department of the Interior who are available to assist the Committee when it is performing this very important function of examining proposed variations. The Committee has followed a practice over a number of years of convening for the purposes of receiving a detailed briefing on the technical aspects involved in proposals submitted to the Committee. These sessions provide an opportunity to question the departments in detail and to obtain such further information as it regards as necessary. In particular, some mention should be made of Mr Westerman and Mr Price of the National Capital Development Commission who are the officers chiefly responsible for briefing the Committee, for their co-operativeness and the lucidity of their presentation. The second report I have tabled is a report that the Committee is unable to complete its inquiry into 2 matters referred by the Minister for the Interior. The report also makes reference to 3 other matters referred as subjects for inquiry upon which the Committee has completed its deliberais engaged in a very important inquiry into the proportion of municipal and State-type costs which should be met by the Australian Capital Territory community. Although it has made some progress with this matter, the Committee's inquiry is by no means complete. Secondly, the Committee has had referred to it for inquiry the matter of a statutory authority to administer education in the Australian Capital Territory. Again this is a matter of great importance for the future of the Australian Capital Territory. In recommending to the House that the Committee be re-appointed in the next Parliament, we have been mindful of the important work of the Committee during this and previous Parliaments. It is also our considered view that the 2 inquiries currently in to facilitate this and to enable any future Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory to take advantage of the work already done, we would recommend that the resolution of appointment provide-as does the resolution of the present Committee-that the Committee have power to consider and make use of the minutes of evidence and records of the present Committee relating to those uncompleted inquiries. I commend both reports to the House. together with minutes of proceedings, from the House of Representatives Select Committee on Road Safety, being a report that the Committee has been unable to complete its inquiry.

Since the commencement of the Committee's inquiry in May 1972 a large volume of evidence has been received and it is expected that more will be received. Invitations were sent to many groups and individuals whose evidence it was believed would assist the Committee in its inquiry. Many of these have already given evidence and/or provided submissions, whilst others have promised to prepare submissions. There was also a good response to public advertisements calling for included in Treasury Direction 16/9, have interested persons and organisations to lodge been set out in chapter 1 of the 141st submissions. The report I have just tabled is to advise years the Committee has paid particular the House that the Committee has been unable to complete its inquiry, and to recommend that a new committee be appointed in the 28th Parliament with the power to use the records of the present Committee in conducting its inquiry. I feel obliged to mention in passing the Report of the Expert Group on Road Safety tabled by the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Nixon) last week. This is a very extensive outline of the problems of road safety and I expect that the new committee will find both the report and its supporting documents of great assistance.

The 141st report which I am tabling today relates to expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for that year and covers the remaining items included in the Committee's annual examination of the expenditure results of departments. The 142nd report relates to the Treasury minute on the Committee's 124th report which dealt with expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the year 1969-70. In examining expenditure from tbe Consolidated Revenue Fund each year, the Committee seeks to ascertain whether or not the principles relating to the formulation of estimates have been adopted by departments. These principles, which are report which I am tabling today. For many attention to the estimates and related expenditure of departments. As a poor standard of estimating has wide ramifications, the Committee has concerned itself not only with excess expenditure charged to the Advance to the Treasurer, but also with the over-provision of funds. The Committee has made it clear that such overprovisions are undesirable, misleading and perhaps unfair to other departments whose financial needs might not have been satisfied. At the same time, the Committee has emphasised that it does not regard the total expenditure of available funds under a particular appropriation item as an objective to be sought without regard to other sary and uneconomic expenditure and can result in the distortion of administrative practices. In this regard the Committee has that have accelerated payments in order to prevent an appropriation from lapsing. As show, there are explanations for expenditure",64,Select Committee On Road Safety

The evidence also shows cases where failures have occurred in the observance of Treasury Regulations and Directions. Attention has been drawn to all of these administrative inadequacies where they have arisen. In connection with the one hundred and forty-second report the Committee has found it necessary to make observations in relation to 3 matters, the details of which are set out in chapter 3 of the report. One of these matters-the Bellenden Ker project -ha s caused the Department of the Treasury to comment that the approach suggested by the Committee would be contrary to the principle of estimating which the Committee has endorsed in the past. The principle involved states that each individual estimate in the Budget Estimates should be a realistic assessment of the sum expected to be spent having regard to the information available to the Department at the time of preparation. The Committee recognises that the formulation of estimates is, in large part, a matter of judgment, in which opinions may vary. In view of the information evidently available to the Department of Works when it formulated its estimates for 1969-70, the Committee felt, as a matter of opinion, that in the case of the Bellenden Ker project, the Department might well have deferred its request for funds. It does not appear to the Committee, however, that the difference in view which it holds witb the Department of Works on this matter represents an approach by the Committee contrary to the principle of estimating adopted in the past. As this is the last occasion during this Parliament on which a report from the Public Accounts Committee will be brought up I should like to take the opportunity of paying a tribute to Mr David Reid, the Secretary to the Committee, and to the very strong and hard working staff of this Committee. I should like also to thank the observers who have attended the public hearings of the Committee and who have helped us so much with our work. You know, Mr work done by our Acting Chairman, the Deputy Speaker, because you are a member of this Committee, that we are greatly indebted to the observers from the Auditor General's Department, the Department of the Treasury and the Public Service Board. As the Acting Chairman of the Committee I would like also to pay a tribute to my colleagues on this Committee which is an all-Party Committee of the Parliament. I emphasise that it is a Committee which consists not only of members of the House of Representatives but members of the Senate as well. As I have said on previous occasions, the work of the Parliament is like an iceberg; two-thirds of it goes on beneath the surface and this Committee is part of that two-thirds. It is a pleasure to be able to say something in the Parliament about the non-political nature of this work which is undertaken on behalf of the people of this country in relation to public expenditure by Government departments. With those few words I commend the reports to honourable members. Speaker, I seek leave to make a short statement. leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, the honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Graham), I should like to associate the Government members of this Committee with the non-partisan remarks which have been made by the Acting Chairman, the honourable member for AdeiaiJe( Mr Hurford). SinceI became a member of this Committee in this 27th Parliament we have had 2 chairmen. One was the honourable member for Cook( Mr Dobie), who is at present in the House sitting close to me and whose services as Chairman of Ihe Committee unfortunately were lost because he took up very distinguished service as Assistant Minister assisting the Prime Minister. He has been much missed on the Committee. The honourable member for North Sydney was appointed in his place.

I did not realise that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be occupying the chair when I was making these remarks. I think it would be very remiss of me if I did not mention the distinguished service which you have given over a very long period from 1956 to 1972 as a member of this Committee. As a member of the Committee for only some 3 years, I appreciate very greatly listening to your experience, your wisdom and your judgment on this Committee. I think we should also pay tribute to a former very valuable member of the Committee who is no longer a member of this Parliament I refer to Senator Dame Ivy Wedgwood, of Victoria, whom I have known since I was a Young Liberal many years ago. Dame Ivy was a member of the Public Accounts Committee from 1954 until 1971. I think Dame Ivy was one who, when I first came on to the Conimittee, made me very much aware of the extent to which the Public Accounts Committee was the watchdog of public expenditure. I think that one of the things that impresses one about a Committee such as the Public Accounts Committee is that one realises after one leaves this place, where we have our parries and our thrusts, which of course is quite right in a democracy, and where we put forward our different points of view, that irrespective of which Party we belong to we know we are all there to do a job. I suppose that the listening public who hear us speak in debates in this place on occasions may wonder how we can all work so harmoniously together on a committee such as the Public Accounts Committee for the good of the community. But this is so. I think it is one of the great things take any interest in the financial adminisabout democracy and about our parliamentary system that this occurs. It only remains for me to express my thanks and the thanks of the Government members on this Committee to the Secretary of the Public Accounts Committee, Mt David Reid, and his staff and to associate myself with the remarks made by the honourable member for Adelaide about the work which has been done and the assistance which has been given to the Committee by the observers who regularly come to Committee hearings. I thank all those people for making the Committee work so harmoniously. I have enjoyed contributing in what little way I could to this Committee. I feel it does a wonderful job. I repeat that we are all very grateful for the work done by the Secretary, Mr David Reid, and his staff. assisting the Prime Minister)I seek leave to make a short statement to the House. Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. Public Accounts Committee during the first half of this Parliament I , too, would like to join in the tributes that have been paid by the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Hurford) and the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Jarman). I should like to reemphasise to the House, which is the master of this Committee, that I would like to see in the future, as we have mentioned before, greater debates on reports that come forward from the Committee and a greater awareness on the part of this House of the financial matters that are discussed by the Committee. I hope that is something that we will see in the next Parliament. You, Mr Deputy Chairman, have occupied the position of Deputy Chairman of this Committee. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), who is at present in the House, is one of the most distinguished past members of the Committee. I hope that, with all the other reports that have come before the House today from parliamentary committees the reports of the Public Accounts Committee will not just be debated for the sake of debate but rather that there will be a growing awareness by individual members of what public finance is all about. Far too often do we hear criticism that the Parliament does not tration of the country. I regret to say that this is all too true. The tributes that have been paid to the staff are well deserved. The tributes that have been paid to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are very well deserved.

Question resolved in the affirmative. BILL 1972 Second Reading MrN . H. BOWEN (Parramatta-Minister for Foreign Affairs) (3.46)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill and the 2 associated extradition Bills, in relation to which I will be moving a motion shortly, together constitute the third significant legislative step taken by the Commonwealth in furtherance of its endeavours to combat an essentially modern problem, namely, the disruption of aviation by hijacking-o r air piracy as it is sometimes called-and the acts of violence that accompany the commission of that offence. Honourable members will recall that the first step was taken in 1963 with the passage of the Crimes (Aircraft) Act. That Act created the Commonwealth offence of hijacking in respect of aircraft engaged in interstate flights, aircraft, including defence aircraft, owned by the Commonwealth ind foreign aircraft that were engaged in a flight ending in or commencing in Australia. The Act also dealt with crimes committed on board aircraft engaged in interstate flights, in flights to and from overseas and, in respect of Australian registered aircraft and Commonwealth owned aircraft, crimes committed on such aircraft even if they were engaged in flights outside Australia. The law to be applied in respect of such crimes was the criminal law of. the Australian Capital Territory. In effect, the Act made aircraft to which it applied Australian territory for the purpose of the application of criminal law, the particular law to be applied being, as I have said, that of thc Australian Capital Territory. The second major step was taken in 1970 when this Parliament enacted the Civil Aviation (Offenders on International Aircraft) Act. That Act gave effect to the Tokyo Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts committed on board aircraft. The Convention established that, as for craft was the law of the State in which the aircraft was registereda flag law. The Convention conferred upon an aircraft commander power to impose restraint in cases protection of the aircraft or persons or property on board. It provided for the delivery of the persons who had been restrained by the commander of the aircraft to the responsible authorities at the place where the aircraft landed. The Convention imposed upon its contracting parties obligations to exercise jurisdiction over offences committed on board aircraft, the primary responsibility being placed on the State of registration of the aircraft. Machinery was provided by the legislation for the holding in custody and extradition of offenders. There was power also to return an offender to his home State or to the Territory in which he had begun his journey. Neither the Convention nor the Act created any new offence. Rather the intention was to ensure the expeditious dealing with offenders under law. Like all conventions on this subject the Tokyo Convent) >n applied only to international civil aviation.

188,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Cope),As,68,Crimes Hijacking Of Aircraft
189,Mr Chipp (Hotham,"Minister for Cusexcluded from its operation. The third step is the acceptance of The Hague Convention. This Convention was made at The Hague in December 1970 and is entitled 'Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft'. The English text of the Convention is set out in the schedule to the Bill. From it honourable members can see that the Convention takes the unusual course of creating in Article1 by, so to speak, international legislation the offence of hijacking. The offence is committed when a person who, being on board an aircraft in flight unlawfully by force, threat or any otber form of intimidation, seizes or exercises control of the aircraft or attempts to perform any such act. An accomplice on iboard such aircraft also commits the offence. Hijacking is generally accepted as a word descriptive of the offence. By Article2 each contracting State is obliged to make the offence punishable by severe penalties. As befits its standing as one of the world's principal aviation nations Australia took part in the formation of The Hague Convention. It was signed on behalf of Australia in June of this year. The Convention came into force on 14th October 1971 following ratification by the tenth signatory state, the United States of America. The main purposes of this Bill are to approve accession by Australia to the Convention, to create the offence of hijackvides that the maximum punishment for ing in cases to which the Convention is applicable and to provide the necessary proConvention also requires its contracting cedures with respect to the taking of offenders into custody and their detention in custody pending a decision whether to try tbem or extradite them. There is also provision for the holding of a preliminary inquiry into tbe facts of a hijacking, as provided for by the Convention, the findings of which are, under the Convention, to be reported to other interested countries. The opportunity has also been taken, however, to extend the ambit of Commonwealth law in respect of aircraft crimes to some categories of offences with which the Convention does not deal. Honourable members will note that the offence of hijacking is committed in a number of circumstances which are set out in clause 8 of the Bill. The first circumstance is the offence to which the Convention directly applies and which Australia, pursuant to the Convention, is required to make punishable. The remaining circumstances are not wholly covered by the Convention but, in the view of the Government, are cases to which this legislation should apply. These other circumstances are: (a) the hijacking of an aircraft on a flight in the course of trade and commerce with other countries or among the States or on a flight within a territory, between two territories or between a State and a territory; (b) the hijacking of a Commonwealth aircraft, including a defence aircraft; (c) the hijacking of an aircraft of the government of a foreign country in Australia or on a flight commencing or ending in Australia; and (d) the hijacking of an aircraft outside Australia by an Australian citizen. Cases falling within paragraph (a) above would mostly come within the Convention with the important exception of a flight between places in Australia, such as interstate, by an aircraft registered in Australia. Cases falling within paragraph (d) would also be mostly covered by the Convention but the Convention would not cover the hijacking by an Australian citizen of a foreign aircraft in flight between 2 places both within the country of registration of the aircraft. The other provisions ensure that in conjunction with the Crimes (Aircraft) Act of 1963 the offence of hijacking is comprehensively covered. The Bill prohijacking is imprisonment for life. The States to establish their jurisdiction over 'any other act of violence' against passengers or crew committed by the alleged hijacker in connection with hijacking. Clause9 of the Bill therefore provides for the creation of offences arising from acts of violence committed on board an aircraft against the passengers or crew. The circumstances in which those offences are punishable are substantially the same as those in which hijacking is made punishable by clause 8. The clause therefore is not confined only to those acts of violence occurring in connection with a hijacking. It covers all acts of violence committed on an aircraft for which there may be no Australian law currently applicable. As in the case of the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963 the law that is made applicable to such offences is that of the Australian Capital Territory which has been selected as it is an area of general criminal law over which this Parliament has control. Clause 10 of the Bill embodies the obligation imposed by the Convention upon Australia to take the proper measures to restore control to the commander of an aircraft on which a hijacking has been committed or attempted. The remaining clauses of the Bill provide appropriate machinery for dealing with occurrences of hijacking and persons who have committed offences against the Act. Honourable members will observe that there is substantial similarity between those provisions and the corresponding provisions of the 1970 Act. Provision is made to ensure that any hijacked aircraft is restored to the control of its lawful commander and for thc taking of alleged offenders into custody or for their arrest. Where it is necessary for the facts of an alleged offence to be inquired into a magistrate is authorised to hold an inquiry and the Bill details the requirements to be observed and procedures to be followed in the holding of an inquiry. Finally1 refer to tbe 2 associated Extrasame way as the Extradition (Commondition Bills. The primary purpose of the Hague Convention is to ensure that hijackers are punished, lt provides therefore that the State in which a hijacker is found shall either extradite the offender or itself consider the prosecution of that offender. The offence of hijacking does not fall precisely within the category of extraditable crimes in our present extradition legislation. The2 Extradition Bills which I will be moving shortly are designed to remedy that position. With the passage of these 3 Bills Australia will be able to fulfil (4.1)-The 3 Bills before the House have its obligations under The Hague Convention and play its full part in the attempted resolution of a world wide problem. There is a fourth international convention relating to the safety of civil aviation, namely, the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation. This Convention was made in Montreal last year and was signed by Australia on the 12th of this month. Legislacumstances in which that convention does tion to enable the Convention to be ratified will be introduced as soon as possible. I commend the Bills to the House. This Bill, the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Bill 1972 and the Extradition (Foreign States) Bill 1972 are cognate measures. May I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure. Before debate ensues on the Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Bill it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering the 3 Bills. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you might permit this course to be followed. -I s it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 3 measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed. Mr N. H. BOWEN-The purpose of the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Bill 1972 has been indicated in my second reading speech on the Bill relating to the accession to The Hague Convention. This Bill will make the offence of hijacking an extradition crime for the purposes of the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act 1966-1968 and I commend this Bill to the House. The purpose of the Extradition (Foreign States) Bill 1972 is to amend the extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966-1968 in the wealth Countries) Act was amended by the Bill just considered. The amendment arises from the obligations imposed by The Hague Convention and the purpose of the Bill was explained in the second reading speech on the Bill relating to accession to that Convention.

190,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Corbett),,70,Crimes Hijacking Of Aircraft
191,Mr Charles Jones (Newcastle),"Foreign Affairs. I propose at this stage to content myself with stating a brief history of hijacking and hijacking legislation, and mentioning some suggestions I should like to make at a later stage in my contribution to this debate. The Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963 dealt with interstate flights, aircraft owned by the Commonwealth, foreign aircraft on interstate flights and on flights to and from hijacking. Australia, and crimes on Australian aircraft on flights outside of Australia. That was basically the outline of the first move in the direction of preventing hijacking. The next Act was the Civil Aviation (Offenders on International Aircraft) Act 1970 which ratified the 1963 Tokyo Convention which was adopted on 14th September 1963. That Convention dealt with offences and certain other acts committed on aircraft. It dealt indirectly with hijacksufficient justification and grounds for ing problems. It was not a specific antihijacking measure. It imposed on contracting States an obligation to establish within existing individual municipal legal framework, jurisdiction to deal with certain inflight offences and offenders. Although it dealt with the return of hijacked aircraft it pared to take strong and positive action we did not provide for the return of alleged hijackers. There was no separate provision making hijacking an offence. I now deal with the Bills before the House, which are related to The Hague Convention of 16th December 1970. This Convention represents the first specific anti-hijacking measure. It creates a new hijacking offence on a national basis and is based on the desire of contracting States to assure certain prosecution and punishment of hijackers at a time when hijacking is increasing alarmingly and when some hijackers seize aircraft and cause them to be flown to places where, for many and varied reasons, they believe they are likely to be immune from prosecution and extradition. 1 hope that the terms of the Convention will be adopted and acted upon by all the countries of the world. Close to the time of the Hague Convention there was also the Montreal Convention of 23rd December 1970, which was a further attempt to guarantee prosecution and punishment of specified in-flight offenders. However, as in the case of The Hague Convention there are still many difficulties in constructing an effective deterrent and preventive structure because of the diverse motives of individual hijackers, among them being the mentally deranged criminals in flight from justice who use passengers as hostages to demand money, and political escapees. These measures are some of the attempts that are being made to overcome this serious problem of At this point I should like to draw the attention of honourable members to the number of hijackings which have taken place during this year alone. Up to about September 25 aircraft have been successfully hijacked. Since January of this year there have been 26 unsuccessful hijackings. All told, 140 passengers and crew have been killed and 97 people have been wounded. On these figures alone there is strong legislation to be introduced by not only this Government but also by the governments of the world to try to combat this menace that exists in the world today. Until such times as governments are prewill continue to be subjected to hijackings by people who think they can get away with the offence by using the passengers on board as hostages to obtain money. If those people can be convinced that they cannot get away with it that will be the best result. I do not think penalties will deter them. I want also to draw attention to the hesitancy of the Government in ratifying agreements. The Tokyo Convention was made on 14th September 1963 but was not ratified by the Government until 22nd June 1970. The Hague Convention, with which we are now dealing, was agreed to on 16th December 1970 but only today are we debating the legislation in connection with its ratification. It was certainly signed on 15th June 1971 but it is the ratification which is the important part and that will not go through until this Bill is dealt with today. It will be almost 2 years since the Convention agreed to the terms that have been circulated and that we are asked today to ratify. It is just not good enough. The Montreal Convention was agreed to on 23rd September 1970 but it was not until 12th October, a few weeks ago, that the Government saw fit to sign it. At this point, on the last day of this Parliament, still no legislation has been brought forward to ratify that Convention. Why could not the Government have brought both Bills in at the one time? Just as we are supporting the Hague Convention we on this side would support the terms of the Montreal Convention or of any other convention instituting positive action to combat hijacking. In order to elaborate on this point I would like the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr N. H. Bowen), who is at the table, to allow me to incorporate in HanLIST OF STATES SIGNATORY OR PARTIES TO THE TOKYO, HAGUE AND Tokyo Convention (In force since April 4. 1969) State Afghanistan Argentina Australia Austria Barbados Belgium Brazil Bulgaria Burundi Byelorussian SSR Cambodia Canada Chad Chile ..

The table should give honourable members a valuable comparison between the attitude of the Australian Government to conventions and that of other governments in a similar catcomplete immunity. In the past hijackers egory. I refer, for example, to Canada, South Africa, United Kingdom and the United States. The comparison could also take in Sweden and similar countries. Canada has already signed and ratified the 3 agreements to which I have referred. I do not agree with the racial policies of South Africa but at least it has not been dilatory about the signing of conventions. South Africa also has signed the Hague and Montreal conventions, and most important of all, it has ratified the 3 conwas hijacked in the middle of this year ventions. Panama and other small countries also have signed and ratified the conventions. The United Kingdom and the United States have signed and ratified the Tokyo and Hague conventions and have signed the Montreal Convention. The important point about the signing and ratification of the Hague and Montreal conventions is that both the United Kingdom and United States signed them in 1970 and both ratified them in 1971. Both the United States and United Kingdom signed the Montreal Convention in 1971, over 12 months earlier than this Government saw fit to do so. In previous years with previous conventions there has always been a feeling that the Communist controlled countries have been reluctant to be parties to those conventions. However, it is obvious of the aircraft and saboteurs but also it has from a list of Communist countries which have signed the agreements that the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Hungary and countries like that are just as concerned about hijacking as we are. It is obvious to me that they have co-operated by signing and ratifying the various agreements. That should indicate to the Western countries that at least they are prepared to cooperate. On one point we should give assurances. People who hijack aircraft for political reasons and endanger the lives of passengers on those aircraft must know that when they are caught they will have to return to the countries from which they came. That is my attitude. I do not care whether they come from fascist countries like Portugal, Spain and Greece or from deterrent-as was done by Algeria-bu t the 20195/72-R-[119 1 communist countries. Although Cuba is not a party to the agreements at least it is now more co-operative than it has been in the past. No longer can hijackers direct captains of aircraft to fly to Cuba with have received some protection in Cuba, but those hijackers who receive protection there today are so glad to get out of Cuba and go back to face up to their responsibilities that they look forward to being deported. Whilst Cuba does not sign and ratify the agreements it makes things so difficult for hijackers when they get there that they are only too glad to get out of the country. I refer to an American aircraft which and flown to Algeria. The Algerian Government immediately returned the Sim ransom. I am not in a position to say what happened to the hijackers. They may still be in Algeria as free people, they may have been imprisoned, or they may have been confined in a political compound. At least an indication has been given to hijackers in the future that Algeria is not a haven to which they can fly their aircraft. I hope the incentive can be removed so that hijackers will not direct aircraft to particular countries. I think the havens of refuge are getting fewer each month. More countries are realising that it is a case of 'You today and me tomorrow', and for that reason they are not acting as havens. At the moment the Middle East is not only a real trouble spot for the hijackers ground problems. I hope in the not too distant future the Middle East will be able to solve its basic problems. It will not be easy but then a way may be found of solving the problems of hijacking of aircraft in that area. That is what we have to look forward to, although I do not think much can be done at this stage with the countries of the Middle East. I believe that taken overall we have to adopt a practical and realistic approach to the problem, even if it means that somewhere along the line we have to think in terms of the United Nations imposing sanctions against countries which are not prepared to return hijackers to the scene of their crime. I think the returning of the money is one",72,Montreal Conventions As Of September 11 1972
193,Mr Charles Jonesi Thank The,"main thing is to return the hijackers to the country of their crime. If that step is too strong to be covered by the sanctions of the United NationsI believe the airlines of the countries that are prepared to participate in these conventions and to ratify the agreements should at least discontinue air services to the countries that are not prepared to co-operate. I feel that is one other way of solving the problem. We in this country have been fortunate up to date and I hope that that state of affairs continues. We had a false alarm just recently in the case of an Olympic Airways aircraft which was on its way to Greece. I wonder whether this was a false alarm or whether something did happen on that aircraft. There are very strong stories to the effect that someyear non-parole period. What it amounts thing did happen on it. Mr Donald Cameron-Lik e the story that Harold Holt is still alive? could well be. But at the same time, people in the Greek community are concerned that there was an incident on that aircraft, and they would know more about that than the honourable member or I would know about it. All that people outside the Greek community can do is to take note of what happened and ask themselves whether the rumours are true or false. At least I hope that they are false. But if they are true we should ask what action we are going to take in the future to make sure that incidents such as this one which was alleged to have happened do not happen again. I feel that we can possibly take some action at our end to ensure that people are not forcibly taken out of this country on foreign aircraft by people associated with the country which operates that aircraft. This is a matter which the Minister for Foreign Affairs would know more about. The truth about this incident is probably in his little book of secrets which he will continue to keep to himself. If the rumours are true I hope that the Minister will be prepared to act. I am certain that the Minister, like honourable members on this side of the House, does not approve of what could possibly have happened on that occasion. The other incident I want to deal with me this was a serious offence. I would like to quote from a Press cutting of the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of Friday 28th January 1972 which states: Peter Pasquale Macari' Mr Brown' in the Qantas $300,000 extortion case-wa s sentenced to IS years gaol yesterday by a judge who said that the penalty for the principal offence 'was fixed long ago and is totally inadequate*. Raymond James Poynting, who stood with Macari in the dock, was sentenced lo 7 years. Judge Staunton said he was satisfied that Marcari had control of the disposal of the unrecovered $220,000 of the half million. I want to point out to honourable members that the judge has drawn attention to the inadequacy of the sentence. ' Mr Brown' was sentenced to 15 years with a 9-year non-parole period and his accomplice was sentenced to 7 years wilh a 4to is this: If these blokes are shrewd, and most criminals are, they will play it safe and calm while they are in prison. ' Mr Brown' will be loose once again in the community in a minimum time of 9 years and his accomplice in 4 years, and they will be free to do what they did on the previous occasion. 1 believe that the Government should be entering into negotiations with the State governments, if it has not already done so, to set down more stringent penalties than those which were set down on this occasion. I have been on aircraft on 3 occasions when, because of mechanical difficulties, the aircraft have had to return to an airport. On one occasion I was in a 2-engine plane which had engine failure in one of the engines and the pilot had to put down immediately. Fortunately we had just taken off and the pilot was able to put the plane down. I know that some honourable members opposite would have hoped that the plane would not get down, but I point out that there were other people on the plane besides myself. On2 other occasions I was on 4-engine aircraft which had engine failure in one of their engines. WhilstI had no fear on any of these occasions, one is still glad to feel the wheels touch down on the strip. There is very little risk involved in a 4-engine plane flying on 3 engines on a perfectly clear and calm day. But, as I say, one is still glad when the wheels touch the strip. SoI can understand the feeling of those people who were up in the Qantas aircraft which had to circle round with an alleged altimeter bomb on board which could have",74,Montreal Conventions As Of September 11 1972
194,Mr Charles Jones,That is right. It,75,Montreal Conventions As Of September 11 1972
195,Concerns The ' Mr Brown',"Qantas affair. Togone off at a certain level below which the aircraft flew. It must have been hell for these people. As far as I am concerned it should now be hell for ' Mr Brown' and his accomplice. But I do not think that the sentence impoed by the court is doing this. It is obvious to me that the learned judge g£ive the 2 men the maximum penalty that he could impose. We, the legislators, whether it be in this Parliament or in the State parliaments, should take appropriate action to increase the penalties and so provide a greater deterrent to the people who have this kind of thing in mind. It is pretty apparent that the Qantas incident resulted from the story contained in a book and film produced some time ago. WhilstI do not agree with everything that the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Chipp) does, I think that he, his Department and the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots made a wise decision recently in connection with banning a film which concerned hijacking and which some of us who were interested saw at a special screening at the National Library. I do not think that the opportunity should be given to people to form ideas of this kind and maybe commit these offences. We should not allow people of ' Mr Brown's' calibre to get their ideas from these sources and commit crimes and offences against the community. I think that the Minister is to be commended for the action he took in banning that film from being shown in Australia. So much for the principal Bill. We on this side of the House support it. The Opposition likewise supports the 2 complementary Bills which deal with the extradition of people involved in hijacking because it would not be much use putting through the principal Bill without also going along with the complementary legislation. I would like to say on behalf of the Opposition that we support the measure. Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect) {4.22)I would like to take a couple of minutes to raise a point that worries me. I am one of those who, unlike the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) who has on 3 occasions been on aircraft which have been forced to land and who has told us that he did not have any fear, has never been on a plane that has been in trouble. But I am always pleased when the plane on which I am travelling puts down. Having said that-and having established my credentials as a coward1 should like to raise the broad question of balancing the proposition of hijacking against the proposition of giving refuge to political refugees in the case of countries from which it is impossible for these people to leave without committing some crime against that country, by the definition in that country's criminal code or method of enforcing its criminal code. There is no doubt about how we should regard the hijacking of planes for the purposes of extorting money or for any of the other purposes that have been raised by honourable members from both sides of the House today; but I can see the proposition that people might try to leave the Soviet Union, East Germany or other countries such as these when there is no legal way in which they can do so. I am not an expert on enumerating all of the countries which fall into that category. But let us face it: There are many countries in the world today in which there is no freedom of travel or no freedom to leave the country. If a person who considers himself to be a political refugee has to take the step of hijacking a plane-le t us say a plane going from Moscow to Warsaw-becaus e he feels that this is the only way in which he can get out of the Soviet Union, and uses what we would all agree to be extremely unpleasant methods to force the pilot to fly that plane to Bonn, or some other city in West Germany or the nearest airport in a free country, are we prepared to say that that person is to be returned to that country? He has committed no other crime -and I emphasise the words 'no other crime'-and his basic crime, I think we would all agree, so far as his own country is concerned, is that he wants to leave that country without having permission from the state, wbich does not consider the right to leave the country to be a right of its citizens. I have grave doubts about this. I do not think the issue is as nicely black and white as people might consider it when they talk about somebody trying to hijack a plane and making threats. This often occurs with planes flying over the United States, which country a person is perfectly free to leave if he wishes to do so. In fact, as I understand it, the United States provides free transport for anybody who wants to leave and go to Cuba, provided he does so on a permanent basis. In those circumstances, if a person hijacks a United States plane and insists on being paid a ransom and so on, obviously that person commits a crime. The same situation would apply the other way around if the authorities in Cuba allow their people to leave that country. I am not quite sure what the position is at present make some criticisms relating to the time but I remember that some time ago Cubans were able to leave Cuba for the United States provided the United States paid what I will call a ransom payment to the Cuban Government. But the position is different in some countries. It is easy for us to pass this legislation because it really has no application in Australia. It is unlikely that any plane coming from a country where those sorts of conditions exist would land her. I just wanted to draw the attention of the House to the fact that I , for one, have some doubts in my mind when I hear countries which have a complete disregard for the freedom of the individual, such as the so-called Iron Curtain countries, making pious statements about signing conventions on the extradition of hijackers. As far as I see it, the proposition is a one way affair because there will be no political refugees who will find it necessary to hijack planes to leave countries outside the Iron Curtain to get inside the Iron Curtain, but there will be people who consider that to be a necessary means of getting out from behind the Iron Curtain. I felt that I should make that point this afternoon in order to indicate that not every honourable member in this House is in complete agreement with the proposition that if people leave some of those countries and find it necessary to use illegal means to do so-and , after all, whatever means they use to leave those countries will be illegalcovered the field. What is happening with they should not necessarily be treated as criminals and returned to their country of origin to be dealt with there. We must remember that they will be dealt with there not only because they hijacked a plane but alos-and mainly-becaus e they completely disagree with the political set-up in that country. MrN . H. BOWEN (Parramatta-Min ister for Foreign Affairs) (4.28)-in replyReferring to the remarks of the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones), I think there is a very broad band of agreement between us on the desirability of this Bill and of what is being done. However, the honourable member for Newcastle did that he said has been taken by the Government in ratifying some of the conventions. I thought I should make some comment about that. He referred to the Tokyo Convention of 1963 and to the fact that the Government had ratified that Convention on 22nd June 1970. I think that it is necessary to add that the Tokyo Convention did not come into force until the end of 1969 and, by world standards, our ratification was a reasonably prompt one in that case. In the meantime, of course, we had passed our 1963 Act which covered the domestic position. So, it was not as though we had left people unprotected while we looked at the Tokyo Convention and did not ratify it. That would not be a correct picture at all. We passed an Act in 1963 creating the offences and protecting the people. When the time came and the Tokyo Convention came into force at the end of 1969, we then moved to ratify it. In other cases, too, we have moved in this international atmosphere reasonably quickly. Australia is a country which does not just sign a thing in international affairs unless it is in a position to make its signing effective by ratification and legislation. I know that many countries do not observe this approach to conventions and though they can be found listed among thc early signatories, the conventions are not always found to be reflected in their laws. Australia believes that the actual protection of the people is the important thing and in this field our law has in fact substantially this Bill, in which we are putting into effect the Hague Convention, is that we are slightly extending the ambit of our existing' law. True, that is an improvement, but even before this the area has not been merely a vacant area in which people were unprotected. We are simpiy improving the position and I think this should be put into perspective. The honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) referred to a particular case. Let me say first of all that it is difficult to make exceptions because this whole problem not only relates to the violent acts, damage to property and injuries to people that occur in relation to hijacking; around the world, hijacking has now reached proportions which present a serious threat to innocent people travelling by air. Air tr.ivel around the world is now a very common and widely accepted method of travelling and this whole method of travelling will be under threat unless the nations of tbe world, acting strongly together-it will require action by all of them-preven t this from occurring so that hijackers will see the virtual certainty of their apprehension and punishment and so that there will be no refuge anywhere for the man who commits such interference. Therefore, it is a very dangerous principle to start suggesting that there should be exceptions While1 appreciate the points which the honourable member for Prospect put forward, f think that they are better dealt with in the way in which we can deal with them in this country, namely, by the nonreturn of an offender in particular cases. Our extradition laws, which would be the laws applied to the return of an offender to his country of origin, do leave some discretion with the Attorney-General (Senator Greenwood). especially the case of a political refugee or something of that kind, could well be taken into account by the Attorney-General in exercising the element of discretion that is left to him in giving effect to the extradition section of the legislation. 1 think that is probably the better way to leave it.

The estimated cost of the proposed work is Si4.2m. The Committee concluded that there is a need for the works and recommends that it proceed to construction. The proposal for the development of RAAF base at Townsville, Queensland involves the construction of new buildings and services and extension of a number of existing facilities to provide for the permanent location at the base of an RAAF utility helicopter squadron, the replacement of unsatisfactory technical and base support facilities, and expansion generally. The estimated cost of the proposed vork is $8m. The Committee concluded there is a need for the works and recommends thai it proceed to construction. The next proposal relates to the construction of Commonwealth Offices at Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. The proposed work is for the erection of a 12 storey office building of reinforced concrete construction, and incorporating air conditioning and external in situ concrete sunhoods. The estimated cost of the proposed work is SI.65m. The Committee concluded that there was a need for the work in this reference and that the re-use of the basic design of ANG House was appropriate. The Committee also concluded that the site was suitable subject to the terms of the lease of the site to the Commonwealth being finalised. This is being negotiated now with the Lands Board in Port Moresby. The Committee recommended that the work proceed to construction in this instance subject to satisfactoryfinalisationof the lease. I refer next to the construction of a new runway and associated works at Port Moresby Airport in Papua New Guinea. The proposal involves the construction of a new runway and associated taxiways, extensions and strengthening of existing aprons and taxiways, and provision of associated engineering services. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $7.5ni. The Committee concluded that there was a need for the work at Port Moresby and recommended its construction subject to satisfactory arrangements being made for the purchase or acquisition of the land required for the development. The Papua New Guinea authorities have already initiated action with a view to meeting this condition. The Committee also recommended that the land usage patterns in the vicinity of the airport should be controlled so that environmental problems associated with the airport development and use do not arise. Likewise action has been taken to ensure compatibility of aircraft operations and nearby land use. This is reflected in the latest town plan. The proposed airport development works at Nadzab, Lae, Papua New Guinea involves the strengthening and reshaping of the existing runway, construction of taxiways, and construction of new terminal complex, associated buildings and a maintenance complex. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $3.85m. The Committee concluded that there was a need for the Lae Airport to be relocated and that Nadzab is a suitable site for the establishment of the proposed airport, subject to satisfacto all Commonwealth projects. The Govtory arrangements being made for the purchase or acquisition of the customary land required. The Papua New Guinea authorities have already initiated action with a view to meeting this condition. In recommending that construction proceed, the Committee also recommended that land usage patterns in the vicinity of the airport be controlled so that environmental problems associated with the airport development and use do not arise. Likewise action has been initiated to ensure compatibility of aircraft operations and nearby land use. The new out-patients clinic at Greenslopes Repatriation General Hospital, Queensland involves extensions to the existing multi-storey administration building to expand the radiology and pathology departments and provision of a new single storey wing for the out-patients clinic. The estimated cost of the proposed work is SI.7m. The Committee concluded that there was a need for the proposed work and recommended that the works proceed to construction in this instance. 1 refer now to the construction of patients and staff accommodation at Kingsholme Rehabilitation Centre at Taringa in Queensland. The proposal involves the construction of a 5 storey patient residential building and a 2 storey building built over the lower floor structure of an existing quarters to accommodate live-in staff. The estimated cost of the proposed work is Sl.75m. The Committee concluded that there was a need for these buildings and recommended that the work proceed to construction in this instance. The proposal for a Rehabilitation Centre at Camperdown, New South Wales involves construction of a 5 storeyed building with facilities for physiotherapy, occupational therapy, medical attention, vocational and recreational activities, administration and vehicle parking. The estimated cost of the proposed work is 53,365,000. The Committee concluded that there was a need for the work and the site is suitable. The Committee recommended that the proposal proceed to construction at the estimated cost of $3,365,000. The Committee indicated that works should not be referred for parliamentary examination prior to cost limits being agreed and that stringent cost procedures should be applied ernment has noted these observations of the Committee. The next proposal is for the construction of Commonwealth office block at Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. The proposal involves construction of a reinforced concrete structure with load bearing concrete masonry block external walls. Air conditioning is provided and design of the building was influenced by the need to control sun penetration. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $ 1.25m. lhe Committee concluded that there was a need for the work, that the site selected was suitable, and recommended that the work proceed to construction in this instance. I turn now to the development of a jungle training centre at Canungra, Queensland. The proposal involves the construction of new buildings to replace temporary buildings and older, obsolete buildings now uneconomic to maintain, the provision of new facilities', and extensions and alterations to some existing facilities. The estimated cost of the proposed work as submitted to the Committee was $6.3m. In reporting favourably on the need and acceptability in general of the proposal, the Committee recommended that motel-style accommodation be provided for officers and senior non-commissioned officers at an additional estimated cost of $60,000. It is proposed to accept this recommendation. The next proposal concerns the construction of a telephone exchange at Sydney East, New South Wales. The proposal is for the erection of a self-contained Works Committee for investigation this building comprising a basement, ground floor and 9 upper floors to cater for expected growth by local subscribers, long line equipment, and facilities for the eastof the Public Works Committee as memern suburbs tandem exchange area to the year 1997. The estimated cost of the proposed work is S3.5m. The Committee concluded that there was a need for the new facilities, that the site was suitable, and recommended that the work proceed to construction in this instance. Regarding the construction of a telephone Queensland, the proposed work is for the erection of a self-contained building comprising a basement, ground floor, and 15 upper floors to cater for expected subscriber growth and other telecommunications equipment up to the year 2000. The estimated cost of the proposed work is Si0.2m. The Committee concluded that there was a need for the new building and concurred with the decision to establish the centre adjacent to the existing exchange, that the proposals to meet the long term needs of the expanding network are soundly based, and recommended that the work proceed to construction in this instance. The Committee also recommended that the Post Oflice should acquire additional land adjacent to the ne# complex to improve the setting of the building and the amenity of its immediate environment, including car parking. The Post Office has indicated that it intends to acquire this land when it becomes available. Any member of the Parliament or any member of the public would recognise, from listening to me for the last 10 minutes, the gigantic task that has been performed by the Public Works Committee. Its members are dedicated and at times they work on this Committee at their own personal inconvenience. All members of the Parliament owe them a debt of gratitude. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson) (4.48) I endorse the remarks of the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Chipp) concerning the work of the Public Works Committee. I intend to speak briefly to the project relating to the development of the Royal Australian Air Force base at Townsville in Queensland. By resolution of 17th August 1972 the Senate referred to the Public project at Townsville. It is now only October and when one considers the tremendous amount of work facing members bers of that Committee, quite apart from the work involved in looking after their own electorates, it is somewhat amazing that they have been able to achieve the results they have achieved. It is, of course, necessary that they do their work as members of that Committee otherwise they will be criticised in the Parliament not only by exchange at Woolloongabba, members of the Opposition but also by Government supporters for not getting on with the job of investigating urgent projects. It is clear to everybody that this is one of if not the hardest working committees of the Parliament. The proposal for development of the RAAF base at Townsville involves the construction of new buildings and services and extensions to a number of existing facilities. The work wil] provide for the permanent location at this base of a RAAF utility helicopter squadron, the replacement of unsatisfactory technical and base support facilities and for expansion generally. The work is necessary. It provides for an extension of an armed forces base and facilities at Townsville in that part of Australia which is vital to our defence. I am pleased that the helicopter squadron is being moved to Townsville where it should have been located years ago. The Air Force base is not a modern base in terms of time or of standards. The Army first became involved in it about 35 years ago when the Citizens Air Force was concerned with the promotion of aircraft activities. During the war, from 1940 onwards, when the Commonwealth became closely associated with Townsville, that centre was one of the most active areas in Australia in terms of attack and defence. It had one of Australia's biggest Air Force bases and it had the biggest concentration of American and allied soldiers and of small ships operating from that area. For national airport because of its facilities and this reason, of course, the Japanese its location with respect to the needs of the attempted to bomb Townsville.

I am pleased to see that the That, in the motion relating to the construction 'because the telephone exchange proposed",78,Approvals Of Works Public Works Committee Act
198,Mr Donald Cameron (Griffith),"construction of a telephone exchange at Woolloongabba, Queensland, be referred back to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works'. I have not come to this decision lightly because I recognise fully that the Postmaster-General's Department is faced with the problem of having this huge new complex completed by 1975. However, let us turn our minds back 2 or 3 weeks and recall the words of the Prime Minister( Mr spent approximately $60m on the building McMahon) when he spoke in this House on l l t h October during the debate on the National Urban and Regional Development Authority Bill. He said: It is the geographical distribution of population I say this with great reluctance-is so tightand industry rather than total scale which calls for our attention. Of course, he was speaking in a national sense, but I believe the same principle applies to a city. This new building which is to be constructed on the corner of Linton and Main Streets, Woolloongabba, will have a basement, a ground floor and 15 upper floors. Each of the 15 above ground floors will have a ceiling height of 15 feet 9 inches, and this will make the building at least 240 feet above the ground. From an examination of the Committee's report and of the evidence one can see that, in the construction of a building costing well over SlOm, the Department has been more fortunate than the average home buyer today because the outlay on land is well under 1 per cent of the total cost of the building, being some $75,000. As is shown in the report, the area in which this building is proposed to be erected is zoned in the Brisbane Town Plan as 'residential'. I know that those who oppose my thinking on this subject will point out to the Parliament that, on the lower side of Vulture Street, the area contains mainly light industry, shopping complexes and what was once a railway yard which has now been cleared for redevelopment. But there is no getting away from the fact that the rest of the area around the proposed building is residential. The Brisbane City Council-the Labor City Council-ha s to share the blame in Les Johnson) went to great lengths to crossthis matter because the Council's Planning examine, as did other members of the comAdvisory Committee has given the project mittee, on the question of parking facilities, its full blessing. The building is to have a which are the subject of part of my total duty staff of about 1,115 people, with amendment. I suggest that if the building anything up to 750 people being there at were to be erected in the inner areas of the maximum. The amendment I have moved makes reference to my opposition on the grounds of the inadequate parking provision. A perusal of the report shows that parking will be provided for only 40 vehicles on the site. If we speak in terms of present values without taking inflation into consideration, by the year 2000 the Postmaster-General's Department will have and equipment. The revenue from local calls and trunk line calls in the year 1990, taken on present values, will be well over $100m. Yet the Postmaster-General's Departmentfisted that it appears unprepared to take a proper stand in endeavouring to obtain more land which would be more suitable for this building. I point out to the House that, to a person living in the suburb of Kenmore, suburbs like Woolloongabba or East Brisbane are hardly worth consideration. But the people who live in those suburbs and who will live there have every right of call on their environmental surroundings. In the 1970s and in the latter part of the 1960s there has been an increase in the number of people who care about and look around at what is being done to the environment in which they live. Yet we are discussing here today a preparedness by the Public Works Committee to sanction the construction of a building that will go nearly 100 yards into the sky and that will be plonked on the south side of Brisbane where there is no other building of its type. All through the evidenceI would like to call the report the 'document of doubt'-on e finds that members of the Committee from all parties expressed doubts as to exactly what is being done. Senator Webster from another place said: It appears regrettable that in a residential area the Council has approved a 15-storey building. The whole document is filled with expressions of doubt as to what the Committee was about to sanction. The honourable member for Hughes( Mr the city of Sydney or Brisbane or Melbourne or Perth the parking would not be a governmental responsibility. But this i building is to be erected 1 miles to l i miles, [as the crow flies, from the city of Brisbane. Here is an opportunity to do something about parking facilities because with the proposed City Council plans to construct modern units the streets of East Brisbane will be clogged up by motor vehicles owned by the people who will work in the new building. If you live on the other side of Brisbane or in the outer suburbs this is not a problem; but in this part of Brisbane there is an opportunity to make a contribution to the quality of the environment by ensuring that conditions will be satisfactory not only for the people who will work in this new building but also for those who have to live near this proposed new building, and it is on their behalf that I speak today. There are some passages of humour in the evidence presented to the Committee. One environmental conscious member of the Committee cross-examined one of the witnesses in regard to recreational facilities for the 1,100 people who will work in this building. He asked: 'Are there any parks or the like?' The departmental officer answered: 'Most certainly, yes; down the road and around the corner there is a little park'. 1 point out to the House that this site is located on the corner of Stanley Street and Main StreetI am told that policemen on point duty opposite that little park are not allowed to spend too much time there because of the danger of contamination by smog and the fumes of passing cars. Yet that is the type of answer that the Committee was given in Canberra by one of the witnesses. Obviously the Labor controlled Council in Brisbane and the Government together are to blame for what is being proposed. I fully recognise that some form of building must go up but I think it is a fair question to ask: 'How can these problems which I have outlined be eliminated?' I believe that a greater effort should be made to acquire more of the surrounding land. The Minister will probably point out to the House that already 3 blocks of land have been acquired, 2 of which have been purchased from the German Club, and that the Club is reluctant to move from this area and that a doctor who owns a big property next to the site also is reluctant to sell. The people of Woolloongabba and the Griffith electorate are used to land resumptions. The resumption of property has been a feature of this area in recent years. The State Government resumed hundreds of homes to enable the construction of the new south-eastern freeway yet this Government seems to be reluctant to consider any sort of resumption in this area. This policy wil] mean a long term loss for the people on the south side of Brisbane. I would like to know the exact amount of money which was offered to the doctor and to the German Club for their properties, because everybody has his price. To take that a ster> further, I do not think that our cost of $75,000 for land on which to erect a building which will cost well over $Wm is excessive. We should be prepared to offer more if we are frightened to tackle the question of resumption. I notice that in the evidence one person made reference to 'dear old ladies'. No doubt this is an emotional point, because the only properties under consideration are those owned by the doctor who has indicated his willingness to sell-apparentl y at the right price-and the German Club, which I feel quite confident if offered a very good price would get out and build nearby. The crunch is that one of the departmental officers has admitted in the evidence that if more Iand were available the building would be very much different to what is proposed. He even suggested that it would be lower. The only hope of unclogging the streets after 1975 is if the Methodist Church is prepared to sell some property nearby and which, in the words in the report, we are endeavouring to purchase. If that does not come to fruition by 1975 we will have a building housing over 1,000 people, but admittedly no more than 750 at the one time, located opposite a cricket ground where Test matches and Sheffield Shield cricket matches are played which in themselves contribute to a great influx of vehicles at the time the matches are played. We will have a situation in which cars will push back right throughout the area. It is all right for people who live outside this area. But if the council proposes units of good style for this area surely the people who buy them have a right to expect that the streets will not be turned into parking lots because the Commonwealth Government and the Labor Brisbane City Council sanctioned the erection of a Post Office building on the corner of Linton and Main streets in Brisbane. I sincerely hope, without wishing to stop progress because I realise that we have to get on with this building, that we will have an assurance that something will be done. That is why I have moved an amendment to the proposal. Order! Is the amendment seconded? Mr Jeff Bate-Yes, I second the amendinforms me that it is generally 3 to 1.

Woolloongabba Telephone Exchange. The Or can any evidence be brought to bear that the project is a major augmentation of Brisbane's telecommunication facilities. Tbe existing facilities are fast approaching full utilisation. It is true, as the honourable gentleman has said, that this is a very large scale project. It is an extremely costly one. Of course, the capital cost of the building is one matter: the cost of the equipment is another. I cannot recall the cost of the equipment which will be going into this building, but sometimes the equipment in a telephone exchange can have a ratio to the cost of the building of 6 to 1 or 7 to I . Sir Alan Hulme-Generally 3 to 1. we know that there have been occasions when the ratio has been a lot higher. So we have a very expensive project on hand.

199,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock),,85,Approvals Of Works Public Works Committee Act
200,Mr Les Johnson (Hughes) (5.14),,85,Approvals Of Works Public Works Committee Act
201,Mr Les Johnson,"The Ministerexperts have considered this and have established that my misgivings are unfounded, and that they are not concerned about it? He went on at some length but started by saying: I could not say that we are not concerned. There are pages and pages of evidence devoted to this matter. It is evidence which was sought, I think, by each of the members of the Committee. In the report specific mention was made of the need for additional land. In one of its recommendations the Committee said: We were informed that as the opportunity occurs the Post Office intends to purchase adjoining property to improve the site amenity, and to augment the car parking area. Because the Committee believed that it is important to improve the bit more before they came up with half setting of the building and the amenity of its immediate environment, including car parking, we recommend that a more positive approach be adopted and that the Post Office acquire additional land adjacent to the new complex for these purposes. More precise mention was made about this matter in the recommendations. Recommendation No, 6 states: The Post Office should acquire additional land adjacent to the new complex to improve the setting of the building and the amenity of its immediate environment, including car parking. If the honourable member for Griffith is at all fair dinkum about this I think he would readily concede that the Committee was more than conscientious in its application to the problem. Let me tell him that if he thinks that the role of the Public Works Committee is to knock back every project which features some conceptual vacuum on the part of the Government, we would never build anything. There are very many occasions on which I disagree with the Government's approach to matters. Many of the 12 matters which are now before us, in my view, should not have come to the Committee in the form that they have. But I cannot spend my time as a member of the Public Works Committee knocking back everything the Government puts up. The project under consideration might be a rehabilitation centre, an Air Force base or an airport somewhere. We would have no rehabilitation centres, no civil airports or Air Force bases and all the rest of it if we knocked back everything that was not properly approached by the Government. I am very concerned that so many proposals are half baked and lack modern contemporary attitudes and thinking. So far as the Woolloongabba Telephone Exchange is concerned, it is absurd to have a IS storey building on such a miserable piece of land. The Commonwealth has a responsibility to set an example in relation to these matters, and it has not done it. Should the Public Works Committee cause great delays in telephone traffic in the State of Queensland because of that? [ think all that we can do in sweet reason is to say: 'We regard the site as insufficient and you ought to get more land.' This is precisely what we have done. After all, 1,100 officers will occupy this site. Mr Donald Cameron-If you knocked back a couple perhaps they might think a baked proposals. knocked back one proposal-the Woolloomooloo Commonwealth offices which was worth about $55m. That was another example of governmental stupidity. The Government intended to crowd into a little peninsula of land some 15,000 employees, which was the height of absurdity and the antithesis of decentralisation and all of the things we have been talking about. But how many proposals can a committee of this kind knock back? Wc do not want to cause the public undue inconvenience, and the public would be inconvenienced if we knocked back this telephone exchange proposal. It would be delayed for many months. The honourable member for Griffith would probably be the first to stand up in this Parliament-assumin g that he will be back in the next Parliament-askin g for some acceleration of the programme so that the people he represents can have telephone services. So that is the problem. I do not want the honourable member to feel that the Committee has failed to face up to its responsibilities in relation to it. The Government has failed to face up to its responsibilities. But this point has been made in the recommendations of the Committee, and that is why it is not necessary for us to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Griffith. It is true that land is available from the Methodist Church and the doctor's property. We were told that the Commonwealth has no inclination to acquire compulsorily any person's land, and that is a worthy",85,Approvals Of Works Public Works Committee Act
202,Mr Les Johnson,"-The Committeeobjective. Nevertheless, I think all honourable members will readily concede that the public interest is paramount. There have been many occasions when all of us have stood for the acquisition of privately held land because of this. I think the doctor has been there for a long time. Maybe the Methodist Church property and the German Club property are involved. A telephone exchange cannot be put up on any site. Regard must be had to the expensive cabling and copper centre, whatever that is. A telephone exchange has to go in a particular place, and this one had to go on this particular site. In the public interest we ought to acquire additional land, and the Conimittee has made recommendations towards that end. I want to talk on a number of these proposals. I would like to make some reference to the Royal Australian Air Force base at Amberley. I do not have to say very much about it because the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) has covered a lot of the ground. Sufficient for me to say that it is a very important Air Force base. Nevertheless, there are a few matters that deserve some attention. I think the point made by the honourable member for Dawson was that in addition to provision being made to accommodate the new helicopter squadron which will be based there, it is intended to replace the Phantom squadron with the F l l l C strike aircraft which at last is coming to Australia. I think it was ordered about 10 years ago and is now many years late. come in 1973-a t great expense. They will now cost us about $300m for the squadron of 24-clos e to $13m each. The price started at about SI.5m each. This purchase is called, is it not, Australia's flying opera house? However, the planes are coming and we are making provision for them, which is a very good thing. We were told that the Phantom, which the F ill is to replace, has been accommodated at Amberley in hangars which are of the igloo type, built during World War 2. Phantoms are very expensive-abou t $4m each. The evidence before the Committee was to the effect that these hangars were -Order! The honourable member's time unsafe in winds stronger than 45 miles an has expired. hour. We were told also that on a number of occasions the base has recorded winds up to 65 knots. It is true that when these winds exceed 45 miles an hour the aircraft are taken out of the hangars. This is very relevant, because we are proposing to build new hangars to replace the igloo type hangars. That point becomes more important as I go on. They are so inadequate now that the Phantoms, costing $4m each, are wheeled out into the open when they should be under shelter. They are put out in the wind and tied to the ground with sandbags attached to stop them blowing away. All of this is in the official evidence. We propose to provide hangars for the F ill aircraft which are worth about $I3m each, but the regrettable part is that we are to supply the hangars terribly late. For a long time there will be no hangars at Amberley capable of protecting the F ill aircraft. We will have 24 of them, but they are not all put under shelter. As all honourable members would understand, these aircraft have to be serviced from time to time. They do not have the best of safety records up to now and they need a lot of attention and overhaul. When they are wheeled into these igloo hangars they will be subjected to extreme danger-$13 m aircraft in shelters that could be blown over in a 45 mile an hour wind. We are told that the hangars will come in the second phase of the programme. TheF ill s are to come in the middle of next year and the hangars are to come in stage 2 of the programme. It will be a total of 40 months before this phase is completed, so it will be close to 3 i years before the F ill strike aircraft will have any adequate shelter at Amberley. I regard this as an indication of lack of planning on the Government's part. It is another major blunder associated with the F ill aircraft. The aircraft were ordered on the eve of an election campaign and now, on the eve of another election campaign, we are proposing to build shelters for them. But the shelters will come more than 3 years later than they should. I believe that this represents very serious irresponsibility on the part of the Government.

205,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock),"Minister's action in granting me an extension of time. I must not labour the point but I think that the Minister will concede that it is a good point that these $300m aircraft should be adequately housed. I think the people of Australia will be alarmed that for 3 i years the aircraft will be without shelter or put in hangars which we know can be blown over in a wind stronger than 45 miles an hour. I will not press that matter further. The work on the Townsville Royal Air Force Base involves a complex of developmental proposals. At this base some 695 officers and 34 civilians are working on a site covering 420 acres. We propose to add to that another 340 acres. Townsville is an interesting situation in that it is a joint user aerodrome for both the RAAF and the Department of Civil Aviation. The proposals involve $8m. Generally, they incorporate the provision of new aprons, parking, refuelling and telecommunications facilities, ground equipment maintenance facilities, a new motor transport section and lots of other very significant matters associated with the running of this air base. I have little quibble with this proposal except that it seems to me that there should be more co-operation on the part of the Commonwealth Government-thi s was revealed in the evidence given to the Committee-abou t noise abatement and examination into the effect that extensions to this airport will have on the Townsville community. It is back to front that the Committee should get a proposal about the extension of any airport without having the benefit of advice from a noise abatement committee. We were told that this committee, which involves the co-operation of the Commonwealth, has not yet gone into operation. The second matter that gives concern is that through lack of foresight and planning a sewage treatment plant built at Towusville just 3 years ago-it is not yet in comGuinea? We should have been at work demission and is worth $lm-wil l have to be resited. As I understand it, 3 years ago the Commonwealth had a long range objective to implement improvements to the Townsville Air Force Base. I know I will oe corrected if I am wrong, and I see the Chairman of the Public Works Committee now shaking his head. The sewage treatment plant was built 3 years ago at a cost of Sim, and planning should have been sufficiently far sighted to have prevented the wasting of $lm. I refer now to the Port Moresby Commonwealth offices. The proposal to build the offices at a cost of $ 1.65m was the subject of a very interesting inquiry. It will accommodate a number of government departments. Papua New Guinea shortly will become a sovereign State and obtain independence. In that country, as in all others. Australia will need to have a chancery. Again, this matter could involve wholesale wasting of public money because of the lack of anticipation on the Commonwealth Government's part. The taxpayers will be up for only Si.65m. We are to build this particularly large scale building of 3 podium levels and 9 upper floors containing 41,400 square feet of space. But this is not the chancery Australia will need to have eventually. The proposal is for a temporary chancery. We are in such a rush, because of our lack of anticipation, that we plan to copy a buildim? which is already in Port Moresby-the ANG building. We had to seek approval from the owners and designers of that building to emulate the design for our temporary building so that we can be one of the first countries to have a chancery in Port Moresby. We will then hope to high Heaven that when the time comes to get rid of the temporary chancery, which is to cost $1.65m, we will be able to find a buyer for it. There is speculation among members of the Committee that it could become the first substantial white elephant and perhaps the greatest white elephant in the h:story of Papua New Guinea. It is quite conceivable that there will be no buyer for the temporary building we are erecting. Why has the Government failed to anticipate the independence of Papua New signing a building for Papua New Guinea several years ago. There was no lack of anticipation by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) about the coming independence. There was none on the part of the Labor Opposition. If there had been a Labor Government we would not be putting up a temporary building in Port Moresby now.",87,Approvals Of Works Public Works Committee Act

The Port Moresby airport is another matter and so is the airtime which would elapse would mean a port at Nadzab for Lae. The main point I want to make is that a lot of land has to be acquired. In the case of Port Moresby it is 1,170 acres. It has to be acquired from native ownership and it seems to me that we are not going about it in an intelligent way and we are not consulting the people properly. I wanted to talk about the repatriation hospital at Brisbane and the Kingsholme and Camperdown rehabilitation centres. In my view, in each case the Government is doing the wrong thing. The Committee has recommended approval but the Government should accept the advice of expert committees on the location of rehabilitation centres in regional hospitals around Australia instead of establishing opera house type buildings in the capital cities. A rehabilitation centre in Brisbane is not much good for you if you live in Townsville or Mount Isa. A Senate committee has recommended that the centres should be dispersed around the country in regional hospitals. Why is it that the Government refuses lo heed the expert advice of the committees it has appointed to inquire into such important matters? Order! The honourable member's time has expired.

I point out to honourable members that in my view there is no justification for supporting the amendment. As the honourable member for Hughes( Mr Les Johnson) said, it is a matter of urgency. The Post Office had to deal with circumstances which existed when the plans were put down. It is not something to be considered in terms of requiring more land. In 1955 the first additional property was purchased by the Post Office with a view to future requirements. Moving to the southern end of the land, at present owned by lhe Post Office, there is the German Club. There was great resistance from the German Club when we sought to take even part of its land, but we came to an arrangement with the Club. Further south again is a Methodist Church which operates a rehabilitation of prisoners service. This is not something to be treated lightly by a government, Commonwealth or State. It is a matter of great social importance within the community and one towards which the community would not accept a willy nilly approach, an approach to get rid of the operation at any cost to acquire more land for another purpose.

210,Sir Alan Hulme,"It is not all thatus the opportunity to give some consideration to the environment. I know that there is insufficient car parking space. But I want to make it quite plain that the Post Office, as is the case with other Commonwealth departments, is required by the policies determined so far by the Government to observe certain standards. Car parking is a modern concept of town planning. I believe it is one which will require honourable member for not being able to great expenditures by the Commonwealth and perhaps a new policy if we are to make provision of parking for customersnot that there are many customers with a telephone exchange; but certainly there is a cross-runway is built. That is not assobig requirement for car parking for the 600 or 700 people who may be working in the building. The Post Office is prepared to consider environmental problems, but we have planned this building in accordance with the broad policies which have been laid down. I would like to refer to one other matter. As I mentioned, the Post Office commenced to purchase additional properties in 1955. The honourable member for Griffith has represented his electorate for the last 6 years. As far as I can recollect I am glad to see that he has taken this interdid not receive until the last day or so any representation by him in relation to this matter. The Brisbane records in the Post Office reveal only that the honourable member made a telephone call on one occasion in relation to it. I suggest that it ence was coming forward. We have the is unfortunate that the honourable member did not take advantage of the opportunity available to him to attend the meeting of the Public Works Committee, not when it met in Canberra, but when it went to Brisbane to look at this area. On that occasion the Committee looked at our central trunk exchange and also at another site on the northern side of Brisbane for future exchange purposes. I would like to say to the honourable member that I believe that, having regard to the delay, not through a re-reference to the Public Works Committee, but the impossibility of meeting a time scale in terms of 1975-76, he might see his way clear, and bearing in mind that this matter has had an airing, to withdraw the amendment that he has moved. I understand that the honourable member for Hughes( Mr Les Johnson) does not intend to encourage the Opposition to vote in favour of the amendment. want to make one very small point that I think should be made. The honourable member for Hughes( Mr Les Johnson), mentioned that the Townsville sewage plant, which has just recently been completed, will have to be shifted when work on the RAAF base at Townsville is completed. I have no complaint with the remember all the details of a great many hearings that have been through the mill recently. In actual fact the sewage plant will have to be shifted if and when a new ciated with the work under consideration at the moment. I think that I ought to make that clear so that the Air Force does not have to carry unwarranted criticism which I know has been made in error by the honourable member for Hughes. mend the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Donald Cameron) for his interest in his area and, while the ideas that he has put forward have been answered by the Postmaster-General( Sir Alan Hulme), I est. Perhaps the honourable member did not know about the Public Works Committee meeting on this reference as early as he would have liked to. Perhaps he did not have the means of knowing that this referopportunity in this House of knowing what references are to be considered, but I believe that it would be desirable for the Federal member of the area in which the Public Works Committee is to examine a reference to be notified as early as possible of that examination. I think that this improvement should be made to the way in which we publicise our hearings at the moment. As the Postmaster-General pointed out, alternative sites for the exchange were looked at. It was not just decided to construct the telephone exchange in that area without due consideration. The Public Works Committee always endeavours to try to find the best solution in siting a work. The Committee does not have the opportunity to undertake an examination of alternative sites unless this is provided to us. If alternative sites are there, the Committee looks at them. But we are reluctant to delay a provision of any public need.",90,Approvals Of Works Public Works Committee Act

212,Mr Corbett (Maranoa) (5.52),"I comThis exchange quite clearly will be required by the time it can reasonably be expected to be completed. I do not want to repeat what the honourable member for Hughes( Mr Les Johnson) has already said. But I want to make one point about his criticism that was made about the construction of Commonwealth Offices in New Guinea. The honourable member for Hughes asked why the Government had not moved earlier and done something sooner. Well, the building that we are undertaking could easily be quite a reasonto assist them in the administration of their able business proposition. I recall the scream that went up, when the Government was buying in wool, about all the money that this would cost the community. The taxpayers at large finished up showing a profit of SlOm. Because of the progress and development which is occurring in that area I would not be surprised if there were a profit, or at least not a loss, from this building. Now that it is known that it must be built, the final result might be that the negatived. building is more appropriately suited to its function than if something had been built without knowing exactly when it was to be used. From this angle, I believe that the proposal will prove in the end to be a reasonably satisfactory one. The question of the Post Office has been fairly well covered but 1 want to repeat that I think the honourable member for Griffith entered into this discussion with the idea of trying to put the views of the people he represents in this area, which views have no doubt been put to him, and from that angle I feel he is to be commended. seek leave to make a short speech. being no objection, leave is granted. House. The Postmaster-General( Sir Alan Hulme) made reference to the fact that there was a certain degree of urgency about this building and that was one of the reasons why I should withdraw my opposition to it. I would appreciate it if somebody would explain to me why, if something had been planned back in 1955, it was referred to the Public Works Committee only at the end of August and why there is so much urgency about it. Perhaps if we could have foreseen that there could have been some problems, the Parliament might have been given much more opportunity to examine the plans as they stood. The system of notifications to members representing the various electorates was referred to by the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Corbett). I state here and now that with all the paper work that members of this Parliament receive and the various things which happen in this House from time to time it is almost impossible to keep up with what is going on. Private members, unlike Ministers, do not have staff duties in this Parliament. I very much regret that, after so many years of knowing the Postmaster-General, we had to end his last day in this Parliament on such a note. But I assure the Postmaster-General that this will not be my last day in Parliament and I will be watching his Department much more carefully in the future.

Test applications of the duty formula recommended by the Board in its report resulted, in several instances, in negative duties and in other cases duties of a very low order.

222,Mr Barnard (Bass) (5.59),"Th enumber of the Islanders will benefit. Apparently those members who served only on Thursday Island are not entitled to assistance because they were not enlisted from overseas service. However, some, for one reason or another, did serve overseas, for example on small ships. It is appropriate that there will be a right of appeal to an that these men should be allowed assistance under this legislation. As a matter of interest I got the War Memorial Library to hunt up some information about the Torres Strait Light Infantry Forces. A unit of company strength was formed in 1941 to assist in guarding the airfield on Thursthe Repatriation portfolio that I do not day Island. These men were drawn from various islands including Murray. Banks and Prince of Wales. The unit was officered by members of the Australian Army, mostly from Queensland, and was called the Torres Strait Infantry Company. Two other small units, the Torres Strait Employment Company and the Islander Labour Company were subsequently formed. AN units were amalgamated into the Torres Strait Light Infantry Company in March 1943. When the war ended 700 Island veterans of this company were rehabilitated in the pearling industry by the Queensland Government. As I indicated lo the House, there were 700 members who served at some time in this Company. That is not an insignificant number. As I said at the outsetI suppose one can always learn something new in this ParliamentI had no knowledge of the discrimination that applied in relation to those from this area served in the armed forces during the Second World War, But at least the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Holten) and the Government have now accepted that there should not be any racial discrimination and the Bill which we now have before us provides for this. 1 am sure that all Australians would accept the principle that laws should not be enacted on the basis of discrimination one way or the other. So, the Government has decided to apply this principle. I have studied the Act very carefully and I have received an assurance that, when the Minister talks about appeals and when his Department refers to appeals, they agree that the benefits of the entire processes of area, and he will know that the homes the Repatriation Act will apply to those who are now being considered under the terms of this legislation. I found it very difficult to determine what was intended by the legislation, because while it contains a reference to a right of appeal to the Repatriation Commission I can see no reference to a right of appeal to an entitlement tribunal. However, I accept the assurance entitlement tribunal. I make it quite clear to the Minister that if this was not the situation it would be one further example of discrimination being perpetuated. I have said in this House on a number of occasions before the present Minister held accept the principle that we cannot give ex-seamen the right of appeal to a higher tribunal. I can never accept the discrimination in this respect. It is not racial discrimination but discrimination in relation to what is availale to ex-servicemen in the form of an appeal and what is available to ex-seamen in the form of an appeal. However, that matter can be corrected, and I hope it will be corrected at a later date. But I accept the assurance that there will be a right of appeal to an entitlement tribunal. The other point I raise is that the principal Act will still apply, although of course amended. I find it very difncult to understand why the Government intends to have 2 separate Acts-a n Act that will apply to Torres Strait Islanders and an Act that applies to all other servicemen in this country. The Bill provides that the Repatriation Act will apply to Torres Strait Islanders. But why is it necessary to continue with 2 Acts? Could these people not have been just as easily incorporated under the Repatriation Act? There may be some administrative problem in doing this. If so, no doubt the Minister will indicate what that problem is. Since the benefits of the war service homes legislation have also been extended to these people I believe that I ought to conclude by making 1 or 2 references to the problems of Torres Strait Islanders in obtaining war service homes. I suppose the Minister for Housing( Mr Kevin Cairns), who is sitting in the House, will be fully aware of the problems existing in that built in those islands have normally been built by the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs. That Department has accepted responsibility for the provision of homes, and most of the homes that have been built have been built for a cost of $800 to $2,000. There has been some variation, but that is generally the level of the cost of building on these islands. The Minister is well aware, as are all other members in this House, that the maximum loan for a successful applicant under the war service homes legislation today stands at $9,000. If the Department of Housing applies the same principles as it applies elsewhere in Australia and demands the level of accommodation that exists elsewhere, a home could not be built in this area for less than $20,000. If the Department of Housing demands that the same standards be applied in relation to the homes on Torres Strait Island and a home is to cost $20,000, it is quite clear that those who may qualify under the terms of this legislation will not be able to take advantage of the benefit which the Minister for Repatriation has outlined. Either the Minister for Housing or the ferent from those which apply in LaunMinister for Repatriation may be able to ceston, Toorak or wherever else one may advise me whether the Department of like to go. A judgment appropriate to the Housing, which is the department responregion will be made as long as an approsible for war service homes, will demand priate security is given. that homes built in this area be of the same standard as homes it builds elsewhere.

Judgments will be made on whether the building or dwelling given as security is a building or dwelling appropriate to the area.

One needs only examine figures at $83m whereas in 1971-72 they were exports were of rural origin and 4 per cent of mining origin. In 1971-72 rural exports represented 50 per cent and mining exports 31 per cent.

225,Mr Erwin (Ballaarat),"I present the Australian Government was consideringwhat one might call a mad race to develop many of our mineral fields. One can understand why the States want development at all costs. The States are not too concerned about foreign ownership because if the State can persuade someone to develop a mineral field the quicker it is developed the more revenue the State earns in royalties, in rail freights and indirectly, in case with the Government. It is well land tax and other forms of taxation. A State is not particularly concerned with the export price of a commodity, but this is an important matter. I am pleased to see that in his statement Japan needs Australia's raw materials more the Minister for National Development than Australia needs Japan. We have several times sounded the warning that in diversified outlets for our exports, if necesfuture the Government will not accept the sary. Japan needs raw materials and has to formula of costs of production plus profits buy from us. as being the equivalent of the export price. It must be a price closely associated with the world parity price. This is what it believe should be followed as regards the should be and should have been for the development of resources by foreign comlast decade. The Commonwealth, of panies.

But lisation based on the development of natuthat should be done only after those other ral resources but we should remember that principles have been applied. The fifth minerals are an exhaustible asset. Once a mineral is taken from the ground and exported it is gone for ever, unlike water and land. It should be our policy to gain as much control as possible of our mineral resources. There is no question that the Labor Party will take a much harder line with foreign companies than has been the known that the Japanese have a mighty and increasing grip on Australia's economy because of our dependence on Japan for export outlets. However, one consolation in this problem is this: I firmly believe that There are 5 basic principles which I The third principle is that in the event ot partnership with that foreign company in principle is that in no circumstances should a government-and no Labor government would-allo w the development of a basic natural Australian resource if it meant that this would not be in the best interests of Australia. I refer to such things as the development of many of our beach sand areas where erosion is rife, and the develop-shoul d stay in the area for basic development of the marginal areas of our pastoral lands. These could cause problems. I note the Minister's declaration regarding the price of exports. This must bear a closer relationship to the world parity price. of basic development in roads, ports, power We should abandon this outmoded, uneconomic and wrong formula of cost of production plus profit. As Australian assets are involved we expect the Commonwealth Government to obtain for Australia the best possible price on world markets. I believe that in the future we will see a greater role played in the Australian economy by our northern resources. Eighty per cent of Australia's bauxite and 60 per cent of its alumina are produced in the north. Already the huge deposits of black coal in north Queensland are responsible for 47 per cent of total production in Australia. Seventytwo per cent of Australia's production of concentrated copper and 93 per cent of refined copper comes from the northern parts. The vast deposits of iron ore in the northern part of Western Australia are responsible for 70 per cent of Australia's total production. Almost all of Australia's bullion lead, salt and manganese are produced in the north. In addition, as will be -stated later by other speakers, a great proa completely independent committee on the portion of the vast deposits of natural gas that we have in Australia is located in the northern half of Australia. While southern Australia is quickly running out of water, in the north we have tremendous reserves of surface and underground water. A great proportion of our water, minerals and energy is in northern Australia. I believe in the future we will see a much greater contribution to the economy being made by northern resources than we have seen in the past. It is to be hoped that the Government of the day will give recognition to the resources of the north and not pay lip service to them, as has often been the case up to the present time. Despite the tremendous contribution which the resources of northern Australia are making to the economy of Australia, too frequently the great profits from these resources are milked away into southern areas or to overseas countries. I believe it should be mandatory that a proportion of the profits, or a proportion of the value of production taken out of the area once and for all-the exhaustible assets ment. Let me give one example. At Weipa is one of the world's richest deposits of bauxite. Yet Cape York Peninsula is one of the poorest areas in Australia in terms and so on. I believe that a proportion of the value of products removed should stay in the area to help the local authorities, just as a proportion should remain in other areas fortunate enough to have very valuable resources in their own backyards. Unfortunately, what is happening today is that most of the profits are going out of the area into other parts of Australia and, m many cases, to other parts of the world. In conclusion let me say this: I firmly believe that a body along the lines of the Vernon Committee should bc formed in Australia as a special projects committee to analyse progressively various alternatives for the development of natural resources-land , water, minerals, energy, forests, fisheries or whatever they might be-and to report consistently and factually to the ministry of the day, free of politics and free of interdepartmental committees. It should be able to put forward the facts as they appear to development of natural resources in Australia. In this way we will achieve planning and an orderly development of natural resources. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. (8.17)-There is one thing certain tonight and that is that I am not going to make a political speech. We have heard a modest political speech just now. When I get over this point I want to say a few things about the Minister for National Development ( Sir Reginald Swartz) and about minerals and other resources. There is no guarantee or indication that the Opposition would do better than the present Government has",96,Australia S Natural Resources Minerals Forests Water And Energy
226,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock),,98,Australia S Natural Resources Minerals Forests Water And Energy
227,Sir Winton Turnbull (Mallee),"done in developing or conserving our resources. In this Parliament I have always dealt with policies, not personalities, and on this, the last night I will be in this Parliatrue too, because the experts thought that ment, I am not going to change my policy. I want to say-thi s is as far as I will go with politics-that in the past the Australian Labor Party has never been in office long enough to do anything, except during the war period. It has been in office for less than 17 years in the 72 years since Federation. It did not stay long on any occasion it was elected. One can take off the 3 or 4 years the Labor Party was in office in each war and one sees that Labor has never remained long in office. It has been like a man in the sea and just about drowned, who had to be pulled on to the beach and resuscitated. A Liberal-Country Party government, or one of a similar political complexion, always had to come in and resuscitate the economy. Let me get away from politics altogether. I compliment the Minister for quite a lot of things he has done. Ever since he came into Parliament he has been a tremendously likeable fellow, not only in this Parliament but also when he went into the electorate to meet the people. On several occasions he has come into the electorate I represent. The people liked him immediately. They liked him very much. I have found that the longer one knows him the better one likes him. That is the sort of person we need to have here. The issue before the Chair concerns such things as what happened in relation to the Dartmouth Dam. I bave asked in this House on several occasions how the building of the proposed Dartmouth Dam was proceeding. The Minister has always given me details of what was happening. I appreciated his handling of the Dartmouth Dam and the Chowilla Dam projects, when honourable members on one side of the House wanted to have something done and honourable members on the other side wanted something else. I will not go into detail on that. The people who were in the House at the time know what happened. The Minister played a mighty part in this House and he played it most impartially, because he supported the experts. There were men in this House who said that the Chowilla Dam should be built, but the men who really knew-the experts on the job-sai d that Dartmouth Dam would give better, clearer and more water more cheaply. Somebody said that at the very outset I supported the Chowilla Dam. That was was the best. But on a more detailed investigation it was found that Dartmouth was better and I supported that. I did not change my mind. I was not being inconsistent. To be consistent is not in keeping to one opinion but in being willing to change your mind if you see reason to do so. Surely the reason was good enough because the experts were saying that the Dartmouth Dam would give Adelaide sufficient water. But some people did not want water for Adelaide; they wanted to get a Premier in and they got him in. I wish to refer to water conservation which is a matter very dear to the heart of the Minister. I have always said in this House that we must have priorities. Most honourable members agree with that but some of their priorities are not the same as mine. 1 have said that the first priority in this nation is defence. It is of no use having Dartmouth or Chowilla Dam or a democratic government or all those amenities which people long to have if we cannot protect them. If an invader came to this country we could fall at his feet and become slaves to a foreign power. Not many people have seen a nation take over another nation but 1 have and so has the Minister. My No. 1 priority is defence. My No. 2 priority is primary industry, asociated in many cases with water conservation. People say: 'What about education and other amenities?' Education is made possible by money that a nation can make from its exports and other avenues. The greatest export factor in this country has been our primary industry. If we have the money we can make possible the provision of education and all those things which build nations. Therefore we should have water conservation combined with primary industry as a top priority. Although minerals did seem to move ahead for a while primary industry is back on its pedestal. Primary industry has been the greatest factor in the building of this nation. I believe it is still the greatest factor in maintaining the stability of our economy in these days. I have continually advocated the piping of water. Only recently the Minister visited Mildura, the nearby Millawa district and west of Red Cliffs where I vvould say the first reasonably big project for the conservation of water by piping is under way. It has been said by Mr East, who was head of the State Rivers and Water Commission in Victoria, that in certain parts of the Mallee electorate which I represent 95 per cent of the water was lost after it left the storage and before it reached the consumer through seepage and evaporation. Mr Fast is a man whose word you can take on this subject because he is an expert and :s not prone to giving the wrong information. I am putting this to the House at this late stage of my time in this Parliament. 1 believe that we must have water conservation by piping it. I have not heard many people advocating this system. 1 have had a pretty lonely job in this respect. Water is an essential item in this country, as everybody knows. It is advantageous to build a dam like the Dartmouth Dam because certain water would drain into it from certain sources and we can make use of it. But if you cannot fill these dams with water what will happen? What we should do is to have a system whereby we can make the best use of the water that we can conserve. You cannot conserve water in a dry year. In a wet year you do not need to conserve it as much as you do in a dry year. Everybody knows that. I represent 70 per cent of the dried fruits industry, and the citrus industry. All these industries require water to bring about prolific growth. We do not only need to have prolific growth. The man on the land must have security and he will never get it in this country unless we have water piped. This would enable water to be taken to irrigated pastures and not just for domestic use. A pipeline could take the water to the pastures. I believe that this Government, the next government or any other government must push for the piping of water if we are to get the best out of this naturally endowed country. I say to the Minister in closing: 'congratulations on the work you have done for this nation in this Parliament'. Why would you not congratulate him? No wonder you are telling us what a good bloke he is. answer tbe interjection because if I do it will appear in Hansard. Hansard should not note it? honourable member does not answer an interjection it does not appear in Hansard. now. been said may be taken by some people as being the truth but I treat it with the contempt that it deserves. I say to the Minister: 'May you have a very happy reirement although I cannot see you retiring. I think you will be doing something, because you are too active and you are a comparatively young man. I wish you every good fortune in the future. I extend to you goodwill as you have extended it to me and to other members of this Parliament.' I was about to wish the Minister good luck. I believe it is not a matter of luck but a matter of work. As Rudyard Kipling said: Tf any nation builds up to a great height of excellence, it is not because of the individual or the Army as a whole; it is because of the everlasting teamwork of every bloomin' soul.' The Minister is a leader. I wish him good fortune and good health. the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) in paying a tribute to the Minister for National Development ( Sir Reginald Swartz). I have always respected him as a man and particularly as a Minister. I wish him all the best for the future. Now that the Minister has had the sugar we will rub in the salt. On behalf of the Opposition I move the following amendment to ihe motion: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'this House condemns the Government for its failure to prepare and publish plans to (a) ensure world prices for exports of natural resources, (b) promote processing industries located and controlled in Australia, and (c) protect the environment from damage as a result of resource developments'.

What is the extent of Woodside-Burmah share drainage away from Australian ownership by way of nominee buying? Will the Minister take immediate steps to protect the national interest by conducting an immediate investigation? Has the Government the power to enforce the provisions contained in the Bill introduced into this House yesterday on foreign takeovers, if in fact they do apply, to cite the quantum of overseas plunder by way of nominee buying? FurtherI ask the Minister whether the Act will have retrospective power to enable the recovery of Australian control of this major natural gas deposit? Did he note the statement of Mr A. Lumsden, Chairman of Burmah (UK.) last Thursday to the effect: 'Burmah was not worried about rising Australian nationalism-a n emotion to which it was no stranger in other parts of the world. All signs are that the Government will be realistic'? What precisely did Mr Lumsden mean when he spoke about this Government being realistic? Let the Minister for Trade and Industry( Mr Anthony) speak for the Government on this question. In answer to a question relating to the failure of this Government to act in the national interest in dealing with an overseas steel pipe contract, he said categorically that the lacks completely a national fuel and energy Government's approach when dealing with overseas corporations was in fact a soft one. Surely in terms of our vast non-renewable fuel and energy resources this is not very satisfactory. There is a world fuel and energy crisis developing, particularly in the the waste paper basket 2 of the pillars of developed countries of the world. The honourable member for Mallee( Sir Winton Turnbull) talked about defence. The United States has something like 20 years supply of indigenous fuel and natural gas. If a country does not have fuel, it has no defence -Order! Is the amendment seconded? If we turn to the question of non-renewable fuel and energy resources, in my view a national government must act within the parameters of nationalism. It has the responsibility in fact to pursue a hard line to ensure maximum Australian view to inserting the following words in place equity, participation and control. These thereof: resources certainly are the most valuable failure'this House condemns the Government for its and strategic in terms of national interest. This Government stands condemned for its failure to exercise its powers, its energies and its abilities. Because of its soft line it has permitted the exploitation, the control and the profit in relation to these resources to be determined in a board room in London. It has been estimated by a company which has compared the hydrocarbon deposits on the North West shelf with those in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Middle East that there are almost 9,000 million barrels of crude oil on the shelf. This gives a revenue factor of something like $2.6 billion. But if we take the figure of 60 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, we find that these vast deposits are more than enough to support a major liquefied natural gas or methanol export project and the Pilbara steel mineral development and leave enough for general use elsewhere in Australia. These assets, which are the envy of the developed countries of the world, could not be more effectively or efficiently plundered if this country were a vassal of a conquering foreign army. The reason for it is that this Government, after 23 years, takes a soft approach to multi-national corporations. These vast gas reserves are capable of providing, and should provide, an essential underwriting of this country's future, whether it be in terms of energy or in terms of decentralisation. This Government policy and a comprehensive and balanced plan for the efficient exploitation of our vast mineral resources. I suggest to the Minister and to the Government that it is high time that the Government threw into Liberal philosophy: One is its colonial mentality, and the other is its soft approach to multi-national corporations. The Government should purchase a 'do it yourself kit. the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Hawker( Mr Jacobi).

It will always be vulnerable to Because Australia appears to have ample requirements from our own oilfields we will be providing only 30 per cent. That means that as half of our energy requirements are provided by petroleum products excluding natural gas, 10 years from now we will be importing, unless new fields are found, 66 per cent of our requirements. A changing pattern of energy requirements has developed in Australia. It is not unusual, because in line with other developed countries coal's share of the total energy market has been declining steadily in recent years due to the increasing use of petroleum products. In 1959-60 coal supplied 54 per cent of Australia's primary energy. Petroleum products provided 37.7 per cent, wood and bagasse 7.1 per cent, and water power 1.2 per cent. In 1969-70 the corresponding figures were coal 43.3 per cent, petroleum products 48.9 per cent, wood and bagasse 3.7 per cent, natural gas-appearin g for the first time -1. 8 per cent and water power 2 per cent. It bas been estimated that by 1975-76 coal's share will fall to 40 per cent and petroleum's share will rise to 50 per cent. Natural gas-and these are figures cited by the Minister for National Development in his statement-wil l increase to 10 per cent of the market by 1979-80. Australia is in the fortunate position of having a fairly minerals of almost every description we good idea at the moment of our primary energy resources, but I have not seen in one statement that has been made by this Government what the potential use of our primary energy resources will be by say, 2000. I cannot even be certain of Australia's population in that year. Unless we plan the use of our resources, unless we have a national fuel and energy policy, we can use our resources uneconomically and wastefully or we can export them without due consideration of our own requirements. I gave the example of the United States of America. We do not want to follow that example. We have our warning and we have the resources. I note that the Minister tor the Navy (Dr Mackay) is at the table. I heard the honourable member for Mallee( Sir Winton Turnbull) refer earlier to defence. Primary energy resources are necessary to develop our country, to provide our manufactured goods and to supply our defence forces. If in 30 or 40 years time we have used our energy resources to the same extent as the United States has done we will be in a similar position. We are in a fortunate position in Australia in that we are an island continent with neighbouring countries that are looking to us for assistance and support. So we must look at the need for a national fuel and energy policy to be laid out precisely and clearly. After 23 years of this Government it still has not been laid out. I commenced my speech by congratulating the Minister for National Development on his statement. A few weeks ago I made a speech about the need for information to be given to our generating authorities, industries and State parliaments. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Dorothea Mackellar, an Australian poet of outstanding merit whose love for Australia was tellingly expressed in her stirring verse, wrote of this country as a wilful lavish land. Our natural resources are immense and we are blessed with reserves of coal, iron and bauxite in great and wonderful supply. The words of Dorothea Mackellar are undoubtedly true; this is a wilful, lavish land. Whilst we have uranium, nickel, metals and have been content to permit the careless plunder of our resources disregarding the responsibilities of nation building and the establishment of a country that will live through the centuries and emerge in the Pacific and Indian oceans region as one of the great nations of all time. Our untapped wealth of petroleum products is only now being revealed. With all of these resources we have been content, unfortunately and regretfully, to behave as economic colonials, content with the exportation of our great wealth, disregarding almost entirely the need for using our resources in the development of this nation and its population. We should build a way of life in this country which will be second to none in the world, a type of life which will give leadership to people throughout the world so that we might be able, because of our economic strength and our technical know how, to assist other nations in the forward march to a better life and better living conditions. Instead of purposefully developing our resources in building this nation we have",102,Australia S Natural Resources Minerals Forests Water And Energy

240,Mr Luchetti (Macquarie) (8.57),"been content to go along in the ways of the early settlers of this country when Australia, and New South Wales in the first instance, was merely a colonial possession. When we think of the immensity of our resources and the opportunities that are given to us for the development of Australia. I deplore the fact that we have no plans for the purpose of developing our country and for the harnessing of our resources. I heard the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) speak this evening of the development of northern Australia. In recent times northern Australia has been virtually forgotten when this Parliament has been discussing development. We hear about it when it comes to the plunder of our resources-the quarrying of our iron ore, the open cut process of obtaining our rich coals for export to the markets of the world, the export of bauxite from the Gulf country and so on. But as for thoughtfulness about the development of this country through the processing of our own raw materials, little has been said and precious little has been done. 1 applaud what the honourable member for Dawson had to say. I would like to think that an overall pattern of development for this nation would emerge so that we would take into consideration all of the factors necessary for the development of our country. It is the popular thing these days to criticise the Ord River scheme as if a vast sum of money is being wasted and lost to the country. I disagree entirely with this criticism. The conservation of water in this country is of tremendous importance and is necessary for the development of Australia. But side by side with the conservation of water there should be other planned development. I am particularly pleased to know that the Government of Western Australia is certainly looking further afield than they controlled 18 per cent in 1964 and 40 the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia is and has a plan for the Pilbara region of Western Australia. This is a plan that the Commonwealth should readily support for the future development of our nation. The Pilbara is an area which is very rich in resources, but if it is to be developed how overseas companies are becoming substantial sums will be required. Instead of vast sums of money being poured into our great capital cities for the building of skyscrapers and so on, we want to see more activity in the country and, in my opinion, in north Australia, lf we are to develop the north it is imperative in a sense that the Minister for National Development in the Commonwealth sphere should work in close understanding with the Minister for Shipping and Transport for the completion of the north-south standard gauge railway line. This line should be completed without delay. I would also like to suggest that a further transcontinental railway should be built from east to west, from the Pacific in Queensland-fro m somewhere around Mackay, Townsville or thereabouts -alon g a line to be surveyed across Australia to Onslow, Port Hedland or somewhere in Western Australia. Such a transport system would give the north of Australia the opportunity to progress and develop. Whilst these are perhaps visionary thoughts today, we must remember that those who advocated the transcontinental railway line in the first place were opposed, criticised and condemned. This railway line was started by a Labor government. It was an outstanding achievement of Labor in government just as the Snowy Mountains scheme was an outstanding contribution to nation building. The Bell Bay project in Tasmania also was a hallmark in national development. I put it to the House this evening that we have to look at the north as we have looked at the south, not for the purpose of evacuation and retreat but for the purpose of development so that we in this country will be able to fulfil our destiny in a thorough way. Not only are overseas companies plundering our resources, but it is easy to understand that they have been encouraged by their control of our resources. Overseas companies controlled 53 per cent of our metal production in 1964 and 69 per cent in 1968; in fuel per cent in 1968; in other forms of energy and resources they controlled 20 per cent in 1964 and 29 per cent in 1968. The degree of foreign control in the Australian mining industry rose from 39 per cent in 1964 to 58 per cent in 1968. This clearly indicates involved in the ownership and the actual control of this country. Thesefiguresshow how much easier it is becoming for them to plunder and win great wealth from this country. It should be a condition that those who are given the right to mine and quarry must also process here and manufacture here. This should be a basic consideration. I join this evening in the words of appreciation uttered by other honourable members for tbe contribution made by the Minister for National Development. The Minister has applied himself diligently. He has produced some great documents to indicate the work of his Department. For my own part I should like to say, 'Thank you' to him for the numerous reports that I have received, reports from the Bureau of Mineral Resources, from the Division of National Mapping and other areas of government. All of these have been of great value indeed. I wish the Minister well in his retirement. He has been a Minister of, I believe in the main, sound judgment. Whilst his thoughts, or the thoughts of his Government, differ fundamentally from those on this side of the House, I believe the Minister has applied himself in a very useful way in the affairs of this nation. I personality thank him for at least the courtesies that he has extended to honourable members and to myself. Looking through the Minister's report on natural resources and development objectives I would like to say that if these objectives were to be translated into legislative effect and were to become actualities and facts of life, how we could applaud and sing the praises of the Minister. The first objective is as follows: We should aim to bring into use natural resources of our country as fully as our powers, energies and abilities permit for the benefit of Australians generally. We are not doing that. Today our emphasis is on the big cities and the coastal strip of New South Wales and Victoria. It is not in the development of our resources in the broad sense. The second objective is stated as: We are bound to think not only of Australians of the present generation but also the future genthe development of this nation. If we were eration. If we were thinking of Australia and the future generation we would have greater concern for the conservation of our resources. We would be thinking of this country for hundreds and for thousands of years in advance. We would be thinking of an Australia going far into the distance. We are not doing that today. Those who come here and plunder our resources very careful and sound consideration. I can only 20195/72-R-[120 ] quickly are granted a franchise to export what they can take. The third objective reads: We should aim to ensure that Australians participate effectively both in the equity capital of natural resource projects and in their management. I have already quoted figures showing how overseas control is increasing in this country. The fourth objective is stated as: We should pursue energetically our endeavours to discover what our natural resources are, and to research into how they can and should best be used. Of course we should do that. But compared with many of the smaller countries, Holland for argument's sake, we are certainly dragging our feet and are not nearly as effective as we should be. These are the glorious views which are put forward by the Minister. Perhaps these are his dearest thoughts, but they are not the thoughts and they are not the intentions of the Government of this country. That is to be deplored. I think that the ideas themselves are quite worthwhile. I support the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart) and the other honourable members who have spoken . of the need of a national energy policy in respect of our enormous supplies of coal, bauxite, water resources and fuel of various kinds and natural gas and oil that can be harnessed by schemes such as the Snowy Mountains scheme. There should be a plan to harness all of these resources in the production of power for the development of this country. A plan of this kind has not emerged from this Government. In 23 years of anti-Labor government nothing of the kind has been produced. The Joint Coal Board emerged in the days of Labor government and played a significant part in building up coal production in Australia. Another scheme for national energy usage could emerge, joining all the forces of energy in an overall Australian plan for to evolve such a plan, the coal that we might sell on the world market could be sold at a better price. There would be less plunder of our resources in this country merely to satisfy the exporter or the importer whether he be in Japan or some other part of the world. These are factors that should be given hope that a plan for Australia will emerge one day, not from this Government but from a Labor government in the future, which will show to the world what this nation can do as we have done in the past with the Snowy Mountains Authority and the trans-continental railway. We will build this nation in such a fashion that we will be the envy of the world. But in building this nation we will make a contribution which will help the less fortunate people in this world and bring health, happiness and satisfaction to the people of our country. This is a great country. It needs great people to lead it. It needs good and patriotic people to lead it. It needs good Australians. I believe that the time will soon emerge when we will have the type of leadership given by Ben Chifley, John Curtin, Andy Fisher and others, and this will not only set an example for all Australians so that Australians will rally and support them but will also be an inspiration to others. Order! The honourable members time has expired. Downs-Minister for National Development) (9.12)-As this will be the last debate in which I will be participating in this HouseI would like to establish a record by speaking for only a few brief minutes. On an occasion such as this, of course, obviously I could not be unkind to anyone, least of all the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) who has just finished his remarks. I do very much appreciate the comments that have been made by the speakers in this debate tonight. The honourable members for Dawson (Dr Patterson), Mallee( Sir Winton Turnbull), Hawker( Mr Jacobi). Lang( Mr Stewart) and Macquarie all made personal references of a kindly type which I know in this House makes quite a distinct change. In view of the circumstances, I should like not only to thank those honourable date and hour to be fixed by Mr Speaker, which members but also to indicate that the statetime ment we have been debating is rather a unique one. To the best of my knowledge it is the first of its type produced by any developed country in the world. I know this from my knowledge of discussions of the House of Representatives from the determiwith officials in Canada and the United nation of this sitting of the House to the date of States of America where they are preparits next sitting. ing a similar document. I think that Australia was the first in that (field. Therefore, I think it is a very important basic document and one on which we can build for the future. No doubt, many of the points that were mentioned tonight will be taken into consideration when any amendments are being considered to this document in future years. Finally, I should like to pay a tribute to the people who actually prepared this document-the officers of my Department. Over the last 2 years or so they have spent many a long hour on the preparation of material and, prior to the introduction of the statement into this House, they spent many all night sittings getting the final preparation completed. I am sure that our thanks as members of this House go to those dedicated public servants, who did a tremendous service to us all. I pay a tribute to them on this occasion. I conclude by again thanking all those who took part in this debate for their comments and I indicate that the thoughts that are expressed in this document are those that have been emphasised to some degree by speakers on the Opposition side but are a blueprint for action by the Government in the future. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. The following Bills were returned from the Senate without amendment: Wool Industry Bill 1972. Wool (Deficiency Payments) BiU 1972.

It signifies also the dissolution of the twenty-seventh Parliament and the fact that, shortly, most of us will be entering the hustings where our fate will be decided by fhe master we all serve, the Australian nation and people. However, there are some who will be with us here today for the last time. They will be going from the Parliament into a retirement of their own choosing, I refer in particular to 2 ministerial colleagues and friends, the Minister for National Development, Sir Reginald Swartz, and the Postmaster-General, Sir Alan Hulme. Both have been members of this House since 1949, Sir Alan having broken his continuity for 3 years between 1961 and 1963. Each has a long and distinguished ministerial career-Si r Reginald since 1961 and Sir Alan having received his first portfolio in 1958.

In achieving this you have been ably assisted by the Chairman of Committees. This is the first year of duty for the Clerk of the House and I would like to commend him for maintaining the high standards of that office. Every member of the Parliament owes a debt of gratitude both to him and to the other 2 sentinels of the table for the valuable assistance which they render.

We are mindful of our duties and responsibilities as the elected representatives of the Australian people and strive faithfully to interpret their wishes. We may engage in heated debate at times and we have our moments of strife but above all there is respect for the institution as the safeguard of the freedom of the people and of our democratic way of life. This has been a strenuous year as is testified by the number of Bills which have been passed-6 4 in the Autumn sittings and some 80-odd in the current Budget sittings. Today it is fitting that we in this ParliaChristmas greetings are inappropriate, I ment should pay a special tribute to the man on whom we have relied to produce these Bills in the technical sense, the First Parliamentary Counsel, Mr J. Q. Ewens. Mr Ewens will be retiring shortly after a long and honoured career of service to the Parliament. He became the Commonwealth Parliamentary Draftsman in 1949 and took the title of First Parliamentary Counsel when the separate office of Parliamentary Counsel was established in 1970. During this lengthy period in charge of the preparation of legislation, Mr Ewens has always set the highest standard of personal and professional integrity and his wisdom and experience will be greatly missed. In wishing him a long and happy retirement we also extend a welcome to Mr C. K. Comans, who will be his successor. Our thanks are also due to the many other members of the parliamentary staff who work behind the scenes with efficiency and dedication. I would particularly like to mention the reference section of the Parliamentary Library which provides an invaluable research service and keeps us well informed with a constant flow of up to-date factual information. The Hansard staff in their usual smooth and highly competent fashion ensure that our words are immortalised, sometimes making us, particularly me, read rather better than we might have sounded at the time. The members of the fourth estate, the Press, have perhaps redressed the balance by presenting us sometimes in rather more controversial context but nevertheless always performing a most necessary and valuable democratic function. I would like to add a special word of thanks to those loyal and dedicated members of the ministerial staffs who do so much to help lighten the burden of Government Ministers and Opposition leaders alike. 1 know, too, you would all like me to acknowledge the courtesy and attention we receive from the attendants, the people in the refreshment rooms, the telephonists and all the rest of the general staff who help keep the Parliament functioning in cheerful and competent fashion. Finally, I would like to thank all members on both sides of the House for their co-operation. I am sure each one of us is proud of having been able to give some service to the nation and to the people he represents. Although would like to wish all honourable members well in the season ahead even' though I cannot extend that to include 'many happy returns'. Opposition) (9.27)Mr Speaker, I support subject and the nature of his remarks. Firstly, I refer to your own. consistendy onerous role. I suppose, Sir, that, you would be the first to admit that Standing Orders make it easier for you to discipline those who ask questions on your left than these who ask them on your right, and you are confined to the invidious role for a parliamentarian of being unable to initiate comments yourself. You can speak only when you are sufficiently provoked. I also join in the Prime Minister's references to those of our colleagues on both sides who have announced that they will not be nominating for election to the next Parliament. There are 10 of them. Between them, they have served more than 220 years in the natioual Parliament. Eight of them have never been defeated. Two of them are. Privy Councillors. There are among them 3 Knights Commander, 1 Commander and 1 Oflicer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. There is 1 Knight Commander of the Order of St Gregory the Great who, it is appropriate in the circumstances to remark, was the first to extol the angelic qualities of English migrants. The Prime Minister has paid very proper tribute to his colleagues, the Postmaster General( Sir Alan Hulme) and the Minister for National Development ( Sir Reginald Swartz) who are 2 of the only 4 Ministers who hold the same portfolio at the end of the present Parliament as they held at",108,Adjournment

247,The Prime Minister ( Mr Mcmahon) In The,"the end of the previous Parliament. We do not sufficiently realise the burdensome nature of ministerial office in this Parliament. Since the corresponding occasion 3 years ago there have been 2 changes in the positions of Treasurer, Attorney-General and Ministers of Health, Labour and National Service, Immigration, Navy and Army and 3 changes in the portfolios of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Education and Science. We must all acknowledge that all the distinguished gentlemen who held this array of portfolios did their very best to remain in those portfolios. Among the 10 members who have announced that they will not be nominating for election to the next House one is retiring from public life at a much earlier age than hononrable members ordinarily choose. No party can lightly suffer a loss such as the departure of the honourable member for Berowra( Mr Hughes). I am sure that his service in this Parliament has in no way diminished his forensic future or disqualified him from judicial office. I join with the Prime Minister in his tribute to the retiring First Parliamentary Counsel and to the newly appointed First Parliamentary Counsel. I might, in normal circumstances, think it inappropriate that in the last hours of a Parliament there should be appointments to any major office of this character. This, however, is a parliamentary oflice. It is proper that it should nate indeed in their wives. A parlianot remain vacant, because I should imagine that well before Christmas it will happen that no incumbent of that office will ever have been kept so fully employed. MightI say, partly in a personal capacity but also more particularly in an inherited capacity, that I have had some association for well over 30 years with both these learned gentlemen. I believe the Parliament of the Commonwealth is fortunate to attract men of such dedication and distinction. I would hope that it would soon become possible for qualified persons to find it attractive to become what we have always hitherto called parliamentary draftsmen. It is essential that tbe people who make the laws in a parliament should be able to make laws with sufficient clarity and dispatch for the public to understand and observe those laws. We do not sufficiently acknowledge that the law is just as importantly served by those who draft the laws as it is by those who make them and interpret them. I support the Prime Minister also in his references to the Hansard staff. Most members of this chamber will envy them, because they are much better remunerated than honourable members themselves. I join the Prime Minister, too, in his tribute to all those men and women who make it possible for this Parliament to function at all-thos e concerned with the comings and goings of members to and from the city and to and from the House; those concerned with the replenishment, the refreshment, the encouragement and the inspiration that honourable members have to call upon. A very great number-hundred s of men and women-provid e these services. There are some people who probably have been kept more busy in this Parliament than ever before. In the last Parliament 2,725 questions were placed on notice; in this Parliament there have been 6,577. It must be very difficult to answer them, because some hundreds still remain unanswered. In paying a tribute to the ten of our brethren who are retiring from public life I should like to acknowledge the support that they have received from their wives. Whatever asperities there may be-thes e are only spasmodic whatever the public may think-betwee n honourable members, I believe that these men have been fortumentarian's wife is in a very real sense called on to serve his constituents. Very few men can successfully conduct a public life without the support of their wives. To the men retiring one cannot wish better than that they should have in their retirement health and happiness for themselves and for their wives as well. I suppose that all of us will have a pretty strenuous few weeks ahead of us. I suppose there is not a great percentage of the population which really would stand the pace of parliamentary life or would seek it, but nobody who has ever undertaken it willingly relinquishes it. Whatever the ardours may be of the next few weeks there can be little doubt that we shall all enjoy them and, whatever the result, we shall enjoy to the full the Christmas period which will elapse before the twenty-eighth Parliament assembles. Mr Speaker, in a personal sense I think we can all sincerely and genuinely wish each other happiness with our families after the ardours of the next few weeks. I conclude as I commenced, by acknowledging the very onerous job that you, Mr long period of time. I have a particular Speaker, have had to discharge. I think I can say without prejudice that you have discharged it with distinction.

Equally, I might say that few of us on this side of the House have an appreciation of the duties of the Leader of the Opposition and his senior colleagues in attacking the Government and being able to expose its weaknesses or its failures. I hope it is an experience that we do not have. If it is au onerous task, we feel sorry for the members of the Opposition and we hope they keep doing it for a long time. The Leader of the Opposition also mentioned the pressures that are placed on our wives and families. 1 join with him in those remarks. I think they are very apt. Tho total responsibility that we have to our electorates, to the Parliament, to committees and what have you, does not leave much time for family life. We have an election before us. We must go before the people and present ourselves for examination. We must explain to the people our behaviour and the way we have performed if we are to warrant their support in the new Parliament. Only the people will be able to make the judgment. For the next few weeks we will all have to be fairly humble in seeking their support. I think we need to be humble as members of Parliament and realise that we do not make the decision. The decision is made by the people in our electorates. They are the ones who make the judgment. Anything we do in the next 2 or 3 weeks will not really be the determining factor. The most important factor of all is how we have behaved as individuals or as parties during a period of 3 years. One cannot change one's performance over a short period of time. Most honourable members who come into this House come with a sense of purpose, to do the best job they possibly can for the people they represent and for Australia, but we will now have to answer to those people. I hope that all honourable members can be successful so that the members in the new Parliament will be exactly the same as in this one. (9.47)I am sorry that I have to be honest and say a few things that represent more realism than some of the remarks we have heard from the other side of the House so far have shown. The Prime Minister( Mr McMahon) intrigued me when he talked about his great respect for the institution of Parliament. I have never heard such balderdash in all my life. about sitting down. The honourable member will have to listen to it. I am going to repeat some of the words the honourable member himself has uttered in this place before I sit down. Hundreds of questions have not been answered-so much for respect for the institution. Thousands of questions have been answered only after months of delay. Reports have been withheld from the Parliament. Reports that have been submitted by committees of the Parliament have been withheld from Parliament and have been emasculated, like the Jess report. Information has been suppressed so that the Parliament could not learn the facts. Debates have been conducted without honourable members knowing what the facts were, because of the Government's lack of respect for the institution of Parliament. The executive has constantly used the Parliament as a mere rubber stamp for decisions it had already made-so much for the Prime Minister's alleged respect for the institution of Parliament. Important Bills have been brought down at the eleventh hour without honourable members on either side having had a proper opportunity to consider them-so much for the Prime Minister's alleged respect for the institution of Parliament. Public servants have been directed to refuse to answer questions before parliamentary committees-so much for the Prime Minister's pretended respect for the institution of Parliament. Having said that, I want to dissociate myself completely from any good wishes that might have been extended' to the Prime Minister and to the other people who have spent so much of their time during the last 23 years preventing the people of Australia from getting the kind of legislation they have long been hungering for. I think the pensioners have no reason to thank the Government and the Ministers who sit behind it for the miserable mean handout which they got. The workers who are trying to live on $51.80 a week have nothing to thank the Prime Minister and his Government for, because that was the amount,",111,Adjournment

I want to say something about draftsmen. The Government is at fault-perhap s it is your fault, Mr Speaker; I do not know-o r somebody is at fault in advertising for draftsmen who are already well experienced. You will never get enough draftsmen unless you decide to bring in cadets and train them in the numbers that you need. You will not get experienced men to come in as draftsmen.

Gentlemen, this is an occasionI thought rather an historic occasion-to farewell some of our colleagues and friends. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has the opportunity to speak on the motion for the adjournment of the House in any way that he thinks fit but I would suggest that in view of the spirit of the speeches which preceded his what he is saying is rather incongruous. I would also suggest when it somes to a question of interjecting from the Government side of the House, under some provocation, that the debate be kept on a level which is in keeping with the occasion when honourable members who have given years and years of service to this House also want to makes speeches but in a different vein. Mr Speaker. I do join with all those who have wished honourable members who are leaving the best of good health during the years that they will be in requirement. Among themI will not mention themare men of great distinction. Unfortunately there are better men going out of the Parliament than some of those who are staying in. That is the tragedy. The Parliament will be the poorer for their leaving and I ble members on the other side of the Parliament unfortunately will not be here after the election. So that is one consolation we have. Mr Speaker, to you I say that occasionally I have noticed that you have indicated some semblance of being impartial and I congratulate you for the effort that you were able to make on those odd occasions. (9.55)-The traditions of this Parliament are very important to us. The traditions are important to every member of this House. They are especially important to those who have served this Parliament and the nation for very many years and who are going out of the Parliament. I regret that the members who have served this Parliament and are going out of it will go out with the recollection that on the last night of this Parliament in which they have served those traditions were so sorely bruised. I would hope that we will not have in the lifetime of any member of this Parliament an experience similar to the one we have had tonight. We will say no more about it. We would hope that the Hansard record in relation to the last few minutes could be expunged. This is a very important night to those members who are departing.

One of the things which we come close to tonight is the operation of tbe democratic system in a few weeks time and what has been said by those who have just spoken or will be said by those who are about to speak tonight will not change that democratic process. There are some people who are leaving wittingly and I congratulate them on the sound common sense which they are showing in doing so. There are those who will leave unwittingly. I regret that we will be deprived of their friendship which does exist despite the Tough and tumble of debate. I particularly thank all those persons who have made the conduct of the Parliament in this session an especially easily managed programme. There are 3 members of my own Party who are leaving and to whom I would like to pay my own tribute. They are Sir Reginald Swartz, Sir Alan Hulme and Tom Hughes. Reg Swartz, who had a particularly difficult period during the 1940s and carries the effects of that, has steadfastly refused to allow it at any time to interfere with his good humour. I have never known another man who could stand up in this House and bring a turbulent situation into one of calm and reason as Reg Swartz could. I compliment Sir Alan Hulme, a man who has had respect for his strict compliance at all times with the decencies of public life and his presentation of the truth at all times in the Parliament. I have enjoyed him as a colleague and a friend. Tom Hughes was spoken of, I think, very adequately by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) and for the tribute paid to Tom HughesI thank the Leader of the Opposition. I think it is a great pity that we will be deprived of his services. But there are other people who play an important role in this House. 1 refer to the 2 Whips, the Leader of the House and his consultant, Sir Reginald Swartz, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. They do a job. The Clerks do a job. But I pay particular tribute to the Whips who have unfailingly kept the House running and have made sure that we won every division, just as I am sure that when we are in government after the next election Maxie Fox will make sure that we win them all. lam) and the Leader of the Country Party( Mr Anthony) for their very generous remarks about my service in the Parliament. IfI might speak on behalf of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser), I thank them also for their remarks about his fine contributions to the debates and deliberations of this Parliament. I thank them all for remembering that I have been here for 32 years. I came here as the third member for Melbourne. I succeeded the late Dr William Robert Nuttall Maloney who held the, seat of Melbourne for 36 years. I have held it for 32 years. Two men have held the one seat for 68 years. It has never happened before; it will never happen again. In all the time that I have been privileged to serve I have done my best. No man can say more. I have had my failures; I have had my successes; I have had a lot of disappointments. In a democracy it is the people who really govern. Democracy rests on majority Tule. There is nothing sacred about majority rule. It is a principle of order but not necessarily of justice. We, depend upon the common sense of the people. In other words, in a democracy the people have the right to go wrong-and that is a sobering thought. It is very sobering for me because the people have been going wrong in Australia for 23 years. But be that as it may. That is all a matter of history. I have been privileged to serve in many capacities. I have a record of which I am very proud. I sat on the ministerial bench and the front Opposition bench for 23 years continuously. Although that has happened before, I do not think it will happen again. Governments come and governments go, or so the saying runs in English parlance. We have not really reached the standard that has been achieved in England where they change the government at every election or every second election. The Leader of the Opposition was on very dangerous ground when he quoted Pope Gregory the Great.

I join with everybody else in wishing all of those retiring members of this Parliament who have served this country to the best of their ability length of days and a long life in retirement. As far as I am concerned, in my retirement I shall try to write books. I might even become a legal adviser on libel law. I am quite qualified. I am an Honorary Doctor of Laws. I was appointed, on the nomination of Sir Robert Menzies as Chancellor of the University of Melbourne, a very great seat of learning. I have sought no honours. 1 have appreciated any honours that have ever been given to me, but I never wanted any of them. I am proud to have them. I know I did not deserve them. As I have, said, I never sought them but I feel greatly honoured by whatever body in Australia has seen fit to say something kind about aie and to give me some decoration. I esteem very greatly the fact that I am a member of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council and one. of the Queen's advisers. I am proud of the fact also that my church has given me a decoration which 1 did not deserve and which I did not desire but which I greatly esteem.

Whether or not there was justification for it, there was never any success. weakening on the part of the Speaker. With due respect to you, Mr Speaker, I think this House could do with a little more discipline. If you were to be here during the next Parliament I would hope that you would enforce it. I would like to join with other honourable members in paying a tribute to Mr Ewens. I think the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia are the best written laws in all Australia. They stand pre-eminent. We must have other men like Mr Ewens and those who write our laws so that judges can understand them. I have no complaint about judges-so far, at any rate. Nor do I have any complaint about juries. I think that we ought to build our institution to a greater eminence. This is the supreme elective body in the whole nation. We must maintain its prestige and its respect among all the people throughout Australia, and there must never be any attempt by any pressure group outside this Parliament to try to run the Parliament or to denigrate members of the Parliament who have served this country with great sacrifice to themselves and to their wives and children by their repeated absence from their homes. I thank the Leader of the Country Party for his references to my family relationship with his family. I remember his dear mother very well and I remember mourning with others her early death. I saw this young man grow from boyhood. I compliment him on the stature which he has attained, and 1 wish him well. To all of those other honourable members who have expressed goodwill to me I say: Thank you very much. I have not always been as kind and as generous as I should have been. I concede that half of the problems and the difficulties I have met in life I created for myself. I do not think I should make any further concessions to my political opponents and my critics than that. I will settle for half. When I leave these halls I will leave with the MacArthur thought: T shall return'. I shall have to come back again and see the ParliaParliament after I have left it, not because of my absence but because I feel that the becoming more civic minded and more determined to maintain the prestige of this country and to do everything to ensure its The first and only time that we ever became a nation in reality was when our forces were assembled for service in World WarI .

I join with honourable members who have paid a tribute to those who will be leaving this Parliament at the end of this session. I refer first to the honourable member for Fisher( Sir Charles Adermann), because I remember that back in 1954 when I delivered my maiden speech in the Parliament he followed me in the debate. He wished me a very happy but a very short stay in the Federal Parliament. I am very happy to say that I will still be here after he retires. I believe that he has made a very significant contribution not only to his Party but also to the nation as a whole. The honourable member for McPherson( Mr Barnes) and the honourable member for Berowra( Mr Hughes) are also leaving. The honourable member for Berowra is not in the chamber at the moment, but I would like to pay a special tribute to him. I had an opportunity to listen to the honourable member for Berowra when he served this Parliament and the country as the Attorney-General. I believe that he made a very significant contribution indeed. This Parliament will be the poorer for his passing from parliamentary service. The honourable member for Mallee( Sir Winton Turnbull) also is leaving. 1 sat alongside him for many years and argued across the aisle with him as I believe he now argues with the honourable member for Sturt( Mr Foster). I was very happy to be associated with him. His contribution to his Party, the Parliament and the country has been notable and significant. I come now to the honourable members on my own side of the Parliament who are retiring. The right honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has been a member of this Parliament since 1940 and has served this country with great distinction. On2 recent occasions I have referred to his career in greater detail. I can pay him no greater compliment than to say that I hope I will be able to emulate such a Downs-Minister for National Developdistinguished career in the Federal Parliament) (10.29)I bave a strange feeling that ment and in the service of this country. The for the second time in one night I will make honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mclvor) and the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Griffiths) will be leaving at the end of this Parliament.

I should include in those who are leaving us the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser). Turning to you, Mr Speaker, I suggest that probably 1 bave been the least of your troubles in this Parliament. You have handled a very difficult position in the same way that your predecessors handled that very responsible office. Every member of this House would pay a tribute to you in that respect. I join with those who have taken the opportunity to extend congratulations and good wishes to all the people associated with the Parliament and who have contributed to the smooth running of the business of the House in what has been a very notable session. I want now to pay a well deserved tribute to one who has worked very closely with my staff. I refer to him as Giff because I have become so accustomed to referring to him in that way. He works very closely with the Leader of the House and with my staff. I have found him to be very loyal, conscientious and helpful not only to the Leader of the House but also to me. I pay a tribute to one who has worked very closely with him. I refer to my private secretary, Brian Toohey. Through mutual co-operation has come very satisfactory management of the business of this House. I conclude by extending, as others who have preceded me have done, good wishes to all those who are leaving this Parliament. I look forward to what I suppose will be an ardous period in the next five or six weeks. I know that 1 shall return. My final tribute is to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) who has the respect of every member on this side of the House.

(10.36)-The eulogies are flowing thick and fast tonight. I want to say that it bas been a great experience to serve my country in the national Parliament for so long a period. All of the eulogies which are flowing on this occasion of the demise of a Parliament remind me of the verse that is used when someone dies and everyone says good things about them. The verse is: It is the roses of Ufe that make us feel great, The ones on the grave, I am afraid they're too late. get back to a normal life. I want to agree We ought to be more appreciative of one another's efforts as we go through life together. I had 6 years experience of being in opposition when I first came into Parliament. I was able to pick all the faults of the Labor Government at that time. I was able to show where it was deficient as the Labor Party for 23 years now has been trying to show where the present Government is deficient. That is Parliament. I had the experience that you had, Mr Speaker, for a period when the late Mr Archie Cameron was sick. I occupied the chair on that occasion for 5£ months. I will not dare to compare your leniency or otherwise with my own, because I suppose that honourable members thought badly enough of how I tried to handle the House. For9 years I was Chairman of Committees. I think at that time it was an advantage to have standing order 303 under which the Chairman could put a member out if he behaved in an unruly manner and then let him back when he calmed off. I remember that we had a social evening on one occasion and the then Government Whip, who ought to have been co-operating with me, provoked me. SoI ordered him out. The Leader of the Opposition stood at full height and laughed at him and I said: 'You go with him'. I am sure that the House enjoyed that occasion and came to appreciate that I tried to be fair by putting one out from each side. I served as Chairman of Committees and Speaker for a time and then for 9 years as a Minuter. It is a great honour to be in a national Parliament and to accept responsibility. I think that today people are claiming too many rights and are not accepting enough responsibilities. I think that today people seek to be served by, rather than seek to serve, their country. These are some of the problems that are arising. People are not facing up to what they ought to accept as their part in life. Whatever deficiencies I have had, all I can say is, like the right honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), I have done my best. Tensions are severe when one is a member of Cabinet. One is never at ease because one's mind is going all the time. I suppose it was a good thing when J retired from the Ministry, because tension left me within 6 months and I was able to with what the Leader of the Opposition said when he referred to one's partner in life. I never could have been a member of Parliament to the degree and extent that I have been without the partner that I have in life. She has just been wonderful in every way. The public does not appreciate the loss of home life that one suffers as a member of Parliament. People outside do not realise the calls that are made on a Minister or a member of this House-the lack of home life and all of the responsibility that are ours. I conclude by saying, as I join in thanking all officers of the House for helping to keep the Parliament going, that honourable members want to beware that we do not lose fhe democracy that we have in our Parliaments in this country. When the Press or other media or any person denigrates Parliament or when members of Parliament act with less dignity than they should act as members of Parliament something is taken away from that right which is ours in a democracy to accept the rule of the people through Parliament and so give a fair, equitable and just decision of law. I hope that all members of Parliament will respect the dignity and the responsibility that is associated with Parliament. SoI conclude 29 years and 3 months in this House, having been in Opposition, in the Chair, in Cabinet and now on the back",119,Adjournment

But I say this: We all ought to have that love of country that Sir Walter Scott spoke about in his poem when he wrote: Breathes there the man, with soul so dead. Who never to himself hath said, This is my own, my native land! I have been proud of my land and I have tried to work for it. want to support the remarks that have been made this evening concerning the officers and the attendants of Parliament House, and also the remarks of appreciation that have been made to you, Mr Speaker, and to your Deputy Speaker, Mr Lucock. I fully support those remarks. But I should like to make one other observation as one who has held for 17 years what probably is the safest seat in Australia and as one who was born in the electorate of Gellibrand and who served the City of Footscray for nearly 20 years as a councillor and in many other capacities in that city. I did not realise until national Parliament of Australia and I I was elected to Parliament the immense job I had taken on in representing the Federal electorate of Gellibrand as I wanted it represented, that is conscientiously. To the men and women in the Commonwealth departments of Australia. I pay my thanks and appreciation, for without their help and advice I could never have coped with the amount of work that went through my office. I was once accused of directing a Dorothy Dixer to the then Minister for Social Services. After many attempts to get an office of the Department of Social Services established in my electorate I asked a question one morning of the Minister and he knocked me down by saying that his Department had already obtained the premises for a local office and they were about to open it. The Minister gave me the privilege of opening it. A name I should mention in this connection is that of Maurie Cronin, the Assistant Director of the Department of Social Services in Victoria. Maurie Cronin always used to call me his best customer. After that office was opened, there is no doubt that the load on my shoulders was reduced considerably. In fact, it now is necessary for me only to pick up the telephone and address Mr Jock Webb, the man in charge of that Department in Footscray, and the problems I have in regard to social services are taken off my hands. Having said that, on behalf of the. honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Griffiths) I want to say that we appreciate the remarks that have been made about our goods ladies-the political widows, as I call them. I am sure that neither Mr Griffiths nor I would have been able to fulfil our duties capably and efficiently in this Parliament had it nbt been for the help of our wives. I know that I have been a crusty old curse at times, but nevertheless I want to say to my wife who is in this chamber tonight that I appreciate all that she has done for me. I know that Mr Griffiths wishes me to express also his appreciation to Mrs Griffiths. I have been asked oq a number of occasions, now that I am wending my way out of the Parliament, what have been my impressions and what are some thoughts that I have had since I have been in this Parliament. Firstly, I want to say that it has been a great privilege to serve the know it has been a great privilege also for Mr Griffiths to serve it. Secondly, I want to say that, since I have been in this Parliament, I have seen 4 Prime Ministers in this place and I have served under 3 leaders of the opposition. I know that I will be forgiven for saying that the Leader of the Opposition that I have loved and respected, perhaps even more than 1 have the late Dr Evatt and Gough Whitlam, with all due respects to both men, has been the right honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell). I have known Arthur Calwell for many years and I have grown up with deep affection fbr him and deep respect for his views and I am very appreciative of the advice he has given me over the years. I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the 17 years I have been in this Parliament have probably been the most momentous years in Australia's history. I remember the first discovery of uranium in Australia and the effect it had on the nation, particularly the north. I remember my visit to Rum Jungle and Mary Kathleen. of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) was with me on that occasion. I remember the sputniks and the resentment that I had towards the sputniks.

278,Sir Alan Hulme (Petrie,"Postmasterafter many years of service in it. I am afraid that in my case it was a situation of apprenticeship within the organisation of the Liberal Party. I could only say that I commend to any aspirant for political honours that in that area he or she would gain an experience which I believe would make him or her better fitted to come into this place to make a contribution. I think it gives such a person an understanding of the people within an area rather than merely the association with constituents who have problems or the association that we have together in this place. Because of my appenticeship in the organisation it is now 29 years since I became associated with politics, and for the last 23 years I have been closely associated with this Parliament. It has been my privilege to have been a Minister or a member of Cabinet for some 12 years out of those 23 years. 1 think that apart from the Prime Minister and the right honourable member for Higgins( Mr Gorton), that is as long service as any other Minister has given. I am not quite sure how the Prime Minister has stood up to 21 years. I find 12 quite sufficient and I am prepared to take my departure. I say thank you to those who have expressed feelings of generosity and appreciation. I want to say thank you also to all the members of the Parliament for the friendship which they have given to me. I am inclined to a view at the end of 9 years as Postmaster-General that I have not had the easiest of portfolios, particularly if one remembers that with it is associated the Australian BeforeI came into the Parliament I remember William Morris Hughes teaching me a political lesson. BeforeI was a member we were having a discussion on a policy matter. We discussed it, I suppose, for 6 or 7 hours. He had not been present at the discussion, but he walked in just before the vote was to be taken and, as was his usual custom, he cupped his ear with his hands and asked for a repeat, merely in the interests of giving him a little more time to think of the appropriate reply. The right honourable member for Melbourne will remember the habit. Having a repeat of the motion he said simply: 'Not sufficiently ambiguous'. I have a feeling that a lot of people who listen to the debate from both sides of this House find that we are sufficiently ambiguous to confuse them as to what is the content of the matter that has been under discussion. I offer my very best wishes to every member of the Parliament. I have seen many come and I have seen many go, and one naturally has an interest in the individual. But like the honourable member for Gellibrand, I have not made many enemies in this place over the period I have been here. 1 wish the very best to each and every member in the future, hoping of course that the majority after 2nd December stays on this side of the Parliament. There is one additional thing I would like to say. As Minister for SupplyI was in charge of the second largest department of the Commonwealth, and as PostmasterGeneralI was in charge of the largest department of the Commonwealth. I theretore believe that I am in a position to offer a view as to the quality of service of people who work in Commonwealth dep,artments. In my experience I could not have expected to find a group of people more conscientious than those in the departments with which I have been associated. Naturally one comes into close association with many other public servants over a period of 20-odd years in this place. I believe that they are all high quality, very conscientious people, and I am always sorry when I hear criticism of them. I say 'Thank you' not only to the people in those departments I have been in charge of but also to my personal staff. My secretary in the Post Office has been my secretary for 9 years. I am pleased to know that she Broadcasting Commission. became a Member of the British Empire following last New Year's honours awards. I believe that she justly deserved it because of the service she has given to every member of this Parliament. To other members of my staff I also say 'Thank you'. Again my very best wishes go out to each and every one of you. (10.59)I would like to say Thank you' to all those people I have come in contact with since I have been a member over 26 years and 8 months. I will not mention any names. I do not think this is right. I thank all those people for the goodwill they have extended to me and for the friendship and consideration-consideratio n is one thing I want a lot of-the y have shown. I want",122,Adjournment
279,Sir Winton Turnbull (Mallee),"to thank them also for their co-operation. I appreciate it from every member. There is a thing called life's greatest gift. Did anyone ever think about what life's greatest gift is? phrase the question. What is life's greatest gift? Somebody said good health. In Pentridge Gaol and gaols all over the country are men whom no-one can fault for their physical condition*, but they are no good to this country or to any country. I have asked what is life's greatest gift and some have said: 'To be a great singer'. I discarded that suggestion. All manner of things were suggested but I did not get the correct answer until I spoke to a certain gentleman who said: 'Look, Winton, you should know what life's greatest gift is. It Is the will to serve, not the capacity'. We do not all have the same capacity but the will to serve, I believe, is life's greatest gift. A certain lady came to me one day and said that a certain gentleman in the Parliament should be Prime Minister. I knew that that member did not have my chance of being Prime Minister. If a list had been made of all members this membera nice gentleman who is not here now-woul d have been near the bottom of it. But this lady thought he was a great man who should be Prime Minister so to console honourable members. I put it that so far as they arc concerned: Someone thinks that you are great, Lasting spur to conquer fate.

Speaker, 1 will occupy only a few moments. I will not soliloquise. I naturally join with all the remarks that have been said by other speakers concerning the attendants and everybody else who serves us in this Parliament. From this side of the House we have heard speeches from Ministers and from Whips but, as a perennial and born backbencher, I should like to say to those honourable members who are retiring that it has been a pleasure to serve with them. They are men of great honour and great distinction. Those of us who occupy the back benches have enjoyed our moments with them. They have been an inspiration to us. I would point out to any potential Minister, however, that being a Minister depends on the backbenchers behind him. It is a good thing always to remember this. The honourable member for Sydney( Mr Cope) has already said this, but I should like to address a few words to the honourable members for Shortland ( Mr Griffiths) and Gellibrand ( Mr Molvor) who are retiring as back bench members of the Labor Party. I assure them that they take from this side of the House the greatest affection as well as the greatest respect for the job that they have done whilst they have been members. Members on this side, in common with members opposite, make their assessments of the people opposed to them. I am sure all members will endorse my remarks concerning these honourable members. I have travelled abroad with the honourable member for Gellibrand. I have had discussions with him. We have agreed and disagreed on many occasions. He is a man of honoura man who has served his country with distinction. He has not had the opportunity to sit on the front bench of the Parliament but I rate him second to none-certainl y second to none of those who do sit on the front bench. I believe the same thing may be said by other honourable members from this side about the honourable member for Shortland. He is a man of honour, a man of distinction and a man who knows his views and is prepared to back them. I conclude by referring to the right honwell). When I came into this HouseI did not agree with his politics.

The arguments he put to me were of such a character that he convinced me and I have changed the decision on this matter. However, I am sorry that I cannot agree that another thing that he started has been as satisfactorily concluded. I refer to what he said in this House on 24th May, which still remains unresolved. Honourable members will recall that on that occasion ne spoke of certain Labor organisations not simply in terms of intrigue and graft but in terms of fraud, blackmail, conspiracy and forgery. These are felonies, but they were his words. He said also that the Federal Executive of the Labor Party must have known of the discrepancies, of the manipulation of the statutory declarations and of the forgery and blackmail. He said: As I see it, any prolonged continuation of that Morris also told me I would receive help from silence in itself condemns the Executive members as being persons unfit to hold public office. On TuesdayI received a copy of a letter by a Mr Johnson who is or who wasI am not certain which-President of the Tingira Heights Branch of the Labor Party. He asked me to bring this letter before the House and I propose to do so, because he says: I firmly believe that some effort will be made to 'hush' up the irregularities that occurred in this electorate, and that those that broke the law will be allowed to go unpunished. He then detaUs a lot of voluminous material which I will not have time to read out. However, he speaks of false statutory declarations and says: The same officer of the Court was offered an alleged 'bribe' of $500 by one of the candidates, Mr P. Morris, and has signed a Statutory Declaratralian Labor Party, because I have here a tion to this effect. He goes on to speak of a lot of other irregularities.

In order to facilitate the debate I ask that the documents referred to be incorporated in Hansard. Is leave granted? granted. ments be laid on the table in accordance with standing order 321? table. With this letter he sent me a number of other documents which I will not read out. However, I will read from a photostat copy of the Statutory declaration which he made. It bears the name of Sydney Michael Johnson and reads: I am President of Tingira Hts Branch of the Australian Labor Party and one night before the Preselection for Shortland Mr Morris approached me to make a Statutory Declaration to the effect that certain members of the above Branch had not been present at meetings as shown in the ALP attendance book. Mr Morris said there would be a re-Ballot. Mr Morris offered me $500 to swear this false information in Statutory Declaration form. Mr other members of Tingira Hts Branch and others outside the Branch and the money, would be a great help as both my wife and I are Invalid Pensioners. After Mr Morris and myself finished the discussion I refused, because all signatures in the attendance book as far as I was concerned are true and correct and had attended as the attendance book shows. The next day I informed the Secretary of ihe Branch and when we talked it over it was decided to make a Statutory Declaration on this matter. This happened at the Community Hall after a meeting held in December 1971. I heard of the re-Ballot at 11.30 p.m. this night. Mr Morris referred to in this Declaration is one of the Candidates in the Preselection BaUot for Shortland. There is another declaration which I will not read in full.

Like Queen Victoria, I do not think the House is amused. I would like to add to the valedictory in one of the languages spoken by the right honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell). He boasts 4 of them-English, Irish, Chinese and Italian. To all of those who are retiring let me say in one of the right honourable member's languages apart from English: 'Buona fortuna.

I would like the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr financial support from the Commonwealth Chipp) to look at it when it is presented by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr about the campaign that our committee has Kennedy). These children have written and asked that the television programmes that are offered to them in our country should he suitable for them and should be Australian in content, so that they are not chained to the watching of overseas programmes of doubtful standard. Out of a total of 400 viewing hours every week, 40 channels in Australia are screening only 16 hours of locally produced children's material. As can be seen from the lists of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, most of the channels are operating their quota quickies in obscure time slots. But 12,249 Australian children have responded to one of the programmes, 'Adclass television. I have 2 daughters; one ia venture Island'. They said: These are the things that we Australian children like to see. They will help us along in our formative years'. A small committee comprising the honourable member fpr Bendigo, Mr Race Matthews who was formerly on the staff of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), and me, got together the views of a large number of children. These letters-thes e original documents-fro m to their native talents and their native abilities which will be extirpated as far as Australia is concerned if the present trends in television are maintained. The honourable member for Bendigo will present tonight in his argument to the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Chipp) the results of a great deal of native' talent. I would hope that because of the children's pleas, not because of the plea of the committee of 3 to which I referred, there might be second thoughts about a further step in extirpating Australian television. I hope that the Minister will look at the letters and drawings and will enjoy them. They are well done. In the dying hours of this Parliament I hope that the voices of 12,000 Australian children will be heard. would like to follow up a few of the comments made by the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Grassby) and express my outrage at the proposal to eliminate the television programme 'Adventure Island' and also to request that this programme not only be continued but that all children's programmes in this country receive extra Government. One of the interesting things noticed is the tremendous enthusiasm that children have for this show. I should like to quote a few of the things that some of the children have said. They show a terrific commitment by the children. Here is a lovely letter by a young child. It is addressed to 'Dear Diddlidumdidlis'. It reads: Please keep on going with Adventure Island.

310,Mr Kennedy,"That is correct. Thehave expressed concern that what commercial television is producing are 'basically passive consumers who are being bombarded with advertising and dull, stupid, unimaginative, boring, repetitive and in many cases American imported cartoons and films that are 20 to 30 years old. One cannot help but look with dismay at such programmes as 'Kattanooga Kats'. Such programmes are quite unimaginative for children and they are stupefying and evoke no response or development in the child -whatever. I tbink that the decision by the Australian which so far has not been explained, to abolish this programme is a bad one. From the response that I have seen, I would regard it as being a tragedy for the young children of this country. One of the basic reasons why this programme has been dropped is that the ABC is not receiving the funds it needs. Rather than cutting back on current affairs programmes it is cutting back on children's programmes. I repeat that I have the fullest admiration for this programme. 1 think that has an artistry and an integrity not matched by any other children's programme in Australia. It should not be abolished. It should be continued and strengthened. dying moments of the 27th Parliament I United States Senate-bot h the Republiknow that many of us think of the honcans and the Democrats-vote d by an ourable members from both sides of the overwhelming majority that the policies of House who are leaving the Parliament.

But never has able member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), this Government had the moral courage the honourable member for Gellibrand even to try to do so, because it was the ( Mr Mclvor) and the honourable member moral decay of this Government that for Shortland ( Mr Griffiths). I have had a caused it to take this immoral action in the long association with these members. I first place.

This matter has not been disresult was that some 500 young men died, cussed to any great extent in this country 250 or approximately 50 per cent of whom because we have not a great involvement were conscripts. in Vietnam at this period, although one must recognise that we still have some commitment in that country. We first became involved in the Vietnam conflict in 1962 when we sent military advisers to that country. We sent full military forces in May 1965. In this day and age of 1972 we still have military commitments in that country. There has not been even a recognition by this righteous Government of those people in Vietnam against whom it has committed crimes year after year. Not one representative of the Broadcasting Commission, Australian Government has given recognition to these people, with the exception of the late Senator Hannaford. Only on one occasion did the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Chipp), who is at the table, ever question the policy of his Government. He did so when he was out of the Ministry writing an article for the Melbourne 'Herald'. With those exceptions, not one member of this Government in the Federal Parliament-eithe r from the Senate or from the House of Representatives-and not one member of any Liberal State Government in either the Upper or the Lower House has ever questioned whether Australia's policies in relation to Vietnam have been wrong. Yet during that period of time the the United States Government in Vietnam",128,Adjournment
311,Mr Uren (Reid) (11.29),"In theseThe United States is trying to save face and is trying to bring about a peace settlement. In fact, it was revealed on the news tonight that North Vietnam has met and agreed with the United States that there would be a ceasefire, but those elements who represent the Government in South Vietnam were not prepared to meet the conditions set down by the United States. The United States could have put forward the same sort of proposals back in 1968. Although it has done so now, it is 50,000 United States lives too late, at least 1 million Vietnamese lives too late, and nearly 500 young Australian lives too late. This shows the hypocrisy of this Government. In this Government moral decay has set in. This is why there will be a change of Government. It was because this Government had been representing the Australian people for so long and had been so devoid of any real positive policies and of any real human understanding that it made its immoral decision to go into the war in Vietnam. It was an incorrect decision to make geographically. It was an incorrect decision to make historically, and of course this Government will pay for it. These smug members of the Government parties will pay for these crimes against humanity. I only hope that many honourable members opposite will in fact suffer by losing their seats at the forthcoming election. Many of these young men I will remember for the rest of my days, until honourable members opposite have the moral courage to stand up and say in public the things that they say in privatethat they were wrong to go into the war in Vietnam and that they should never have become involved in the war in Vietnam. They should have the moral strength to stand on their feet and say: 'We had no moral right to go into the war in Vietnam. We were wrong. We should not have inflicted our views on the people in Vietnam. The problems of Vietnam can be solved only by the Vietnamese people and not by pitting the might of one nation against another nation'. They cannot bomb people back into the Stone Age as some of them wanted to do. Some of these young Ministers are smug. The Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Chipp) and Minister for External Territories ( Mr Peacock) look at me with smugness on their faces. As long as they sit in this Parliament I will remind them of the immoral crimes that they have supported over those years. They know that if President Nixon could save face now and make terms with North Vietnam to get out of Vietnam, he would do so. But the fact is he has gained no'.hing. He could have settled. He could have made peace agreements Sir Winton TurnbullA point of order. Even at this late hour it makes me feel very uncomfortable Sit him down. with a point of order. for too long. member for Reid will resume his seat while the point of order is being taken. you will save your own time. Sir Winton Turnbull-The point of order is that it makes me very upset to see the honourable member for Reid pointing at the 2 Ministers and not addressing the Chair. for Reid will address the Chair. there is no point of order. So far as I am concerned, the Ministers and the Speaker himself will pay for some of the crimes committed in Vietnam. In fact every member on the Government side will pay for their negativeness and for their commitment because they have really achieved nothing. They have on their hands the blood of 500 young Australians as well as the blood of the Vietnamese, and it is to the utter disgrace of the Parliament that not one of them has had the courage to say publicly what he has been, saying privately. They were wrong to send troops to Vietnam. (11.38)I propose to speak for only oae minute, and I thank the Leader of the House( Mr Chipp) for giving me one minute to make my point.

320,Mr Charles Jones (Newcastle),"from a Mr Johnson. The honourable member for Mackellar spoke and tabled the letters for one purpose only-to discredit Alderman Peter Morris, the selected and endorsed Labor candiate for the seat of Shortland at the forthcoming Federal election. Mr Morris is a most honourable man. I have known him for many yearsI would say for the best part of 20 years. In that time. I have never seen him do one dishonest thing. He is a well respected alderman of the Newcastle City Council and a well respected businessman in Hamilton. His parents, his brothers and his sisters all hold very responsible positions in the community. One of them is a doctor. These letters were tabled to villify this man, in an tor's name mentioned in the file. He has a attempt to discredit him on the eve of an election. I can get proof to show that this man Johnson, who is a justice of ithe peace, knowingly witnessed a false statutory declaration by a person whom he personally knew. It was not like somebody coming off the street and saying: 'Would you witness my signature? I want to make a statutory declaration; I would like you to witness it as a justice of the peace'. He personally knew the person who allegedly signed the document. This fa the type of man for whom papers are being tabled here in an attempt to villify Alderman Peter Morris, the selected and endorsed Labor candidate. I made an arrangement with the Minister. I thank him for the couple of minutes I have had. I should have liked to take the whole file apart and explain to honourable members just how rotten this man is. If anyone should be prosecuted, it is Johnson for having breached his responsibility as a justice of the peace. I notice a Labor senawrit against the Australian Broadcasting Commission and I am confident that when the matter is heard it will put him on the retired list for the rest of time.

This air is first filtered through higb medical schools in Australia. Lucas Heights Atomic Research Establishment (Question No. 6020) Mr Les Johnson asked the Minister for mission reports the monitor results accordingly. National Development, upon notice: (1) What is the (a) description and (b) quantity amounts of radioactivity representing only small of radioactive waste disposed of from Lucas Heights fractions of those permitted. Atomic Research Establishment. (2) Where is the disposal area for this waste and radioactive waste was buried in a disposal area what is the method of disposal. (3) What containers or protective encasements mately one mile north of the Research Establishare used to prevent contamination. (4) How is the disposal area rendered secure. (5) What is the estimated contamination life of the waste. (6) Is any radioactive waste from the Lucas Heights Establishment dumped at sea; if so, what are the particulars. Sir Reginald Swartz-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a and b) The Commission has disposed ot solid, liquid and gaseous waste from its Research levels of radioactivity. solid radioactive waste has consisted mainly paper, cardboard, plastic sheeting and laboratory which was sealed in fibre drums or bitumen impregnated kraft paper consisted of bulky metal or wrapped in plastic sheeting, and sludges from the liquid waste treatment plant, which were scaled in steel drums. All the above wastes were slightly contaminated with a mixture of radioisotopes, consisting mainly of fission products, natural uranium and a very small low level solid radioactive wastes buried has been 1,670m, containing the small total of 4.2 curies 9 The liquid radioactivity wastes disposed of are contaminants to extremely low levels. The treated are carefully monitored and then discharged via a pipeline to an underwater outlet in the upper Gaseous waste disposed of from the Commission's Establishment has consisted of ventilating efficiency filters and tben discharged to the atmosphere through stacks. Each stack is fitted wilh a radiation monitor and is the subject of a separate discharge authorisation given by the New South Wales Department of Health. The authorisations specify the amounts of radioactivity which may be discharged in 1 13-week period and the ComDischarges in each 13-week period, since the authorisations were issued in 1969, have contained (2) Until November 1968, the low level solid situated in Commonwealth-owned land approximent. Burial was in 10ft deep trenches with at least 3ft of consolidated earth cover. Since then all solid radioactive waste bas been stored at the Research Establishment. (3) The solid radioactive waste was packaged before burial as described in the answer to question (1) above. However, the characteristics of the soil in the disposal area are such that any radioactivity which might be leached from the wastes by ground water would become chemically bound to the soil by an ion exchange process and thereby fixed in position. Consequently no special containment of the wastes, designed to prevent the spread of radioactivity, is considered necessary. A regular programme of sampling, designed to indicate any movement of radioactivity from where it was buried in the disposal area, has detected no such dispersal of radioactivity. (4) The area is surrounded by a security fence and is under surveillance by Commission staff and by Commonwealth Police. (5) The radioactive decay half life of fission products ranges up to a maximum of 30 years for caeshnn-137 and strontium-90. The actinide elements have half lives ranging up to 3.8 X 10* years and the radioactivity in natural uranium has a half fife of 4.5 X 10"" years. However, it must be recognised that the half life is but one of the factors which define any hazard which a radioisotope presents to man. Other factors are: the radiotoxicity which, in the case of the wastes under discussion, falls mostly either into intermediate or low categories; the contained quantity, which in this case is low; the probability of man coming into contact with the material, which again is low. (6) No. I Nuclear Explosions for Pilbara Port (Question No. 6039) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: On what occasions and with what outcome have consultations taken place with the States, other than at the Fisheries Council (Hansard, 16th September 11970, page 1256 and 31st May 1972 1972, page 3391), concerning the proposed use of nuclear power in harbour construction. Sir Reginald Swartz-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Consultations (otber than at the Fisheries CounSeas, was signed in Djakarta on 9th October 1972. cU) concerning the possible use of nuclear explosions for harbour construction have occurred on three occasions. All occasions related to the possible provision of ports to serve iron ore developments in the Pilbara area of Western Australia. Tbe dates, sites affected and the outcomes were: (a) April 1965-February 1966; several sites between Onslow and Cape Preston: discussions lapsed following alterations in the plans of the companies developing the iron ore resources. <b) December 1968-February 1969: Cape Keraudren to serve the Nimingarra deposits: the company did not proceed wilh the Nimingarra project (c) May-July 1969: Cape Preston to serve the Robe River deposits: alternative arrangements for development of the ore reserves led to the discarding of plans for a port at Cape Preston. Australia-Indonesia: Seabed Boundaries (Question No. 6214) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Will Australian and Indonesian technical experts meet in September 1972 to discuss the boundary between Northern Western Australia and Indonesia. (2) If so, on what dates will the meeting take place and will it be conducted on a tripartite basis to include Portugal. (3) Has this matter been the subject of discussion between the Government and the Woodside Burmah consortium; if so, when were the discussions held and what policies resulted. (4) Is Portugal supporting Indonesia in seeking a median line between the Australian coast and Timor. (5) If these countries are successful, will the median line pass through a number of permit areas granted by either the Western Australian or the Commonwealth Governments. (6) Which of these two governments has jurisdiction over these permit areas. (7) What is the exact geographical location of these permit areas, and are they currently subject to farm-out or proposed farm-out agreement. (8) What is the (a) maximum and (b) minimum distance claimed by the Government in respect of the proposed boundary line from (i) the north-western Australian coast and (ii) Timor. (9) Can he say whether drilling operations are taking place within the area between the proposed median line and Timor; if so, what companies are involved, and what is their exact geographical location of operation. Sir Reginald Swartz-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1 and 2) FoUowing negotiations between the Governments of Australia and Indonesia in early October, an agreement establishing seabed boundaries in the area of the Timor and Arafura The text of the Agreement, and a map showing the agreed boundaries were tabled by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the House of Representatives on 10th October 1972. (3) In 19'68 B.O.C. of Australia Ltd made representations to the Government with regard to offshore petroleum permits which might be affected by any seabed agreement with Indonesia. The Government undertook to keep the interests of the company in mind in any such agreement (4) Portuguese Government has not made known its position. (5, 6, 7 and 8) See (1) and (2) above. Northern Territory. Permits P.2, P.7, P.8, P.9, P. 13, P. 15, have been affected by the new Agreement.

None of these permits is subject to farmout or proposed farmout agreements. (9) One well (Brown Gannet No. 1) is currently drilling in the area referred to. The position of the well is lautude 12° 05' 27"", longitude 123"" 51' 23"" and is being drilled by Arco (Australia) Ltd.

(Hansard, 16th August 1972, page 278). Sir Reginald Swartz-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Queensland Government has sought advice from the Commonwealth Government on whether the Ross River Dam would be eligible for consideration for financial assistance under the Nalional Programme. Telephones: Outstanding Applications (Question No. 6305) Dr Patterson asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice: (2) What was the date and estimated cost of each submission.

Details necessary for a proper evaluation of each project did not accompany all submissions. The Commonwealth Government has usually left it to the individual States lo decide whether to make public the fact that a project has been submitted for consideration under the Programme.

Everard Park: Purchase for Aborigines (Question No. 6529) Mr WaHis asked the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts, upon notice* As the Commonwealth Government has finalised plans for the purchase of Everard Park In South Austraha for Aboriginal purposes, what plans have been formulated to develop this property for the benefit of the Aboriginal people in the area. ourable member's question is as follows: The purchase of the Everard Park station in South Australia by the Commonwealth Government has been completed. The Aboriginal people associated with Everard Park have indicated that they wish to continue to operate the property as a pastoral undertaking. For this purpose it is contemplated that an Aboriginal operating company will be formed, but details are to be worked out in consultation with the Aboriginal community and the South Australian authorities. The Aboriginal community will be assisted in the undertaking by an Adelaide-based firm of pastoral consultants, which has prepared a development plan. To make possible the continued operation of the property as a pastoral undertaking, I have approved Ihe provision of loan finance from the Capita] Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises and morefinancewill be provided for additional stock, equipment and improvements in accordance with tbe recommended programme for the development of the property. Brisbane Airport: Re-siting Proposal (Question No. 6535) Mr Keogh asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) Has the Government decided to re-site the Brisbane Airport in accordance with the siting and general recommendations of the Advisory Committee's report, proposal 'Q\ (2) If so, when will the proposal for site works Customs and Excise, upon notice: be considered by the Public Works Committee.

Sir Reginald Swartz-The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following sibility. answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) At the request of the Prime Minister all Commonwealth Departments concerned, in co-operation with State and City of Brisbane interests, are completing the engineering and environmental studies as a matter of urgency. Some $600,000 of investigation are involved. Those studies are well under way; some have been completed. Prompt consideration will be given to the proposal as a whole immediately the results of all these supplementary studies and other technical reviews are available. (3) Eliminating existing aircraft noise problems is one of the main issues which has received the attention of all concerned in developing alternative airport plans for Brisbane and in the Advisory Committee's recommendation in favour of what has become known as Concept Q. All alternatives considered have been north of the Brisbane River and do not involve significant noise nuisance in the Electorate of Bowman. Brisbane Airport: Re-siting Proposal (Question No. 6536) Mr Keogh asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) In relation to the proposed, re-siting of Brisbane Airport, has consideration been given to the criticism by the ex-President of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, Captain Holt, to the positioning of the main runways, and his suggestion that they should be slightly re-aligned. (2) If so, has any decision been made in regard to changing the position of these runways. Sir Reginald Swartz-The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the. following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) Additional to the publicreleaseof the Commonwealth/State/City pf Brisbane Advisory Committee's Report on Brisbane's future airport needs earlier this year, the Department has referred to all major aviation interests, including the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, a summary of all the factors which had to be considered in achieving a new safe airport concept for Brisbane. That paper is now being discussed.

(5) Can the high alcohol minimum requirements be fairly compared to a compulsory minimum tar or nicotine content in tobacco products. able member's question is as follows: (1) No. Section 13 of the Spirits Act provides the Fund in recent years as will be seen the owner of spirits, which have apparently become unfit for human consumption whilst still under the control of Customs, with an alternative means of disposal. Under other provisions of both the Customs Act and the Excise Act the duty liable on tbe spirits would be remitted upon the destruction of those goods. The Spirits Act Year provision allows such spirit to be methyjated and subsequently used for industrial purposes. (2) Not applicable in view of (1). (3) No. (4) Neither the Customs Tarifl nor other Cus1971-72 toms legislation would act to prohibit the importation of any potable spirits because of the particular alcoholic content of that spirit. However, before any potable spirit is marketed it I refer now to investment in housing. It is would be necessary that it comply with any not the current policy of the board to relevant State Government legislation. (5) I. see no basis for comparison between the vidual home-owners but rather to lend to strength at which particular alcoholic beverages are marketed and the tar or nicotine content of institutions which specialise in detailed tobacco products. Superannuation Fund 29th August 1972, the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr Keating) asked for information related to the investment of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund. On the following day I provided certain answers which led to a further statement and additional inquiries by the honourable member. I undertook to examine the request of the honourable member that details of mortgage investments by the board should be tabled in the House; this inquiry was broadened to cover 2 other aspects of his question-the possibility of low interest loans by the board and financial support which may be given to housing and related services. The matter of tabling of details of mortgage loans by the Superannuation Board has been raised on a number of occasions. As a statutory corporation the board enters into its commercial transactions on a confidential investor-client basis. To table the details of mortgage loans, as suggested, would not only be a serious breach of confidentiality in respect of past transactions and contrary to an established 20195/72-R-[121 ] practice of lending institutions but must prejudice the board in future lending activities. As to the question of low interest rates, the President has confirmed that the board does not invest in commercial loans at low interest rates. The established policy is to achieve the best available rates at a particular time; this has been reflected in consistent improvement in earning rates of from the following table: Assessed Mortgage earning rate loan rates for fund Per cent Per cent 1969-70 7.508.75 5.88 1970-71 7.759.75 6.09 8.50-10.0 0 6.43 enter into direct housing loans with indihousing loan administration. The board has invested some $16m at semi-government private loan rates with housing authorities of the Commonwealth and States, while $166m have been lent to governmental authorities for such services as water, sewerage, drainage, gas and electricity. These investments constitute a significant contribution to improved housing facilities in the States and Territories of the Commonwealth. I should add, for the purposes of the record, that the amount of $3 6.5m mentioned by the honourable member on 30th August 1972 (Hansard, page 880) was the amount of fhe total of first mortgages in New South Wales and not 'other than mortgages on land', as stated. It is also necessary to state that mortgage investments by the board are secured by specific changes in the form of first legal mortgages over commercial property; they do not take the form of an equitable mortgage, by way of a floating charge over the assets of the borrowers, which the honourable member was apparently led to believe.",137,Answers To Questions Upon Notice

Sir Alan Hulme-The answer to the available and it would be technically impracticable honourable member's question is as folfor most of the stations included in the seventh lows: The relevant information for most of the tion of other stations, not only, in relation to the stations concerned is set out in the table seventh stage stations but also in relation to existhereunder.

(b) The actual or proposed radiation pattern of the station is directional. The details shown in columns one and two are those in the direction of maximum radiation. (c) The distance of expected satisfactory reception is based on average reception conditions, with flat unobstructed paths between the transmitting location and the receiver. As a general rule, viewers residing in more distant parts of the areas expected to be covered, and also viewers in any areas which are shielded by topographical or other features from the transmitting location will need to use special receiving aerials. The use of special receiving aerials may also enable some of the population beyond the distances indicated in column two to achieve reasonable reception particularly if there is a clear path to the transmitting station. (d) If high powered stations, providing a service within a radius of some 60 miles of the transmitting and costing of the order of $600,000, were established at the stage 7 station sites, it is to be noted that there would be considerable overlap of service areas, not only between the stage 7 stations but, in some cases, there would also be overlap with existing stations. In calculating the additional populations shown in column four, the population falling in overlap areas has been apportioned between the stations concerned and lhe population served by existing stations has been excluded.

Charles Edward Barnes, (b) Hon. Rendle McNeilage Holten, (c) Hon. Peter James Nixon, (d) Hon. Andrew Sharp Peacock, (e) Senator the Hon. Sir Kenneth McColl Anderson, (f) Senator the Hon. Robert Carrington Cotton, (g) Senator the Hon. Thomas Charles Drake-Brockman and (h) Senator the Hon. Reginald Charles Wright. Sir Alan Hulme-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I have been informed by the Acting Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Mr cern in mind. The Committee's role is an advisory A. G. Lowndes, that the ABC does not keep records of invitations to appear in ABC programmes which are declined. Immigration Policy (Question No. 6539) Mr Calwell asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the declaration, signed by Professor E. G. Saint who was Dean of the Faculty of Medicine in the University of Queensland, which appeared in the 'West Australian' on 20th November 1963, in support of a claim that Australia's immigration policy needed reappraisal so that our reslrictiveness able for registration without further examination. should balance a regard for our national interests with some concern for the susceptibilities of our coloured neighbours; if so, why was Professor Saint appointed a member of the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications in March 1969. (2) Is the Government satisfied that Professor Saint, as a member of the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications, has acted in such a way as to preserve the high medical standards of Australia and that he has supported the decisions of branches of the Australian Medical Association and the various medical boards to make sure that Charge of Tourist Activities, upon notice: Indian and Pakistani doctors who possess only the highest qualifications are admitted to practise in Australia. (3) Will he make available that part of any Airways International in which it was stated that recent report of the Committee on Overseas Proit was approved by the Australian Tourist Comfessional QuaUfications which deals specifically mission. with the medical qualifications, now demanded or to be demanded, of medical practitioners seeking to be admitted to Australia from India, Pakistan, Uganda and the Caribbean Islands. able member's question is as follows: (1) No. The Government has every confidence the professional and personal capability and integrity of Professor Saint. His distinguished career indicates that his professional colleagues share this confidence. Professor Saint's career in Britain and Australia has been centred on medical teaching and research but included a 3 year term as a flying doctor in Western Australia. He is at present Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Queensland, Chairman of the Advisory Medical Council of Australia, nominee of the Universities on the National Health and Medical Research Council and a Councillor of the Royal Australian College of Physicians. The Government considers Professor Saint an eminently suitable person to be a member of the Commiitee on Overseas Professional Qualifications. (2) At the time of the establishment of the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications it was very clearly stated in this House that a cardinal feature of the Committee's operation would be its concern to maintain professional standards in Australia. The Government is satisfied that Professor Saint, as a member of the Committee, has acted at all times wilh this conone and it has no authority to impose its views or decisions on the various bodies responsible for the recognition of qualifications in Australia. In the profession of medicine the responsible authorities are the medical boards in each of the States and Territories. Information about action which the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications has been taking in regard to the medical profession is given in pages 12 and 13 of the Third Report of the Committeea copy of which was sent to all members recently. (3) I will send separately to tlie honourable member a copy of the recently published Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications booklet 'Medicine in Australia'. This booklet sets out the requirements for the registration of medical practitioners in the States and Territories and lists the overseas medical qualifications which are acceptChanges in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and South Australia since the booklet was printed have necessitated the deletion of a number of these qualifications.

(2) How many volunteers were rejected on medical or other grounds. able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) 1,222 men who volunteered for service under the National' Service Act were enlisted in the Regular Army Supplement in the 1970-71 and 1971-72 financial years. During the same period 787 men who had volunteered were found not to meet the standards required by the Army. Immigration: Mr V. A. Kolesnik and Family (Question No. 6502) Dr Khignroan asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: (1) Has he received an application from Vladimir Andreyevich Kolesnik and his family, formerly of Kiev, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and now of Vienna, Austria, to enter Australia as permanent immigrants. (2) Can he say whether Mr Kolesnik was formerly conductor and managing director of the Kiev Opera. (3) Will he give favourable consideration to this the honourable member's question: application from a political refugee. (4) Will he ignore any representations to prevent Mr Kolesnik's admission as part of a bargain to obtain USSR support for Australia's election to the Security Council of the United Nations. able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) I understand that Mr Kolesnik was formerly conductor/director of the Kiev Opera. (3) Thc application is under consideration and enquiries concerning it are proceeding. Due weight will certainly be given to the humanitarian factors involved. (4) The decision to allow a person to enter Australia is based on the individual merits of the case alone. It is unthinkable that such a decision would be influenced in the manner suggested by the honourable member. Child-minding Centres (Question No. 6545) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Did a survey conducted by his Department in 1969 estimate that an additional 100,000 women would join the work force if adequate child-minding centres were available. (2) Does he expect the Child Care Bill to provide these facilities. (3) If so, (a) how many additional women are now likely to join the work force and (b) where will they find jobs. able member's question is as follows: (1) The survey to which the honourable member refers was conducted, not by my Department, but by the Commonweallh Bureau of Census and Statistics in May 1969, as part of its quarterly population survey sample. According to the survey 102,800 females who were not in the labour force but who had children in their care indicated that they would have worked if suitable child care arrangements had been available. (2) and (3) The Child Care Scheme is not intended to encourage mothers to enter paid employment, nor to discourage them from doing so. Rather it is aimed at meeting an existing problem, that is to help the children of working and other parents insofar as they are deprived of proper child care either because good quality facilities are not available or because the cost is presently too high. Institute of the Law of the Sea (Question No. 3620) Mr Whitlam asked the Attorney General, upon notice: Where, when, by whom and with what result was consideration last given to establishing an institute of the law of the sea. (Hansard, 6th May 1971, page 2707). MrN . H . Bowen-The Attorney-General has supplied the following answer to Consideration was given to this matter in 1970 by the Attorney-General's Department and the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Treasury and Defence, and the Public Service Board. The proposal was not proceeded with at that time. The Commonwealth is well served in law of the sea matters by the Solicitor-General and officers within the Commonwealth Public Service. In 1971 the Attorney-General's Department, by arrangement with the University concerned, engaged the services of a University lawyer for a term of years as a Special Assistant in International Law. While the arrangements provided in the normal course of Government administration have functioned effectively, the Government will continue to keep in mind whether those arrangements could at any time be usefully supplemented by the establishment of a Law of the Sea Institute. One important consideration would be the availability of suitable personnel",149,Nature Of Administration Sponsorship And Assistance For Tertiary Studies

343,Mr Lynch,"The answer to the honourAboriginals: Child Brides (Question No. 6022) Mr Les Johnson asked the Minister for the Interior, upon notice: (1) Do some Aboriginal men in the Northern Territory pursue a custom of taking promised girls as child brides. (2) If so, what is the official altitude of the Northern Territory Administration to this practice. (3) Is it an offence for an Aboriginal male to have carnal knowledge of a young Aboriginal girl in the Northern Territory. (4) What carnal knowledge prosecutions have been preferred against Aboriginal males practising the child bride custom during each of the last 5 years. (5) What protection is extended to girls so exploited. (6) What are the legal obligations of an Aboriginal male whose relationship with a young Aboriginal girl results in the birth of a child. (7) Is the Welfare Branch of the Northern Tergiven : '. ritory Administration taking any action to discourage the child bride practice; if so, what are the details and when will the Administration invoke the appropriate laws against offenders. able member's question is as follows: (1) to (7) The promissory system of marriage is important in traditional Aboriginal society as a means of ensuring continuation of family and clan groupings and of preserving and developing group affinities through inter-marriage. The promoffence against a 12 year old. girl at Bathurst issory system is still widely practised in many communities and any precipitate a'ction aimed at destroying it would provoke resentment from Aborigines. The official atutude in the Northern Territory is to discourage the promissory system in an unobtrusive way with the objective of reaching a stage where there is general acceptance by communities to abandoning the practice. If it is known that a girl objects to meeting a marriage obligation she is assisted to live away from home for a time to avoid pressures from her community. If necessary she is placed in the custody and care of the Director of Social Welfare. It is an offence in Territory law for any person to have carnal knowledge of a female under the statutory age. Because of the general acceptance and practice of early marriage of Aboriginal girls it is not realistic to expect enforcement of the statutory law in this regard through legal sanctions. Charges were prosecuted in 8 cases in the past 5 years arising from carnal knowledge of underage females outside tribal marriage. There is no discrimination in the law regarding liability of have had that the circumstances of the offence a father to contribute to the support of his chilemanated from or were related to Aboriginal cusdren. It is part of the traditional custom of Abortoms. iginal people that the clan or family group support its own members and the need for a mother to seek maintenance orders does not arise in these circumstances. Judges' Salaries (Question No. 6325) Mr Daly asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) What are the (a) salaries, (b) allowances, (c) travelling facilities and (d) expenses of (i) Justices of the High Court, (ii) Judges of the Northern Territory, Supreme Court, (iii) Judges in Bankruptcy, (iv) Industrial Court Judges and (v) Presidential Members and Commissioners of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission at this date. (2) What is the pension contribution and entitlement in each case. Mr N. H. Bowen-The Attorney General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The honourable member is referred to the answers given to questions previously asked by bim (Hansard, 12th August 1969, page 153, and 11 and 12th September 1969, pages 1260, 1261, 1964 and 1265). There has been no change in the information he seeks since those answers were Aboriginals: Child Brides (Question No. 6376) Mr Les Johnson asked the Minister for the Interior, upon notice: (1) Did His Honour Mr Justice Forster in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory recently find an adult made Aboriginal,' named Leon Puruntatameri, guilty of a -carnal knowledge Island. (2) Was the defendant placed on a 2 year good behaviour bond.

(4) Is the practice of taking promised girls as child brides still practised by the. Aboriginal community at Bathurst Island. (5) Are charges usually preferred against men who have relations with juveniles who are promised brides or is special dispensation from the laws in the Northern Territory extended to Aboriginal men who follow this tribal custom.

Trade Marks (Question No. 6403) Mr Kennedy asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: What is the estimated average time taken to register a trade mark from the date of application. . MrN . H. Bowen-The Attorney General has provided the following answer Trade Marks and no one commences opposition to the honourable member's question: What period of time elapses between the maktbe date of lodgement of an application for regising of an application to register a trade mark and tration of a trade mark to the date of registration Completions by Home Builders' State Housing Authorities Account: Completions Civilian Service and Housing Housing Total purchases(a) .. .. 3,449 556 4,005 2,905 .. .. .. 2,005 215 2,220 1,667 ; (b)I,269 174 (b)l,443 . 496 .. .. .. 1,588 1,588 2,596 .. .. .. 1,250 106 1,356 137 .. .. .. 518 .518 400 10,079 ]fi5l 11,130 8,201 Repayments of Principal Payments of Interest 1945 1956-1966 1945 ' 1956-1966 Agreement Agreement Agreement ' Agreement $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 .. .. .. 2,158 3,659 3,871 22,766 .. .. .. 2,217 2,971 3,982 18,170 .. .. .. 630 946 1,134 6,073 .. .. .. 292 1,694 563 10,641 .. .. .. 625 848 1,148 5,429 .. .. .. .. .. 604 ;. 3,788 5,922 10,722 10,698 66,847 Number of tenants receiving Amount of rebates at rental rebates 30 June 1972 in 1971-72 3,407 765,318 (est.) 2,464 725,136 1,298 313,583 1,569 324,898 (est.) 8,738 2,128,935 the registration of the mark depends on a number of factors. The principal factors are (a) the delay in the applications being considered by an Examiner; (b) whether matters adverse to the application are raised by the Examiner and the time taken in dealing with these matters; and (c) whether the registration of the mark is opposed by an interested person. Where no objection is raised by the Examiner of proceedings, the average time that elapses from is 14 months. Because of the large number of applications awaiting examination, an Examiner's report on an application is not made for approximately 10 months after the date of lodgement of the application. In addition, a period of 3 months after the acceptance of an application, is provided by the Trade Marks Act during which notice of opposition to the registration of the mark may be lodged. Australian Capital Territory: Leasehold Land (Question No. 6421) Mr Enderby asked the Minister for the Interior, upon notice: (1) Has leasehold land in the Australian Capital Terrilory ever been auctioned by reference to the rent to be paid rather than the price or premium to be paid; if so, when and for how long did the practice exist. (2) Was the practice general in its application or specific in relation to certain areas or certain types of Iand. (3) Why was the practice introduced, and what were the reasons put forward at the time for its discontinuance. (4) Will land be cheaper if leases are again auctioned in this way. (5) Are any disadvantages likely to be associated with this proposal. able member's question is as follows: (1) Between 1924 and 1935 Canberra lease buyers bid a capital sum, equal to or in excess of a nominated reserve value, on which they were prepared to pay land rent at the rale of 5 per cent per annum. The sum payable at auction was the first years land rent. (2) to (5) Tbe practice applied to all business In 1935 the system was changed so that any and residential leases offered under the City Area amount bid above the nominated reserve value Leases Ordinance. This form of bidding was part would be payable in cash. of the original administrative system adopted for Canberra leasehold. Tbe effects of this practice and the reasons for changing it are explained in the contemporary reports of the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Board of Review on Canberra valuations for rating purposes. The Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts reported in 1928 that: 'In view of the unsatisfactory situation in April 1970 for the Interstate Standing Commitcreated by the inflated prices paid for land in tee on Uniform Building Regulations, did the SecCanberra, it was strongly represented to the retary of his Department stress that adoption of Committee in evidence mat steps should be the minimum standards by major institutional lentaken to have the land in the city area revalders for housing throughout Australia was imporued. To this end it was recommended by the tant to achieve a worthwhile reduction In the cost Public Service (Canberra) Welfare Committee of home building. that a Board of Review should be created to investigate the whole question. The Committee notes with satisfaction that the Federal Capital ations have accepted the tentative code to date. Commission recently appointed such a body, and that the Board of Review will submit its adopted and enforced. report at an early date. The necessity for a revaluation cannot be too strongly emphasised, for it is quite clear that some investors, particularly at the last sale, displayed more enthusiasm and sentiment than ordinary business prudence, paying prices for land which, in the opinion of the Committee, were far in excess of its true, value. The Committee also notes with pleasure the announcement of the Federal Capital Commission that it has in contemplation legislation in the form of an ordinance which will provide for a more satisfactory and more equitable system of disposing of land than that which has obtained in the past. In this connection tbe Committee considers that, if the policy of sale by auction is to continue, any legislation in contemplation should provide that the fixation of upset prices should be carried out on a definite and sound basis; that the upset prices, not the prices realised, should form the basis of ground rental and rates; and that, where land is sold at a price in excess of the upset price, the excess or premium shall be.paid in cash by the successful bidder. By this means speculation would be discouraged and.the payment of rentals and rates on fictitious values avoided'. In the same year the Board of Review on Canberra valuations for rating purposes stated: ""We consider the prices realised at the last sale in 1927 were in many instances unsound, and that to ensure contracts made being carried out (as forfeited lands are prejudicial to future offerings) suggest that since qn upset price is announced, prices paid above the upset should be, by way of premiums ' in cash-o r terms might be allowed of say one-third cash, balance one and 2 years at 5 per cent.. lf this were done speculation would be reduced to a minimum and we assume that the Commission would prefer a sale which meant the erection of a building, to one at perhaps 50 per cent higher price which was entered into in the hope of being turned over at a profit. Uniform Home Building Code (Question No. (*u>i) Mr Keogh asked the Minister for Housing, upon notice: (1) In the Tentative Uniform Home Building Code prepared by his Department and published (2) Which local authorities and lending organis(3) When will a uniform building code be",152,Melbourne
346,Mr Hunt,"The answer to the honourMr Kevin Cairns-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) As1 explained in an answer on l l t h November 1971, the Tentative Uniform Home Building Code was made available to the Interstate Standing Committee on Uniform Building Regulations late in 1970. It was for the Interstate Committee to decide the standards for home building to be incorporated in its Australian Model Uniform Building Code. (3) I understand that the last portion of the draft Code was forwarded to State Ministers of Local Government on 5th October 1971. It is their prerogative to decide whether, to what extent and when to adopt the Code. Commonwealth Railways: Provision Stores (Question No. 6528) Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Shipreceived ping and Transport, upon notice: As Commonwealth Railways operations resulted in a loss of $2,332,598 during 1971-72, will he state whether the operations of the Commonwealth Railways provision stores operated at a profit or loss during the same year, if so, what was the profit or loss. N.S.W.* (a) Commenced training (b) Completed training * Includes Australian Capital Territory t Includes Northern Territory (c) No records are available which would indicate whether any ex-national serviceman has received a Commonwealth cadetship while studying under the National Service Vocational Training Scheme. Hospital Bed Statistics (Question No. 6036) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: Will the Minister bring up to date the information which a former Minister gave on 12 June 1970 (Hansard, page 3578) on hospital beds. New South Wales: Number of beds Vear 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 able member's question is as follows: The Commonwealth Railways provision, stores operated at a profit during 1971-72. However, it is usual practice that the accounting results of this activity are treated as confidential. The purpose of the stores is to assist employees of Commonwealth Railways and it is not believed that their interests or those of the railways would be served by disclosing the results of their respective operations. National Service Vocational Training Scheme (Question No. 6003) Mr Bennett asked the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice: How many national servicemen have (a) assistance. (b) completed their traimng and (c) received Commonwealth cadetships while studying under the National Service Vocational Training Scheme in each State and Territory since the inception of the Scheme. able member's questions are as follows: Vic.

State New Soutb Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Northern Territory Australian Capital Territory Commonwealth Note-From 1 January 1963, the National Health Act provided for the approval of institutions as either hospitals or nursing homes. Accordingly, private hospitals which prior to that date were not recognised for the purposes of Special Account benefit under the Act were automatically approved under the National Health Act as nursing homes. This explains the reductions in the numbers of private hospital beds after 1962.

The Council noted the problems of Aborigines living in camps on the outskirts of towns in various parts of Australia, and that pilot schemes were planned in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. The Council noted the Commonwealth intended, where appropriate, to provide funds to acquire properties in the States and Commonwealth Territories for the benefit of Aboriginal communities, as announced by the Prime Minister on Australia Day this year. The Ministers agreed the acquisitions could involve the purchase of leasehold or freehold properties, and would be carried out in consultation whh the State concerned or the Department of the Interior. The State Ministers called for the allocation of a greater proportion of national resources this year to meet the needs of Aboriginal citizens. They argued that if programmes were to have a real impact, the level of the Commonwealth grants should be increased dramatically. Ministers discussed the matter of sites of special significance and agreed that there was vital need for a consistent approach in legislation and collaboration ta the administration of provisions for the protection of sites. This decision was made to ensure that Aboriginal heritage and culture were preserved, as sought by the Aboriginal people. Recognising that this need was particularly pressing in the Central Australian reserves areas, they endorsed the proposal by South Australia that the Office of Aboriginal Affairs arrange a meeting of the South Australian, Western Australian and Northern Territory authorities concerned with these sites in the Central Reserves area. It was noted that other States were concerned with similar problems and would be invited to participate. The State Ministers commended the effects of the Aboriginal Secondary Grants scheme and recommended its extension to cover all Aboriginal secondary school children. They welcomed the progress being made in extending opportunities for pre-schooling to more Aboriginal children. The Ministers agreed that the provision of family planning advice and services was important and recommended further support of voluntary organisations to supplement Government programmes of family planning advice for Aboriginal mothers. The Council supported the national Aboriginal Advisory Conference held in Canberra on August 10th and llth as the best means available of obtaining a truly representative expression of Aboriginal views. Ministers expressed concern about the continuing high level of Aboriginal unemployment and underemployment. It was recommended that the Commonwealth arrange a study of the position of Aborigines on missions and settlements, designed to recommend procedures for dealing with employment problems on a basis equally applicable to Aborigines in all parts of Australia. Ministers reported on the significant benefits observable in areas where Special Work Projects Schemes had been funded through grants to the States by the Commonwealth. Ministers endorsed the scheme because as well as providing employment, it yielded significant social and training benefits, and recommended that the Commonwealth be urged to provide substantially more funds for Special Work Projects. (J) (a) Commonwealth Laws: Section 423A of the Navigation Act has been repealed. It is proposed tp seek repeal of Section 64 of the Migration Act as soon as is practicable, (b) State Laws: Queensland-The Aborigines. Act 1971, which repeals both The Aborigines' aria Torres Strait : Islanders' Affairs Act of 1965-1967 and paragraph (ii) of sub-section (1) of section 4 of the Vagrants, Gaming, and Other Offences Act 19311971, was-passed by the Queensland Parliament late in 1971 and is to be proclaimed as soon as regulations have been prepared, ' Western. Australia-The Native Welfare Act, 1963, has been repealed by the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act, 1971. The provisions of sections 150 and 151 of the Licensing Act; 1911-1968 were included as section"" 130 of the Liquor Act, 1979. The section has not been repealed but has been 'inoperative since July 1971 when action was taken 'tri remove restrictions on Aborigines' access to,, liquor in Western Australia.' The Native (Citizenship Rights) Act, 1944-64 was repealed in 1971. '. -1 Repatriation: Boer War and World WarI Veterans (Question No. 6151) Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice: (1) How many veterans of (a) the Boer War and (b) World WarI are still alive. (2) What would be the cost of extending repatriation benefits to all survivors. (3) Does the Government regard , this figure as beyond its resources. (4) If not, will it extend repatriation benefits to all survivors. able member's questions are as follows: (1) (a) less than 200; (b) approximately 66,700. (2) A precise cost estimate is not possible but on the best available information as to current costs and the numbers who would be eligible the estimated cost of providing Repatriation medical and hospital care would be approximately $7.08m annually plus additional capital expenditure in Repatriation institutions. (3) and (4) The Government has rejected this, and similar proposals, as a matter of principle rather than cost. Repatriation legislation already provides full medical and hospital care for war-related disabilities suffered by Word War I",158,Private Hospitals Number S Of Beds As At 30 June

When such veterans are pensioned at the 100 per cent rate, or at special higher rates, they are also entitled to treatment (other than prolonged in-patient treatment for chronic conditions) in respect of disabilities that are not war-related. Those veterans of the Boer War and World WarI whose means are limited can qualify for service pensions that entitle them to treatment for nonwar-related disabilities under the same conditions. To extend these facilities to all Boer War and World WarI ex-servicemen would benefit only those veterans who are neither seriously incapacitated from war-related disabilities nor in financial need. Home Nursing Organisations (Question No. 6205) Br Klugman asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) What are the names and addresses of the home nursing organisations eligible for subsidies which were established (a) before September 1956 and (b) subsequently, (2) How many nurses are employed by each of these organisations. (3) How many of these nurses have their salaries subsidised by the Commonwealth.

(2) The total number of nurses employed by each organisation as at 30th June 1972 is shown in the schedules. In the case of organisations established before September 1956, the number of nurses employed over and above the number employed at that date is also shown. The numbers of nurses given include the full-time equivalents of part-time nurses employed. (3) Under the Home Nursing Subsidy Act 1956, eligible organisations receive subsidies to assist in providing home nursing services. As the legislation was enacted to encourage either the expansion of existing home nursing services or the establishment of new services, subsidies are determined on the basis of the number of nurses employed over and above the number employed in September 1956 in the case of organisations in existence at that date and, in the case of services established since that date, on the basis of all nurses employed in home nursing. In the former case annual subsidy is determined on the basis of $4,300 for each additional nurse employed and, in the latter, $2,150 for each nurse employed.

As at 3 Ist April, the most recent date for which exact figures are available, $965,000 had been given to Bangladesh. An estimated total figure for private donations to date for both the refugees and for Bangladesh is $4m. 2. It is not possible accurately to estimate the freight and administrative costs of the total aid given by the Government, although it will be noted that $710,000 was spent on freight on aid for the refugees in India and $510,000 has been spent on freight on aid items for Bangladesh. No assessment has been made for administrative costs which are not included in the sums pledged.

The Government has not, up to this time, seen fit to introduce any amendments to the law designed to abrogate the effects of the Bray decision, but the need for general remedial legislation to counter avoidance of the gift duty provisions will be considered in due course. Colleges of Advanced Education: Victoria (Question No. 6169) Mr Kennedy asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: (1) Do the total capital and recurrent funds approved before the end of June 1972 by the State and Commonwealth Governments for Victoria's 5 country Colleges of Advanced Education for the 1973-73 triennium represent a cut of 50 per cent on the total funds requested on their behalf by the Victoria Institute of Colleges. (2) If so, (a) will this cut have a severe effect on the planned growth of these colleges through a restriction of building programmes, new courses, and student intake and (b) what steps has he taken to provide additional funds to enable these colleges to implement their plans for development. Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable follows: (1) and (2) The Commonwealth Government approved in full the recommendations of the Australian Commission on Advanced Educalion in respect of involved colleges in all States for the 1973-75 triennium. Before framing its recommendation to the Commonwealth and State Governments the Commission had thorough discussions with college authorities, the State co-ordinating bodies (including the Victoria Institute of Colleges) and State Ministers for Education and State Treasury officers. In accordance with its aim to promote a balanced development between the colleges of advanced education in Australia, the Comniission has presented what it believes to lie a fair and equitable distribution of available resources among the colleges. Payment for Petroleum Products (Question No. 6105) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Supply, upon notice: <1) What were the total payments made to each oil company for the supply of petroleum products to mentalities and the Armed Services in the latest year for which statistics are available. (2) To which companies, in which areas and for what period have current contracts been let for the supply of petroleum products. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) The information sought on actual payments would be obtainable in detail only from each of the Commonwealth Departments and Instrumentalities using petroleum products. No central record of expenditure is kept. However, from estimated usage figures adopted in letting period contracts by the 2 main Commonwealth contracting authorities, viz. the Contract Board of the Department of Supply and the Commonwealth Stores Supply and Tender Board, for the supply of these products an estimate of the aggregate annual value of usage has been assessed as follows: Company Sm Golden Fleece Petroleum, Victoria 7.800 Shell Co. of Aust. Ltd, Victoria 7.414 B.P. (Aust.) Ltd, Victoria 6.684 Caltex Oil (Aust.) Pty Ltd. New South Wales 5.511 Mobil Oil (Aust.) Ltd, Victoria 4.361 Esso Standard Oil (Aust.)

The best conveniently available estimate of total annual payments by these bodies to oil companies is of the order of $16 million. Any further detail or greater accuracy would require extensive enquiry amongst all Departments and Instrumentalities. (2) The table below shows the Companies, areas and periods of current contracts let by the Contract Board of the Department of Supply.

Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the met the cost of them. honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Fees for children attending pre-schools in in water and (c) in the atmosphere. the A.C.T. vary from suburb to suburb. This occurs because the provision of pre-school educain (a) Australia and (b) the Pacific area which tion is a joint venture between the Commonmay have been caused by radiation. weaUh which provides the buildings and the salaries for staff and parents associations which meet the other operating costs of the pre schools. Individual parents associations decided what fees ourable member's question is as follows: they will set. The average fees for established pre schools vary from $6-88 per term for attendance at 3 half-day sessions per week. Fees for 2 halfday sessions per week range between $4-56 per tests in the Pacific in 1967, the French Ministry term.

International Labour Organisation Conventions: Application to Singapore (Question No. 6340) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: Which International Labour Organisation Conventions had Britain applied to Singapore before the Cocos (Keeling) Islands ceased to form part of that colony. MrN . H . Bowen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Convention No. 29 Forced Labour 1930. Convention No. 50 Recruiting of Indigenous Workers 1936. Convention No. 64 Contracts of Employment (Indigenous Workers) 1939. Convention No. 65 Penal Sancations (Indigenous Workers) 1939. Convention No. 84 Right of Association (NonMetropolitan Territories) 1947. Convention No. 85 Labour Inspectorates (NouMetropolitan Territories) 1947. National AnthemI (Question No. 6362) Mr Calwell asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that both Canada and New Zealand have a separate National Anthem as well as 'Goa* Save The Queen'. (2) If so, why cannot Ausualia have its own National Anthem as well as 'God Save The Queen'. (3) If there is no valid objection to an Australian Anthem, when does the Government intend to give the people of Australia an opportunity to produce an Australian equivalent to 'La Marseillaise' and 'The Star Spangled Banner'. honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In 1967 the Canadian Parliament endorsed a recommendation that 'God Save Thc Queen' be",188,Example

(2) My Department, together with the Department of Defence and tbe Parliamentary Counsel, has been working for some time, on, but has not yet submitted proposals relating to, a draft Royal Warrant which would provide for proposed AusUalian regulations for submission to The Queen. Independent Schools Survey (Question No. 6384) Mr Kennedy asked the Ministerf o r Education and Science, upon notice: How many private non-Catholic schools in (a) each State and Territory and (b) the Commonwealth which (i) did not submit returns lo questionnaires which his Department sent out in the 1970-71 survey of the needs of independent schools and (ii) sent in returns too late to have their data included in the survey were (A) special schools and (B) other schools traditionally categorised as grammar schools and colleges.

This does not, of course, allow for men who are not required to register because, for example, they are serving in the Permanent Forces or have already served for more than 18 months, migrants who arrived after the registration date for their age-group and men temporarily resident in Australia, including shortterm visitors and overseas students.

(3) There is no precise time-table laid down in relation to prosecution action nor, given the diversity of circumstances arising in individual cases, is it considered' there can or should be. Private Schools Survey (Question No. 6385) Mr Kennedy asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: (1) Did he communicate with any private schools in any way to request that they not participate in the survey which his Department made in 1970-71 into the needs of private schools. (2) If so, with which schools did be communicate for this purpose, and why. Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) See answer to (1). Racial Discrimination (Question No. 6417) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) Did Australia advise the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 27th October 1971, in the course of the International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, that active consideration was being given by the Commonwealth and State Governments to the removal of the few remaining elements of legislation which may not be compatible with the provisions of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. (2) If so, which elements in the legislation of the Commonwealth or any State were considered at that time to be incompatible with the provisions of the Convention and what action has since been, or is now being, taken in each Parliament to remove those elements. Mr N. H. Bowen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) (a) Commonwealth Legislation: The relevant provisions were as follows: Section 64 of the Migration. Act 1958-1966. Section 423A of the Navigation Act 19121970. Section4 of the Native Members of the Forces Benefits Act 1957-1968. Section 423A of the Navigation Act was repealed by the Navigation Act 1972. It is proposed to repeal Section 64 of the Migration Act when tbe next bill to amend the Migration Act is introduced. Legislation is before the Parliament to provide that Australian Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, now receiving war compensation and associated benefits under the Native Members of the Forces Benefits Act 1957-1968, will receive these benefits under the Repatriation Act 19201972. (b) State Legislation: The following State laws were considered to contain provisions that were, or could be regarded as, incompatible with the Convention: Queensland The Aborigines' and Torres Strait Islanders' Affairs Act 1965-1967 and the Regulations thereunder. Western Australia Firearms and Guns Act 1931-1969. Gold Buyers Act 1921-1961. Liquor Act 1970. Mining Act 1904-1970. In Queensland the Aborigines Act 1971 and the Torres Strait Islanders Act 1971 have been enacted and upon their coming into force will replace the Aborigines' and Torres Strait Islanders' Affairs Act. However, the new legislation does not fully satisfy the requirements of the Convention. In Western Australia the only discriminatory provision in the Firearms and Guns Act was repealed in 1971. I understand that the Western Australian authorities propose to seek the repeal of the discriminatory element in the Gold Buyers Act. In regard to the Liquor Act, since lst July. 1971 there has been no prohibition concerning the consumption of liquor by Aborigines. I am also informed that a new Mining Act is being examined by fhe Western Australian Parliament and that it does not contain any provisions which are discriminatory on racial grounds. Private Schools: Commonwealth Aid (Question No. 6424) Mr Kennedy asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: (1) Does his reply to question No. 4971 (Hansard, 9th May 1972, page 2265) mean that no formal request has been made to him in 1971 or 1972 by private school authorities for an increase in Commonwealth aid to private schools.

In Tasmania, the diseases had been virtually, eliminated. From January 1970, the Commonwealth agreed to participate with the States in a National Campaign over the triennium lst January 1970 to 31st December 1972, on the following basis: (i) the Commonwealth would match thc combined expenditure of the mainland States in the triennium; (ii) in view of past efforts made by Tasmania, the Commonwealth would bear, during the triennium, all costs associated with the Campaign in that Slate in excess of the first $50,000; (iii) the Commonwealth accepted responsibility for costs of the Campaign in the Northern Territory; (iv) the States would undertake to maintain at least their 1968-69 level of activity on eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis, and, if possible, to intensify their activities further.

Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Catholic Offices of Education in each State and Territory provided one return each in which details for all schools in that State or Territory were summarised. Consequently there are no details available for individual schools. Natural Gas (Question No. 6477) Mr Whitlam asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: In relation to the supply of natural gas to Sydney, bas the Government given consideration to requesting trie New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian Governments or any of them to confer witb it pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding dated 16th October 1967. ourable member's question is as follows: I am informed that the Memorandum of Understanding dated 16th October 1967 is in the form of an annex to the Agreement between the Commonwealth and the States of Australia relating to the Exploration for, and Exploitation of, the ability of Australian wheats for a wide range of Petroleum Resources, and certain other Resources, of the Continental Shelf of Australia and of certain Territories of the Commonwealth and of certain other Submerged Land. The Memorandum of Understanding relates to trade between the States and between the States and Territories in petroleum products from offshore areas to which the joint Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967-68 applies. The Memorandum records the agreement of the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States that they would encourage and would declared their common intention not to discriminate against any such trade and that they would confer from time to time as any of them requests. I am advised that as the Memorandum of Understanding relates specifically to offshore reserves it is not applicable to petroleum including natural gas, recovered onshore-as for example from the Cooper Basin for supply to Sydney. There is, however, opportunity for regular discusCouncil. Moreover, my colleague, the Minister for National Development, has recently had discussions with State Government Ministers in all States in regard to natural gas, and maintains a close liaison with them. At this time no matters have arisen in this regard which appear likely to require a conference between the Governments of the CommonweaUh, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Australian Wheat Board: Orders (Question No. 6494) Mr Kennedy asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) What countries have made requests to purchase wheat from Australia since lst January 1972 which the Australian Wheat Board has (a) not accepted and (b) met only partially. (2) What is the quantity of wheat involved in each category in each and all of these cases. able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) In the nature of its business, the Australian Wheat Board receives a large number of requests for price quotations and for offers to supply wheat. Many of these are in the nature of tentative inquiries made with the intention of sounding out the market. Some importing countries call tenders for the supply of wheat. Offers against such tenders are a normal part of the Board's business but if the Board refrains from offering against any particular tender it does not follow that it thereby loses business which might otherwise have resulted. The Board has not sat back and waited for requests from buyers. It has widened its selling base and enhanced its reputation as a world wheat trader by diligent pursuit of market opportunities, by following up leads for developing new outlets and by demonstrating effectively the suitend uses.",193,Tuberculosis And Brucellosis Eradication Campaign Expenditur E

Navy Inspection Services (Question No. 6503) MrM c l v o r asked the Ministerf o r Supply, upon notice: (1) In relation to the inspection duties carried out by the various Naval inspection branches on overseas contracts for Australian equipment manufactured by his Department, is it a fact that a percentage of the total value of these foreign contracts is allocated to pay for inspection duties by the Department of the Navy. (2) If so, what is the percentage and how much does this amount to in actual money terms on contracts held currently by his Department. (3) Is this money being allocated to the Naval inspection branches concerned with this work; if not, why not. (4) If the money is not being allocated to the branches concerned, will he give a firm undertaking that the moneys aUocated in respect of contracts now held and any similar future contracts will be diverted to the Naval inspection branches concerned with these contracts as soon as possible, thus ensuring that this equipment can be delivered with the highest standard of Australian workmanship. ourable member's question is as follows: <1) Charges are included to cover Navy inspection. (2) It is not the practice to divulge such infor1966-67 mation as it could result in disadvantage to the Commonwealth. (3) and (4) No. Receipts for this purpose ate paid to consolidated revenue from which the Navy Inspection Service is financed. Any additional effort by the Navy Inspection Service would need to be provided for by appropriation through normal Budget processes. Drought Relief (Question No. 6515) Mr Grassby asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Did the Commonwealth Government refuse requests for assistance for drought relief made by 1971, 8th July 1971, 9th November 1971 and Sth July 1972.

(2) The Premier raised the subject again with me by letter dated 21st August 1972, following a decision by his Government to introduce certain drought relief measures. He has since referred *.o these measures and to his approach to the Commonwealth when bringing down his Bud>ct for 1972-73. Examination of some aspects of '.he Commonwealth's policy is proceeding, and the situation remains that the Premier's proposals are being considered in that context.

I am informed that the Bureau is currently revising iis estimates back to 1967 in light of the outcome of the 1971 census. As lo ihe figures given by the honourable member of men who have registered for national service during 1965-66 and 1966-67, available figures relate to the periods from lst January 1965 to 30th April 1966, when 122,581 men were registered, and from lst May 1966 to 30th June 1967, when 106,626 men were registered.

(2) Has he been notified of these cases; if so how many cases have been brought to his attention and what action has he taken. (3) Has he received any letters from supervisors of postgraduate students expressing concern at inordinate delays m releasing records vital to publicly financed research work; if so, how many has he received. (4) Has he acknowledged the existence of such delays; if so, in how many cases. (5) l f the answer to any of the above questions is in the affirmative, why did he, in answer to a question from me on 13th April 1972, say that he was unaware that research work financed from public funds was being seriously impeded. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) I have no evidence of Ihis.

Overseas Academic Qualifications (Question No. 6541) Mr Beazley asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that his Department will only provide the service of interpreting and assessing academic qualifications gained overseas for other Government departments and employing authorities. (2) l f so, does he envisage that lhe service will be extended in the near future to give members of the general public access to this important facility. (3) Is it also a fact mat his Department is the only authority whose interpretations and assessments of academic qualifications gained overseas are regarded as official. (4) If so, is it impossible for a person with academic qualifications gained outside Australia to have such qualifications assessed without first seeking employment in this country. Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No. As the final acceptance of overseas qualifications is a matter for employment authorities, my Department's service is advisory in nature, and it is therefore not envisaged that the present service will be extended to the general public in the near future. (3) There are a number of bodies such as professional institutions and registration boards which have the responsibility for determining entry standards for various professions who will inform individuals on request, of their acceptability to the relevant profession. Several State education departments also carry out assessments of teaching qualifications of persons seeking employment. I have also been advised that the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications has established expert panels in a wide range of professions, and in generalist qualifications, and that the reports of the Committee are available to the public. I understand that in the case of generalist graduates the panel has undertaken to provide an advisory service whereby these graduates can obtain advice on the standing of their degrees.",196,Survey Of Non Government School Needs Independen T Schools Returns Received After 22 February 1971

The base figures of actual I've births and infant deaths on which the mortality ratio is calculated are however very small. Isolated examples for particular communities based on a fictional figure of 1,000 live births are a misleading and unreliable way of expressing the problems of infant health particularly when the communities include groups living on remote pastoral properties where the natural environment and social hygiene standards are complicating factors. Many of the people in these communities are amongst the most primitive groups in the wot Id.

380,Mr Sinclair,The answer to the honour,199,Table Of Cases Of Venereal Disease Reported In The Northern Territory During Financial Years As Stated
381,Mr Wentworth,"The answer to the honMr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There are 127,500 students at Australian universities in 1972, of whom 30,278 are new higher degree and bachelor degree students. These figures exclude a total of 145 higher doctor course enrolments and 40 new higher doctor course enrolments respectively. (2) The number of Commonwealth University scholarship holders in training at 30th June 1972 was 36,627. This represents 28.5 per cent of the tolal student enrolment at universities in 1972. and 32.5 per cent of students enrolled in bachelor degree and diploma courses, i.e. those courses covered by the Commonwealth University Scholarship Scheme. (3) (a) The number of applications received foi Commonweallh University scholarships available in 1972 was 62,727. (b) The number of Commonwealth University scholarships offered in 1972 was 16,439. (c) The number accepted was 12,813. This represents 20.4 per cent of the total number of applicants. (4) Matriculation State New South Wales Certificate Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania The figures shown in the above table relate to numbers passing the relevant examinations in each State at a standard which meets the matric.dation requirements of at least one university within that State. Because of differing university matriculation requirements the figures are not necessarily comparable between Slates. (5) The following number of Commonweallh University scholarship holders are enrolled in the first academic year of courses in 1972. These include students who accepted awards in earlier years, deferred their entry to university and commenced their courses in 1972. Australian National University University of Sydney University of New South Wales University of New England. . University of Newcastle Macquarie University University of Melbourne Monash University La Trobe University University of Queensland James Cook University University of Adelaide Flinders University University of Western Australia Universily of Tasmania Australia (6) A l 30th June 1972 there were: (a) 33.722 Commonwealth university scholars in full-time studies at universities; and (b) 2,905 Commonwealth university scholars in part-time studies at universities. (7) Under the Commonwealth University Scholarship Scheme, living aUowance is payable to scholars in full-time study subject to a means test. For most scholars ihe rate of allowance is assessed on the basis of their parents' iicomcs. At 30th June 1972, 7,656 of these scholars were eligible to receive part living allowance and 3.684 were eligible to receive full living; allowance ln addition there were 2,777 scholars classed as 'independent' of whom the majority were in receipt of full living allowance. (8) The actual expenditure on benefits for Commonwealth University scholarships in 1971-72 and the estimated expenditure for 1972-73 are as follows: Actual Estimated expenditure expenditure 1971-72 1972-73 s $ Number <aj Fees 17,742,391 19,680,000 examination passing (b) Living allowance .. 10.324,274 14,410,000 Higher School fc) Fares .. 21,882 50,000 17,919 Matriculation 13,274 Tolal .. .. 28.088,547 34.140,000 Senior 4,465 Matriculation 3,506 Leaving Certificate . 2,669 (9) The numbers and percentages of CommonMatriculation 1,093 wealth University scholars who failed in 1971 were: (a) First year (b) Later years As a perAs a percentage centage or Cwlth or Cwlth Number scholars Numbci scholars who in first who in later University Tailed* year tailed* years Australian National 43 12 37 5 Sydney 204 14 331 7 New South Wales 113 10 252 8 New England .. 5 6 11 2 331 Newcastle .. 14 8 28 S . . 1,502 Macquarie 6 3 22 4 . . 1,053 Melbourne 214 15 296 7 97 Monash 86 12 162 6 185 La Trobe ,. 18 21 28 7 192 . , 1,489 Queensland ,. 130 12 158 5 667 lames Cook ,11 11 4 2 84 Adelaide 33 6 130 7 . . 1,084 Flinders 21 10 41 11 95 Western Australia 103 17 211 13 .. 611 Tasmania 24 11 58 9 .. 174 695 Australia . . 1,025 12 1,769 7 191 * A student's results are counted as a failure (i) il he is 8,450 required to repeal the whole year of a course, or (ii) if he fails in some subjects and is allowed to proceed but is unable to complete the course in minimum time.

Australian National (School of General Studies) (a) This is the ratio between equivalent full-time students and equivalent full-time staff members calculated m the manner set out in paragraphs 6.36.4 and 7.5 of the Fifth Report of the Australian Universities Commission. (11) For the answer to this part of the QuestionI would refer the honourable member to my answer in reply to Question No. 5009 asked by Mr L. R. Johnson (Hansard, 15th August 1972, page 150). (12) (a) and (b) The number and percentage of students qualified for matriculation in each State who are recorded as unsuccessfully seeking enrolment in universities in 1972 is set out in the following table: Applicants for university and certain Victorian colleges of advanced education enrolments who were qualified for matriculation but were not offered places State New South Wales ..

The detailed schools statistics published by the Bureau, for the year 1969 were available in August 1970. For the year 1971 the figures were published in May 1972. Statistics compiled by my Department relating to the Commonwealth University Scholarship Scheme are normally available by the middle of August each year. Most of the other statistics remain the subject of special collections by my Department and the Australian Universities Commission and the timeliness of reporting individual items is variable. Every effort continues to be made to ensure timely reporting.

(16) What (a) amount and (b) percentage of fees received by each college was paid by the Commonwealth in 11971. (17) What would be the cost to the Commonwealth of paying fees of the present number of college students whose fees are not already paid by Commonwealth and State departments and instrumentalities (Hansard, 9th December 1971, page 4522). (18) As the then Minister told me on 22nd September 1970 (Hansard, page 1494) that enrolment statistics are available in mid-August or early September and scholarship statistics are available in mid-August or early September and scholarship statistics in mid-August, will he himself answer this question earlier than he answered the similar question in 1971 (Hansard, 12th October 1971, page 2226). Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A number of educational institutions classified as colleges of advanced education under the States Grants (Advanced Education) Acts conduct courses both at tertiary level and sub-tertiary level, although only courses at tertiary level are approved for direct Commonwealth assistance under these Acts. No statistics ate available of total enrolments at all levels in these institutions. The latest available data as supplied by the various colleges indicates the following enrolments in courses which attract a Commonwealth Grant under advanced education arrangements: Total 1971-45,11 3 Total 1972-53,51 6 (estimated). (2) (a) and (b) The number of students holding Commonwealth Advanced Education scholarships in 1972 at colleges named in the Act was 6,607. This is 12.4 per cent of the total enrolment at these colleges given in answer to part (1) of this question. (3) The total number of students holding Commonwealth Advanced Education schlarships in 1972 at all institutions approved under this scholarship scheme was 7,739. This includes the 6,607 scholars referred to in answer to part (2) of this question. (4) (a) The number of applications received for CommonwealthAdvanced Education scholarships available in 1972 was 59,888. Most of these students also applied for other scholarships and awards, (b) The number of Commonwealth Advanced Education scholarships offered in 1972 was 10,600. (c) The number accepted was 4,129 of which 3,189 were for students entering first year. The acceptances represent 6.9 per cent of the total number of applicants, or 39.0 per cent of the students who received the offer of an award. (5) The following numbers of Commonwealth Advanced Education scholars are enrolled in the first approved year of their courses in 1972. It should be noted that certain courses to which entry may be gained one year below matriculation level are, for purposes of the Commonwealth Advanced approved from the second year of the course. Tne statistics shown here include students who accepted awards in earlier years, deferred entry to their courses at the time and commenced training in 1972. (a) NEW SOUTH WALES AND A.C.T.

(10) The calculation of staff-student ratios continues to be a difficult exercise in respect of colleges of advanced education. A number of the colleges conduct courses both at tertiary and subtertiary levels and the same staff members may teach at both tertiary and sub-tertiary levels; colleges make widely varying use of part-time staff; hence the calculation of meaningful and accurate Actual Estimated equivalent-full-time staff ratios in each college is very difiicult. With regard to the student body, 1971-72 1972-73 students may be ful l time, part time 'sandwich course' or external and the calculation of an 'equivalent-full-time student load' is also complex, $ $ accordingly it is not possible to give information 1,508,652 2,062,000 on staff-student ratios in which I would have .. 2,023,455 3,345,000 confidence as being accurate, and reflecting the 2,127 4,000 true position in each college. 3,534,234 5,411,000 (11) and (12) Information as to which colleges and courses have had quotas imposed in 1972 is not available. (13) No final decision has been made on the inclusion of basic nursing education in colleges of advanced education. Submissions from some states for 1973-75 triennium included proposals for basic Later years nursing courses and it is intended that the followFailures ing post-graduate courses will continue to be as a perfunded under the Commonwealth advanced Educentage cation provisions: of Cwlth scholars Colleges of -Nursing, Australia: in first who in later Nursing Administration. year failed* yean Nursing 'Education.

In respect of school, preschool and technical teacher education being involved in colleges, the Honourable Member will be aware of my statement to the House on 22nd August '1972 in which I outlined proposals for the expansion of teacher education facilities within the colleges of advanced education. On that occasion (Hansard 22nd August, page 482) I stated that: 'The scale of involvement of the Commonwealth in teacher education will increase in the triennium as I indicated in my recent statement on the Commonwealth's programme in education for 1972-73 where I outlined the Government's decision to expand its support for teachers colleges. In brief the Government has decided to extend present matching arrangements applying to universities and colleges of advanced education to include State teachers' colleges which are being developed as self-governing tertiary institutions under the supervision of appropriate co-ordinating bodies in the States. Also the Commonwealth is offering to share with the States capital and recurrent costs of pre-school teachers colleges under advanced education arrangements. I have asked the Chairman of the Australian Commission on Advanced Education to investigate the application of these proposals and to submit a report no later than March 1973. The Government will then be guided as to the nature of the supplementary programme it will support with regard to teachers colleges from 1 July 1973 for the remainder of the triennium, that is to 31st December 1975. (14) As this is purely a State matter and one in which the State Governments are not obliged to advise the Commonwealth Government, I would ask the Honourable Member to seek the information in answer to this part of his question from each State Government. (15) The information requested is not yet available. The requirements of the States Grants (Advanced Education) Acts are met by certified statements from the States relating to funds applied to approved courses at colleges; from this single figure the levels of Commonwealth grant attracted are calculated. It is not necessary for a State to supply separate components of income for colleges. (.16) The States, in respect of colleges of advanced education are not required to separate State grants and fees for the purposes of assistance under the States Grants (Advanced Education) Act. Therefore the figures of fees received by such colleges and by other colleges not in receipt of assistance are not available. The followoperation for the peaceful uses of atomic energy, ing table shows for each State the amount paid by the Commonwealth for fees on bebalf of Commonwealth Advanced Education scholarship holders in 1971. State New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory Victoria .. Queensland South Australia Western Australia .. Tasmania Total 20195/72-/1-1124 ] (17) The estimated cost to the Commonwealth for .1972 is $3.5m for students whose fees are not already paid by Commonwealth and State Departments and instrumentalities. This estimate takes into account possible savings to the Commonwealth from a reduction in claims for income tax deductions which would arise from the abolition of fees. Allowance has also been made for the value or reimbursement to students who as employees of the Commonwealth are eligible for a refund of fees paid. {18) My answer to this question was being held until the answer to part (17) became available. My Department has been involved in a high volume of work relating to the Government's recently announced programs in education and I was not prepared to authorise the detachment of staff to update the analysis given in my reply to Question 3641 until they could be spared from more pressing duties. Uranium: Prices (Question No. 5857) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Have tbere been any discussions between the Commonwealth and United States Governments regarding the effect on uranium prices resulting from the United States decision to release 50,000 tons of uranium in the form of yellowcake from its national stockpile. (2) Have any discussions been held with any of the members of the tripartite centrifuge enrichment consortium into the possibility of their participating in a feasibility study for a centrifuge enrichment plant in Australia along the lines of the study being undertaken with the French Government for a diffusion enrichment station. (3) Has the German industrial group, Studiengesellschaft Fur Uranisotoedntrennverfaihren, set up to study enrichment technologies, been approached by the Commonwealth to assist in the formulation of Australian policies towards uranium enrichment. (4) Under the new treaty with Japan for codoes Australia have access to the latest technology on centrifuge enrichment developed in Japan, in particular the technology developed by Toshiba, Hitachi, Mitsubishi and Kawasaki. (5) Is the Enrichment Study Group in the Expenditure Japanese Central Electric Power Research Insti$ tute of the Japanese Government intending to 344,906 assess the possibility of a uranium enrichment 357,420 plant in Australia; if so, what aid has been given 131,754 to them by the Australian Government 152,812 (6) Will the report of the study conducted by 89,471 Cameron, McNamara and Partners on co20,093 ordinated development of the Alligator region be 1,096,456 made public; if so, when will it be available and will it be tabled in the Parliament to enable a debate to take place. (7) Was a correct assessment made by Sir Fhilip Baxter when he stated on Monday Conference recently that Australia's uranium reserves are in excess oi 200,000 tons; if not, what are Australia's uramum reserves. (8) Can he say whether (a) the Spanish Government intends to set up a Government owned national uranium company, (b) uranium resources in Sweden are under the control of A.B. Atomenergi, a government organisation rather than a private company and (c) the British company, Nuclear Fuels Ltd, is wholly owned by the British Government. Sir Reginald Swartz-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foltion programme of the Woodside-Burmah consorlows: (1) Yes. The United States Government has decided not to proceed with the release, but rather to use the material in pre-production of enriched uranium for stockpiling against later demand. (2) No. (3) No. (4) No. The recent Agreement with Japan for co-operation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy is basically an enabling agreement under which the parties, or organisations under their jurisdiction, may make arrangements for exchanges of information and co-operative ventures in specificfieldsof nuclear science and technology. No arrangements have yet been made .between Australia and Japan for exchanges of information on the technology of centrifuge enrichment. (5) The Enrichment Study Group in the Japanese Central Electric Power Research Institute is known to be interested in international enrichment projects. However, it has so far made no approach to the Australian Government to seek any assistance in its studies, nor has it given the Government any indication of its programme of studies. (6) While it is expected that the report by Cameron McNamara and 'Partners on coordinated development of the Alligator River region will be made public, it is not possible at present to indicate when this might occur. (7) Proven reserves are presently of the order of 100,000 short tons, but it is expected that durholdings of these companies. in the next 12 to 18 months this figure will double. (8) (a) The Spanish Government is at present setting up a National Fuel Company to develop a nuclear fuel cycle capability in that country. The new company will be government cotrolled, but is likely to include Spanish and overseas groups involved in uranium supply, processing and fuel manufacture, (b) Uranium mining in Sweden is controlled by A.B. Atomenergl The Swedish Government is setting up a nuclear fuel corporation to co-ordinate purchases of uranium from overseas and also to undertake and promote studies of uranium enrichment possibilities in Sweden. It is reported that the corporation is to be 50 per cent owned by the State Power Board and 50 per cent by private and municipal utilities, (c) British Nuclear Fuels Ltd, is at present wholly owned by the United Kingdom Government. It is intended that in due course private organisations would be offered shareholdings. OQ Exploration: Northwest Shelf (Question No. 5885) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) In relation to the Northwest Shelf exploratium, were the relative interests of the initial consortium of companies organised by the Australian firms Woodside Oil and Mid-Eastern Oil to explore the areas as follows: Percentage Company interest Shell 16* Caltex (California Asiatic) .. 16$ Burmah .. 16| British Petroleum .. .. 16J Woodside 25 Mid-Eastern Si (2) Was Burmah Oil Co. of Australia Limited the operating company for the consortium. (3) Did Woodside, Mid-Eastern and Burmah Oil Company of the United Kingdom form in August 1971 a holding company, Woodside-Burmah Oil NL, in which Burmah would hold 50.3 per cent of the equity; if not what was the level of Burmah Oil equity. (4) Did the Woodside-Burmah holding of 50 per cent interest in the consortium result in effective control of the whole programme being exercised by Burmah Oil company; if so, did this take-over need the endorsement of the State Government of Western Australia at that time. (5) Under the original consortium arrangements, did the local companies, Woodside and Mid-Eastern, hold an interest of 25 per cent and 8i per cent, respectively, in the Northwest Shelf leases; if not, what were the respective equity (6) Following the merger with Burmah, did the effective total interest of the local companies decline to 24.85 per cent, with Woodside and Mid-Eastern holding a 49.7 per cent interest in Woodside-Burmah which holds a 50 per cent interest in the consortium; if not, what effective interest was held by the local companies. (7) Did Burmah Oil Company of Australia Limited, as the operating company for the consortium, announce on 7th April 1972 3 farm-out arrangements, whereby additional groups of companies would provide the finance for further exploration in certain areas and share in any subsequent production with the Burmah consortium. (8) If so, (a) are the farm-out arrangements as follows: Area Rowley Shoals (4,743 sq m) Bedout (6,304 sq m) Mitsui and Co. Ltd Broom Swell (6,170 sq m) C. Itoh and Co Fitzroy Graben (3,198 sq m) Mitsui and Co. Ltd Sumitomo Shoji Kaisha Ltd Beaver Exploration (Aust.) .. (b) What are the respective interests held by the above mentioned companies, (c) What Australian equity is held in the companies involved in these farm-out arrangements; and (d) Have these farmout arrangements been approved by the designated authority in Western Australia. (9) Is it a fact that the impact on the effective share of the local companies of these farm-out arrangements will depend upon the productiveness of the various exploration areas conditional upon (a) if the 4 farm-out areas yield no commercial oil or gas fields, and all production is limited to the areas retained by the original consortium, will the local interest in actual production remain at 24.85 per cent and (b) if, however, commercial discoveries are made in these farm-out areas, will the effective local share in total production decline below 24.85 per cent; if not, what will be the level of local share under both (a) and (b). (10) Is the statutory designated authority in Western Australia the State Minister of Mines. (11) Under the Agreement relating to the exploration for, and the exploitation of, the petroleum resources, and certain other resources, of the continental shelf of Australia and of certain Territories of the Commonwealth and of certain other land, made between the Commonwealth and the States (a) has the Commonwealth under Section 11(0 notified any State Government that it will not need to consult the Commonwealth regarding any of the subsidiary matters of that sub-clause, (b) has the Western Australian Government consulted the Commonwealth regarding these farm-outs as it is bound to do under section 1-1 (i) of the Agreement, (c) if so, what decision has been made by the Commonwealth on this matter and (d) if not, will he take action to ensure that Commonwealth approval of such farm-out permits is conditional upon maximum participation and control by Australian companies within these areas. (12) Has his attention been drawn to Press reports on 13th April, 1972 claiming that the Northwest Shelf reserves are valued at $16,400m; if not, what is the estimated value of reserves. (13) Have Burmah Oil UK. marketing representatives from London recently undertaken on behalf of the Woodside-Burmah consortium negotiations with representatives of either the Japanese Government or Japanese companies relating to contracts for the sale of our liquid natural gas from the Northwest Shelf area. (14) If so, were the details of these negotiations the subject of discussion between himself and the Woodside-Burmah consortium prior to, during the Group subsequent to these negotiations; if not, why not share of (15) Will he give an assurance that in relation Companies production to contracts involving the sale and the export of Percent these vast natural gas deposits he will maintain Shell Development (Aust) Pty jurisdiction in respect of both export and price Ltd levels to ensure that such contracts are in the Hematite Petroleum Pty Ltd best interests of the people of Australia. Bridgestone Liquefied Gas C. (16) Will he ensure that all relevant contracts Pty Ltd are tabled for the information of the House and, Amax Petroleum (Aust.) Inc. if necessary, fbr discussion by the House. Sir Reginald Swartz-iTh e answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) BOC of Australia Ltd is the operator for the consortium. (3) Following the merger the Burmah Group held approximately 51.2 per cent of the equity in Woodside-Burmah Oil NL . (4) Exploration in the area controlled by the consortium is carried out under an operating agreement between the companies concerned. The Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments had discussions with the companies involved in the merger, and were assured that there would be substantial Australian equity in the new company and that the board of WoodsideBurmah was and would remain predominantly Australian. (5) See1 above. (6) The effect at the time of the merger was to reduce the Australian equity in the permits by less than one half of 1 per cent from 24.78 per cent to 24.4 per cent. Woodside Oil NL and MidEastern Oil (NL held approximately 48.8 per cent equity in Woodside-Burmah which holds a 50 per cent interest in the permits. (7) Four farm-out agreements were announced in early April 1972. (8) (a) and (b) The farm-out arrangements and respective interests are as follows: Share in Area Company production percent 'Rowley Shoals' Shell Development (Australia) Pty Ltd 'Bedout' and Hematite Petroleum Pty Ltd 'Broom Swell' Mitsui& Co. Ltd, Bridge3? stone Liquified Gas Co. Ltd., C. Itoh& Co. (Australia) Pty Ltd .. 15 'Fitzroy Graben' Amax Petroleum (Australia) Inc. 12* Mitsui and Co. Ltd 12} Sumitomo Shoji Kaisha Ltd 12* Beaver Exploration Australia Ltd .. 12* (c) Hematite Petroleum Pty Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, and Beaver Exploration Australia NL has substantial Australian interest. The other companies are wholly foreign owned. (d) The farm-outs are under consideration by the Western Australian and Commonwealth Governments. (9) (a) See6 above, fb) See8 above. (10) The Western Australian Minister for Mines and Electricity is the Designated Authority. (11) (a) No. (b) (c) and (d) see 8 (d) above. (12) I have seen a number of reports relating to the possible size and value of the North-West Shelf hydrocarbon reserves. Such reserves, however, have not yet been fully proven or evaluated and until that evaluation has been completed I am unable to estimate the value of these reserves. (13) and (14) I am aware that preliminary discussions have been held with potential overseas buyers in respect of the possible purchase of natural gas from the North-West Shelf. I have not discussed details of these negotiations with the companies and there is no requirement for the Commonwealth to be a party to such negotiations. (IS) As I announced in January 1970 and have confirmed on several occasions, the export of natural gas would be controlled by the Government. In my Statement to the House on 28th September 1972 on Australia's Natural Resources, I made particular reference to ihe question of fhe export of natural gas. The honourable member is assured that the aspects raised by him will be taken into account State* $-000 New South Wales (including Australian Capital Territory) Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania (2)AS AT 30 JUNE 1971 State* New South Wales (including Australian Capital Territory Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania (16) Details of a commercial contract are normally regarded as confidential by the Government, though it is open to the parties concerned to publish such information as they deem appropriate. If a contract for the sale of natural gas overseas was submitted to the Government and if the Government approved such a contract I would, as is my custom, make a statement. Commonwealth Benefits (Question No. 5984) Mr Cross asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) What sum was paid by the Commonwealth in each of the States and the Northern Territory by way of (a) medical and (b) hospital benefits in the year 1970-71. (2) How many, members were there of registered (a) medical and (b) hospital benefits organisations in each State and the Northern Territory as at 30th June 1971. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (b) Hospital HospitalTotal Cwlth Insured Uninsured isation free Pensioner benefits(a )Medical patients patients of charge patients Hospital $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 36,669 9,514 465 134 9,269 19,382 23,871 5,634 239 136 5,255 11,264 8,984 2,108 163 2,381 3,813 8,465 11,767 2,448 104 201 2,113 4,866 8,229 1,895 103 42 2,058 4,098 2,841 718 33 4 1,048 1,803 * As there are no registered health insurance organizations based in the Northern Territory, persons in the Territory insure with organizations ih New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia.

It was not a Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers for Housing as such. I was invited to attend as a guest in my capacity as the Commonwealth Minister for Housing. The appropriate source to be approached if a copy of the minutes is required is the Tasmanian. Minister for Housing, who convened and chaired the Conference. Nursing Homes: Financial Assistance (Question No. 6027) Mr Whitlam asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: What has been the date, nature and outcome of the consultation with the States on assistance for nursing homes which he forecast on 5th October 1971 (Hansard, page 1878). ourable member's question is as follows: The honourable member will be aware that, as tory, the Northern Territory and Papua New indicated in answer to previous questions, it is not Guinea.

Mr Kevin Cairns-The answer to the number honourable member's question is as themselves of advances for the purposes menfollows: As was the case when a reply was provided to of question No.127 (Hansard, 12th May 1970, page estimate 2033), it is assumed that the reference to so-called for assistance 'rationing schemes' relates to changes in War Serof a decline infor vice Homes arrangements implemented in 1951 any change in arrangements. and 1962 to ensure thaf the funds appropriated for War Service Homes were used as far as possible for the provision of homes in accordance Education: Tertiary Entrance Examination with the purpose of the Scheme rather than to improve the position of those already owning a home. These changes were: (a) In 1951, the suspending of advances for the discharge of an existing mortgage on a Education and Science, upon notice: home already owned by the applicant except where the mortgage or charge was arranged with prior approval or in special tiary Entrance Examination Project and what procases of grave hardship; and Date Date authorised completed and or for Client Type of Service and description commenced completion Department of Hie assignment of an officer for a period July July Foreign Affairs of three years to assist in setting up a 1969 1972 cost accounting system for the accelerated Rural Development Programme under Colombo Plan Aid Department of Stage 1: Feasibility study into the proviDecember April Foreign Affairs sion of personnel and equipment 1969 1970 required to establish an Intensive Training Unit Stage 2: Provision of personnel and September 1974 equipment to establish the Intensive 1970 Training Unit Department of Inspection of projects in hand and May July preliminary investigations of a number 1970 1970 of projects under Colombo Plan Aid: Proposed Vung Tau Water Supply Project Proposed extension of the Saigon Metropolitan Water Supply Proposed IS kV electric distribution line approximately 100 km long in Phuoc Tuy Province Road construction projects in hand by the Engineering Squadron, Australian Task Force Study of Vietnamese proposals to extend October December the National Power Grid 1971 1971 Report on feasibility of proposals prepared July August Foreign Affairs for an electrification scheme for the 1970 1970 Province Department of Management on behalf of the Department July September Foreign Affairs of Consultants engaged to carry out 1970 1972 the investigation, design and calling of tenders for tbe supply of materials, equipment and construction of the Vung Tau Project (b) in 1962, the limiting of additional advances to the provision of essential extra accommodation and tiie installation of basic utility services. As indicated in the reply to Question No. 127, any estimate of the present cost of re-introducing variables involved. These variables include the purposes for which additional loans will be under any change in arrangements, the amount of assistance available and the number of applications received. Based on an estimate of the of persons who might now seek to avail tioned above, the cost of re-introducing the forms assistance suspended in 1951 and 1962 is now estimated at $ 17.5m in the first full year. The provides for a reduction in the demand the purposes mentioned because the number of persons affected by Project (Question No. 6111) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for When, did his Department inaugurate the Tergress has been made on it. Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as fol3 occurred between 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. lows: An account of the origin and development of the Tertiary Education Entrance Project is contained in 'Education News', June 1972, published by my Department. An amount of $50,000 is provided in the Budget for further development of the project in 1972-73. Preliminary, work is proceeding on the development of additional objective tests and on research into the effective use of school-based data for tertiary selection. i Department of Civil Aviation: Employees in Papua New Guinea (Question No. 6303) Mr Charles Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) How many persons are employed by the Department of Civil Aviation in Papua New Guinea. (2) How many of them are indigenes. (3) How many indigenes are holding positions of administrative and technical responsibility in the Department. Sir Reginald Swartz-The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) 1,709 as at 30th September 1972. (2) 1,163 as at 30th September 1972. (3) It is not clear what is meant by 'holding positions of administrative and technical responsibility'. However, there are 96 indigenes whose services have been made available to the Department by the Papua New Guinea Administration and who are Second Division officers of the Papua New Guinea Public Service. The Second Division in the Papua New Guinea Public Service is simUar to the Third Division of the Commonwealth Service and these 96 indigenes could therefore be considered as occupying positions having administrative or technical responsibility. Sydney Airport: Flight Operations, Runways and Second Airport (Question No. 6174) Mr Lionel Bowen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) What was the daily number offlightsin and out of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport in July 1972. (2) What percentage of these flights used the east-west runway. (3) How many flights (a) took off in an easterly aircraft, departed or landed at the airport within < jlrection and (b) landed in a westerly direction on the hours 11.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. during the this runway on each day. (4) How many, of the flights referred to in Part (5) How many flights were there on all runways within curfew hours during July 1972. (6) What sum was expended in 1971-72 on the investigation of a parallel runway system at the airport. (7) Do these investigations relate to a parallel north-south runway or a parallel east-west runway, or both. _ (8) What is the present position with the investigation, selection, and recommendation to the Parliament of a second airport for Sydney. (9) When is it expected that a recommendation will be announced. Sir Reginald Swartz-The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: PercenTotal tageof Numberof Numberof number of total take-offs landings movements movetowards towards (landings ments on tbe east the west luly and east-west using using 1972 take-offs) runway runway 07 runway 25 1 293 67.90 Nil 101 2 293 19.10 Nil 38 3 346 0.06 Nil Nil4 383 10.40 2 1 S 386 62.70 Nil 120 6 384 74.30 Nil 156 7 432 62.00 Nil 104 8 315 59.70 Nil 103 9 314 66.80 Nil 113 10 350 28.60 1 29 11 362 27.30 Nil 40 12 381 45.60 1 76 13 374 64.20 Nil 66 14 410 46.60 47 30 15 292 66.10 2 92 16 309 28.10 Nil 38 17 361 30.40 Nil 63 18 359 41.50 Nil 52 19 369 46.30 27 43 20 390 44.80 Nil 84 21 396 47.70 Nil 91 22 282 19.80 Nil 29 23 290 33.10 1 39 24 358 7.50 20 6 25 363 29.80 Nil 29 26 381 36.70 NU 63 27 362 15.40 Nil 53 28 29 385 298 13.50 28.00 2 1 30 28 30 278 25.20 I 26 31 313 30.20 Nil 22 Total. . 10,809* 38.50 105 1,765 * Excludes 167 helicopterflightsduring the month. _ (4) _ 724 flights either took off in an easterly direction or landed in a westerly direction between 6.00 p.m. and 11.00 p.m. during the month. (5) 289 flights, which included all types of month, 34 of these flights were jet aircraft. (1) to (5) The low numbers of take-offs to the east and the number of days when a relatively high number of landings were to the west on the east-west runway are indicative of winter westerly wind conditions influencing runway use. The Immigration, upon notice: overall percentage use of the east-west runway in either direction of 38.5 per cent may be compared to an annual estimate of 37 per cent which advertise for migrants. allows for all seasonal and other conditions. Qf the flights occurring between 11.00 p.m. and 6.00 each of the last 5 years in advertising for a.m. only 7 took off or landed over the eastern migrants. side of the airport. One of these was a jet aircraft. (6) and (7) During 1971-72 a working group consisting of airline and other industry representatives, the New South Wales State Planning advertise directly, for migrants overseas varies conAuthority and interested Commonwealth Departsiderably from country to country. The British ments, including DCA, completed a review of Government imposes no restriction on the amount Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport primarily to or type of migration advertismg; but most Eurodecide the best way of expanding the domestic pean countries will not allow any direct adverterminals and meeting other miscellaneous accomtising for migrants. The countries in which my modation requirements. It was determined that Department advertises directly for migrants are TAA and EWA should be authorised to expand listed below in (2). into the old international area and that AAA and Airlines of New South Wales should expand from their present position along the southern side of the north-east (domestic) terminal complex. These Year domestic terminal developments can take place, with other accommodation re-arrangements, without compromising the ultimate parallel runway 1967-68 . . pattern at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Both parallel runways were considered by the working group and these considerations were referred to 1970-71 . . the Commonwealth/State Committee bearing in 1971-72 . . mind that the Committee must recommend on the respective roles of Sydney's second airport and Sydney (Kmgsfcrd-Smith) Airport. The working group meet periodically and usually, incidental to other commitments of its members and, as a result, it is not feasible to isolate the investigation costs in this discussion phase. (8) The present position with the investigation of proposals for a second airport is that the Commonwealth/State Committee appointed to make recommendations to the Government is actively carrying out its investigations. The Committee has had 17 meetings up to 22nd August. To assist the Committee, the Commonwealth Government has engaged a 'British firm of consultants who, with the assistance of Australian experts, will carry out a detailed benefit/cost study of the alternative proposals for a new airport, as well as the alternative schemes for the development of the existing airport. The study will be most comprehensive and take into account not only a comparison of the costs of all works involved in these proposals but also a comparison of the benefits and costs in all significant aspects including environmental factors and aircraft noise. This study is currently in the design phase and present indications are that the study itself will not be completed before October 1973. (9) As the report on the benefit/cost study is statement by, Dr Alan McLean of Newcastle, New not expected before October 1973, it is unlikely, South Wales, that it was a widely held opinion diat the Commonwealth/State Committee will be that the standard of doctors in Australia was in a position to make a recommendation before being eroded by the admission to this country of. the end of that year.

Medical Practitioners: Standards (Question No. 6538) Mr Calweil asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a reported some Asian doctors. (2) How many Indian and Pakistani doctors with qualifications below those required by Australian universities entered Australia during the hut 5 years. (3) Have a number oi medical boards in the Australian States laid down a requirement that Indian and Pakistani doctors must submit themselves for examination before their overseas qualifications are recognised; if so, which State medical boards have done so and with what results. (4) Is it a fact that not more than 20 per cent of Asian medical students applying are passed for admission to the medical faculties of Australian universities. (5) As many leading Australian physicians and surgeons visit Asian universities each year to examine, lecture and demonstrate to undergraduates, and many of these universities, in particular the University of Singapore, now have medical standards almost comparable with those of Australian universities, why does the Government allow the westernised sons of wealthy westernised Asians to come to Australia to secure an education which they can obtain at home while Australian-born students of both European and Asian origins are being denied admission to universities in Sydney and Melbourne because of the practice referred to. (6) Will the Government prohibit the influx of any more Asian students, other than Colombo Plan students, who desire medical education in Australia because their education may only be at the expense of the Australian-born boys and girls referred to previously. able member's question is as follows: (1) Reports of comments by, Dr Alan McLean concerning some Asian doctors in Austraha have been brought to my attention. (2) Applications from Indian and Pakstani doctors to enter Australia for residence based on the possession of medical qualifications have been approved in those cases where it was established that the qualifiations were Individually acceptable for registration purposes by the appropriate State Medical Registration 'Boards as the appropriate authorities responsible for assessing such qualifications. (3) It is not appropriate for me to comment on the requirements of State Medical Registration Boards. (4) I have no information to support this assessment. (5) and (6) Applications from students from Asian countries seeking to enter Australia to study medicine under the Private Overseas Student Programme are considered and will continue to be considered or* their individual merits having regard to facilities available in the students' own countries and the usefulness of qualifications they hope to acquire in Australia from the point ot view of recognition of and demand for such qualifiations in their home lands. In. line with these considerations students from Singapore generally are not now approved for entry to Australia to study for a basic degree in medicine. Homes Savings Grants (Question No. 6380) Mr Les Johnson asked the Minister for Housing, upon notice: (1) Has it been established that people in many callings and professions including the Police Force, the Armed Services, the ministry and the teaching service are often excluded from qualifying for a grant under the Homes Savings Grant Act because the nature of their profession is such that its members are precluded from acquiring a permanent home until after reaching the age of 36 years. (2) If so, has consideration been given to removing the age barrier in respect of cases where the disadvantage can be properly established. Mr Kevin Cairns-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Some people, because of their occupations or for other reasons, do nnt acquire their first matrimonial homes until after they reach the age of 36 years. The Home Savings Grant Scheme is designed to encourage and assist young people to acquire their first homes and, in that context, the present age eligibility is regarded as reasonable. Medical Graduates (Question No. 6476) Mr Grassby asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: How many medical graduates from Australian universities were tliere in each of the last 10 years, and what percentages of them were (a) male and (b) female graduates for each of the same years. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The following information has been provided by the Bureau of Census and Statistics: Male Female Total graduates graduates number NumPer NumPer graduYear ber cent ber cent ates 1962 422 83.6 83 16.4 505 1963 493 87.6 70 12.4 563 1964 522 86.7 80 13.3 602 1965 546 85.3 94 14.7 640 1966 603 85.0 107 15.0 710 1967 621 83.5 123 16.5 744 1968 751 74.0 264 26.0 1,015 1969 676 80.3 166 19.7 842 1970 701 82.2 152 17.8 853 1971 735 82.6 155 17.4 893",210,Australia

385,Dr Forbes,"The Minister for Health hasMinisterial Staffs: Electorate Work (Question No. 6316) Mr Whitlam asked the Prime Minister, threat from locusts to the Riverina and northern upon notice: (1) Has he conferred with the Minister for the Navy with respect to my letter of 12th July 1972 relating to a pamphlet issued by the Minister regarding both his electoral secretary and his public relations officer being available full time at his electoral offices (Hansard, 23rd August 1972, page SS8); if so, is he now in a position to reply to my letter. (2) Which of bis Ministers (Hansard, 27th biology and ecology of this pest. This research is April 1972, page 2182), apart from the Minister -assisted by staff from the Centre for Overseas for the Navy, has a member of bis ministerial Pest Research, an international research body with staff working in his electoral office instead of his headquarters in Britain. CSIRO has reported ministerial office. ourable member's question is as follows: '(1) I have now replied to the honourable memlocust control. ber's letter. (2) Ministerial staff is provided to assist Ministers in carrying out their responsibilities and Ministers determine, in the interests of office efficiency, where that staff is best located. Plague Locust Infestations (Question No. 6542) Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) Has he received reports from the New South Wales and Victorian Departments of Agriculture indicating the scope of current plague locust infestations in those States. <2) If not, will he call for reports urgently. (3) Will he also confer with the 2 State Ministers to ensure that all possible assistance is offered to the States to contain current outbreaks which are causing widespread concern in southern New South Wales and northern Victoria. able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) I am aware of the increasing threat to agricultural crops from hatching plague locusts in New South Wales and Victoria. This matter was discussed at the Eighty-Third meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council on 16th October 1972. (3) lhe control of locusts on private land is the responsibihty of individual landholders. State Departments ensure insecticide supplies and other assistance where outbreaks threaten serious damage. The2 States are mamtaining a close watch on the situation and are ready to co-ordinate comprehensive control measures and provide staff and equipment should large locust bands form. Last year, this type of co-operation between State Governments, Pasture Protection Boards and other local Government authorities, and the landholders proved effective in overcoming a potential Victoria. There is a standing arrangement between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia (which Queensland is joining also) for the purpose of maintaining a locust patrol service, with the actual work of patrolling being undertaken by New South Wales on behalf of the participating States. The Commonwealth provides direct to CSIRO and through special research grants, funds enabling CSIRO to undertake investigations of the favourable developments likely to assist in combating locusts, through enhanced ability to track movements of these insects by use of radar. The Commonwealth/State Entomology Committee is also considering measures that may be required to add further to the effectiveness of plague Consultations with Government (Question No. 6562) Pr Everingham asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Has the Government paid for trips to Canberra by spokesmen of the Australian Medical Association in order to ask them not to breach a' long standing agreement for the first time by recommending increased fees at an interval of less than 2 years. (2) Has an increase been justified by some doctors on the grounds of unusually rapid cost inflation. (3) Has his attention been drawn to the action of Queensland Alumina and/or associated construction firms in dismissing, on 18th October 1972, 1,200 employees on a temporary construction project because of their claims for a week's severance pay, protective clothing, reduced working hours, fares to and from their home town once in 3 months, allowances for travelling time 'and penalty rates of pay for the substandard conditions and civic amenities, exorbitant rents and living costs, unhygienic environment at the work site and the dearth of adequate and convenient accommodation. (4) If so, will the Government pay for representatives of the unions concerned and their employers to come to Canberra and for Government experts to go to Gladstone so that appeals may be made to those concerned to resolve the dispute and to discover whether the agreements alleged to have been breached by the employees were unduly onerous, whether the employers were also in breach of the agreement and whether it is in the interest of the employers to delay construction on account of declining demand for alumina.",218,Other Countries
386,Mr Mcmahon,The answer to the hon-the,219,Other Countries
387,Mr Sinclair,"The answer to the honourourable member's question is as follows: (1) The President and 2 other representatves of the Australian Medical Association came to Canberra on 18th October last in response to a request I made to them. This request followed a report from the Minister for Health that the Economic Advisory Committee of the AMA was contemplating recommending to the 'Federal Council that fees for general practitioner consultations and home visits and for some other services might be increased shortly. The Government did not meet the cost of the visit to Canberra. (2) The AMA representatives said that the national economic indices had moved upwards at on abnormally high rate since December 1970 and for this reason the Federal Council would be considering the question of interim fee increases on 21st and 22nd October. I told them that the movement in the indices could not properly justify a departure from the 2 yearly review period. The Federal Council decided at its meeting that it would not make a recommendation for an interim variation in fees at the present time. (3) and (4) I am of course aware of the dispute view of monetary and banking policy and, involving claims by unions whose members are after consultation .with me, informed the employed on the construction of extensions to the Queensland Alumina refinery at Gladstone.

II Includes reimbursements under the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan and payments towards Special Account defici.s by the Commonwealth. 1 This part of the question is taken as referring to the percentage of claims where the payment of fund benefit was refused. For the purposes of explaining the principal reasons for refusal, the table may be conveniently divided into two segments, namely: (a) from the commencement of the Scheme up to and including 1962-63; and (b) from 1963-64 to the present, as follows: (i) Prior to 1 January 1963, hospitals were categorised as either 'recognised' or 'non-recognised' for the purposes of payment of fund benefits. Where a patient was accommodated in a 'nonrecognised' hospital, fund benefit was not usually payable. This reason accounts for the major portion of each percentage shown in the fist part of the table. From1 January 1963, institutions were reclassified as either 'approved hospitals' or 'approved nursing homes'. Those institutions which previously were classified as non-recognised hospitals were, in general, reclassified as nursing honies after the change. Consequently, payments in respect of patients accommodated in these institutions were henceforth outside the scope of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, with some minor exceptions. The other major reason for the non-payment of fund benefit in these early years was the application of pre-existing ailment rules by the organisations. However, with the introduction of the Special Accounts Plan oa 1 January 1959, fund benefits could no longer be refused by reason of a contributor having a condition that existed prior to his joining an organisation. (ii) Since 1963-64 the only significant reason for refusing fund benefits has been in respect of claims relating to hospitalisation during the waiting periods for new contributors. Contributors are not entitled to payment of hospital fund benefits unless they have been members of a fund for a period of two months before the particular hospital expense is incurred. Exceptions are made in the case of accidents, where no waiting period applies. In obstetric cases, the waiting period is nine months (with special provision for premature births under certain circumstances). °* Provisional figure.

(b) Revised figures. (c) No intermediate ward classification As mentioned in Part7 of the reply, prior to the restructure of the hospital benefits scheme during 1971 the registered hospital benefits funds did not operate tables which were equivalent to thc various levels; of charges made by public hospitals. A multiple table structure was operated by each fund and each table provided fund benefits which may have either been more than the hospital charge or less than the charge, depending on the table to which the patient was a contributor. Consequently, the percentages set out above should be regarded as approximations only of the respective levels of coverage. (17) (a) and (b) As at 30 June 1972, the numbers of members of registered hospital benefits organisations whose contributions were paid under the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan were: (i) wholly paid 29,461 (ii) partly paid 999 These persons represented 0.73 per cent of hospital fund membership. It should bc noted that these figures relate to the position at a particular point of time and therefore do not give a true indication of the extent to which persons are availing themselves of the benefits provided under the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan. During 1971-72, there were some 152,960 enrolments in hospital insurance organisations under the Plan. fl8) Expenditure under the Plan for 1971-72 for hospital benefits, by way of Commonwealth benefit re m"" urscment of fund benefit and reimbursement of management expenses was $9,183,167. .

Under the ILO Constitution, the making of a declaration in respect of Papua New Guinea stating the extent to which the provisions of any Convention should be applied does not arise unless and until Australia has ratified that Convention.

The Minister for Labour has advised me that the making of an appropriate declaration for Convention No. 109 is under active consideration by his Department. Overseas Investment in Newspapers and Television and Radio Stations (Question No. 6006) Mr Calwell asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Is he able to say in wbich Australian newspapers, television and radio stations there is any overseas investment, from which countries this investment is derived and what is its extent in each case. (2) ls there any current investigation into any or all of these matters being conducted by a committee of either House of the Parliament. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth Statistician has advised that, although regular surveys on overseas investment in Australia are conducted by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics, information collected in respect of the operations of individual companies is strictly confidential and cannot be disclosed lo any person or government authority. With regard to overseas investment in television and radio stations, the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1972 provides that not less than 80 per cent of the issued capital of a company holding a licence must be beneficially owned by Australian residents and that no overseas shareholder is permitted to have more than IS per cent of tbe Issued capital. (2) The terms of reference of the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control include investigation into the foreign ownership and control of Australian commerce, industries, land and resources. The Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts has been requested by the Senate to inquire into all aspects of television and broadcasting. The Committee has invited submissions concerning, inter alia, the ownership, control and licensing of commercial stations. Armed Services: Posting Statistics (Question No. 6063) Mr Whcflani asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: What are the posting statistics for the Services for 1971-72 (Hansard, 21st March 1972 page 947). able member's question is as follows: The methods of maintaining records of postings in the individual Services vary. The foUowing are the posting statistics for 1971-72: Navy Overseas 1,044 Interstate 7,227 Intrastate 7,428 Notes(1) Thesefiguresdo not include movements by new recruits between training establishments; these movements are frequently of short duration and are not recorded as postings. (2) The figures include postings between ship and shore billets, including personnel posted to shore billets near their own homes. (3) The figures include postings to and from courses including short courses of less than two weeks duration. It is estimated that these movements together with movements on compassionate grounds accounted for some 30 per cent of postings in -1971-72. (4) Approximately SS per cent of sailor billets are at sea and 45 per cent in shore establishments. Relatively frequent movement between sea and shore billets is necessary to ensure that each sailor is afforded an equitable period of shore service. As a result sea service varies from 1-3 ""years and shore service 1-5 years. Officers normally can expect to serve at sea for approximately 18 months to two years and on shore for two to three years on a rotational basis until the age of about 35 when sea postings become less frequent. Army Personnel transferred after recruit training for Corps training 10,548 Personnel transferred to Units on completion of Corps training 11,110 PostingsTo mainland units 8,101 To South Vietnam 3,707 To Malaysia/Singapore 1,166 Other Overseas Postings 130 To Papua New Guinea 482 Note-Th efiguresfor New Intakes include movements by all new recruits, including national servicemen, which are frequent during the first year of service because of postings between training establishments. Up to four movements by one individual may be recorded in this section of the table. Duration-The length of postings to Vietnam varies from 4 to 12 months. Other overseas postings are normally for two years. The average duration of postings within Australia is 20 months. RAAF Recruit and Trade Training Recruits posted for initial and category training and personnel posted for re-training 4,649 PostingsTo mainland units 8,135 To South Vietnam Other Overseas Postings 1,020 Duration-The average duration of postings to South Vietnam was approximately 8 months. Duration of postings within Australia averaged 23 months and for overseas posts, other than South Vietnam, 24 months. Married members are posted less frequently than single personnel; their postings average from 30 to 33 months duration.",234,Tasmania

(2) If so, did the Minister claim that Wollongong had been chosen for the pilot project because it facilitated a quick assessment of the results of intensive publicity allied with personal contact and counselling. (3) Did the Minister also say that the methods found most successful in the Wollongong project would be used for further promoting the Plan throughout the rest of Australia. (4) What was the (a) number and (b) nature of means of publicity used in the project through (i) radio, (ii) television, (iii) the Press and (iv) other media. (5) Were poor results achieved from the project and has the Minister decided that the cost of similar means of publicity on a national basis would be prohibitive; if so, is it a fact that it has been decided not to go ahead with any substantial increase in the scale of advertising used to date. (6) In view of the Government's refusal to lift the qualifying income limits, does this indicate that no serious action is contemplated to increase substantially the present number of low-income earners enrolled in the scheme. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1), (2) and (3) Yes. (4) (a) and (b)(i) Radio-The local commercial radio station (2WL) broadcast 2 30-second announcements each day from Monday to Friday during the initial 3 weeks of the campaign, and 2 30-second announcements each day from Monday to Wednesday during the fourth week.

Marriott, who was in Wollongong to launch the campaign, was played at 6.4S p.m. after the evening news on the night of 21st February 1972 by Station 2WL. This interview lasted 5 minutes IS seconds. On 23rd February 1972. Station 2WL devoted its entire 70-minute 'open line' programme to the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan. According to surveys commissioned by the station, this programme is heard by some 55,000 home listeners daily.

(ii) Television-The local commercial television station (WJN4) broadcast one 30-second announcement nightly from Monday to Friday during the inital 3 weeks of the campaign, and from Monday to Thursday during the fourth week. The station made a total of 19 announcements during this period. In its evening news bulletin on 20th February 1972, W1N4 made reference to the initial Press release. A 2-minute sound on film interview with Senator Marriott was included in the WIN4 evening news bulletin on 21st February 1972. The campaign and the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan in general, were featured by WIN4 in 3 successive Saturday morning migrant education programmes, and were also discussed in an interview in a women's programme on that channel. (iii) Press-Larg e advertisements (12 inch x 6 inch) appeared in the 'Illawarra Mercury' on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday during the initial 3 weeks of the campaign, and from Monday to Thursday during the fourth week.

Both 'The Express' and the 'Illawarra Mercury' carried further articles during the currency of the campaign. (iv) Other Media-59,00 0 leaflets and 520 posters were made available throughout the Wollongong/Port Kembla area by enlisting the support of doctors and chemists, and organisations such as health funds, bank migrant advisory services, post offices, trade unions, local, State and Commonwealth Government Authorities, migrant organisations and social welfare groups.",235,Tasmania
399,Mr Fairbairn,The answer to the hon,236,Tasmania
400,Dr Forbes,"-The Minister for Health has(5) The Wollongong campaign achieved significant success in terms of percentage increase in the number of applications received for Subsidised Health Benefits from persons in the area to which the campaign was directed. I also consider that it has left a permanent residue of awareness among residents of the area concerning the benefits available under the Plan, especially among persons and organisations in a position to counsel potential beneficiaries. A national round of advertising in Press and on radio was undertaken in July following the raising of income limits for families on low incomes. In addition, kits of information are now being prepared by my Department, and these will be distributed shortly to State Councils of Social Service for re-distributhe area. tion to social welfare agencies throughout the Commonwealth. (6) The qualifying income limits were raised in June 1972. Sales Tax (Question No. 6224) Mr Crean asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) How many taxpayers are there who have reduced tbe taxable sale value of goods taxable at the highest rate of sales tax, such as motor cars, radio and television or similar appliances, cosmetics or jewellery by the device of separating components of the total charge borne by the retailer and having some components of that charge invoiced by one entity and other components of the charge invoiced by a separate entity. (2) What is the annual loss to revenue from the use of this procedure. (3) What steps does the Government propose to take to protect tbe revenue and ensure that the taxable sale value shall not be reduced in this way by some taxpayers so that all taxpayers will bear tax uniformly. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) No statistics are available as to the number of taxpayers wbo have arranged their business activities along these lines. (2) As the system of sales tax provides for the imposition of tax on the last wholesale sale of goods without regard to any payment that may be made by the retailer for ancillary services provided by an entity other than the party liable for the sales tax, it might be contended that the arrangements described are not contrary to 'he intention of the legislation. The provision of indePopulation centre pendent services to the retailer by an entity other than the taxpayer liable for the sales tax may be made for valid commercial reasons not necessarily associated with a scheme for minimising sales tax payments. It is not possible to furnish a reliable estimate of the additional revenue that would result if service charges were added to the last wholesale price for the purpose of determining the value of goods on which sales tax is payable. (3) The question of amending the law to vary the present provisions raises a number of complex issues and is currently under consideration. Servicemen's Dependants: Hospital Treament (Question No. 6240) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) How many (a) wives and (b) children residing with servicemen in the Holsworthy-Ingleburn area were treated as (i) inpatients and (ii) outpatients in civilian hospitals during the latest year for which statistics have been collected. (2) What was the date, nature and outcome of the latest consultations with the State authorities on the provision of additional hospital facilities in ourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Service Departments have no requirement to maintain statistics on the treatment of wives and children of servicemen as in-patients or out-patients'in civilian hospitals. (2) There has been no consultation with State authorities on the provision of additional hospital facilities on the Holsworthy-Ingleburn Townsville or Richmond area.

Hamersley Holdings Ltd: Shareholding (Question No. 6359) Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Can he say whether the Kaiser Steel International Mining Corporation took up 36 million shares in Hamersley Holdings Ltd on its formation in 1967. (2) Did the Corporation, through a share split in 1970 and a 1 for 20 bonus issue in May 1970, increase its holdings to a maximum of 79,380,000 shares, worth $18m, which represented 36 per cent of the total capital of the company. (3) Did the Corporation sell 3,780,000 of these shares on lst January 1971 at $5.17 a share. (4) Did the Corporation make a total profit of $16.8m, or $4.70 a share, from this transaction.

(2) Is it a fact that this publication's table on cholesterol does not show the cholesterol content of the various types of oil and oil products; if so, why were these not shown. (3) Will the Minister instruct his Department to correct this deficiency so that further confusion can be avoided and to ensure that if the levels are zero they are included. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) My Department has not received complaints from the medical profession regarding the data on cholesterol content of foods set out in Table6 of this publication. (2) No reliable data are available on the cholesterol content of some types of oil and oil products. (3) My Department is currently investigating means of obtaining reliable data on the cholesterol content of foods where it is not presently available. It is current practice to indicate, by the figure 0, levels which are known to be zero. Conference of Ministers for Labour: Tradesmen's Certificates of Competency (Question No. 6389) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Which States have legislated, as agreed by the Ministers of Labour at their conferences in 1968 and 1969, to recognise certificates of competency granted in any other State to lift mechanics, crane drivers, riggers, dogmen, crane chasers, scaffolders and operators of explosivepowered tools (Hansard, 27th August 1969, page 790). (2) When did the legislation in each State come into effect. able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The State Labour Ministers have advised me as follows witb regard to the situation in their respective jurisdictions: New South Wales As a result of the Conferences of Ministers of Labour in 1968 and 1969, it was agreed that uniformity of certificates of competency should exist and a sub-committee, comprising the Chief Inspectors of the various States, was asked to report on whether uniformity of certification and reciprocity of certificates between States could be achieved. Following various meetitngs of this subcommittee, a formula for the issue of such certificates was agreed to and with the exception of a requirement for an applicant to produce a medical certificate and modifications to an applicant's experience requirements, the procedure agreed to by the sub-committee for the issue of certificates of competency was basically as that followed by this State. A review of the New South Wales Scaffolding and Lifts Act, 1912, as amended, and Regulations is now in progress and draft amendments are being prepared to incorporate uniformity provisions. Victoria The Lifts and Cranes (Amendment) Act 1970 provides for reciprocity with respect to lift mechanics, crane drivers, riggers, dogmen and crane chasers. That provision has not yet been brought into operation, but will be when certain administrative arrangements with respect to the grant of certificates of competency have been completed. I am not aware of any legislative provision granting reciprocal recognition with respect to scaffolders or operators of. explosive-powered tools. Queensland Lift Mechanics-There is no requirement for a certificate of competency for lift mechanics. Crane Drivers-Applicant s holding an unrestricted crane driver's certificate are issued with a full value Queensland certificate. The majority of States issue certificates restricted in some form and it is customary for a certificate of equivalent value to be issued in Queensland. Riggers-Applicant s having unrestricted riggers' certificates issued by New South Wales and Western Australia are issued with full value Queensland certificates. Dogmen-Certificate s issued by other Australian Statutory Authorities are recognised but it is also customary to give an applicant a practical examination, to demonstrate his ability, before issuing a certificate. Crane Chasers-Becaus e of an industrial award prescription crane chasers are called 'slingers' in Queensland. Very few applications from persons who possess crane chasers' certificates issued by other Australian Statutory Authorities are received in Queensland. Any such applications received however, would be issued with a full value 'slinger's' certificate. Scaffolders--Ful l value Queensland certificates are issued to holders of unrestricted New South Wales and Western Australian certificates. E.P.T. Operators-Ful l value Queensland certificates are issued to holders of Western Australian certificates. Applicants having certificates issued by other Australian Statutory Authorities are required to sit for a theory and practical examination as an explosive-powered tool operator. I am informed by the Chief Safety Engineer of my Department of Industrial Affairs that the qualification and examination requirements for the above certificates issued in Queensland are in accordance with the principles previously agreed",238,Tasmania
405,Dr Forbes,The Minister for Health has,239,Tasmania
406,Mr Lynch,"The answer to the honourupon by the Conimittee of Chief Inspectors for the Uniformity of Certification for Crane and Hoist Drivers. South Australia The position in South Australia is that certifirecognise certificates of competency granted in the cates of competency are required in the case of crane operators and riggers but not for the other categories. New regulations have been prepared under the Lifts and Cranes Act 1960-1971, which include requirements for a crane operator in accordance with the agreement of State Ministers of Labour, including the recognition of certificates issued by other States that conform to the same requirements. It is expected that States that conform to the same requirements. It is expected that these regulations will come into operation on lst December 1972. The requirements for riggers will be revised to comply with the agreement when regulations are made under the Industrial Safety, Health and Welfare Act shortly to be introduced into Parliament. Since 1st April 1968 the present regulations have authorised the issue of a certificate of competency to a rigger who has a similar certificate in another State, and this has been done. Western Australia A crane driver's certificate of competency is the only certificate for which legislation exists which will allow recognition of a corresponding certificate of equal grade issued in other States. The provision is contained in the Inspection nf Machinery Act 192M969 and came into effect on 3rd July 1922. There is no legislative requirement at the present time for lift mechanics, dogmen or crane chasers to hold a certificate of competency in this state. Tasmania There was no need for any legislation to become effective in Tasmania in order to give effect to the agreement by Ministers for Labour to recognise certificates of competency granted in other States to lift mechanics, crane drivers, riggers, dogmen, crane chasers, scaffolders and operators of explosive-powered tools. Certificates granted in other States to crane drivers, dogmen and scaffolders have been recognised for many years subject to evidence of physical fitness and the payment of prescribed fees. Scaffolders' licences issued in other States have in the Technical Note in the labour force survey been recognised since the commencement of the Scaffolding Act, 1560, on lst October 1961. Recognition of specific equivalent qualifications for crane drivers and dogmen were last prescribed by Statutory Rule in 1969. Lift mechanics, riggers, crane chasers and operators of explosives-powered tools have not been required to hold certificates of competency. If and when such requirements are introduced there will be recognition of equivalent qualifications obtained elsewhere than in Tasmania. Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory With regard to the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory the Minister for the Interior (the Hon, R. J. Hunt, M.P.) has advised me as follows: No action has been taken in the Australian Capital Territory to amend legislation that would States. The situation is under review and any uniform legislation agreed to by the States would be considered for adoption in the Australian Capital Territory. Under existing legislation in the Northern Territory scaffolders and riggers are granted licences if they obtain interstate certificates. Consideration is being given for the introduction of legislation that will recognise certificates granted in the States to the other classes of trade. Unemployment: Commonwealth Statistician's Information (Question No. 6392) Mr Whitlam asked fhe Treasurer, upon notice: What information did the Commonwealth Statistician obtain in the May quarter of 1972 on the number and percentage of unemployed among (a) males, (b) married women, (c) all females and (d) all persons who arrived in Australia in 1971 and 1972. istician has supplied the following information in reply to the honourable member's question: Estimates of the numbers of migrants who had arrived in Australia during the period January 1971 to May 1972 and who were unemployed were obtained from the May 1972 population survey. Separate estimates were obtained for (a) males, (b) married women, (c) all females and (d) all persons. Since the estimates were based on a sample, they are likely to differ from the figures that would have been obtained from a complete census, using the same questionnaire and procedures. The exact difference is unknown, but a measure of its likely magnitude is given by the standard error of the estimate. The standard error depends on the sample size and design and can be estimated from the data collected. However, standard errors are not estimated for all survey estimates separately. For most purposes it is sufficient to use the approximate relationship between size of estimate and standard error given bulletins. The smaller the estimate, the higher the relative standard error. Very small estimates are subject to such high standard errors (relative to the size of the estimate) as to detract seriously from their value for most reasonable uses. The estimates for May 1972 for married women and for all females were so small as to be of this kind. The survey estimate for number of unemployed males was 4,600 and for number of unemployed persons 7,700. The approximate standard errors of these estimates suggest that there are about 19 chances in 20 that the figures obtained from a complete enumeration would have been within the wide range of 3,000 to 6,200 for males and 3,700",239,Tasmania
407,Mr Snedden,"The Commonwealth Statto 9,700 for persons. The corresponding estimated percentages are 6.6 for males and 7.2 for persons. These percentages are subject to almost the same relative (sampling) variability as the corresponding estimates of numbers. Additional caution should be employed if these Insurance Bill has been introduced since . he figures are used to evaluate movements between placed the question on the notice paper. February and May 1972. Firstly, the May figures refer to a larger group of people, as they include those who arrived in Australia between the February and May surveys. Secondly, the average duration of residence in Austraha for these people is somewhat longer for the May survey than for the February survey. Finally, because a new sample is representing the Minister for Health, upon being introduced progressively during 1972, the standard errors of the changes from February notice: 1972 to May 1972 will be greater than usual. Motor Car Insurance Brokers (Question No. 6428) Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a recent kinds of liquor was to sustain revenue rates, while Press report stating that in New South Wales at the law and the medical training of the advisers least 20 motor insurance brokers have been concerned would have allowed and suggested dropped by, a large insurance company for keepmuch lower minimum concentrations. . ing premiums and leaving hundreds of car owners uninsured, that as much as $60,000 is involved in leagues these dubious transactions, that the insurance welfare and the rights of consumers placed before company involved had changed ownership and considerations of revenue raising, or docs this management and it had discovered these illegal herald consideration of further taxes on jnpreactions of tbe brokers when claims were received scribed drugs which will then have to be made from motorists who had no policy with the comstronger by manufacturers without regard to thc pany, and that the insurance company has advised physiological and pathological effects claimants to sue the brokers. (2) If so, will he take immediate steps to ascertain (a) the name of the insurance company involved, (b) the names of the brokers involved and (c) the Act under which the company and the brokers were registered. (3) Has his attention also been drawn to a recent Press statement attributed to the Hon. F. M. Hewitt, M.L.C, Minister for Labour and Industry in New South Wales, committing the State Government to legislative action (a) to force insurance companies to pay the full amount a car is insured for if the vehicle becomes a write-off and (b) to amend the Consumer's Protection Act, if the foreshadowed Commonwealth legislation fails to do so. (4) Will he give an unequivocal assurance that the foreshadowed Non-Life Insurance Bill will be introduced during the present Parliament. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The existing statutory provisions, so far as the Commonealth is concerned, in relation to non-life insurance are those contained in the Insurance Act 1932-1966. That Act does not make any provision for intervention in a dispute between a policy owner, an insurance company, and/or an insurance broker. It would not, therefore, be appropriate for the Commonwealth to take the action suggested by the honourable member. (3) Yes. (4) As thc honourable member is aware, the Alcohol Concentration Levels (Question No. 6471) Dr Everingham asked the Minister (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to letters from his colleagues, the New South Wales Minister for Health and the Minister for Customs and Excise, lo Canberra Consumers Incorporated referred to in a letter published in The Medical Journal of Australia of 19th August 1972. (2) If.so; do these letters' indicate that the sole concern of the Governments in establishing alcohol concentrations at minimum levels in various (3) Will the Minister consult . with the colreferred to with a view to having the public provided tlie following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Extracts from the letters referred to, as appearing in the letter by Canberra Consumers Incorporated published in the. Medical Journal of Australia of 19th August 1972, have been brought to my attention. (2) No. The alcohol limits in wines, spirits and liqueurs were recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council in the exercise of its function of making recommendations on matters of public health legislation. Council recommended model standards-which include minimum alcohol contents. It is envisaged that such standards will be incorporated into the food legislation of the various States Commonwealth excise legislation does not establish minimum levels of alcoholic content in respect of wines, spirits or liqueurs. Excise duty is payable on wine by liquid volume, whereas on potable spirits, duty is paid only on the volume of alcohol contained in the manufactured liquor. (3) No. 1 am satisfied that the Council, through its Expert Committees, has carefully considered the interests of the public in making the relevant recommendations. In examining the question of minimum alcohol levels, neither the Council nor my Department bas had revenue considerations in mind.",240,Tasmania

Commonwealth Savings Bank: Calculation of Interest (Question No. 6500) Dr Klugman asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Is Commonwealth Savings Bank interest calculated on the lowest amount in an account on a monthly basis. (2) Is the same method used by the other savings banks in Australia. <3) Can he say whether savings banks in the United States of America calculate interest on a daily basis. (4) If so, would there be any difficulty in changing to this method in view of the computers now in use by the banks. (5) Are there anyfiguresavailable, in respect of relieve the Commonwealth Savings Bank of the the Commonwealth Savings Bank or any of the other banks, of interest forgone by depositors because of the monthly method of calculation compared with the daily method. (6) Is interest on loans from savings banks calculated on a monthly or daily basis. ourable member's question is as follows: The Commonweallh Banking Corporation has provided the following information: (1) Interest on ordinary savings accounts in the Commonwealth Savings Bank is calculated on the minimum monthly balance. Mention is made of this fact in notes contained in each passbook. Deposits made on the first working day of any month or withdrawn on the last working day are eligible for interest for that month. i(2) The Corporation understands that other savis to keep the interest rate on its housing loans as ings banks in Australia adopt the same basic method of calculating interest (3) Within the United States of America a variinvestments, including housing loans. An increase ety of methods is adopted by savings banks in calculating interest. Such methods include botfa the use of the minimum monthly balance and the daily balance. (4) The Commonwealth Savings Bank does not intend at present to convert all its branches to a computer system and adoption of varying methods in calculation of interest as between groups of depositors in different areas is not considered appropriate. (5) There is a differential between the effective interest rate paid by the Commonwealth Savings Bank and the nominal rates quoted but this is the result of a variety of factors of which the difference between use of daily and monthly balances as the basis for calculation of interest is but one. There are no figures available to show the difference resulting solely from the present basis of interest calculation. (6) Interest on loans for housing provided by the Commonwealth Savings Bank is calculated on monthly rests. Interest on similar loans provided by State Government Savings Banks is calculated on either of monthly or quarterly rests, while certain of the private savings banks calculate interest on monthly rests and others base their calculations on daily balances. Commonwealth Savings Bank: Interest Rate (Question No. 6509) Mr Calwell asked the Treasurer, upon notice: Will he give urgent consideration to (a) an increase in the interest rate paid on Commonwealth Savings Bank deposits, (b) making the amount of interest added annually to Commonwealth Savings Bank deposits tax free and (c) amending the Commonwealth Bank Act to allow the whole of the net profits of the Commonwealth Savings Bank to be transferred to the Commonwealth Savings Bank reserves so as to obligation to pay one half of the net profit of the Bank to the Commonwealtb Government to be used for revenue purposes. ourable member's question is as follows: (a) Subject to the control over bank interest rates exercised by the Reserve Bank of Australia with the Treasurer's approval, the determination of the rates of interest payable by the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia is the statutory responsibility of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation Board. With respect to this part of the question the Commonwealth Banking Corporation has provided the following advice: ""The Commonwealth Savings Bank offers a range of deposit interest rates, which is kept under constant review. At the same time the Bank's policy low as possible. The ability of the Commonwealth Savings Bank to increase its deposit rates is directly related to the income it earns on its of, for example, 0.2S per cent p.a. in the interest rate paid on depositors' funds would add about $8m to deposit interest costs. This would almost certainly involve a significant increase in interest rates charged on housing loans, since a large part of the Bank's other investments are in long term securities bearing afixedrate of interest.'",241,Tasmania
